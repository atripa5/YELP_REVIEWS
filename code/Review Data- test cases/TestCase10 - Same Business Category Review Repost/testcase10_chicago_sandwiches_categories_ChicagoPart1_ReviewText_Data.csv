panes-bread-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/panes-bread-cafe-chicago,4,"I probably should have stuck with the original cuban sandwich; instead i went with a tomato, basil, and fresh mozzarella pressed sandwich.also a touch too much dark meat for me.50 (yep you read that right) to full bottles with lots of selection at different price points.we also had an awesome waitress..the baked wings are legit!! i took my girlfriends when they were in town and they crave them now.my friends and i sat at a small table and chatted for a good hour and a half or two hours and there was a constant bustle around the place.if you need 1 sandwich or 75 sandwiches make sure you stop at conte - you won&#39;t be disappointed!.they were delicious, fresh and exactly what we needed during a long day of moving.the wait was quite long for two sandwiches."
