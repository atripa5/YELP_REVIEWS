mac-kellys-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mac-kellys-chicago-5,4,"Overall great meal.They had a table where you can leave your bussines cards..The seating here is communal, so if you're not down for hearing little snippets from the table next to you, this place might be a no go.Additionally, they haven't any idea who ordered what.I could have done without the mint (not a huge fan), but otherwise, really tasty and a refreshing change from a side garden salad.Great spot for a local farm to table style lunch.It's cash only.Wait, what? it's in the loop? how is this possible?..."

zoup-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/zoup-chicago,4,"This is really the only place of its kind inside city limits (as far as i know).Everything seems fresh and i am always satisfied.I'm not sure if it was because they were slicing meats to-order for sandwiches in between our orders, but it might be nicer to have separate areas/ functions for to-go vs.The food is fantastic - the reuben is on point.The owner, george, is the friendliest guy, and he knows how to run an efficient business.I get the regular, cajun chicken sandwich with fries.Our reservations for the theatre were for 7:30 and it was at this at this point 6:05 or so and we didn't even tell them we had theatre tickets.I'm guessing that the food is much better when its made earlier in the day and not sitting around all day/ night.But grab a sandwich or a chi-style hot dog there.Also a good place to buy fresh mozzarella cheese, salami or other deli items.."
conte-di-savoia-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/conte-di-savoia-chicago,4,"The omelet wasn't anything special, but it came with potatoes and bread, so you definitely get a lot of quantity, if not quality.You can't just eat one.One thing that you must try is their homemade oatmeal! once you get a taste of this treat, your world will never be the same.On nice days the front opens out onto the sidewalk, but my favorite spot is at the full service bar, where the servers are as knowledgeable about the menu as the drinks.Friendly baristas who not only engage with customers well but also put out quality product every time..There is literally no pr food on the south side you have to go to the north side to get good pr food but this place is good the rice,jibarrito and the patato salad.99 a pound,  to our surprise we were charged $25.When you bite into these sandwiches, you hear a loud, satisfying crunch..."

d-amatos-bakery-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/d-amatos-bakery-chicago,4,"Will go again but will be wary of going there 30 minutes before closing time going forward.The pork jibarito i had was quite small in terms of portion, and probably the smallest of all the latin restaurants i have been to.They were cohesive on the plate but still tasted like themselves.Not sure what can be done about this, but that's been the case in both the to-go and in-store versions- some kind of visual receipt by default or way of showing the person what they paid for would be nice.The food was excellent, authentic..The bright colors of the walls and tables give it a warm and friendly vibe and the people watching both inside and out on 18th street is great for seeing chicagoans of all walks of life.But its a quick and cheap.Their vinny's special is great, all fresh and very tasty!.."

perkolator-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/perkolator-chicago,4,"However, the restaurant does offer drinks, as well as items that appeal to non-vegetarians, so i can't say it's a universally poor experience.There are no indoor tables but the outdoor seating makes for a nice place to eat with kids.Good food and reasonable prices- a great lunch spot in the neighborhood!.Based on my experiences, they both always have delivered.Excellent customer service and well worth dropping in for a coffee and sandwich..99this place has everything you can want for your salad if you know what you like down to the science (which i do).I think next time we will get two sandwiches instead.Very good food.Quick service and very friendly staff.."

windys-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/windys-chicago,4,"The low key tone and the view out on the heart of the 18th street corridor, watching the neighborhood wake up, made for comfortable caffeination and reading time..Been a bari regular for 10+ years..We went with a thin crust sausage pizza, which was absolutely legitimate.The fresh and made-in-house bread is probably the best part! cute little patio is a nice touch during warm weather..Tried ipsento omg i'm in love with it.It's a small place with a few tables and they have somewhat of a small menu of mostly sandwiches and sides.."
