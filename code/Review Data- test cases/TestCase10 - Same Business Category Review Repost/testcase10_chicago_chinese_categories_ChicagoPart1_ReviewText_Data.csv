mos-asian-bistro-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mos-asian-bistro-chicago,4,"Hands down the best! the non spicy dishes are pretty good too.Love their sui loong bows.Your paying to eat fried grease.I guess my biggest qualm was that things were not sweet enough, and if they were, then they weren't sour enough.The ambiance is comfortable, yet swanky for a chicago hotpot place--it's dimly lit with several secluded booths.The portion size was enough for the two of us to split a light dinner, which was a great value.I'm about to give the food 2 stars until the fat rice comes out which was pretty amazing.Overall i don't think the people here are very friendly..Pineapple cake - 4/5 would get again! basically a pineapple upside down cake, but with a delicious caramel sauce, ice cream, and nuts.."
wow-bao-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wow-bao-chicago-5,4,"You don't ask for a tip you earn it!...I may give them a bit of the benefit of the doubt because our visit was on the day of the chinese new year parade but the restaurant should have been better prepared for the rush..The bubble tea smoothies are the best!  real fruit and fresh ingredients..Would have recommended as a place to eat in chicago a few years ago, but now it is average at best...."
youngs-chinese-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/youngs-chinese-restaurant-chicago,4,The food is also better than an average chinese restaurant....Good price3.This place has free wifi.The wait staff essentially ignored us for for the better part of 30 minutes while i tried to catch their eye to order some food.Delicious dim sum!! nice selection and my food was brought out quickly and hot.It is one of my favorites.Obviously i wouldn't be trying it out at this place..
dim-sum-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-house-chicago,4,"Service is also very attentive, and you actually do get everything you order promptly, which is very very rare at ayce places.One of my favorite dishes is the potato noodle spicy soup, i am not a fan of spicy dishes but the soup is a blend of heat and vinegar which makes it very enjoyable.Incredible handmade fish balls in noodles.We arrived for my friends birthday.I have liked everything i ate here.My prix fixe: crab wonton soup, green apple and flank steak salad, duck dumpling, frenched pork loin, and chocolate truffle.The crab rangoon is what has me coming back :).Great, friendly service.Other food might be good, but don't get their wings.So slow.."
mak-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mak-restaurant-chicago,4,This is their specialty -  no in-dining here.Friends had chicken dishes.Everything was delicious and not greasy..Dim sum is standard.The fish was fried up and glazed in the same sweet and sour sauce.I have yet to try the crab rangoon but it  seems like it's very popular.Came in at 930 drove far to eat there and was told they were closing and turned us away.The potstickers were delicious & an egg roll order comes w.See my pictures to find the must orders..
hong-huah-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hong-huah-chicago,4,"Loved it! the food was fantastic, quick carry out and reasonably priced.Highly recommended.The skin was too thick and they dried out too fast.Of the dim sum we ordered (shrimp and chive dumpling, salted chicken congee, beef tripe, egg custard buns, bbq pork baked buns, coconut and red bean jello, chicken feet, bbq pork steamed noodles/crepe, and shrimp steamed noodles/crepe), i particularly liked the beef tripe because they were good sized whole pieces, not like little flakes at other restaurants..Food was excellent the spicy broth is really spicy so beware..This place is definitely a journey away from where i live but it's worth the drive.I had to try them, seeing as they're the top-rated item.I am not even hungry any more.."
new-china-tea-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/new-china-tea-chicago,4,"Good sized cheap portions.0 i th.A special mention that the crab rangoon is one of the best i have ever had.Thank you for a great dinner last night via delivery!  everything was fresh and right on that we ordered.The worst bao i ever tried! i heard they do wholesale too, but are they licensed to do wholesale? and the picture they're posting i recognised is from somewhere else, lol.Some dishes you should try: (i will spell the chinese word out so you can tell the waiter i think they will know what you are talking about)-(xiang la dou si香辣豆丝) spicy shredded tofu, it's a cold appetizer, but very good-(di xan xian第三鲜) this dish that has eggplant, potato and green pepper, just ask for that they will know what you are talking about-(song shu yu松鼠鱼) deep fried whole fishget some dumplings too while at it.The real treat was the salt miner's eggplant: crispy, flavorful, satisfying.That sure helps a whole lot!i'll be back to try more!.The decor is nice and place is family friendly.They are the same chewy gross chicken bites with different veggies mixed in, yet doesn't taste like either style.."
fat-rice-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fat-rice-chicago,4,"Inside is a bit of crowded, it is more of a family style but with good food.I went for a birthday dinner and got the 4 course pre fixe menu for $35.I clearly could hear she talked to another guy in another phone in chinese said you could charge her one or two dollar for her rice.Even my wife feels it is authentic like from hk or guangzhou..I can't even recall the name or type but it doesn't even matter because no person would actually get these if pork buns were an option!overall the food was okay.You simply can not go wrong.We were informed that they were only in a soft opening but we had a great experience.."
vora-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vora-chicago,4,"We are frequent visitors at golden bull.Kimchi fries quality seriously dropping.The food is good: creative and yummy.It's an easy to miss place just a few storefronts south of 26th street.Also i don't wanna talk about price there.Fat rice:pros: bomb rice, bomb flavors, nice variety, feeds two people, moist chickencons: overpriced, clams are alrightegg tartspros:buttery flaky goodness, would def come back for thiscons:...Great option for fast chinese take out!.My family had a really tiring day and we decided to stop by here to get some authentic chinese food.."
de-rice-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/de-rice-chicago,5,"But most important of all - the food has been consistently delicious.This will be my new place to order from! food was great, portions are considerably large, and the food arrived quickly and hot!.Red hot mandarin! enough said!.It was like any other hot pot place i've been but they do not sell alcohol (byob which is a good thing too if i known in advance) nor do they have a sauce counter, u have to ask them to bring out the various condiments and i couldn't really understand her reason but apparently the food is so good there is no need for sauce so they don't have a sauce counter, sounds like a load of bsoverall it was nice, decent typical hot pot experience.Don't miss this spot during the week for wonderful dim sum.The food is good but not great for upscale chinese food.It's in pilsen while i live in the north side!!! so if they could open up a store on the north side, i would greatly appreciate it.Both times i've gone, someone has come over to ask about my drink and see if i had any feedback.Salt and pepper japanese tofu was really yummy.I've never had a bad dish here.."
friendship-chinese-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/friendship-chinese-restaurant-chicago,4,"Sweet spicy little lolipop wings!?a bucket to go with a pack of beer = treadmill for 4 hours.Very yummy northern chinese food and best in the area.Big bowl of noodle soup for $7 or less - with beef or lamb or fish balls - and you can select from 5 types of noodles.50) and microwaved 4 (covered with a little water) for 5 minutes and they came out very nice.When being seated, you are given a dim sum menu, entree menu and libations menu.The soft shell crab was a highlight.The food was good, i just wish they would improve on the customer service.I come to this place often with my husband, it's very good, the service is great..Their milktea is always spot on.."
min-min-asian-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/min-min-asian-cafe-chicago,4,"Otherwise a very good experience and i'm looking forward to trying the rest of the menu..The pork is cooked to perfection and is fatty and tender.Terrible! poor service and attitude!!! we wanna some hot water, they told us:' no hot water/cold water to offer!'what? r u kidding me??! first time, a restaurant doesn't offer hot /cold water to guests!will not eat here anymore!.I have a scallops whenever possible vow which trumped the meat quest.Starting  off with the water taxi,  we boarded at michigan avenue...Still, i'd go again in a minute!.Joy yee has many different kinds of asian foods.."
guey-lon-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/guey-lon-chicago,4,"Consistent quality every time keeps us coming back.Only came in for a little snack, but would like to come back sometime to try out all their other dumpling offerings.Great place for outdoor dining on a summer evening if you're willing to pay for top dollar for fancy chinese food.Not only is the food and drinks cheap, but it's tasty and the portions are huge! my order was enough for 2 meals, and my drink was enough to be a meal in itself because of how massive it was! we ordered the hainanese chicken with rice, beef cube tomato rice, mango tapioca freeze, and taro tapioca freeze.Ok yummy yummy isn't the best but it's a good deal..My new favorite chinese takeout.We walk in and the waitress is prepping raw chicken skewers at the table next to us, i should have known better and left then.I don't think tier service is so bad that they deserve a 1 star.They are fast for the most part once you order but they can drag hardcore to tend to you initially and when you ask for your check.."
bbq-king-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bbq-king-chicago,4,"I came here with a group and we had 10 entrees floating around the table, so i'll just review what i ordered and a couple other standouts.It was rich and creamy due to the fact that i think cornstarch was added as a thickener.The paintings on the wall in the back room were really cool.Wing yip egg foo young, egg rolls is amazing good here.We ordered a bottle of wine, terrible!.It was better than any oriental food we have eaten.The soup here is the best of both worlds, with a spicy herbal broth and original herbal broth (make sure you get the mix 'yin-yang' pot).Both of our visits were on saturday nights when reservations are a must.I will never ever come back here.After reading yelp reviews i decided to try the food from here.."
dragon-gate-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dragon-gate-chicago,4,"Very juicy/soupy inside.Awesome food and the portions are huge! 15 bucks will buy you and a friend a lunch you won't be able to finish.We decided to order from the lunch dim sum menu which made it feel better since that menu was more affordable for what we got.The chicken was hard and tasted like cardboard.My go-to meal is:wonton soup - simple, clean, comforting, and delicious.We ordered beef w chinese broccoli and shanghai noodles..There were only two other tables dining in an otherwise silent restaurant.Very authentic family-cooked cantonese food.It sounded like it had hurt written all over it.."
ma-gong-la-po-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ma-gong-la-po-chicago,4,"Don't expect american style chinese food here (i don't know why would someone come to chinatown for that.It's just another trendy place with sub  par food.We received a free crab rangoon,very nice a little on the sweet side for those who like that.Pick a filter already!oh, and the noodles? they're handmade too and just as delicious! i finally got to try them during my most recent visit.The ambiance, food and service are exceptional.Found out the owner was a well known chef in cheng du.So happy they reopened!! love the spicy egg roll, kung pao chicken, chicken wings, everything!! the customer service is way better they are so much nicer!! they give you so much in the lunch specials!!!! fast delivery!! keep up the great work!!.I also really liked their tai chi fried rice which was half chicken and tomato and the other half peas and shrimp fried rice.I love seafood and i esp love cantonese style seafood and grand palace is a good place to enjoy thatus being first timers, we solicited recommendations from the chef what we should order and we ended up with clams with lobster sauce (the clam was gigantic!!), steamed razor clams, deep fried pork intestines and greenseverything was fresh and tasty and the staff can't be friendlier (it helps since i speak cantonese i suppose) :)can't wait to try other dishes!!.Most places in chinatown are the same cantonese style hong kong restaurants, where they serve mostly the same stirfried stuff.."
my-place-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/my-place-chicago-3,3,"We also tried the mushroom and leek potstickers which were just as great.Potsticker house is one of the better restaurants i've been to - love the soup dumplings (although i'd say they're on par with lao sze chuan) and the scallion pancakes were delicious.I just had some of mak's food catered to my workplace.I enjoyed the meal at this location..Great food, reasonable prices, and a clean, nice atmosphere.I also enjoy having some date nights here as well.The crab legs were a bit small and because of how it's cooked, the meat kind of disappears on you.Would order again.They also serve beer, wine and a few cocktails.."
joy-yees-noodle-shop-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joy-yees-noodle-shop-chicago-2,4,"They certainly sound appetizing, but i'll be sure to eat before i arrive.Most importantly, it doesnt have that msg/freezer burnt flavor!!! 6 stars..The staff is closer to elderly than middle age, one waitress-owner-manager-cashier, one busser, two cooks, it's not a speedy combination but service was adequate, friendly, and they knew just enough english to get me what i wanted.They are really easy to eat, so yay for that.My boyfriend and i intend to spend all our anniversaries from now on here.Server was routinely checking up on us, but not in an overbearing, creepy way like some servers in chinatown.I like the dim sum house, because if you want dim sum catered at you party they get it done for you, at a reasonable price.Terrible! poor service and attitude!!! we wanna some hot water, they told us:' no hot water/cold water to offer!'what? r u kidding me??! first time, a restaurant doesn't offer hot /cold water to guests!will not eat here anymore!.."
king-wok-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/king-wok-chicago-3,4,"The ingredients are fresh and consistent in flavor.Dishes never arrived.The place was is a great example.For asian food in midwest this is interesting twist.This restaurant was built on their famous chicken wings and they never disappoint! my go-to when i can't think of what to eat for dinner, or when i watch a movie, or after i work out, or while i am studying, or when friends come over, or etc etc.Everything was delicious as usual.I might go back for their cold noodle and skewer.At the price point, i expected a little more from hans 202 (better prepared food, bigger rice portions?)..The dry chili chicken is mind blowing, the wonton and dumpling appetizers are great.."
1st-chop-suey-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/1st-chop-suey-chicago,4,"Went w/friend & had no problem walking in to get a table on a sunny sunday where there were lines out the door at other logan brunch spots...I have seen steamed egg yolk buns a lot in dim sum restaurants, but this is the only place serves baked ones.The bar though - i would return just to order drinks at that emerald green bar!..Everything was good, but few were exceptional and i would probably ordered it again.I asked one more time nicely and said, 'if you are the manager, you must have discretion over this.You can get really good food for a very good price.We tried the salty egg yolk shrimp, dungeness crab curry, and the french beef.."
chiu-quon-bakery-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chiu-quon-bakery-chicago-4,4,"The word got out that hand pulled noodles and soup dumplings after a blackhawk game the best decision you will ever make.Hottiessssss.To put the cherry on top of the disastrous food, two of the employees were playing on their phones while working.20 clams.Walked in for lunch 25 minutes after they opened.Otherwise, fantastic.Ordered online this weekend.Heard this place is good, can't wait to try!.The curry chicken was not breaded meat but tender the sauce was a perfect thickness and a medium spice.The waiter did great job in recommending food and service.."
hong-kong-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hong-kong-house-chicago,4,"This seems to be a real renovation:  owner showed us an image of the new design.Awesome smoothies!! they add a good amount of fruit and they taste really good! so many flavors to choose from too! great service! : ).This place is awesome!!!! love love love shanghai terrace and peninsula!.Not only was this the best customer service we've ever received in chinatown, but the food was fresh, delicious, and suuuuuuuper affordable.We order from here almost once a week, so we must like it! the chicken wangs are insane and we generally order the chicken bowl w/blistered green beans.They delivered to my hotel and it was very convenient ordering off the menu they have on yelp.The prices are also quite cheap!.Their noodles is not that impressive..Be prepared for some spice, but also lots of deliciousness!.."
han-202-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/han-202-chicago,4,"Very good food a lots of choices and very quality free parking in china town and very accommodating people they cater dim sum for me even its only up to 4pm i'm so impressed.You simply can not go wrong.I came here with my fiancée after a large dumpling meal and we waited outside for 25 minutes (10 minutes in line and 15 minutes for the 20 orders of smoothie orders ahead of us.Three years later and still my favorite restaurant ever.The door person helped us to turn the already rotating door, which was something i've never seen before.We won't be ordering from emperor's choice again.For chinese carry out this place is great!excellent chinese food!  it's worth the drive out..After having a bad experience the owner milo  contacted me to apologize and offered to make it up to us.My boyfriend and i sat down to eat, and as we were enjoying our sushi we noticed a dead fly in the soy sauce bottle plastered to the inside of the bottle.."
lao-beijing-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lao-beijing-chicago,4,"Make sure to get it spicy to complete the power play.We really enjoyed the soup dumplings and hand pulled noodles...Cumin flavor lamb with bone was fork tender and immensely flavorful on our first visit but we overheard complaints about chewiness on our second visit.Ordered with a co worker i got the kung pow beef, she got the beef and pepper..I have tried several other dishes and they were all very fresh and tasty except for the the seafood hot pot, which the shrimp and squid were a bit overcooked.Just not as good as others in the area.We also ordered fried rice and found it quite flavorless.."
tangs-garden-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tangs-garden-restaurant-chicago,4,"Jiazo - a standout - could really taste bone marrowoctopus, cucumber, and peanut saladcheong chow fun: these two were ok but too similar in appearance and flavorpeking duck: presented with the head for shock value, good but skin should have been crispier and would have been nice to have the traditional scallions as well as the more unique accompaniments..Ordered food at midnight from here while i was in chicago for the weekend.Homemade mak sauce was also a highlight..Yummy yummy noodles is quick and cheap -- but doesn't have any special or distinct dishes that would make me come back versus going to a slightly pricier restaurant nearby like chi cafe, sweet station, or ken kee..I'd definitely go back.Bad bad bad.Right on time, hot, deliver man nice/friendly, condiments and sauces plenty.."
golden-bull-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-bull-restaurant-chicago,4,"Nice place for a dimsum lunch or dinner in the area.Timings are great for students.We will be back.Definitely a place we will return.Classy.A lot of great food for not a lot of cost.I got the chicken kimchi fried rice because i keep hearing about kimchi and wanted to try and it was a perfect first experience (this is sounding creepily vaguely sexual but maybe it was who can say) my boyfriend got umm something with udon noodles, i was a lil busy with my rice to notice or remember the name but he liked it..Just okay..."
china-snack-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/china-snack-chicago,4,"Yum, yum! mighty tasty dim sum! i love this place, great selection, nice price and super tasty! try all the unique things! you might like it!.Can we say horrible together?  weird location, run down strip mall.Japanese egg white tofu fried till it's golden yellow with just the right amount of salt and pepper and jalapenos.The waitstaff is slow and completely avoided tables, on a slow night it took awhile for someone to ask us if we were ready to order..Not minghin.The walls are lined with paper bags and there are ducks hanging by the chef counter.The past time i ordered online, it said it'd be one hour before it was delivered - which i was totally bummed about - but when i got the call 15 minutes later that they were here, i was ecstatic!  it was very hot and fresh!..Man they made the chicken juicy as hell and mouth full of flavor.."
qing-xiang-yuan-dumpling-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/qing-xiang-yuan-dumpling-chicago,4,"It totally worked.Good service- food piping hot on delivery..I highly recommend the potstickers, tchai-de-bonzo, and of course the infamous arroz gordo.Although the service was very nice the food was mediocre and the views were not even worth mentioning.A bit confused where the one hundred spices ran off to.Love the environment! i ordered the deluxe combination in the lunch special menu.The chicken was too spicy and the sauce tasted weird.The food has always been hot and fast.The fat pork potstickers are what i dream of when i'm missing nyc chinese food.."
potsticker-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/potsticker-house-chicago,4,"Taiwanese braised pork and fish filet with cream of corn.I added their full bodied french press coffee and walked out of there satiated in a most content way!thank you so much yvonne b and m who introduced us to the divine eatery.Come at 2pm for a discount! but makes sure the order goes in after 2pm or else the discount doesn't apply.We got the goa boa as an app (the spinach buns are to die for) and the beef and noodle bowls as main dishes.The food is good, but the plates are so small.Will definitely be back for the falafel!.Great option for fast chinese take out!.Surprisingly my least fav is the mapo tofu..They were happy to wrap things up for us and quick to bring things out to us.."
bamboo-garden-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bamboo-garden-chicago,4,"So bad, avoid it at all cost!.Noodles are cooked to my liking.The waitresses were very friendly and helpful in guiding our selection of the different dishes.Too good.Triple crown offers a great variety of traditional dim sum with a blend of modern hong kong eats.They always checked up on us and made sure everything was to our liking! everything was fresh and came out quickly.You can't bast the quality or the price for sum sum here.You can also ask them to give to chili oil on the side.But once the food hits your tongue, you'll be glad you went in.Shanghai soup dumpling.."
gen-hoe-ii-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/gen-hoe-ii-chicago,4,Their portions are huge! try the spicy red chilli sauce with the dumplings to make it more flavourful.Love love love it!..(and only a 20 minute wait)...So no comment on this for now.Probably won't be back.Ask for the handmade ones because they are better.Authentic cantonese place in an excellent location..
jess-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jess-cafe-chicago,4,"Highly recommend!.Perfect balance of sweet and the pork is fried to perfection.You grab a pencil, mark how many you want, and just patiently wait for it to be brought to you.I'm from hong kong and i know my dim sum very well.We went here during lunch and it was kind of pricey but i think it's worth the money! even the chili oil was good!!! most dim sum places have chili oil that has way too much oil and isn't even spicy but it was perfect here.I honestly don't think i would ever come here again because the food wasn't spicy at all, it was overpriced, and way too salty.There were lots of children, extended families, a nice but not quiet atmosphere.We ordered a chicken and rice clay pot (30 minutes needed) and it was delicious, fragrant, and phenomenal..I like the dim sum house, because if you want dim sum catered at you party they get it done for you, at a reasonable price.."
takie-outit-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/takie-outit-chicago-2,4,"Great food, great drinks, cheap, cool tables, and always nice times.Favorite place to go in china town and i think they stay open until 1 am on weekends, so i love coming here after a night of drinking.It was good flavor but super mushy and way too much onion.Would have recommended as a place to eat in chicago a few years ago, but now it is average at best.Everything tastes like vineager and was not the best tastes for sesame chicken and the dumplings had a wine tasting sauce and hard dough not good...We had white fish, crab, shrimp, mussels, lamb, beef, greens, shitake mushrooms and more! it was heaven for a foodie! the décor was really unexpected..I wouldn't be back -- not for this place at least!.."
hana-sushi-chinese-and-thai-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hana-sushi-chinese-and-thai-chicago,5,"There was a bunch of items on the menu that i've never seen on a before.I love that they offer some flavor combinations you won't find elsewhere.This was just an egg converted pancake.This place is byob.The cocktail list is great as well- i loved the lost in translation.She always has a smile on her face and greets you immediately.First off, i love that they cut it up into a lollipop style, so much easier to eat! the sauce for those little hotties was so amazing, and everything on the menu is so affordable.These are a selection of entrees w rice for only $5...."
thee-asian-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thee-asian-restaurant-chicago,4,"The portions are so big! they are very generous with meat, fish balls, veggies and tofu.Divirery puhweese.I have tried several other dishes and they were all very fresh and tasty except for the the seafood hot pot, which the shrimp and squid were a bit overcooked.Everything ordered was on point.It was okay.Everything was delicious and not greasy.If this was somehow out of the ordinary, then i would recommend the french beef tips, just like everyone else...My favorite chinese restaurant for traditional cantonese home cooking.."
chi-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chi-cafe-chicago,4,"The fat rice is amazing.Kimchi fries are amazing, the way the fries, sauce, and kimchi comes together is to die for...Food was great.For instance, the dong po pork belly dish didn't contain the melt-in-your-mouth chunks of meat i had expected, but rather thin strips of chinese 'bacon' with preserved vegetables (梅菜扣肉)..Ordered the steak bowl with broccoli and steak was cooked medium and was decent quality.Very rude staff and not accommodating..."
p-f-changs-chicago-8,https://www.yelp.com/biz/p-f-changs-chicago-8,4,"Don't let that visual fool you, there's a ton of meaty goodness to go around! i believe you get about 8-10 hotties with a generous portion of rice..The food is good, but the plates are so small.Service was decent, and most waiters had better english than i am accustomed to as well.Everything was great, except the egg rolls.I had heard a lot about this chinese chain (chain, as in this restaurant actually started in china) and have been wanting to try it.It was excellent!! only thing we did not think was excellent was the egg drop soup.Every time i asked where  my order was, '5 more minutes.Overall we were pleasantly surprised as we had not heard of this place.Tea is not complimentary, which is a bit sneaky on their part by saying 'water or tea?'.."
home-style-taste-chinese-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/home-style-taste-chinese-chicago,4,"We usually order the salt and pepper squid and smelt, walnut shrimp, sesame chicken, and diced chicken with salty fish fried rice!.The taco bao were made of korean style beef with minced veggies, again very flavorful meat...Most of the chairs (common area) are uncomfortable or broken.Had the service rivaled the food, i would have given lsc a 5 star review.50) and microwaved 4 (covered with a little water) for 5 minutes and they came out very nice.The portion was kind of lacking.I really liked the green apple salad but didn't really like the beet salad, which isn't surprising because i don't like beets.."
wing-yip-chop-suey-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wing-yip-chop-suey-restaurant-chicago,4,"But addictive.While they do have a recycling bin, my conscience can't let me produce that much waste in one meal if i am eating in.Must tries include the xiao long bao (especially the truffle and spicy szechuan), the pork belly la mian and the yang chaofan.Everything is authentic.The wing sauce was excellent...Hl wanted dim sum for father's day so we came here with the recommendation of our hotel's concierge.5 nicely renovated, opens late, delivers late, inexpensive, and decent food.And more so than what you're used to at a chinese restaurant.."
sze-chuan-cuisine-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sze-chuan-cuisine-chicago,4,"I will never ever come back here.The reason i would want to come here over another asian restaurant is because it's a 'quick' concept.At best, this place is maybe 'gourmet food with a few asian flavors'.I order the chicken wings with brown rice and it was really good.Today i ordered egg foo young(highly recommended); shrimp with lobster sauce, szechuan broccoli, orange chicken(free by check-in on yelp).Vegetables in vegetable kow dish were way overcooked...Very tasty..."

joy-yee-noodle-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joy-yee-noodle-chicago-2,3,"My friend also insisted on ordering beef intestines.The combination of restful setting, superb food and faultless service make this chicago's best chinese restaurant, and one of its top restaurants overall.Not so wow.We got forced out of our seats by a guy who just waved us to another table, our appetizer came out after our main dish, we had to ask 3 different people for our white rice which came out towards the end of our meal, and we never got more than our first serving of water.I like these better)- spicy fried rice- mak abcwe got carryout and got to use the free fried rice offer when you check-in..Better taste, better all you can eat, much better price than those in cali..They were a little weak, and really just tasted like juice.We've tried soft shell crabs, shrimp, steamed oysters, steamed fish, lobster, razor clams, french beef, peapod sprouts, and some grapefruit dessert pudding.."
great-wall-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/great-wall-chicago,3,"Just plain yum!!.The best crab rangoon !! i never was a fan but when i tasted theirs it is simply delish! the combo rice is very good and don't past up on the orange chicken ! i highly recommend.Best dimsum in chicago.If i ask for the heat, bring it! maybe it's me, but i wish they offered some sort of dessert.The zucchini was not cooked properly and still raw.The last and main dish i was looking forward to was the best.2-5 happy hour discount but i would totally pay the full price, not expensive at all.The fat pork potstickers are what i dream of when i'm missing nyc chinese food.I wouldn't say it's 'authentic' but that doesn't mean that it's not good.When we show up hostess says they take names for the bar as it is not first come as all other bars in chicago.."
lao-sze-chuan-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lao-sze-chuan-chicago-2,3,"Oh joy yee's, i love you.I liked the beef / onion one the best because it seemed to be the most 'juicy'.Healthy asian-fusion food! tasty, not greasy.The default offering is the 4 course menu for $35, which is an amazing price - the portions are not huge, but unless you have a huge appetite (or are a glutton), by the time you have finished the main course, you will have just enough room for dessert, and you will not leave hungry.Everything was hot, fresh, and tasty.Amazing mandarin food.So dining suggestions would be: do make reservations or call before you arrive to see how long you would wait.Love it! first time to chinatown and they have authentic and delicious flavor of scechuan food.Must go!.We didn't even finish it.."
duck-duck-goat-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/duck-duck-goat-chicago,4,"Sometimes the quality is inconsistent but even when i would say the quality is not the best, it's still pretty darn good.* shumai.I want to give no stars..Well, better late than never, i guess.There are a few smaller tables that are in front of the kitchen (that is nice and open to the dining room)..Had the string beans, twice cooked pork, and spicy tofu; all three were among the best i've had anywhere.But i do at least try my friend's drinks, and they are all equally delicious.."
no-1-china-express-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/no-1-china-express-chicago,4,"She had the stir fry beef and that was pretty good though very salty.Kitchen and bathroom are extremely dirty.- lobster cooked with green onions and ginger.Honestly, every dish i've eaten here i have enjoyed and that keeps me coming back for more.Thanks guys!.Decent food, okay service.Best egg roll i have had in a long time.For a party of two, your bill will easily hit the $50-60 range.The beef crepe  intrigued us because the filling did not taste like beef.What happened? i don't know if times are tough for the take me out crew, but the chicken portions have been severely downsized.."
18th-street-asian-bistro-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/18th-street-asian-bistro-chicago,4,"I personally think the food has high quality.Beyond that, the food is average at best, so just go find a better meal elsewhere.Come check it out.Just be prepared to burp up hot pot for a few hours.But, because there aren't many people at dinner at 5 pm the servers just stand and stare at you.No joke bruh, ain't no way we could finish anything.This place is awesome, indeed a modern asian kitchen.A seafood dinner for a party of 4 for only 85 bucks.We were visiting chicago and came here on a recommendation.So if you're staying at swissotel, radisson or the hyatt and are tired of the hotel restaurants, like we were, head to the village market.."
king-garden-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/king-garden-chicago,4,"Me and my friends go there all the time.I got a recommendation through word of  mouth for their soft shelled crab..Amazing chinese food, really! i visiting there on a weekday as i was craving for some good asian food on my way back from work...This little restaurant is located inside the chinatown food court along with other small shops and restaurants.The scuff marks on the bowl said it all.My mother orders from them all the time for our birthday parties or house-warming parties the potstickers are a hit!i also recommend their almond jello, and shrimp dumplings ( ha- gow).."
wow-bao-chicago-8,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wow-bao-chicago-8,4,"We both preferred the steak bowl...Amazing value, french tenderloin is unreal and the service was quite good.The pot stickers were delicious! i asked for a side of sweet and sour sauce (omg probably the best s&s sauce i've ever had.But, chinese food is far more diverse than what you find in just chinatown.Both drinks were amazing for the hot weather and i loved that they used fresh fruits! you can see them chopping up the fruits!the lines are long but it's worth the wait.5 nicely renovated, opens late, delivers late, inexpensive, and decent food.It would be hard to pay this place a third visit.."
minghin-cuisine-chicago-7,https://www.yelp.com/biz/minghin-cuisine-chicago-7,4,"It was really good..Incredible food.My old favorite was shui wah before it closed.They also had a slight taste of sesame oil i didn't care for.You have to dress nicely to come here (business casual is fine), do not come in with t-shirt/shorts or street clothes.Super fun with a group because you can try a lot, but also great for a date night!.I have to change my review in view of a second visit to the place, the chef that i was raving about has left, and it's a different guy cooking.My first time here and i had the combo a.Been going here for years.."
hot-woks-cool-sushi-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hot-woks-cool-sushi-chicago-2,4,"5 stars - my waiter was very awkward and did not know how to upsell the menu (or sell the menu at all for that matter).I got boneless wings instead (gross.Was the pork belly, melted in your mouth.:)  i sat by the window up front with a friend as your table was wrapping up.The chicken satay is a hidden treasure, and the traditional stone bowl rice is always a hit.I think i could have done without the sweet and sour pork, but i really enjoyed the salt and pepper shrimp.Pork belly with preserved  veggies on buns is amazing!  i do miss the old guy who hand made the noodles on the window...And don't be afraid to try something new!.."
little-wok-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-wok-chicago-2,4,"What i absolutely adore about these were the intersection between east meets west: the majority of the dumplings stayed authentically true to its asian roots, but the gruyere and truffle were such a delightful surprise with a modern european twist on an asian staple.First off, i know this is a chain.Cumin flavor lamb with bone was fork tender and immensely flavorful on our first visit but we overheard complaints about chewiness on our second visit.It was fried perfectly.Also had some sesame chicken which was equally good!overall, i would recommend this place to anyone.Good job mak guys!.All in all, i would definitely come back when in the area again!.I had the biggest hopes for this dish too, since it's rather popular in taiwan.Everything here is fantastic! if you have a gluten allergy, just ask and they will be happy to make it gluten free!.."
tasty-china-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-china-chicago,4,Hongshao rou - this is really just pork belly and the classic version i'm used to has a different flavor profile.But at least the eggplant is good?.We had a 10 minute wait before getting seated in a comfy booth by the window.Just don't.Would definitely go back.This is more like 4.Thanks to arielle the always smiling server who recommended the place!..My waiter spoke no english and upon several hand signs i was able to give my order..
northern-city-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/northern-city-chicago,4,"I look forward to trying their other soups!.However, both my brother and i agreed that the wontons had an unusual flavor.If someone still want more than that, go out and turn left to lao series restaurants..Reasonable prices..Loved the service.We also used arestaurant.The large options seemed pricey but it lasted us (2 people) for 2 dinners! def recommend this place!.Back for more :-).."
leungs-chop-suey-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/leungs-chop-suey-chicago-2,4,Can't explain it.Great spot we stumbled upon via the great yelp reviews and photos! they offer parking which is awesome to start! and then the wait staff is so friendly! they made great recommendations and were so inviting.Very disappointed.Clean and tastefully decorated.They get packed real fast..Once shown to our table we ordered six plates between the four of us.If you are from the east coast and can't find any good chinese food in the city of chicago - go to golden bull!  it's worth the trek.Tried order the general tsao's chicken from here and it was basically tossable..
