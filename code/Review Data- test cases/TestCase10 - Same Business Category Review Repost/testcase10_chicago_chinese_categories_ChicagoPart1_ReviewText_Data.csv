potsticker-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/potsticker-house-chicago,4,"I went here for dinner during chef&#39;s week.the dumplings were delicious: piping hot, bursting with flavor, and oozing with soup..china is historically known for 4 distinct styles of cuisine: yue cai, lu cai, chuan cai, and su cai.5 food was ok and service was good, but didn&#39;t live up to the hype.other than that, we&#39;re fans..came in at 930 drove far to eat there and was told they were closing and turned us away.the excitement soon faded.i&#39;m looking forward to bringing a big group downstairs and getting everything custom made."
yan-bang-cai-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yan-bang-cai-chicago,3,"And these are pretty great!my overall impression is that some dumpling phd is in the kitchen making these little masterpieces..bbq pork buns, bbq ribs, and fav deep fried pork dumplings...only downside is a credit card minimum of $10, but get some friend or get bubble tea for a friend as well.my boyfriend and i tried this place for the first time today and the experience wasn&#39;t great.its really difficult to communicate with them.this place was really good, especially for the price! their chicken was soo tender.restaurant appeared clean and wait staff and service was fast and attentive."

wok-cuisine-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wok-cuisine-chicago,4,"As mentioned, service was slow, considering there was not many people there, and i&#39;ve had speedier dimsum service, not in other places, but here too.95 for a bowl of beef noodle soup is a steal..本人山东长大，在东北生活过3年，地地道道的北方人。。。。但是，还是说一句，这菜实在是太咸了，北方菜可没这么咸啊。。。这完完全全就是堆味精堆出来的。。。就这样生意还很红火。。也就是在芝加哥。。。放在纽约加州估计早就被挤下去了。。。。你要是重口你来吃。。。我今后是不来了。。。。.like others have said, the dry chili chicken is great and very similar to lao sze chaun.people waited on us constantly.will be back again soon.spicy chinese food in the city!rolled in here on a cold rainy day to warm up.i think the most special aspect of the place is the seafood.every time i asked where  my order was, &#34;5 more minutes."
bbq-king-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bbq-king-chicago,3,"The way it should be.so warning: don&#39;t get the pineapple fried rice only because you want to eat out of a pineapple! besides that disappointment, i thought the food was mediocre.what changes the game here are the superior noodles.the cost on the printed menu is what they charge on call in orders.you won&#39;t go wrong.great place for outdoor dining on a summer evening if you&#39;re willing to pay for top dollar for fancy chinese food.terrible! poor service and attitude!!! we wanna some hot water, they told us:&#34; no hot water/cold water to offer!&#34;what? r u kidding me??! first time, a restaurant doesn&#39;t offer hot /cold water to guests!will not eat here anymore!.this is not a restaurant you could eat at on a weekly basis unless you want high blood pressure.just got my order - so annoyed! lettuce wraps with no sauce at all.one of the best in chicago."

ken-kee-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ken-kee-restaurant-chicago,4,"Chicago restaurants usually are on par with their &#34;customer service&#34;..btw, 10% off if you pay with cash.not authentic asian restaurant but asian fusion.these hotties (wings) are pretty awesome!  there are different kinds and i got the buffalo hotties with purple rice.i made an order to-go and was told the wait would be about 15-20 minutes--perfect, as i had bought a bottle of wine prior, and what better way to spend my time while waiting.that was nice as it is impossible to get a reasonably timed reservation here.my mother orders from them all the time for our birthday parties or house-warming parties the potstickers are a hit!i also recommend their almond jello, and shrimp dumplings ( ha- gow).delicious food, been a regular customer for the longest.nor am i interested in getting anything else here."
