mcnamaras-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcnamaras-chicago,4,"She seemed to infer that any 16oz beer would be offered at $4, so some of the ones i ended up ordering were full price.super fun!cocktails wise, we tried a couple of the drafts, i liked the killing floor which was watermelon with spicy tequila.another cool place for tuesday special, a set of delicious 9oz burger, fries, a shot of bourbon and  a pint of beer for only $16, if you love cheese and want to add on your juicy burger, it&#39;s $2 more for that, great offer.i will make sure that i let everyone i know to ignore this spot.to top it off they have a very extensive beer and cocktail selection.woo hoo! finally decided to give this place a shot..it paired really nicely with the zombie beer i got as well!sheboygan: a sheboygan veal brat with melted gouda, sauerkraut, black currants and mustard on a flat bun.nothing else matters.this place is a fun lively place to go after work."
corcorans-grill-and-pub-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/corcorans-grill-and-pub-chicago,4,I probably should have said something because xyz happened but they were really busy and i was in a good mood and couldn&#39;t really be bothered.fantastic.great place to watch the sox or stop in before and after the game.we started off with samosas.this insides seemed to be a mix of pounded out breast and thigh.a must &#39;eat&#39; for chicago!...i&#39;ve been to laschets several times.excellent.

the-glunz-tavern-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-glunz-tavern-chicago,5,"Pretty good compliment coming from someone that doesn&#39;t like beer/nor root beer.the wings and hamburgers are the best ! the prices are reasonable and the location is fantastic !.as if they were trying to unload last week&#39;s uneaten fries on me and my friends.i love this place..best ribs i&#39;ve had in chicago.the service was remarkably good, it was unbelievable how knowledgable our server jolene was...the bartender brian is great, nice guy, makes a great drink!."
pleasant-house-bakery-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pleasant-house-bakery-chicago,4,"One of the best mai tai&#39;s i&#39;ve ever had.i met that six-foot tuba-playing blonde here.after we closed out, our server surprised us with champagne, which was so thoughtful and definitely made the evening that much better.great food selection.the orders came pretty fast and my burger was good.a restaurant that is divey and has a mechillin star.no answer.the food was another story.and get a snack as well!.one tried the international whiskey flight and he loved it and tried to educate me on the flavors."
green-door-tavern-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/green-door-tavern-chicago,4,"Definitely my favorite pub in chicago!.hey, take breaks, enjoy the silence before the chaos but be sure someone is keeping an eye on customers so they don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re burdening those employees who are working during the odd hours/shift changes.flo&#39;s polish pizza is always a group favorite and the buffalo bill&#39;s chicken pizza is definitely on the spicy side but still oh so good!  i love recommending this place to people as there is something for everyone on the menu!  the patio is great for families and larger groups too.i thought it was pulled pork for some reason..new management.pricey, with the air of exclusivity to match.fun atmosphere and delicious food.nothing too nerdy but some solid picks.so while the name still is a bit confusing for a restaurant in a hotel, the local did a good job of convincing this local girl that another visit to try out more of that &#34;comfort food&#34; menu would be in order."
mcgees-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcgees-chicago,4,"My manhattans were delicious, though i am told that the old fashioned is their signature drink.decent, nothing special.big disappointment from what it was.then they turned the music up to keep us from talking.love this place to death!!..we will be back!.with little research online i found out about longman &amp; eagle.it&#39;s not listed in their online menu, so i can&#39;t report what it contained, but i liked the aftertaste more than the actual taste.."

harrigans-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/harrigans-chicago,4,"It&#39;s a good mix of professionals, old regulars, students, and young families who come in for dinner.i will make sure that i let everyone i know to ignore this spot.perfect for a spring day.it went to this spot last night.who do you think you are to give peoples&#39; rules?!?!? i think you can be very sophisticated, provide an elegant and upscaled type of environment without being rude, and this place for me it is just rude.a visit to the green door is almost like going home; it just has that feel to it..if you like tiki drinks or rum drinks, you&#39;ll love three dots and a dash.i&#39;ve had burgers, nachos, and salads here.you can rate owen based on its great selection of booze, its friendly and attentive service, or its soothing ambience, but i&#39;m not here to talk about any of that."
d-o-c-wine-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/d-o-c-wine-bar-chicago,5,"This is a really old bar predating the current establishment that dates to 1950.the patty itself is brittle yet extremely flavorful.it came out to be a lot more expensive than we thought the food was worth.the portions were on the smaller side.the atmosphere is also beautiful and modern.even when i said &#34;the bad food is annoying, but the fact that no one has apologized a single time is a real concern.i would come here more often if i lived closer!.he was super friendly and helpful and was always there with a fresh beer, or whatever else we needed.&#34;what is this place?!&#34; this was not her usual scene.."
fado-irish-pub-and-restaurant-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fado-irish-pub-and-restaurant-chicago-2,4,"The place does not accept reservations, so getting there right when it opens is highly recommended.i got the chili, which was a carnivore&#39;s happiness.like most of the places around here, o&amp;e suffers a bit from hipster attitude at the hostess counter and at the bar (of course we are decidedly unhip middle-agers so ymmv).the staff is so friendly and accommodating and let you watch what you want from shows on tv to requested sports games.this a such an awesome spot for late night eats, i flew in from sf starving, and sean and crew took care of me..just a burger? let me tell you about the thing you say is &#34;just a burger.after trying to send it back the owner came to our table and offered us mimosas and pastries.ok i know this is my second check in in 24 hours.it is enough food for you to as k for it to go and eat it for the next meal."
trinity-pub-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trinity-pub-chicago,4,"Was hoping to walk back over from the hyatt for their extensive beer selection , alas i didn&#39;t get there.great food..nothing else matters..their cocktails are sub par for the river north but their prices are standard for the street.she was not impressed at all.the plates were a reasonable size, and we also ordered pub royale drinks which were delicious.stop by - great way to see how the established neighborhoods of old chicago functioned before the onslaught of the suburban yupps.it has an old school north woods feel and it&#39;s almost more of a bar than a restaurant."
reillys-daughter-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/reillys-daughter-chicago,3,"I&#39;ve been to fado a number of times for drinks, but this week was the first time i ordered food as well.amazing drinks,  amazing service.&#34; bartender said it was designed by the chef from au cheval, the burger place with 4 hour wait times, so you know it&#39;s delicious.i would&#39;ve been there all night but i had to refrain..finish with a strudel and you&#39;ll be happier than a kid chasing an ice cream truck.it&#39;s a pretty classic bar.did not try the food but looked nice..the ultimate drink tests-manhattan &amp; old fashion were well made."
goose-island-clybourn-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/goose-island-clybourn-chicago-3,3,"Great for kids and nice craft beer selection..i don&#39;t have a problem with paying a couple more dollars for a cocktail due to it&#39;s real estate but, i do have a problem when it isn&#39;t worth it! sorry, but i will not be back here...i had a pumpkin soup, turkey and mashed potatoes and a pumpkin pie.all of us went with the natural choice of ribs for our main.(bus boy was lovely).the one big patty had little texture and left a soggy, soggy bun.the burger patty lacked sat and paper, and was surprisingly bland."
tilted-kilt-pub-and-eatery-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tilted-kilt-pub-and-eatery-chicago,4,"Pretty tasty, however, i don&#39;t think i&#39;d order cocktails here again, they were good but i&#39;m a beer person.only 4 stars because the staff could be more friendly.that doesn&#39;t mean the food and preparations weren&#39;t good.we had a reservation for 2 for 6 pm and it was extremely uncrowded but strangly enough it still took about 5 minutes of us standing there with the host to get seated...this was our first stop in chicago after i insisted on it remembering how harmonious that pizza was with the kielbasa and sauerkraut.the ribs are boiled!! no seasoning.compliments to the chef.."
racine-plumbing-bar-and-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/racine-plumbing-bar-and-grill-chicago,4,"I live about a block away and have been here twice.so when you order plain old fries, be prepared for $8 on that receipt.it&#39;s great!.go to longman &amp; eagle for the following reasons:1.i&#39;ve never had one, but they looked great as they came by.you may want this burger cooked a little longer than usual, to sweat out some of the fat and grease.it&#39;s great that you have the choice to get a great craft beer, amazing selection.my first time here and the food is amazing,i will definitely be back again with plenty of friends,they also have something to do for everyday of the week,i&#39;m in heaven.really cool thing to do if you want something a little different than the norm.the food is okay but if your going to spend downtown prices for salad or sandwich i think you&#39;d enjoy somewhere else more ."
o-callaghans-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/o-callaghans-chicago-2,4,"I honestly can&#39;t remember their names but mine was a brandy cocktail with beer.caesar&#39;s salad and coleslaw had rich and good flavors.the owner often works the bar and the type of guy that makes his bar what it is, amazing!.expensive for what it is, but definitely a place with a big crowd (if that&#39;s what you like).the boyfriend ordered wings that will always hit the spot just right.i would definitely recommend reservations as they were busy and i can imagine they are like that most of the time.it was also chewy/rubbery.we managed to find a table that did not have a reserved sign.00 a beer not thrilled about this place just easy for my travels.i can&#39;t speak highly enough about this location."

connollys-public-house-oak-park,https://www.yelp.com/biz/connollys-public-house-oak-park,4,"My group got mostly appetizers and sandwiches.we also had the fried pickles which were good but a lot of breading.we started off with samosas.will definitely come back!.the food isn&#39;t anything fancy but it always hits the spot and is priced reasonably well.i will totally come back, maybe again before march madness is over!!.light and tasty; the yogurt, which was good; and my favorite, the elotes sweet corn, which was limey, fresh and exploding with flavor!thanks for making our sunday brunch supurb :).make sure you mix zesty and prohibition together, little sweet and spicy.get an oyster or lamb slider, portobello fries, and a strong cocktail."
first-draft-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/first-draft-chicago,3,"It was your basic pub/bar fare.after seating at the full bar i was handed a beer menu an food menu.the cafe is not a bistro by any means: its cafeteria-style, where you line up, grab a brown tray, give your order to the staff, and proceed to pick up your order and pay for it at the register.they do not disappoint.the carmalised onions add a perfect tint of flavor and, although optional, the cheese on top was also a great addition.a hidden gem in plain sight, ill definitely be back and bringing friends to this indian/american inspired joint with a good cocktail list, great beer selection, and some mega tasty unique plates.i would be more than happy to consume all of my liquid calories at longman.it was a tuesday and they have half price bottles of wine! i had the thüringer and smoked thüringer which came with sauerkraut and potatoes.our server was fun and very friendly."

lanigans-irish-pub-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lanigans-irish-pub-chicago,4,"Get the pretzel with mustard for starters; they&#39;re fabulous! red cabbage is perfect, german potato salad warm and bacon-y.well yeah,  we asked 15 min ago.after we got our drinks we didn&#39;t even know where to stand since 1) we couldn&#39;t use the tables even to just put our drinks on it and 2) extremely crowded to even find a space to stand.service was slow- took 45 minutes for wings to come out..the burgers are world class, the metal is brutal, and the line can get long, so try going at odd hours.5 stars for service: friendly, attentive, fast, and focused.someone mentioned it was my birthday and they brought out a complimentary brulee.etc- go in the side door! and cash only!."
bar-on-buena-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-on-buena-chicago,3,"Goulash is zesty.not loud music.it&#39;s a bar.the carnivore had one of the night&#39;s specials, a 14 oz rib eye.she didn&#39;t come to take out order, refill waters, check on us, or bring the check.love this place! the hawaiian theme reminds me of a rip off (but classier) version of a little place in the suburbs!i love that they made this a secret entrance bar.overall, this was a good place, but nothing exceptional.the interior is dim and intimate with a bar to the right of the entrance, about 10 tables in the first enclosure and 7 past the kitchen to the rear.this seemed like a cool place to go on a date! i only got to enjoy the deviled eggs with chorizo and the soft pretzel with the chocolate stout mustard and both were good.there are far better places to get bbq in chicago."
shamrock-club-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shamrock-club-chicago,4,"We tried multiple times to get a hold of the manager/event coordinator via email, calls, etc.the doors were locked and not a soul inside.they were so good i had to order extras to take home with me! i may even make another trip before we go back to la.we used to have work events here (and my going away from my old job as it happens.all in all, a must stop for any wing afficianado!.we had one other entree as well but i honestly can&#39;t remember it because it was so salty, it was impossible to eat.always a great stop in chicago! i love the history and atmosphere! the food is delicious from the sauerkraut to the bratwurst.henry&#39;s was the opposite of other places on hubbard (packed with long lines and girls dressed like they were heading out in vegas) and i couldn&#39;t have been more glad it was.i had the prime rib open face sandwich which was very good.the mushroom goulash with red cabbage and spaetzels is terrific and jojo (our favorite waitress there) always makes sure that the beers will hit the spot."
js-old-lincoln-park-pub-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/js-old-lincoln-park-pub-chicago,4,"1..the food was not amazing but pretty good.when our server brought the wine, he splashed it everywhere, with every pour, in all our glasses.for dinner i ordered the egg plant curry, also really great.the ribs were fall off the bone juicy and delish! if i ever return to chicago this will be one of the spots i will hit for sure.first off, we went on a tuesday for $2 tacos.the ribs are the way to go.this is a massive irish pub in the heart of river north.we headed to the bar and had some of the berghoff lager (very good) and rubbed elbows with a lot of rugby fans."
vaughans-pub-and-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vaughans-pub-and-grill-chicago,4,"Also, the sweet potato and pork belly hash were so good.but they name their burgers after metal bands and you&#39;re a tool, so why not? throw on your favorite flannel, trucker hat, and aviators and chow down.the aesthetics are pretty cool, as well..we were drawn to local 22 (blue frog, whatever it should be called) because of bar rescue..as a burger many bill as the best in chicago it was a big let down.outdoor patio was very nice.we sat in the outdoor seating area which was lovely and sipped on the g.points for that."
o-briens-restaurant-and-bar-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/o-briens-restaurant-and-bar-chicago-2,4,"Im sure the place gets a great profit margin with the menu set up with mostly sliders.would recommend!.mac and cheese! we got the prosciutto and sun-dried tomatoes.great place to chill and hang out at the bar...happy yelping!.i got the turkey club sandwich and the portion was huge! i was so stuffed after eating half of it.great spot - actually busy /full even on weeknights, which is awesome if you want to go out and don&#39;t want to hit up an empty bar! good service, awesome beer selection.then my husband and i had the tots--exceptional and a must get! we split the howell and hood burger which was a good burger, not exceptional, but good."
twin-anchors-restaurant-and-tavern-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/twin-anchors-restaurant-and-tavern-chicago,4,"Threw all the food out.and hot damn, that thing was amazing!! it&#39;s a large patty with every bite as juicy and flavorful as the next....normally i reserve 5 stars for outstanding culinary experiences - this is probably my first 5 star based on concept and execution alone.the place was full of bridgeport locals and sox fans from near and afar.but don&#39;t assure us three times that food is safe when it&#39;s not.that&#39;s where the good times ended."
sullys-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sullys-house-chicago,4,"Stumbled on this place on their opening night.our order is almost always the same:- giant pretzel- delicious beer- sourbraten with double spaetzel instead of red cabbage- or rouladen, also with double spaetzel instead of red cabbage- wife usually gets the fish and chips- we both go for the side salad with warm bacon vinaigrettewas just back there last month and it was as good as always!..* buttermilk fried chicken and waffles was the dish my dining companion ordered and she loved it.prices are average.neat little spot to hang out...i went to glunz tavern for a cocktail.or something like that."

brendans-pub-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brendans-pub-chicago,3,"We did a bunch of small plates, and had to refrain from getting two orders of the chicken fried lobster - it&#39;s that good.the pierogi were also good, got meat and the potato &amp; cheese ones that comes with sour cream and apple sauce.the restaurant also uses a phone app called &#34;giftameal&#34; and i got to donate 2 meals to a food pantry (no cost to me)- just by snapping a pic of my food through the app; i thought that was pretty neat.while i was in chicago, an employee at the hotel i was at suggested this place if i was looking for a late night bite or a cocktail.you do not get to choose the beer or bourbon, and i would suspect they change from week to week but i&#39;m not certain on that part.not new to me, but a favorite.they were large oysters with a soft meat.we loved the fried cheese curds (squeaky!) and the bratwurst was so big on a pretzel bun that she could barely get it in her mouth! it came with a sweet red cabbage slaw that again was just so-so.the fries and burgers are great and my vegetarian friend was raving about the veggie burger.the cheese was probably the only thing that really stood out."
the-irish-nobleman-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-irish-nobleman-chicago,4,"Red lion is a good place for a conversation and a pint.even the fries were naughty good.i love dmk&#39;s fries, but these are crinkle cut and waaaay below expectations.what??i came here with the girlfriend for a hawks playoff game, coincidentally along with a dozen of chicago&#39;s finest.valuefor $12-$16/entree the food here isn&#39;t bad, it&#39;s really a 3.good food, lots of immediate seating (it&#39;s a big place) and very good service both times.expensive for what it is, but definitely a place with a big crowd (if that&#39;s what you like).started with the albacore ceviche, which was unexpected, subtle, and delicious..best old school place ever."
a-j-hudsons-public-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/a-j-hudsons-public-house-chicago,4,"I loved the decor.the waitress was nice and very attentive.after the snack i ordered my friend a lyft and we helped her into the car..kuma&#39;s offers big food for burger lovers.our waitress was super nice and attentive, too..granted, he gave us all kinds of sassy hell, but it was the good kind of hurt and he had us laughing nonstop.the driver was so polite even thanks me for ordering.some of their darker options were pretty good too, but i&#39;d stick to the lager."
pitchfork-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pitchfork-chicago,4,"I was satisfied with it! my colleagues got beer and whiskey, they were happy too! tartar and grilled pepper was also good.we also had their wings and it was pretty much the smallest wings i&#39;ve ever seen.the menu is amazing.yummy bar food the chips are to die for and you can chose various sauces for dipping.a tiki lounge hidden in river north - you would need to go through an alley that is lit with tiki torches.you can tell they put time into crafting their pizza that every slice is as good as the last.thoroughly disappointed.overall the dishes i tried were delicious and portions are hearty.when we were leaving,  we tried to say bye to the server, but he was standing at the host stand texting.nothing."

laschets-inn-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/laschets-inn-chicago-2,3,"My only regret was i was too full for a cocktail and considering their bar selection i&#39;m certain it would have been wonderful.on the plus side, if you go from 6-8 on weeknights, they have an absinthe service, which features a fabulous absinthe cocktail (the frappe), and a really really good french absinthe, complete with spider/spoon/sugar/water setup.after 2 visits, i have to say i am a huge fan of both the food and drinks..most of the menu is meat oriented.what a fun place to watch a game!  there is an extensive beer list which covers pretty much every type of beer you can possibly imagine.i mean it&#39;s just a cool spot.they had some good craft beers to choose from, and for food i got the half soup/sandwich combo with shrimp bisque and fried bologna, both were good though there were only like 2 shrimp in my soup, but wevs, cool decor, you go downstairs so the sun won&#39;t get in anyone&#39;s eyes, waitress was nice, i&#39;d def be down to come back.happy hour from 4-7."
