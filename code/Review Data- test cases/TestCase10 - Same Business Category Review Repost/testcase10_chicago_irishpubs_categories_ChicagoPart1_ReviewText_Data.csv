glascotts-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/glascotts-chicago,5,"I started with a tasty stiegl paracelsus.Fabulous experience saturday! lunch with centerville band (ohio).A bar that knows how to treat people! the green door is the place you want to go for a quality, neighborhood experience.From a service standpoint, the staff were all great and the osb space in the back is very cool.If you are expecting some gourmet dish and large beer list with hd tv's then stay away.I think i had 5 of the hemline, which was the perfect combo of tart and boozy..Texture of the pretzel was perfection, and the sauce is to die for.The pickles in the sauce gave it the perfect zing.Very homie ambiance if you are looking for a chill spot to grab a drink and some ribs, staff is super friendly!.."
emmits-irish-pub-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/emmits-irish-pub-chicago,4,"Our server was really nice and attentive which was a positive.To drink i had the #1 royale cup - delicious.On that visit food was good service was decent.The eats are delicious, as well..I have never written a single review of anything in my life, but this was the most rude and offensive interaction i have had with anyone as far back as i can remember.Loved the fling pork wings and calimari was spot on.The ambiance is dimly lit and very romantic..Overall, a decent experience.."
tommy-nevins-pub-evanston,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tommy-nevins-pub-evanston,4,"Everyone's invited.I would definitely call this one a neighborhood gem.Spoiler: the door is right next to the mouth of the fish painting (at least that's what the painting was at the time) or you can just figure out where the entrance is by seeing the line of people standing next to what seems like just a wall.Liked the additional booth/bar seating to make this place more conducive for friendly chitty chatty.Fortunately the hostess found us a table because a reservation cancelled (make reservations! even for happy hour on a tuesday!), and we were seated right away.You wont find many places that their staff really care about customer experience, but both the gm and laura were concerned and cared about my experience..The entire time we were there, carts of dishes and linens were being wheeled back and forth which was disruptive..Almost half of what makes eating out fun is the feeling of ease you get from not having to prepare your own food.."
kellys-pub-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kellys-pub-chicago,4,"We sat in a comfy booth with luxurious drapes and it was perfectly private.Our server didn't really seem engaged with going over anything with us and she would disappear for long periods of time..He told us how great the food was, so my bf and i scheduled a date night and were beyond excited to give it a try.All the taps?  german beer.The food: my dining partner got the blackened salmon salad..Sunday at 7pm without a reservation and we were seated right away! awesome!! the outdoor seating area was beautiful!!the drink list is impressive.Good cocktail and beer list, simple foods with a large variety, and a cool atmosphere.It just didn't fit the sandwich.."
laschets-inn-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/laschets-inn-chicago-2,3,"Food: we started with the bruschetta (it was just ok) and drinks (they were out of blanton's but they have an interesting cocktail menu) before moving onto our main course of: the burger (on special, nicely sized, tasted good), the roasted chicken (tasty), the grilled sirloin (very tasty and enjoyable!), and the grilled pork chop (very enjoyable).But beware as the drinks are super potent! my go to concoctions would be the jet pilot or dead reckoning.Was this the best fish and chips i've had stateside? well, actually it might be.Daytime bartender: 5-stars.Great location to chill and grab a drink.Prices are great and i will definitely go back for drinks with friends.Pushing this to 5 stars because of the outside seating on a beautiful day..You dont need to add any slat , oregano or etc .."
christinas-place-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/christinas-place-chicago-2,4,"If u overlook this place ur an asshole.I will definitely definitely coming back when i return to the chicago area..Great place.This place is awesome.Live and learn - the ribs were worth the walk!.It's basically just a door-shaped chunk of a wall it's in.Tried their donuts it's good a bit dry but tasty.But, given that i can go there and have a 4/7 chance at cheap wings (after 3pm), psp is a pretty solid option.Just as important as the beer.."
macs-american-pub-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/macs-american-pub-chicago,4,"Yeah, fado is a chain, but damn it's good and fun.Shaller's is like stepping back in time, but not to the 1880s, but more like the 1950s.They fall of the bone with no effort.As john oliver might say  'swanky texas' ( we are talking about mexico today otherwise known as 'spicy canada')good chance if you are here that you are a fan of twangy bbq sauce.House salad was good.Once described by a friend as 'upscale hipster' or 'a bit of wicker park in river north' for all you locals, henry's is a breath of fresh air in a neighborhood of pretentious nightclubs (and that's coming from a regular guest of paris club and underground) and boring bars lacking personality.When a repeat customer walks in, they're greeted warmly but not at the expense of other guests.Great bar, only place in river north that is an actual bar.Went on a friday night with some friends and the service was absolutely horrible.The desserts sounded amazing, but we were so full we could not try them.."
vaughans-pub-and-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vaughans-pub-and-grill-chicago,4,"Get a reservation!!! we didn't have one but were luckily dining early enough to grab a table in the bar area.Be prepared for a long line both to get in and at the bar..Returned on 10/21/2015 for the oyster happy hour and a drink or two - tried the nikka coffey grain after discussion with peter, the super-knowledgeable barman.The karaoke host was quite nice yes i do give him major props i've been to many many karaoke places and this host was awesome!! the waitstaff was also super nice and food was extra tasty so yes hands down this place definitely gets my vote..I had the lamb, burger, and chicken sliders.Love it! took my girls from colorado here for some good chicago food and this place hit the spot.Great idea.Very traditional american, it felt like i was dining in an upscale log cabin, which i thought was rad.."
the-harp-and-fiddle-park-ridge,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-harp-and-fiddle-park-ridge,4,"This place had completely changed the way i view meat and became a believer than lean meat can be just as juicy and flavorful.We were about 2 blocks away and walked all the way back only to find that we were offered an indoor table..Fries were mushy, fish was frozen, and cost was high...Come back earlier when it's not so busy, maybe the servers will be more attentive.The atmosphere is also beautiful and modern.The last time i was there i was in a tuxedo - while my newly minted bride stood in her wedding dress.Solid burgers.."
shanahans-forest-park,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shanahans-forest-park,5,"It looks old from the outside, but they have good food.Fries are hand cut and awesome.Most recenlty chris was our server and he was phenomonal..Thanks for the tip and the good care sean!!..Both were perfectly prepared.The 'three dots and a dash' drink was fantastic.Arrived as a group of 6 on a saturday night, and there was a line outside this speakeasy.What i like about the food is that it is served as little bite sized dishes almost like tapas in an americanized cuisine.."
dunlays-on-the-square-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dunlays-on-the-square-chicago,4,"Perfect nightcap for probably few but a-ok in my book!..Decent place with $6 manhattans and fish and chips $5  (at least thats what i get) during happy hour.Not the quickest service,but the food is great! join the rewards club here you can get a free drink!!! the prices are reasonable for both food and drinks! also, if you are bold enough try the balls of the day (yes balls)!!! it will take money off of your bill if you can stomach the balls or offal (fyi fried and tasty!!) i will definitely be back!!..My bride had the led zeppelin.The worst breakfast in chicago.I went here after dinner one night and really enjoyed its authenticity.And don't even get me started on the burger! hands down the best burger i've ever had.Very dimly lighted, not rowdy at all, a very classy place, to have great conversation and spend time with friends.."
monks-pub-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/monks-pub-chicago,4,"The biggest hits were:1) the hot sausage plate - specifically, the bratwurst was some of the best that i've had anywhere.Stop in before a white sox game and make a day of it.Buffalo chicken sandwich was awesome.I had the kuma original burger, and my husband had the pantera burger.The cornbread was a little dry but all in all, we were really impressed by the standard of this pub food and we were a little peeved we only had time to eat here once on our visit!don't pass jake's by, you'll regret it!.Marvelous.Great location.And, both times, i left without anything too memorable--but, maybe that's okay?the hot dogs are solid.I wouldn't have cared as much if the food was worth it, but it wasn't.Thank you.."
js-old-lincoln-park-pub-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/js-old-lincoln-park-pub-chicago,4,"Great place for a date, group of friends, or snacks at the bar with a drink..Everything that went by looked so good.Warning: all food here is heavy and not for someone looking for a salad.We were walking through old town having not been before and decided to stop for a few drinks.We were slightly indecisive but came up with items that looked appealing and we were putting it in the hands of our waitress to narrow it down...I recommend it if you want to have a nice and friendly evening with friends..."
hopleaf-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hopleaf-chicago,4,"The burgers are good, the drinks are good, and i like to watch the bears while eating.When i travel i always try to check out bars with a lot of history behind them--this one obviously delivers.I was just here earlier this week for the first time with a friend of mine, and as i walked in i immediately took in the feeling of being in a library from the early 1900s.We shared a $35 passion fruit drink that hit the novelty spot.Nice touch!although the the patio and outside bar are the true hit for this establishment the interior is 'almost'as nice.There was also a ton of duck, which was awesome.It was five hearty balls on a lightly toasted hoagie bun with marinara sauce and melted mozzarella cheese.Met up with some friends after work and it was great! great food and drinks and the staff was friendly and always available.A great lunch spot in a great location! our waiter was more than happy to assist me in finding a food that did not have dairy or meat, which was appreciated.The portions are small (tapa sized) so you'll have to order multiple things per person.."
the-grafton-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-grafton-chicago,4,Great place to hang out or grab some food and drinks before or after a movie.Parking always bad all over lincoln park so uber it there like i did.I think they're trying too hard to be something they're not.We had to come back later because the line was so long to get in..Thought it may be expensive but it aint!!  i will explore the food on the next review.Average food at best.All the appetizers were awesome.What is there to say about kumas that hasn't been said in the 4k+ posts already...
slainte-irish-pub-forest-park,https://www.yelp.com/biz/slainte-irish-pub-forest-park,4,"I will say i am not much of a ribs eater but i decided to do it at our work happy hour and glad i did.They have a great beer selection.I would try something else next time...Extremely few misses, and most everything i've tried has been decent.I will definitely be back!fyi: restaurant is attached to a hotel so bathroom is a far walk towards the hotel then down the stairs.We weren't in a hurry so it wasn't a big deal.."
pepper-canister-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pepper-canister-chicago,4,"It was quick, but friendly and we loved the vibe.Dessert -- shot glasses of key lime -- was great!ambience very nice, staff helpful and efficient.The restaurant itself is very large..Probably the best thin crust i've had in the city.Was here for a birthday party of sorts.The pork was so tender and the flavors were very savory.We both had the tasty thanksgiving dinner that was one of the specials of the day.My friends and i ordered so many but my favorites were the mai tai and the painkillers.This food is hypnotizing.."
rocking-horse-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rocking-horse-chicago,4,"Found this bar on yelp and since it was kinda close to the hilton hotel,  we decided to walk.Waitress let us pick our booth, no wait on a sunday afternoon.A staple in my restaurant list!.Great beer and craft cocktails, scotch egg is so yummy, home made pickles, and i love their crumpets!  never been for dinner but i am sure its just as good!!!!  i don't think i can eat a burger anywhere else after this.Very comfortable, great bartenders, good food, beautiful room with many original features - easily the best place to come for a relaxing dinner amidst all the craziness of wells street just a little further north.Came here on a pizza tour stop.Loved the books and knick knacks around the bar, would love to come with more friends or a more interesting date ;-).If you're feeling crazy you can also make s'mores at your table or get paid to eat some duck balls (better than you think, but you could probably fry and bread anything and make it taste acceptable).I'm not sure if they thought i was waiting for someone (i went solo), but it took a good 5-8 minutes till i even got a 'hi' and offered to get a drink.Great interior, lovely wait staff, great drinks selection and delicious food.."
cork-and-kerry-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cork-and-kerry-chicago-3,4,"But, not enough pros relative to the cons.Relaxed vibe and friendly staff!.We had three really great dishes and would recommend all of them.I have been here several times and i really enjoy coming on a weekend night where it can be packed and there is a line of people waiting outside the door..The owner often works the bar and the type of guy that makes his bar what it is, amazing!.The build your own burger option was calling to me.It was light even though it had southern flavors...."
windy-city-inn-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/windy-city-inn-chicago,4,"I'm used to a cpp that is much thicker.I've had better meals at burger king.It's mild in flavor and didn't come with an egg.Upon arrival, i certainly got the feeling of an old-time bar/restaurant with it's dark wood and the layout of the booths and tables.' obviously they boil them or soak them for a long period of time before putting them on the grill.Reminded me of being on a cruise ship! the bartenders were super friendly even though they were crazy busy.I would have liked to have had a beer but their current draft list is a good representation of the brewing season.I loved it.Immediate reaction: it was ok, so much history.Too bad i didn't check in for that free famous root beer.."
blue-frogs-local-22-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-frogs-local-22-chicago-3,4,"My wife said her rose was decent but not the best she's ever had.Also, if you want food, don't bother.Also, when we walked in, there was no one to greet us.Simply delicious!!! the coffee was equally good.We got the fried pickles which are spears and come with a great sauce for dipping.Even if i don't like the type of alcohol, even though i don't like certain ingredients, i have always loved anything i or my friends have ordered here..After we sat down the waitress gave her little shpiel and let us know it would be best if we order 3-4 dishes for the two of us.Service was not good at all.Service was great, the vibe was very chill.."
hüettenbar-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/h%C3%BCettenbar-chicago-3,4,"Outstanding irish pub! the lamb dip and mash was excellent along with the perfectly chilled smithwicks!.Highly recommend the venison brat! the addition of jam brings a great variety of flavors.Sleek 'vintage' furniture.As we were looking at the dessert menu (didn't get any) the table next to us ordered the house made sausage and let me tell you, that looked really good..This place had all the right elements but there were too many missteps to be a win.The bartender brian is great, nice guy, makes a great drink!.However, my suspicious is that they had forgotten our order, so they had to prepare it so fast that the eggs were still runny.Burger.My rating is strictly for the ribs, i mean, that's what they are known for.."
racine-plumbing-bar-and-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/racine-plumbing-bar-and-grill-chicago,4,"I thought it was a little too much blue cheese and not enough jalapeños..The fries were indeed good.I don't think there is another place with good food where you can walk out leaving a $20 bill on the table.Love that you can't use your phone in the bar! you actually have to talk to the people you are with!.Great burger!  where else can you get a fantastic burger, a craft beer, and a shot of bourbon for like $16? this is on my top five burgers in the city, for sure.When we arrived it was packed.Come hungry!kuma's corner5/5.You put your name down and they will give you a time estimate for a table or you can scout spots at the bar.(i was staying at the attached hotel).."
mo-daileys-pub-and-grille-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mo-daileys-pub-and-grille-chicago,4,"Wealth of guinness and other drinks.I would definitely come back to try the other menu items.The wienerschnitzel was very good but not worth the $24ish it came out to be.Overall, the décor and furniture are really cool, the drinks were good and we had a good time just hanging out there feeling exclusive.Vast menu supplemented by daily specials..Service: the service was alright, nothing too impressive.Very near millennial park and the chicago art institute.Asked what seemed to be the manager/owner if he could put on the tigers baseball game.The decor is of good taste but the prices are more than reasonable.."
first-draft-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/first-draft-chicago,4,"Brings in the tourist for sure.They are opening their 4th restaurant right by my new place in west loop and i'm about to gain 10 pounds from the burgers.My grandson and i were early as we were hungry, but the main dining room was closed and we ate in what, i think, used to be the bar.This is a hidden gem (i almost didn't want to write this review to share the secret).Next, was the lobster fried chicken which is basically two lobster tails and fried a little in the same stuff as you would fry chicken and i thought i would hate it and it wouldn't be moist and flavorful, but on the contrary it was really tasty and the spicy ranch sauce went so well with it that i wanted to dip my other piece of bread in it too, get this dish and you won't be disappointed.The pork was so tender and full of flavor and matched perfectly with the beans.Great location..I haven't had the chance to eat here yet, but i was very impressed with my cocktail experience here yesterday.Nice staff.."
howells-and-hood-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/howells-and-hood-chicago,4,"We both cleaned our plates..I will definitely recommend red lion to all my friends.All in all, a great night out..It makes no sense at all as to why some dishes can be substituted and some cannot..It was delicious especially with the homemade spicy mustard.This meal was amazing and all i wanted was more.I was a little put off by the way it looked--kind of pale and sickly; not the usual fried chicken caramel brown color, but it tasted fine.."
blackthorn-pub-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blackthorn-pub-chicago,4,"Which is a damn shame because if they're so creative with toppings, they could make a bomb chipotle black bean burger from scratch that people might actually be able to eat.I hosted a company party here in may, and the staff were phenomenal.Loved absolutely everything about this place! their peanuts are soooo tasty.The cauliflower tots are overrated and are only really worth ordering if you're at the bar for happy hour and have already downed a drink or two.Nobody checking id's at the door.I've been to jakes twice, and each time it has been quite good.Even though they're not trying to push the culinary envelope, it is clear they take their food seriously..Now.Forgot what we all ordered but all so good!! thanks for the complementary bachelorette shot waiter!.."
palmer-place-restaurant-and-biergarten-la-grange,https://www.yelp.com/biz/palmer-place-restaurant-and-biergarten-la-grange,4,"Then the server informed us that the bartender wouldn't serve it for another hour at least because it 'wasn't up to his standards' as it hadn't frozen enough at that point.Unfortunately i didn't get to try their food here but the menu did look good as well as their polish drinks.Most meals are under $10 and they have a really good prime rib dinner.What a great place!  just a neighborhood joint with a great story behind it.Comfort food, good staff, good drinks, sinatra playing in the background.My plate of food could feed a family of 4..I was so ready to leave but too bad i was really hungry.Menu is mostly indian small plates with lots of vegetarian options.."
bar-on-buena-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-on-buena-chicago,4,"Fun place but the service??? they are nice but we had to ask for napkins and place settings and three other tables had they're food and nothing to eat with???it was a sunday so we had one person that eat at the buffett and had 4 plates before we got our food!we waited over an hour for our food!we had to ask for refills!.Had some super cheap old fashioneds to ring in the new year, not a bad startive been here before and cold weather makes for a cold bar but the patrons and staff are friendly, and hell im always chilled anywaysserves food and lets you carry in once the kitchen closesseveral rooms to hang out in and pool and plenty of tvs to keep you entertained..Nice warm welcoming atmosphere.I give it 4 stars for the drinks.No one in the entire place had a baseball cap on backwards.All three sauces, 'stout and cheddar cheese sauce, sweet mustard, and dusseldorf mustard' to quote the menu, were delicious.Love this spot its got a nice look..Servers were very attentive and helpful.."
exchequer-restaurant-and-pub-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/exchequer-restaurant-and-pub-chicago,4,"You totally forget about the busy streets of the damen intersection and even all the partying that's going on at big star across the street..They'll change your life..Definitely mine and my boyfriends favorite local bar to go to.Mac and cheese! we got the prosciutto and sun-dried tomatoes.Sorry.The sauce was some of the best i've had and the garlic bread that came with it was good too.The choices were outstanding, especially the beer and other drinks menu, they had beers we haven't had since we were in london.Seems like this is a great place to come for a variety of drinks and the atmosphere.."
the-irish-nobleman-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-irish-nobleman-chicago,3,"It was kind of confusing, but when you walk in and sit at one of the hightops, there is no waiter service there.For the main dish i ordered the sloppy pig sandwich, it has pulled pork, beef brisket and pulled chicken on it.My friend ordered the black jack burger it comes with bbq sauce, bacon and jack cheese.Place also looks great and staff was friendly..The burger and and scotch egg is nuts!  drinks were really good too.Little did we know it was the air and water show when we made the reservations.The atmosphere is really cool, and their alcohol selection is nice.Its an clean, welcoming sports/music bar with good prices and quality food/beverages.Frist real stop for food in chicago started here.."
kitty-o-sheas-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kitty-o-sheas-chicago,4,"I will not offer to share this item with him next time.They do service right..Just moved to the area with my fiance and danny welcomed us with tequila shots and awesome beer! thank you danny!! this will be our new watering hole!.The cooks did an amazing job with the food as well..I went in with a group of 10 co-workers for lunch and the minute we sat down i could tell the waitress was hesitant to wait on a larger group.Exceedingly busy with foot traffic! accordingly, it is a very loud venue! our wait staff were quite good! our food was excellent from the salads to scallops to the enormous pork chop one diner ordered! would not hesitate to return anytime we find ourselves in chicago!.My friends and i came here last week after the game was cancelled in search of beer, food, and a great crowd..."
paddy-longs-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/paddy-longs-chicago-2,4,"This is now the oldest bar in chicago, so do ya think there's a little history here? it has been operated by the same family since 1881, so they have seen it all including generations of chicago sports fans, politicians, and sports figures, not to mention prohibition.Daytime bartender: 5-stars.However, despite the crowds i have always managed to be seated promptly, which is a huge plus.They bring said, still really enjoyed my meal!.But the burgers are king and they still deliver the goods.Great traditional german food and better beer! very cozy atmosphere with friendly people.Super cool joint where you can have a great bite to eat and enjoy some good conversation.I'd been refraining from going, thinking it was just an over priced drinks and share plate joint with a cool patio but was pleasantly surprised to find innovative cocktails,  interesting and delicious share plates from a small but refreshing menu and an intelligent,  friendly, personable mixologist (sorry justin or jason) who busy as he was had the knowledge and graciously made the time to explain some of the more esoteric components of their drinks.All that to say, everything from the amazing cocktails to the little details push the envelope from 'a great space' to 'best place in the city..."
flo-and-santos-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/flo-and-santos-chicago-3,4,"The food is good too.Overall, great food and a good time.Very good upscale pub grub.Great beer-check! great service-check! authentic irish pub feel-check! our waitress was even from the homeland and had an accent and everything.Also, make sure to get your parking validated before you leave.I can't say enough good things about the nachos! huge and spicy! ay-yi-yi! we followed the yelp reviews and ordered the smores and were not disappointed.Amazing customer service.Love the cookies at the end too!.5 stars for them!.."
the-irish-oak-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-irish-oak-chicago-2,4,"Grab a handful of root beer candies from the hostess station before you leave and you'll be reminded of that jake melnick experience the rest of the afternoon..Friendly place.I thought it was a fun bar with elevated bar food and friendly service.Neat little spot to hang out.The shamrock shuffle was last sunday and the gage is near the finish line, so we came back.Weren't crispy or cooked like how it usually is.Another review mentioned $5 bombers though, i'll have to come back to try those!.The two of us actually ended up splitting the mahi mahi tacos.First time here for all of us so we decided to try it.."
halligan-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/halligan-bar-chicago,4,"I got the led zepplin burger which comes with pulled pork on top, i also sub a ceaser which is always fresh and a huge portion.Only drawback is i wish there was more room.The chicken was doused in oil and fried to the point where it overtook the taste of the actual meat.I go to twin anchors all the time.Not sure what happened the first time around, but the wings are delicious, great heat on the spicy buffalo wings...Sleeper spot for pre gaming before a bears game.Looks like yummy grub as a late-night snack, hh app, or game-day meal!service at fd is pretty first-rate based on my drinking experience here.We found this to be a real good bar with a way friendly staff and ridiculously good bar food.."
celtic-knot-public-house-evanston,https://www.yelp.com/biz/celtic-knot-public-house-evanston,4,"Your irish car bombs are even better! thank you for your hospitality.I will for sure be back for dinner, drinks and to hang out with my friends...My big bro was in town for work and staying at the hilton.The prohibition sauce is so money!! i like mine with onion rings on the side, but the baked potato or fries make pretty good accomponiants too.I said i wasn't a shot kind of gal, so he brought over a shot of beer i was contemplating trying (unprompted).I literally wandered in here in quite a state and had this more piquant version of my favorite cocktail, the venerable gin gin mule..Overall: great food, great beer, atmosphere for a fun and neat pub experience.."
daily-bar-and-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/daily-bar-and-grill-chicago,4,"The next burger was more on the rare side but took almost 30 minutes to get back to us.E 6:38 = $6.My favorite pizza in the city! love the pizza with garlic olive oil instead of sauce.Best german restaurant in chicago in my opinion.It was very clear that the staff knew what they were doing, and they are very knowledgeable when it comes to suggesting wine/beer pairings.To drink i had the #1 royale cup - delicious.The wings.Simple dish- cheese & bread.Friendly, clean, and the ribs with the prohibition sauce were fantastic,  a great local eatery with a fascinating history!.Gorgeous new space for the red lion pub.."
the-local-chicago-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-local-chicago-chicago,4,"I tried the egg belt.Yes it's old and dark, but there's a place for such nostalgic places, especially if the food is good, and that's the case here.They have a really unique draft beer list with lots of stuff from europe (i'm assuming).Great food..I had heard that it closed when the owner died and was pleasantly surprised to find the family had reopened it.The food was good, not great.Food great and beer.It was excellent and i highly recommend this appetizer.35-year-old-hipster? we opted for their $30 shots thereafter so he couldn't mess it up.."
horse-thief-hollow-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/horse-thief-hollow-chicago,4,":) there is a taxi stand right across the street so it was easy in and out for those without a car.One of the most interactive,  and influential and knowledgeable bartenders i have had the pleasure to be served from.The wings were made fresh, the meat was juicy and there was plenty of buffalo sauce.The place looks like a wooden box and i could barely see the door until the bouncer opened it up for us.Then we sat some more.However, the service has always been great once i was in the rotation.Servers are busy and can't always keep track of who just sat down.However service was excellent..Ordered the steak tartare, which was served spread very thinly on dense bread.."

foxs-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/foxs-chicago-5,4,"Great appetizers and pretty good service.Interesting fact they have special lemon ice you can add that instead of lemon.At that point the server came over and took our orders.You have friends to stay with the next time you are in tahoe!  j & k.Sunday a bit after 12pm was quite busy, but the service was prompt and we didn't feel rushed.The pilsner was superb, the service was super pleasant, sitting at the bar was treat for the eyes with the old wood panels and marquetteries.The broth has a kick from the serranos, and the toasted ravioli is unusual, but tasty with a crumbly texture.Inside you are transported to a more pre-20's era parisian style escape from all the huhbub of the close by milwaukee-north-damen intersection and the big star crowd.The hostess was fine, nothing wrong with her.Everything about this place was amazing and the service was on point.."
fat-cat-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fat-cat-chicago,4,"Came here for drinks after work with friends and really dig the place..After writing this review and telling all my friends about this place, my buddies came back arguing au cheval is better.I give it a 5-star to give me an experience and feel which i havent gotten anywhere else yet..Again, no reservations so leave church early and go have some waffles!.Could've easily been two meals however.We were led to a very comfy vinyl upholstered booth, from where we could see a few tvs at the bar..I'll definitely be going back.."
irish-american-heritage-center-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/irish-american-heritage-center-chicago,3,"Overall the food was nothing out of the ordinary but good classic options and service.Came back to b&l sober and it was a slightly different experience., naperville, il.It's the oldest standing bar in chicago so definitely worth checking out just for that, aside from that there's not that much special about it, not to say it's bad, they sometimes have live music, the beer is cheap, though just standard domestic selection, i know their food is supposed to be good, i haven't had it yet, but it's a full dinner menu, one of these days i'll come back and try it.The burger was so juicy and tender it was melting in my mouth.Highly recommended for a no frills atmosphere with great grub and drinks at a reasonable price! we will be back on our next trip to chicago!.Nothing too nerdy but some solid picks.We had the salmon tartare and mussels to start with, which were disappointing.The music was great, the waitstaff was just the right amount of helpful while still maintaining a metal edge.After second try i refused the drink ordered an old fashioned.."
wilde-bar-and-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wilde-bar-and-restaurant-chicago,4,"Would recommend!.I felt like the avocado crudo could have used more of a kick or something.Just a nice neighborhood barbecue joint that turns out fantastic ribs, chicken and onion rings.The mac and cheese was the right cheesiness without being too heavy, yum.Been to this great bar several times.Food was greasy and portions are way too small and expensive....On this particular evening, i ordered a draft beer 'the rabbit rotating selection', which consisted of a craft beer located outside of chicago with a latin spin on it.."
three-dots-and-a-dash-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/three-dots-and-a-dash-chicago,4,"I have no problem with this place.I live in the area and this is one of the spots i like to bring friends to or go for a bite to eat and drink.Been to this great bar several times.Generally we come at night for karaoke, typically just to watch but occasionally we jump in there..Great service and great atmosphere! our server is blonde with some blue in her hair and she gives the best customer service.It was not worth it, really..It can be overwhelming at first but once you pick your drink, what's to come is mere euphoria.We waited 1 hour.."
randolph-tavern-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/randolph-tavern-chicago-4,4,"The sandwich i got was decent, not the best, but the fries they came with were cold and tasted old.The service was prompt and friendly.Relive the best meal.I ordered the loop burger that included applewood smoked bacon, tomato, onion relish, muenster cheese, lettuce and local sauce.Either way, it's like a free beer and shot of bourbon, so there's really no reason to complain.I know it's cold outside, but seriously? it's just tacky.So, there's also that.I enjoyed all the beers i tried.I feel like all of the positive reviews are from made up profiles giving fake review.We were yelled for talking to people next to us in the bar area and kindly asking them if we could grab some napkins because our section did not have any.."
mcfaddens-restaurant-and-saloon-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcfaddens-restaurant-and-saloon-chicago,4,"I mean whoa.:)i'll dock a star for the sometimes slow service, which happens some late nights when bigger groups come in.The music is sooo loud and definitely not my taste.It's simply the best place to be welcomed, relaxed and have good home-cooked meal.Bravo!my boyfriend and i checked this place out for the first time the other night for happy hour / dinner.Place also looks great and staff was friendly..I had never been here before even though i have lived here for 8 years.To be fair, we have never ordered food, just drinks.But the beer selection was good.."
