thai-bowl-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-bowl-chicago,12/16/11 , 5 ," Maybe if I lived or went to school nearby I could learn to like it, but for an experienced Thai food connoisseur like myself, this just wasn't up to snuff.I will give them a shout out for the shear amount of tofu in my Spicy Basil Leaves dish, but the rest of the meal was on the brim of being disappointing. Good thing my company was satisfying.First off, it wasn't spicy. Not at all.Second, The rice and other components in my dish weren't the delicious delicate ingredients I'm used to. The rice was room temp and all clumpy like maybe they make a big batch for the day and scoop it into each bowl as ordered. Wah, wah. And one of my favorite things about Thai food it's usually very fresh and you can taste each of the ingredients , plus it's generally pretty healthy for you. Not this one. Everything tasted a bit like fried rice and I'm just not big on the frying.Third, Spicy Basil Leaves should have a certain amount of a liquid-y chili broth swimming around, not this one. I mean, maybe it had been on there at one point but evaporated from being pre-made beforehand or something. Dry Thai makes Candi Cry.It's possible I just went during an off time but based off my experience, I think there are much better Thai options out there. If in the area and convenience isn't the main factor when I'm searching for food, I'd defo go elsewhere."
kabobi-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kabobi-grill-chicago,12/27/14 , 5 ," What an incredible experience!! I wanted to cater my parents 50th Wedding Anniversary on Christmas Day. Everything had to be perfect so I went on a quest to sample all the local Persian & Mediterranean Restaurants in Chicago. After visiting Rezas, Noon & Kabob, Pars and others I decided to try Kabobi.What a gem this place is... As soon as they found out what I wanted to do, they brought me a huge tray of 4 different styles of kabob, 2 types of rice and I was immediately won over!! I placed my order and like clock work my order arrived on Christmas Day at the exact time I ordered it.The food was a hit and to make things even more personal, the owner followed up with me the next day with a phone call to ensure everything went well. Kabobi has won me and my picky family over and is officially our goto Iranian Restaurant. Give them a try and I promise you won't regret it :)"
salonica-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/salonica-chicago,06/07/14 , 5 ," My favorite breakfast-brunch spot so far on the South Side. Clean and cozy, just like some said earlier, is the perfect description. Friendly staff that doesn't rush you, even though it's usually pretty busy with a lot of people eyeing you down for your seat.After the breakfast rush, it's a great lazy place to get some work done if you're in the area and need a seat."
janes-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/janes-chicago,03/17/14 , 5 ," Jane's is a super cute and quaint restaurant that's perfect for a girls night out session. I've tried a couple of dishes here and my favorite is the Housemade Quinoa Vegetable Garden Burger with sauteed mushrooms. Yea I know what you're thinking - quinoa vegetable burger?? I was surprised myself but for a vegetarian burger, this is hands down the best. Tasty and fresh, no guilt whatsoever and unlike any other burger you've ever eaten. Jane's is also known for their corn chowder but it's not my favorite. It was too milky and the consistency wasn't thick enough for me. For dessert I highly recommend the Apple Oatmeal Crisp and Creme Brulee.I also know that they switch out menu items based on seasons so the desserts may or may not be on the menu when you get there. Also, be sure to call and make a reservation so you don't have to wait. They are quite busy on Fridays and weekends."
fish-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fish-bar-chicago,11/30/13 , 5 ," Fish Bar is a small and beach-like restaurant that specializes in 'fresh' seafood.  They bring some coast-like vibes to the Midwest with their wooden panels, bar stools, hanging canoe, mason jars, and daily specials handwritten on an oversized chalkboard.  I was really intrigued when there was so many raved reviews about how fresh and good the seafood Fish Bar offers.  So I stopped here one night with a friend and shared a couple of items:Clam Chowder:  this is served New England style; cream based chowder with a thinner consistency than other regional styles.  I liked the creaminess, but it was overly salted.  No amount of water helped to tone it down.Lobster Roll:  claimed to have one whole Maine lobster in a roll.  For $22/roll, I didn't expect anything less but miraculous.  This roll definitely didn't disappoint.  The lobster was fresh and perfectly seasoned.  There were also so many pieces of lobster stuffed inside the roll that it kept falling out.Calamari: breaded, deep fried, tossed with banana pepper, jalapeno, and garlic, and topped off with some parmesan cheese and parsley.  I enjoyed the unique pickled component with a tad of spiciness, but the actual calamari was too chewy for my liking.  Also the ratio of calamari to other ingredients in this dish was a joke.  There was five pieces of actual calamari, so not an ideal dish to share.Surf and Turf Burger:  crab with a grass-fed beef patty.  I thought the beef would overwhelm the light taste of the crab, but to my surprise it didn't.  They balanced each ingredient perfectly.Overall, the food was pretty good but does not meet up to the standards of seafood from the coastline.  Also the ratio of price to size is ridiculous; almost $50 for our meal and we weren't full.  The waitress there was nice in the beginning, but later on became a little pushy about ordering more food.  One of my biggest pet peeves is pushy employees.  Ugh...she made my experience there really uncomfortable."
mr-ds-shish-kabobs-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mr-ds-shish-kabobs-chicago,05/02/14 , 5 ," This is a five star steak sandwich here, folks!!! This bad boy had SO much flavor and was so juicy that I kept thinking there was some cheese in there somewhere, but came to find that there wasn't and it didn't even need it!!Mr D's is a complete 'what you see is what you get' kind of place. No smoke and mirrors here, you walk in, sit down, order and you can watch them cooking your food right before your eyes. The place is tiny, the walls are bare, and the customers are all locals, mostly blue collared fellows stopping in on their lunch break. The staff seemed like a father and son operation. I LOVE the exposed kitchen, the meats looks freshly prepared and there was a whole potato sitting right inside the fry chopper, so you know it's the real deal fries.Steak sandwich....First of all, you have to appreciate and enjoy the flank/skirt type steak. It's a bit tougher, just a tad bit chewier at times. But the secret is that it really holds in the flavor of the marinade or seasonings that Mr. D is using. I ordered mine with tomato and onion and the veggies were VERY fresh, well seasoned and enhanced the sandwich no doubt. So did the bread, which was like a french bread bun but not as firm, almost like a burger bun. This was key b/c is allowed the juices to quickly soak up in the bread, which gave it a cheese filled texture.The fries were excellent. Someone else mentioned they tasted like Gene and Judes and I completely agree. However, the fries at Gene and Judes, IMO, get a bit mushy when wrapped up with the dog. The fries here at Mr. D's stay crispy and crunchy as soon as they hit the table.Prices appear to have gone up a bit here. My steak sandwich was $7.15 before tax. But I would pay it in a heartbeat, as I know sit down places with fancy decor and all would charge twice as much for a steak sandwich like this. If you're in the area and want a quick bite, this is definitely a place to consider."
drews-on-halsted-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/drews-on-halsted-chicago,01/06/14 , 5 ," The good: Great menu with a ton of options. Nice relaxed atmosphere with very friendly service. They take reservations and the food was served at a reasonable pace. The food itself was very tasty, our pasta options were great. Portion sizes were pretty good. Great martinis and cocktails too!The bad: For some reason they can't afford Spotify premium...kept hearing the ads in the background. Great music choices, but the ads...Also, the prices are pretty high for what you're asking. $20 for a pasta dish that I got was not necessary.Overall: A great atmosphere and good food, but there are a few things that keep this place from being top-notch. Still, a great option!Atmosphere: 8/10Service: 9/10Food: 8/10"

ajida-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ajida-chicago,01/17/14 , 5 ," Went to lunch here today. Service was off- they brought two of the three skewers I ordered while my friend waited for his ramen. I ate my entire meal when they brought his. They apologized but offered nothing for our trouble. Then we took our bill to the register, already late for work & the flustered girl made us wait while she tried to fix her other mistake. We finally had to demand that she wait in us. Again, nothing offered for our trouble & our waiter knew it was my birthday & after the long waits, nothing. They are new so I feel like they still have some kinks to work out. The food was good and there isn't anything like it in the loop so I will give it another chance and update my review.I had a beef skewer, a shrimp& bacon, a sweet potato, and a crab. I didn't like the fried crab but the other three were good. If you are hungrier, go with the ramen. The skewers are not very filling.F"
horse-thief-hollow-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/horse-thief-hollow-chicago,02/16/14 , 5 ," A brewery restaurant that is child friendly? I'm in! The craft beers here are oh so good. I like ordering the Cuban with sweet potato fries. The grass fed burgers are also tasty. When we came here with friends and their kids, they had a band playing (banjo, fiddle, bass) and the music was so entertaining, the kids were dancing! The children also get a kick of the hug moonshine jar that goes up and down every time the front door opens or closes.I'm definitely coming back."
la-oaxaqueña-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-oaxaque%C3%B1a-chicago-4,11/11/14 , 5 ," I went here an age and a half ago, but then came back recently. Why come back? Best. Frozen. Margarita. Ever. Seriously. Bookmark this place now.  I've peered into the back area and seen the bushels of limes they have on hand. I bet they put one bushel (do limes even come in bushels?!) in EACH MARGARITA. They are so delicious. Also, at $6.00 each, well priced.The food? Authentic! I have only tried the tacos, but I will tell ya, extra stars for the chorizo. It must be homemade and some of the least greasy chorizo I have encountered (except for soy-rizo but that stuff's fake!).Come for the rita's (frozen, original, lime) and stay for the sweet ambiance, service (although to warn you, no one is in any hurry) and delicious tacos."
lulus-hot-dogs-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lulus-hot-dogs-chicago,10/24/14 , 5 ," I've eaten here a couple of times on my lunch break since I work in the neighborhood. Cash only, but an ATM is located inside. Standard sub shop offerings: subs, burgers, hot dogs, fried things of all kinds, milkshakes, etc. First time I had the shrimp basket (great deal for $5), and thought they were really tasty and crispy. Fries are kind of similar to McD's.Second time I had the steak, and would definitely not order it again; my jaw ached from trying to chew through that rubbery mess; even my garbage disposal other half wouldn't eat the rest of it and I ended up throwing it out. Inexpensive, friendly staff, would probably try again sometime."
primebar-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/primebar-chicago-2,03/17/14 , 5 ," Dropped by for a work HH last Friday night; Primebar has huge space but as a result it features pretty poor customer service.  I know because when you have a party of eight seated just a few steps from the bar and you wait 20 minutes to see a server--a server whose first question was 'have you folks been helped yet?'--you know something is up.  There were stretches even after we did get a server where ordering Heinekens would take 15 minutes...even looking around the large dining area, I didn't see a lot of servers walking around, and on a Friday night, that's really inexcusable.  Naturally I'm worried since our firm is moving to a building right next to Primebar next week and I'll have to drink here again!Food was just okay.  The spinach/queso dip was tasty, nothing special; the fish and chips were priced well for the large portion but it isn't at the level of Duke of Perth or the fish in Antique Taco's stellar fish tacos.  The beer selection is quite strong so if you can get a server, you've got good choices, but be prepared for a long wait (this did not change over the course of four hours and two different servers).Like I said, I'm going to have to come back to Primebar so I'll update this review if things get better.  If!!!"
sophies-chicago-9,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sophies-chicago-9,12/24/14 , 5 ," Mother-in-law was in town and wanted to do a special holiday lunch.  We didn't want to even attempt to deal with the madhouse @ the Walnut Room so I decided on Sophia's and we loved it!Located on the top floor of Sak's, it's a bit of a hidden gem and that's okay considering it's a small restaurant. We started off with cocktails. I had the Sophie's Sonnet which was like a mimosa but with a much more refreshing taste. I had the Designer Club with the truffle fires. The club was fresh, crisp & tasty. The fries were incredible! My partner had the lobster roll and also loved it. His mom had the apple & brie grilled cheese which she also enjoyed. They surprised with a 'sweet bites' platter to celebrate my partner and his mother's birthdays. Nice touch, guys!The only 'dings' I would give Sophie's was that staff (and a few customers) seemed a bit pretentious. And that's fine but the manger who walked around was verging on 'snooty'. There was also a table of four girls next to us who ordered glasses of wine but the staff brought out half finished bottles of wine and presented them to the girls. That seemed strange to me because usually restaurants simply bring out the filled glasses. To present half empty bottles that were used for other tables and then fill the glasses at the table just seemed weird.Aside from the snooty manger and the weird wine presentation, Sophia's was a great lunch choice for us and we will definitely be back."

I also like their oversized portions to make you feel stuffed. :D The steak and two eggs I got were hefty, and the steak itself was quite tender and juicy. The coffee was quite hot and fresh. The prune and the slice of orange was a refreshing way to clean out your palate before the grease begins. They even have homemade marmalade for your Greek toast! Service was great, can get quite jam-packed, and parking is available on the surrounding streets (watch out for the street cleaning signs on certain days!).+doughnut holes & Milk Duds for the ladies :P+steak n eggs+prune & orange slices"
vora-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vora-chicago,08/19/14 , 5 ," Get the pork over rice from the Taiwanese market menu.  It was fabulous.On a windy Saturday night, we walked a good 25 minutes from downtown Chicago to Vora, wanting to take a chance on a restaurant that seems to have a little bit of everything that we were craving for: sushi and Chinese food.  Though we were confused by the outside decoration (which suggests an organic salad place), we were further confused by their interior decoration (where's the mandatory Asian decorations, fans, a picture of Great Wall, lanterns, and anything that suggests you've traveled to somewhere else).  Instead you have a clean, modern look that is somewhere between upscale and mid-scale restaurant, and an atmosphere that is comfortable.Our hostess made one mistake, which was to take us to a little 2-person table.  Didn't she know that we looked like starving tigers, wanting to eat the biggest prey?  We asked the store manager (who later identified as the owner) to switch to a bigger table, and thank goodness we did.We targeted at the Taiwanese market menu even though we were talking about sushi the entire 25 min walk.  Mostly because it's nostalgic, but partly it's curiosity.  We ordered the dim sum box, wa guei, oyster noodles and pork over rice.  The owner treated us shaved ice for dessert, so that was also very generous of them.  Overall we absolutely loved the pork over rice.  Coming from DC/Maryland/Virginia area, We thought it was better than any gazillion Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants we've had.  The wa guei was done a little different than what we were traditionally used to, but it was decent.  And the dim sum box was a decent value, where you get to try multiple items on the menu, just so you know what to get next time.Given that their Taiwanese night market menu (and perhaps other parts of their menu) are changing based on customers' feedback (Vora has just opened for about a year), the owner/manager was very receptive to customers' feedback.  So make sure you let them know what you like and don't like.  Do me a favor, and say you like the pork over rice, because I definitely want to get it again next time we're back in Chicago."
county-barbeque-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/county-barbeque-chicago,09/15/14 , 5 ," I have to preference this first by saying I'm not a huge fan of barbecue food. The only place I seem to like so far is Chicago Q, but even then there's only some things I will order.I went here with my mom and sister (huge barbecue fans) and we started off with a few appetizers. I like to try a few weird things when I go out to eat so I figured why not try the bacon and barbecue parfait. Um....ewwww. Tasted like weird baby food covered in barbecue sauce. Totally not a fan of that one. I however, did enjoy the hush puppies. It was an interesting mix with the pork and I liked the lemon aioli dipping sauce. We also got an order of the garlic fries loaded. The jalapenos and chili over the garlic fries was excellent!I wasn't impressed with the entrees we ordered. My sister got the rib tips (way too fatty) and my mom and I shared the BBQ Sampler: Hot Link (probably the best item of the sampler. Nice spicy kick), Chicken (okay), Ribs (way too fatty), Brisket (Is this supposed to be fatty???) LOL.I'm not a fan of barbecue sauce and out of the 3 sauces on the table (House, Mustard, and spicy) my favorite was the house sauce. I think the reason I wasn't a fan is because I want my meat to already be marinated in sauce. I'm not into doing the work myself when I go out and eat.The dessert was also a disappointment. Ordered the Bourbon Banana Bread Pudding. I am a huge fan of bread pudding, so you really got a bring it for me. It was dry and not sweet. The whip cream on top didn't even melt into the bread pudding because of the lack of moisture.If I were to come back it would definitely be for the appetizer and sides. Main courses I could do without. I also have to mention the service because it was great! John was as sweet as can be and did a great job explaining the menu items to us and checking on us throughout the meal."
uptown-pho-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/uptown-pho-chicago,12/27/14 , 5 ," Uptown Pho has decent pho, but it doesn't have the wow factor to go along with the high ratings. We were the only table on a Saturday lunch hour so service was attentive. However, it felt a little awkward at times since there no music playing. The restaurant looks new and clean, nicer than expected from the outside appearance.To start, the egg rolls had a great thin crispy and non-greasy shell though they didn't have any distinguishable flavor. The pho broth was very light, clean with some sweetness to it and a peppery finish. Overall, Uptown Pho is a nice change from the more popular destinations with a slightly different take though it didn't win me over."
dosirak-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dosirak-chicago,11/15/14 , 5 ," Average Korean Fast Food.Dosirak occupies the first floor space of a three flat that is setback for a nice front porch area on a main artery in the Illinois Medical District. Perfect spot for the health professions passerbys and or the UIC students living in the area.The no frills interior was a bit of a downer. Despite the sparse design, I was happy hear another Korean restaurant opened up in the city.As I walked in for an early supper to go order, I was confronted by the owner who happened to be Chinese. Hmmm. His wife was Korean. Ok.Tried their KimChi Stew and Spicy Pork Belly dish. The stew is a common and traditional dish. It was unfortunately subpar. The Pork was good but very oily.This place should be an encouragement to those young entrepreneurs too afraid to try. If Dosirak can make it,..."

No one else was shooting pool, but there was a bunch of guys at the bar, but they all slowly left. We ended up being the only ones there.Place is clean and decent size. Felt very comfortable there. Good location since it's a bit hidden from the busy path and there are metered parking ($3.00/hour).Seems they have tons of drink specials everyday of the week."
azteca-grill-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/azteca-grill-chicago-2,08/26/14 , 5 ," These are some good ass tacos.Came here after a show down the street at the Public House Theater. They've got an impressive selection of tacos, tortas, burritos, quesadillas, and the like. You can order some of the tacos al a carte, but the best ones come in platters of three with rice and beans, including the pescado and the camaron.The food comes out quick and the service is friendly. They've got some great chimachurri sauce and a fire salsa that will definitely bring the heat.I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. But I may just end up ordering the bacon and steak tacos again..."
calumet-fisheries-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/calumet-fisheries-chicago-4,06/23/14 , 5 ," Still on my barbecue bucket list is a trip to Kansas City, where the fine folks smoke anything under the sun. Given my Texas bias, which means brisket sits on the Iron Throne, ribs and sausage are Baratheons-in-waiting, and every thing else are declared usurpers of Westeros, I'm hesitant to think of things like smoked fish as barbecue.To that end, my recent trip to Calumet Fisheries was like a visit from the lord of light, sponsored by Anthony Bourdain. The 'pit' at Calumet looks like a free-standing, ironclad meat locker, but the smoke is legit. It wafts out and hits you like a proper BBQ joint should, and the output that the Calumet pitmasters pull from the smoke is pure gold.First, some logistics. This is not an easy place to get to, as you have to drive far south on 90 or derail the trip off Lakeshore. Calumet is also truly a shack. It's to-go counter service only. On nice days when winter isn't coming or already frozen over, you can eat outside on a grass patch or on the few plastic picnic tables set up. Dogs are allowed outside the shack, and a bring your own soda or red solo cup policy is recommended. Ordering, as mentioned, is counter service. Anything smoked in the trays is ordered on the left, anything fried on the right. Got it? Good.Now, onto the smoked fish. It's wonderfully delicious. The highlight of our self-made trio sampler platter was the sable, otherwise known as black cod. It's succulent, buttery, and amazing, kind of like eating a brisket cookie sliced off the point end, dripping in fat. Our second fish, the pepper salmon, tasted like the flat with a flavorful char and a firm, slightly dry, meat. To each his own. I prefer the buttery, melt in your mouth texture.We ended with smoked shrimp, easy to peel, easy to eat, easy to enjoy. Along for the ride (because as a Texas ex and Louisiana neighbor, I'm a sucker for fried seafood) was a small order of fried oysters, strewn in a Chinese take-out box, piping hot, and also incredibly tasty. Dipping those suckers, and frankly, any of the seafood, in Calumet's hot sauce is a recommend.On that note, if I had but one complaint, it's that Calumet doesn't serve its seafood straight from the smoker. The smoked food isn't hot, but instead cooled and served at chilled temperatures. The pitmaster recommended waiting for room temperature before eating to bring out the flavor. He also provided by wife with ample samples right out the smoker. If my jealousy shows, it's because I was inside, in line, when these shenanigans occurred. Reheating isn't recommended, and so I'm just left wondering what a freshly completed, hot off the presses smoked fish tastes like. I'm guessing it would be in contention for the best smoked meat outside Texas."
habanero-baja-grill-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/habanero-baja-grill-chicago-5,06/05/14 , 5 ," 3.5I was going to go to Chipotle to grab a salad, but my friend suggested we go to Haba Nero. Since I've never been before she didn't have to twist my arm. I had no expectations going in except that the meat was all natural (good thing) and the tacos were supposedly pretty decent....and they were. I'm pretty picky when it comes to taco's, so I can't give it a five star because I have had better for a cheaper price.  For a place in the loop though it's pretty decent.My friend got the 3 chicken taco order and I wanted to try everything, so I mixed it up and got 1 chicken, 1 steak, and 1 shrimp. It's nice that they allow you to mix the taco's. My favorite would have to be the steak. I like the avocado sauce they use on it. What's also nice is this is right by outdoor seating. Everyone and there mother was outside enjoying the beautiful weather and watching the boats go by. Made me feel like I was on vacation than just a lunch break."
the-southern-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-southern-chicago,11/29/14 , 5 ," Street parking is fine north of North avenue but watch out for permit 514 parking only spots. The service was professional and attentive. I like the big glass sliding doors which links the patio to the the indoor dining area. That must be great in the summer time. The lighting was really low key and it made hard to read the menu without the illumination from my IPhone. But we managed and ordered the Hog fries and 2 Hanger steaks (medium rare). The hog fries are like Canadian poutine fries (fries with assorted toppings). It was hearty, heavy and meaty as an appetizer. The hanger steak came with an excellent hollandaise sauce. The steak was a nice portion and not over cooked but could have come out a bit hotter. It seemed like it was room temperature when I had mine. The decor is nice with tables that can seat 8 in the back. They also have a downstairs dining area which was intriguing but we didn't get a chance to see it. It also seems that the restroom needs to catch up with the outside decor. All in all a good experience and we'll come back for the shrimp and grits."
the-dock-at-montrose-beach-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-dock-at-montrose-beach-chicago-2,06/14/11 , 5 ," No shirt, no shoes, no service? No way! You can kick off your sandals and sit here in your thong, if you want. You can even bring your pooch and tie him/her up right next to you-you can do all the no-no's of most street cafes. This is the quintessential beach bar with most tables in the full sun, spacious and accommodating, and nothing surrounds you except the beach and the dunes and a nice view of the north lakefront skyline. And very accessible by driving, biking or walking to the very end of Montrose Ave. The cafe is easy to spot once you hit the harbor.The food and beer menus are both simple and pleasing. You have the standard bar appetizers of chicken tenders, quesadillas, and nachos. There are salads and wraps, sandwiches, burgers and panini. The beer selection is fun with some standards and craft beers like Half Acre and some imports. I had that Polish Ale with way too few vowels in its name. I ordered and chicken panini which was quite tasty because it was dressed with carmelized onions and cheese. It's a little pricey, but not that bad. A burger does run $12.95, so it better be good! My panini with a couple of drafts came to $21.00 sans tip.The service staff they day I went almost out-numbered the guests. They were friendly, and efficient, and maybe a teensy bit too anxious to bus the table, get the check paid. But this is a nice place to linger over a couple of brews after a long lakefront walk or bike ride. I miss the old Waveland Cafe next to the golf course where you could hang out on the patio with a pitcher of beer and pass the lazy summer afternoon. I love that Chicago has preserved so much lakefront with little 'commercial interruption,' but I'm glad, too, we have a couple of free and easy beachfront places to wine and dine with or without the shoes and shirts.Oh, and P.S.: I wish some of you emigre music nerds from California could help them out with the music here. Bob Marley at the beach was fun in 1992 in Costa Rica, but I'm a little sick of it now. Plus 'Don't Worry, be Happy??' And other lame beach oldies.The tunes need major rehab."
uncommon-ground-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/uncommon-ground-chicago,08/03/14 , 5 ," We went here prior to seeing Avenue Q at the Mercury Theater last night.Don't be fooled by the reservation tool online. When I went to make a reservation, the only time available was 4 pm or 10 pm. I called and was able to make a reservation. Not that it was necessary. There were TONS of tables open at 6 pm on a Saturday night. I don't know if it was because it was Lollapalooza so most people weren't hanging out in Lakeview, but it was no problem getting a table.We sat outside which was nice. A strangely perfect temperature for a July evening. Our waitress was very nice and fairly knowledgeable about the drinks. I had the Virtue hard cider which was a very light cider, almost like a white wine. It was delicious.My favorite part of the meal was the cheese curds. They were fantastic. Homemade, delicious, light and served with a cucumber salad. I saved the ginger aioli sauce for my fries, which was perfect.I ordered the mushroom 'ravioli' and it was good. The waiter warned me it was a small portion, but I guess I didn't think it would be that small. It was $20 for 4 'ravioli'. They use vegetable slices to hold them together and pureed cashews for the cheese. It was tasty but for the size and quality, it really should've been a small plate priced closer to $9-$11. Way over priced. I ordered sweet potato fries which were good. But, $8 for a side of sweet potato fries? Ridiculous.The dark chocolate banana bread pudding was good, but really nothing to write home about.It looks like a nice restaurant and the waiter was friendly and attentive. The food was overpriced, but otherwise average. Aside from the cheese curds, food was average."
beat-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/beat-kitchen-chicago,12/19/14 , 5 ," Admittedly, my first visit to Beat Kitchen was for a private party, so my review is related to that.We visited last weekend for a party in the upstairs.  Unlike other parties I've been to at bars where there's mass confusion at the door, this was easy... 'we're here for the party' and then we got a wristband - super!Upstairs, there are bathrooms (nice, so you don't have to go through the bar), coat racks and a nice open space.  There's also a bar.I don't know exactly how the party worked in terms of food/drinks, but the setup was great - food along one wall in an open space and then some high and low tables (but still plenty of room to walk) in the front area.  The bar also had seats and a very friendly bartender who was busy since the party was crowded but didn't seem stressed out.I think the space was pretty and it had a good layout with windows to give some light and view outside but plenty of space to walk around and chat.Bathrooms were clean and easily accessible.Very friendly staff really made it as well.Definitely a great spot for a party!!!"
blackies-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blackies-chicago-4,12/06/14 , 5 ," Blackie's was fine. It is a neighborhood bar that's been around for a long time. Since it is right by my daughter's apartment, we met there.It's got that neighborhood bar feel. I have to agree with some of the comments made here about service. It was 6ish on a Saturday evening, and they were not crowded at all. There were, perhaps, four tables with people at them and one person sitting at the bar. Getting the server's attention should have been easy, but no.The food was actually pretty good. I had their fully loaded burger - it came out well done when I'd ordered medium. But, the meat was well seasoned and juicy, so the fact that it was overcooked was not so noticeable. It comes with pickles, sauteed onions, mixed green lettuce and tomato. I skipped the cheese. The fries were fresh, hand cut and were very good.I've wanted to try Blackies for a while, and it was a fair experience. With all of the new options popping up in the gentrifying South Loop, they may have to start to work on their service to survive.Oh, make sure you stop into their restrooms. While they are small/cramped, they have interesting posters on the walls and ceilings. I understand that they have similar posters in the ladies restroom too, but they cater to the sexes."
idof-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/idof-chicago,10/10/14 , 5 ," I haven't had much here, so maybe this review isn't really fair, but what the hell. I had the baba ghouj and was really underwhelmed. It was more of a paste than the stringy eggplant that normally makes up the dish. To top it off, the pita just wasn't right. I don't know how to explain the super mediocre/subpar taste. It just wasn't great."

first-slice-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/first-slice-chicago-4,03/26/13 , 5 ," Super cool little pie and sandwich place in Albany Park.  Sure it's even better in the summer with their outdoor patio right next the Brown Linen train. Cozy and esp fun for the kiddos. All sandwiches look good but we tried the Mediterranean quiche and coffee braised beef burrito.  Both exceptional. Plus the salad is so simple yet flavorful (anything with arugula is a winner in my book).  Then had a slice of the key-lime pie and was tasty as heck too.  Also have a nice cup of freshly brewed coffee with soy milk.This is a chain of cafes that are passionate about cooking good food but also help busy families serve good meals at home (they offer a meal plan for purchase) and help fight hunger for those in need.  You can learn more at any of their locations and on their website -firstslice.org.If you're in the neighborhood for breakfast lunch or dinner, this is a good pick."
slims-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/slims-chicago,06/27/14 , 5 ," Finally.When I travel to other cities, I like to sample the indigenous junk cuisine in addition to higher-end and more exotic fare.  In Chicago, of course, junk cuisine largely means deep-dish pizza, Chicago dogs, and Italian beef sandwiches.  In several past visits, I've been able to appreciate the deep-dish, but have been perplexed by the mediocrity of the dogs and Italian beef at a couple of chain-ish spots where we've sampled them.Slim's, though, goes a long way toward justifying the Chicago-dog and Italian-beef hype.  For the first time in my experience, the Chicago dog toppings seemed to meld harmoniously.  The dog itself tasted high-quality.  The Italian beef and its juices had more depth of flavor than you'd expect in a five-buck sandwich.  Curly fries were tasty, too.Slim's has a bare-bones, almost snack-bar kind of feel.  Which is just fine for this kind of fare.  Plus the place looked clean and sharp, and the service was snappy."
vincent-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vincent-restaurant-chicago,07/18/11 , 5 ," Came here with a few friends for Yelp Eats. My first encounter with Dutch cuisine and pleasantly surprised. Between the 4 of us, we ordered almost everything on the Yelp Eats menu, starting with the Dutch mustard soup and fried meatballs. The Soup was interesting, but the meatballs stole the show, crispy on the outside, soft & juicy on the inside. With the mustard sauce it didn't feel greasy at all. We were also served with warm, crispy bread with butter and a clove of roasted garlic, yum!For entree we had 3 orders of the mussels, and one of us was adventurous enough to order the mashed potatoes and sausage. The plump, fresh mussels came in this flavorful broth with beer, star anise, carrots, celery, onions and other herbs. We couldn't stop dunking our bread in the broth. Each mussel order came with a giant order of fries with garlic aioli. The aioli was nice, but the fries were a bit greasy. The sausage was nice and flavorful too, with a dollop of grainy mustard.The evening ended on a high note with superb desserts: panna cotta with blueberry compote and chocolate cake with peanut butter mousse. The panna cotta had a rich creamy texture and was very refreshing. The chocolate cake was moist and chocolaty, simply to-die-for. Peanut butter mousse had a hint of salt in it so it prevented the dessert from being over-sweet.It was overall an awesome meal, and at 50% off, a superb deal. However, the AC was rather weak and it was a steamy night out,  hence the 1 star deduction. But I'd be happy to return when the weather's cooler!"

taco-joint-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/taco-joint-chicago-3,12/17/14 , 5 ," I've been to Taco Joint a number of times now and I suppose that's all you really need to know to judge my opinion of Taco Joint.Pretty much every taco is $3, a couple are $3.5 but those are generally worth the extra 50 cents in my opinion as they're generally the daily special taco. 3 tacos will do the trick, so your total comes out to about $10 generally which for a meal in river north is dirt cheap. Love that.They change up the tacos every now and then - got rid of a fish taco I loved - but I'm especially a fan of the machaca and al pastor tacos. Both with plenty of meat and great flavor. No overpowering onion or slaw or queso, just great meat and great flavor.I wouldn't recommend the guac actually. It's a pretty tiny portion and fairly average in my opinion.You're better off spending some money to split a bottle of margaritas with friends. You'll probably get 6 drinks out of a $32-38 bottle and the margarita is good. I always get a bottle of margaritas when I'm there.I've gone back a number of times, clearly I'm going to recommend you all try out Taco Joint."

I went back after work and ordered a medium thin, half canadian bacon and a breaded steak.After 15 minutes they finally tell me they are out of steak? Huh, spluh, bluh? Now this is a FRIDAY at 4:45pm, your weekend is just starting and NO STEAK? Anyway, I ordered a beef sammy.This time around, their canadian bacon was DEF' LOWER QUALITY. No smokiness at all..in fact, it tasted like plain old ham. The cheese was def' on the cheaper side - nowhere near as quality tasting as Vince's just a few more blocks up. The crust was dry as heck and kinda disintigrated in my mouth..not in a good crispy way either.Their beef sammy was pretty decent.Probably wont be going back again as I like to get my sammies from the same place I get my pie and Ciprianis isnt it any longer."

This place is really modern and stylish. The decor is nice and the vibe was also great.We ordered a flight of cheese and had a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. The cheese was absolutely amazing! I was hoping for a few pieces of apples with the cheese but it wasn't a big deal. I expected their menu to have a flight of wine we could taste since the place is called 'Bread and Wine' but nope, no flight of wine. Their menu is also very very thin. They did not have a good selection of food but i guess its a very small neighborhood restaurant that is still trying to make s name for themselvesI had the gnooci but it was not pasta. I always thought it was pasta but i got six square pieces of fried things. I was really disappointed because i am pretty sure that it wasn't gnocci. Plus the 'gnocci' wasn't even good. Before i even ordered this 'gnocci' i asked the waiter what it was and he explained as if it was pasta.Now the really disappointing thing is that when we walked in (a tall slim woman) well she obviously works there gave a dirty looks. We asked to sit in the corner because, god damn that's where we wanted to sit. The place wasn't packed so yes that was our table of choice. She rolled her eyes and gave us attitude seating us. No do not roll your eyes. If the place was crazy busy then yes we would have understood but it was slowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!I really wanted to like this place but nope"
ikram-cafe-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ikram-cafe-chicago-2,07/26/14 , 5 ," First off, how to get here:1. Get on your phone and get your GPS going2. Look for a red building that looks like a very fancy clothing store3. Go inside the store, walk your girlfriend/fiance/wife quickly by all the very-nice-yet-super-expensive stuff, up the stairs past what appears to be an art gallery entrance, and you'll find this placeOnce you arrive, you'll find a cool little lunch spot that may seem a bit stuffy at first on appearance (because it's nicely decorated - i'm not an art expert but it's probably modern or contemporary or something like that) but is quickly dispelled by friendly and welcoming service.My wife and I both had the bison burger, which was perfectly cooked but maybe a notch too juicy. Good problem to have. Some random complementary small plates, like fresh grilled shishito peppers, were dropped off which was a nice touch. The bottle of wine we had matched perfectly with everything we ate, and the dessert, which was a small portion of cherry sorbet, was unexpectedly mind-blowing. The Chef was out talking to some other patrons and we had a chance to thank him while we were walking out.Awesome meal on a great summer day in Chicago. Highly recommend Ikram Cafe and appreciate the good service from Nathan. Note: Not sure of the hours, but I'm pretty sure they were the same as the store. They don't serve dinner."
meatheads-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/meatheads-chicago,07/12/14 , 5 ," Ordered a cheeseburger with avocado, jalapeño, and giardiniera on it.  Out of all the restaurants that I have ever been to, Meatheads is the most generous with avocado portions.  Meatheads slathered on at least 4 thick slices of avocado- and that made my cheeseburger a 9 out of 10 (one cannot order a hamburger rare at this location.)The french fry portions are large, they have jalapeño-ketchup, and hot sauce.  These additions help the french fries immensely.  Its not that the french fries are bad, but they do need a little nudge in the right direction.  Recommended: cheeseburger with many toppings."

I'll have to admit the dimly lit fourth floor is nothing like I've ever seen before. Nice comfy couches, private rooms with Buddha statues, and an awesome bartender that help us with our selfies and  really took care of me in my girl tonight. :) We had the pineapple upside down and keylime martini. Both as delicious as the dessert.Not exactly what we were planning on doing tonight and not the typical crowd we like, but still good times were had :)"

There is always an artist of some sort around, either a musical performer, or a painter/drawer to exhibit his/her work. I've been to three Clandestino events and was impressed that Efrain knew my name! How awesome. He is such a great guy and an outstanding chef. I think its great he's creating a non-profit organization for kids who are interested in the culinary industry. The locations to these events are never disclosed until 1-2 days before the actual date of the event. The meals are usually $75-$80 but include at least 5 courses if not more. You meet a lot of interesting and great people too! And if you arent enjoying the conversation, then at least you'll enjoy the food or entertainment. I've always had a great time.

He said it was different or it tasted like it was going bad.Breaded Steak - This was okay. Breaded steak was tender, but even though the bread was soft, part of it was cold.

We picked it because we were about to get our drink on and Yelp said it was nearby good eatin'. Thankfully, Yelp didn't lie.Upon first glance, the place looks really small, but it's not. There's the front, most obvious area with about 10 tables, the Moroccan room off to the side and another dining area toward the back of the place. Our server (maybe an owner) was delightful. He seated us, offered advice on the menu, answered questions and was attentive without being overbearing.We were welcomed to our table with a basket of warm pita, some spicy red sauce and a container of olives. I'm not an olive fan, but the manfriend raved about them. Both of us devoured the basket, nearly forgetting about the Briwats we ordered. The Briwats, a phyllo dough of vermicelli and shrimp with lemon over the top were delicious too; not a huge portion, but appropriate for the $5 price tag.For our mains, he got the lamb Casablanca and I the tilapia tagine. Each dish came in a stoneware pot; a hearty mix of our protein and veggies. He raved about his and we both agreed mine was pretty fantastic as well. The generously portioned tilapia was moist and flavorful and served over a bed of thinly sliced carrots and potatoes.

Luckily, my Yelp app suggested I go here to this hidden gem.Their specialty is goat, goat, and well more goat! We ordered a goat taco, a beef taco and goat face/head taco. The beef was okay,  but the goat and goat head was just to die for! No gamey taste, not dry at all and full of flavor. I do admit the goat head was my fav...so tender  that it just melts in your mouth. The tacos are pretty big and three is enough for one person.They also give you a bowl of pickled spicy onions along with limes. Warning these little pickled spiced onions pack a good amount of heat! Also they're addicting too...i wonder if they sell it  by its self?The menu also gives you the option for goat stew, consume, and of course buying just the goat meat by the pound.

This particular day I was craving a classic order of chicken + pita. A quarter chicken white meat (breast and wing) to be exact. For $6.25, you get chicken, grilled pita bread, choice of side dish and fountain drink. Unfortunately, only Pepsi here, but I suffered a little bit in the name of awesome chicken. Loved the green beans too-- a bit of sea salt, perhaps some olive oil and maybe sesame? I think I tasted a subtle Asian influence.

Not I.  Since my cousin checked it out recently and was exalting praises, I finally got around to trying them.  A staple of their business is being open 24 hours to feed the working public.  So the other late night on a drive back from Indiana, I decided to quick stop for a sandwich and a quarter pound of something nicely fried.  I inquired with the counter guy as to where the shrimp came from.  Can you believe that this guy didn't know.  He couldn't tell me what kind of shrimp they offered nor from which waters.  This is information any clerk, cook, etc in a seafood shop should know.Their fish sandwich was huge, a big bun with a huge plank of fried fish covered with chopped lettuce, a slice of tomato and American cheese.  The sandwich was served without sauce.  I was dismayed when given packets of restaurant grade stuff purchased from a supply store.  A chef (buddy) once told me, tartar sauce is the easiest stuff to prepare.  Any purveyor of prepared foods can manage to make their own.  Perhaps some traditions have changed over the years.  Per a few of their reviews there are some which look to be from loyal repeat customers.  Some have mentioned a taste difference in the quality of the breading.  I thought the shrimp was perfectly fried.  Per the web it's stated that the oil is changed about three times daily to ensure freshness.  While it was fresh the breading on the shrimp was hella thick.  After a few bites, I began removing the breading and eating the shrimp naked.  I didn't find the coating to be very tasteful nor did I find the reheating of the shrimp (a day later) to be tasty.  For two guys, three sandwiches ($4.95/each) & a 1/2 pound shrimp ($7.25) with tax just under $25 dollars.I might be in the minority here but for all the fried fish, shrimp and more that I've had nationwide, this was the most generic in taste.  With all the food shows on the television and requests of foodies for home made everything, I'm surprised to still see businesses offering restaurant grade stuff over made in house.  I kind of like the Lawrence Fisheries Hot sauce but looking at that packet with several mentions of complex ingredients like citric acid, preservatives and modified food starch amongst other ingredients.. I'm not a fan. P.s. I've had bigger gulf shrimp elsewhere.  In this instance I teeter between ratings.. a 2.5 star would be best.P.s.s During this visit we found a 'boneyard' in the parking lot.  Composed of shrimp tails and chicken wing bones.  They should have signs out there to indicate to motorists to clean up after themselves.  Perhaps I should have tried the chicken."
wilde-bar-and-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wilde-bar-and-restaurant-chicago,10/02/14 , 5 ," Don't let the reviews fool you, this is an Irish bar. That being said, it's one of the better ones, I came when they had decked it out for Christmas and it's very large. They have a cool area a little further back with books on the wall and quotes from Oscar Wilde all over the place in photograph frames.The drinks are relatively good overall, I had an elderberry cocktail and M had the beer. Pretty extensive beer menu. The food is better than the average bar, good options are the Mac and cheese, which is seriously the best I've had, and the creole shrimps, which were on special that day. We also tried the bison burger, but I wasn't a big fan, I'll stick to good old steak. Staff is very friendly and provide good service, without climbing all over you. Great option for a low key night but be warned, this place can get loud on the weekends"
yum-dum-truck-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yum-dum-truck-chicago,06/12/14 , 5 ," I was so happy to run into the Yum Dum Truck at the NOSH's Lunch Market today! It's a food truck that makes regular stops at NOSH events and seems to have quite a following judging by the line on the plaza. Words cannot begin to describe the deliciousness that I found at Yum Dum. I went for the $10 lunch and got a great amount of high quality food for $10. I would recommend the pork belly and Korean chicken baowiches with the kimcheesy rice balls on the side. The baowiches are a good size and chock full of sweet and spicy flavors. I don't know if I have ever had anything so delicious as the kimcheesy rice balls. They are balls of sticky rice, smothered in Siracha and cheese, then lightly deep-fried. Pure heaven. I want one of the funny tanks emblazoned with 'Get Sum' on the back. Maybe if I order enough $10 lunches they'll give me one? I am certainly up for the challenge!I would encourage anyone and everyone looking to escape their lunch rut to get out to NOSH on the Plaza. Every Thursday and Friday from 11am-2pm a group of food trucks/vendors get together and serve delicious and well priced food at this beautifully sunny plaza. There are even guest DJs spinning during your lunch hour! Make sure to visit Yum Dum first though, fittingly they have the first spot on the plaza too. I know I will be back to try the dumplings and sesame noodles."

I like to stop by here with a few friends to grab some drinks and catch up. If you come here, you must get the Chili Cheese Tots. This is a tater tot explosion!! I have also tried the Captain's Philly and it was really good as well. The drinks here are good and reasonably priced. Service is friendly and I love coming here to relax."
cafe-el-tapatio-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-el-tapatio-chicago-4,06/04/14 , 5 ," My husband and I have eyed this spot for a long time. We love the vintage lighted restaurant sign and the patio always looks like a nice place to have a drink on a hot day.We finally got our chance to dine in and really enjoyed our dinner there. It was the 3 of us and although they are kind of family friendly (lots of highchairs available), the space is kind of tight so I am glad that we went during early dinner hours so it wasn't that crowded and we were seated immediately.My husband and I split the beef and chicken fajitas and enchiladas.  Both were really good, although I enjoyed the fajitas a bit more--the meats were tender and flavorful and the peppers and onions were also cooked just right and not super soggy or mushy. The corn tortillas were fresh and the guacamole was well-made and creamy too. I also tried sips of his Michelada--it was a HUGE serving--but delicious and refreshing.They didn't have a kids menu but I asked if their quesadilla could be made with just cheese (their q's have cheese, chicken and peppers).  Our server said it wouldn't be a  problem and would I like a small serving of rice and beans for the kiddo. How perfect was that? They have horchata too so the kid got one of his favorite drinks as well.Super service, fresh food. Next time we're patio bound!"
takos-koreanos-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/takos-koreanos-chicago-4,12/13/14 , 5 ," While passing through Andersonville on my way to the Argyle area to sample some Vietnamese pho, I saw taKO's KOreanos and though that Mexican-Asian was a rather different fusion combination. I shall conclude that it is a very, very good combination on the palate.Green tea. Beef barba Korean fries. Spicy chicken taco. Honey chili taco. Potato salad. Kimchi fried rice.The beef barba Korean fries reminded me of street food. The pulled beef had been seasoned such that it popped with enough sweetness to keep from biting the back of the tongue. Topped with sauteed onions, cheddar cheese, sour cream, and chives, the concept of chili cheese fries has been relegated to kids food.Having grown up eating very spicy food, the spicy chicken taco was an instant favourite. Not thinking that the honey chili shrimp would be as good, I was a bit shocked that I couldn't decide whether I liked the spicy chicken taco more or the honey chili taco. The accompanying potato salad didn't taste like fast food or 'refrigerator section' potato salad. The kimchi fried rice was reminiscent of bibimbap and that was a hit.taKO's KOreanos has a cash-only policy. The good thing is the prices aren't so extreme that you need a credit card. Great service and outstanding food, I'm a fan, for sure."
johnnys-beef-and-gyros-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/johnnys-beef-and-gyros-chicago-2,12/04/13 , 5 ," Great burger, fries, and drink combo for $7! Quality comparable to 5 Guys, although they don't give you such a ridiculously large serving of fries. Menu includes a selection of salads as well as typical sandwiches. Staff are friendly and accommodating. Dining area is clean and pleasant with background music that stays in the background."
new-england-seafood-company-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/new-england-seafood-company-chicago,07/20/14 , 5 ," If you are lost, don't worry, the smell of seafood drifts down Lincoln and will draw you in to New England Seafood Company!Whoa, I am not sure it's feasible possible to squeeze any more lobster in to their lobster roll without the use of duct tape to keep in in ($17.95) . The grilled bun was delicious and everything was complemented by the drawn butter and lemon wedge. I am the exact opposite of a lobster roll connoisseur, so while NESC's lobster roll was probably technically perfect, I prefer Fish Bar's with a little added herb butter and pizzazz. The homemade chips were nothing special in my opinion but my companion liked them, so I think its a personal thing.The table next to us got 2 of the fist tacos ($3.95) and they were really big and looked delicious. A bit more bang for your buck, I think I would try those next time!!They have a very crisp minimalist interior dinning room as well as a three table patio on Lincoln Avenue which is surprisingly quite quiet."

Definitely recommend this place for a cold day. Their lunch looks like a good deal, especially."
city-cafe-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-cafe-chicago-2,12/10/14 , 5 ," Cheap prices, great menu, and wide selection. It's a great place to grab some breakfast when in the area and time permits. As everyone mentions, service is amazing and the whole staff are very friendly.I ordered the corned beef hash. Can't say much about it. It was just your typical corned beef hash that you get from a breakfast spot. Small dices of potatoes with some corned beef running through it.Overall I would say a great place to get some breakfast but food is just what you would expect of it. Decent, cheap and worth it."
little-vietnam-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-vietnam-chicago,12/24/14 , 5 ," Excellent stuff! Best vegetarian tofu spring rolls I've ever had.The cucumber water they bring to the table is nice and refreshing to start.As I said above, the Veggie Spring Rolls, (the cold sort wrapped in a white rice wrapper), arrived with an excellent peanut sauce for dipping, and they were so well wrapped they didn't fall apart like others I've had, well done!We also had the Vietnamese Fried Egg Rolls, (my automatic backup order in case the veggie spring rolls are no good.) Turns out I didn't really need them, but they were good nonetheless!My friends ordered the The Vietnamese Egg/Veggie Crepe (Omelet?) It looked very tasty, quite large, and filled with veggies as well.Before now, I'd never had Pho. I had heard about it, and the different styles/types, and how the broth is the most important aspect of it and how each place does it differently, etc. etc. I can honestly say - I'm a fan!The huge bowl of Round Steak Pho was filled with skinny noodles and sliced steak. The broth was very tasty, and the sprouts, jalapenos, mint, and other veggies/herbs on the shared plate at the table were excellent additions to it, including the Sriracha sauce. (A must-have in my opinion.)My friends ordered the Chicken Pho and Vegetarian Tofu Pho. By all reports, these were also very good.Lastly, I ordered an iced Vietnamese Coffee. My oh my! YUM.And we were brought out a fresh sliced orange for dessert. Perfect!The location boasts very popular affordable sandwiches, and being near Dice Dojo, I was happy to see that a group of diners were playing a board game at their table when we arrived.The space is very clean, the owners are very nice folks, and there are enough tables to go around. (There is also TV, if you're in to that sort of thing.)Oh, and it's BYOB! So don't forget to bring your favorite libation!Cheers! Maybe I'll see you there sometime. :-)"
horizon-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/horizon-cafe-chicago,09/16/14 , 5 ," Great neighborhood place for a bite to eat. I visit once or twice a month as I live down the street. They serve breakfast,  lunch and dinner. However,  They are probably more known for their breakfasts.Breakfast options are great. I've had the omelettes,  skillets, and benedicts. I like all three so I change up when I visit. Service is fantastic and quick! Sundays tend to get pretty busy but no extraordinary wait times.I've ordered take-out a few times for dinner and have been satisfied with my choices. Online ordering makes for a quick and easy dinner option."
reno-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/reno-chicago,12/04/14 , 5 ," Ordered the garlic focaccia for appetizers and hog for dinner. The app is actually a pizza. So we ordered 2 pizzas for 2 people. Oh well. We were hungry. And drunk. Garlic focaccia was amazing. Loved it. Hog was a little too spicy for me, which wasn't really advertised. I would have been fine with just the app. The portion was huge. Not a bad place for cheap pizza and beer night."
old-town-social-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/old-town-social-chicago,09/09/13 , 5 ," After visiting Old Town Social a couple of weeks ago, we had dinner to check out additional items on the menu that caught our attention last time. Again, service was excellent all the way around. The manager, Matt, stopped by to say 'hello' and chatted with us for a bit. I had the Noble Bee, a very tasty and sweet cocktail. My boyfriend and I shared the Salmon Rillette appetizer, which was a nicely done salmon pate. He had the chopped salad and I had one of each of the tacos. My favorites were the fish and shrimp tacos. We ended the meal with the featured dessert, the warm sugar doughnuts with marscapone sauce. Yummy!Our next trip will be soon, and we will be checking out the brunch menu. We had dinner inside this time, and noticed all of the flat screen TVs. Matt told us that Saturdays feature college football games (no particular team or conference affiliation). This seems like a great place to watch a game and get some good eats and drinks!"
red-door-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-door-chicago,07/23/14 , 5 ," On my first attempt at the Red Door, I tried to go with a friend around 3 p.m. on a Friday afternoon. They do not open until 5 p.m. on weekdays. So keep that in mind if you are trying to start your weekend early like I was.My next visit was to try their brunch. We sat on the patio, which was a great oasis from the city. Communal seating at long picnic tables and the patio is dog friendly. I don't have a dog but I enjoyed playing with the little guy under our table who was with another group.The bottomless mimosas are not on the menu but just ask and, for just $11, there is no end to your mimosa supply until you say when. I recommend having NOTHING else to do for the rest of the day if you choose this option though.The food was wonderful. I had the bacon and eggs with roasted tomato and my friend and I split a 'side' of pancakes, which were two huge fluffy pancakes. My friend got the steak and eggs, which come with kimchi. She loved it.The food was so good that when another friend wanted to do brunch the next day, I went back for round two. I did not do bottomless mimosas this time. This time I ordered the brioche French toast with peaches. The best French toast I have ever had!The wait staff is super nice and know the menu well.Couple of down sides to keep in mind. 1. Although I loved my server, the service was on the slow side on both visits. 2. On my second visit, they were literally out of almost everything on the menu. She had to take a pen and mark up on the menu which few items they still had available. And I totally lucked out with the very last order of French toast."
tacos-garcia-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-garcia-chicago,09/22/14 , 5 , Ehh not to impressed with their food. I ordered tacos and they were very bland and their tortillas BLAND! I think the tortilla makes the Tacos! My server two thumbs down. I came in here on a slow night.I was the only one in the restaurant and she acted like I was bothering her. If you look that bothered and annoyed you should quit! Take your ass home or don't work in the service industry!!!I won't waste my money and return to this place.
glenns-diner-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/glenns-diner-chicago,05/04/14 , 5 ," Just a quick update. I've been coming here for the last five years and I think year after year it gets even better.  My most recent visit, I had Artic Char which was pan seared to perfection in a spicy diablo shrimp sauce.  The sauce didn't keep the flavor of the Char from coming through, it was moist and tender.  Unbelievable!Every time I come here I try something different on the menu. I have not been disappointed yet. So this year I added a star for total consistency!"

(gorgeous).*works harder in life*Can I justify spending $300 on some fabric with buttons?? sadly not today. good bye beautiful shirt!Pros:-Excellent service- everyone was so friendly, responsive, helpful and it definitely had an air of high quality service.-Loved how fast items were removed or arranged onto our table and how fast the waters were filled.-Our waiter even commented on the 'wait time' of the salad which I definitely did not think was that long.-Food was delicious- I had the orange mousse chicken salad which was amazing and the sister had crab salad which had avo- yummy!-Dessert was great- sister had the pumpkin creme brulee and I had NM cookies that was presented in a NM box with recipe card (so cute!)-They have the most adorable after lunch mints that come tucked into NM envelopes post lunch with the bill.Cons:-Pricey for lunch- our meal was $60 w/o drinks.Everything else was decent- will likely return if I'm ever in the area or in the mood for that chicken salad.THANK YOU SISTER FOR LUNCH!!!"
brasa-roja-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brasa-roja-chicago-3,10/27/14 , 5 ," Starting to wonder about the reviewers in this neighborhood. Went to this restaurant based on the rave reviews.  The food was ok. The service was inattentive.  The fruit flies we had to keep swatting away, we're obnoxious. I witnessed a server dumping used salsa from other customers into a clean bowl and putting it back in fridge for re-use. We asked if they had tortillas and were presented with a pack that was microwaved and ripped to shreds when we tried to separate."
trattoria-ultimo-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trattoria-ultimo-chicago,01/15/14 , 5 ," Between freezing my ass off, them running out of things we ordered (and not telling us until several minutes later), the subpar food, and the fact that's it's cash only, I'm likely to not return to Trattoria Ultimo.To start off, we were seated at a four-top right near the door, so whenever anyone came or went, a big gust of wind would blow in and completely overwhelm me (and not in a good way). It's hard to enjoy a nice dinner (no matter how good the food) when you're shivering.Subzero conditions aside, the food just didn't do it for me. I started with a hearts of palm salad and that was the best part of the meal. It was fresh, lightly dressed, and came with some chopped asparagus. I did think the price tag of $12 was a bit steep though. Someone else at our table ordered one of the appetizer specials, and when it was brought out, they made a substitution in one of the major components of the dish without mentioning it until it was served. We also shared the tuna carpaccio, which tasted fine, if sloppily presented; the tuna looked like it was cut with a pair of very dull scissors.I should know better than to order mushroom risotto at most restaurants, as I'm usually disappointed, but there was nothing else on the menu that appealed to me. My expectations were rather low, and I still thought it was pretty terrible. Risotto should be creamy and served in a shallow bowl, not heaped in a big mound on a plate. And the promised truffle oil? Undetectable.Others had salmon (which was settled on after being told they were out of the grouper they initially ordered) and they thought it was 'fine, ' but not remarkable.Desserts were a flourless chocolate cake, again nothing special, as well as some kind of mascarpone cream in a cup with crumbled biscotti. The texture of the cream reminded me of phlegm. So unappealing.Service is harried as there seems to be a very small staff doing everything. It's byob, and corkage is $5. Cash only, and there's an ATM in the back of the restaurant.Skip it."
frasca-pizzeria-and-wine-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/frasca-pizzeria-and-wine-bar-chicago,11/26/14 , 5 , The pizza had no cheese whatsoever... See the picture I posted. If I order pizza that says it has mozzarella on I'm assuming it's more than 1 shred. Not to mention no one else's pizza was like that !! The Capone was a tad salty. Service was very good. Prices are very fair. Increase the cheese factor and I'll be back!
cohiba-cuban-cuisine-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cohiba-cuban-cuisine-chicago,07/05/14 , 5 ," Overall: A great Cuban option in East Lakeview.

Clean atmosphere with good music. Again, the food is fantastic. Great portions. Left stuffed. Prices are fair.The bad: The upstairs was fine, but the downstairs area was very cold. The green plantains were too dry for my taste. Not much else is bad!Atmosphere: 9/10Service: 9/10Food: 9/10"
derby-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/derby-chicago,10/26/14 , 5 ," Here we go, round 2. Went in with a friend for brunch this morning with the intention of updating this review. Last time was a series of unfortunate events and I'm glad I decided to come back for another try because this was a world of a difference! Seriously from a 1 star to a 5 star... Can't beat an experience like that! Our server, Amanda, was wonderful and gave us suggestions as well as plenty of time to decide. Finally I settled on the southern breakfast wrap. It came out super fast which is always a plus. & then what's even better was that it was AMAZING! Perfect mix of lunch food & breakfast food just perfect for brunch. The breakfast potatoes were great, and the wrap itself was super good. It was so big I couldn't finish it! I'm sad I didn't box it up to go because I was craving it later in the day...It wasn't that busy at 11:30 inside but when we left the patio had quite a few people. All in all I'm glad I returned and I will be back again and again as long as this quality of service and food stays consistent!"
leghorn-chicken-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/leghorn-chicken-chicago,06/26/14 , 5 ," If you're going to be a chicken sandwich shop, you're inevitably going to get compared to Chick-Fil-A. The tl;dr version of this review? I'd rather Eat Mor Chikin.Leghorn's sandwiches are fine. The Nashville Hot is too hot and not flavorful enough; the pickle brined is good but understated. The thigh is retrograde cool, a whole piece of chicken cooked well, reminding me of Chinatown trips to get Taiwanese pork chop rice (made with chicken if you go to a place extra special). The breast is closer to Chick-Fil-A taste, and probably healthier for you if you believe the FDA propaganda to eat more white meat. The biscuit optionality is appealing but again falls short of the southern standard.It sounds like an unfair bash, and all-in-all, Leghorn's sandwiches are pretty good. The massive sauce varietal is Chick-Fil-A worthy, but charging a quarter per sauce is marginal cost that just dissatisfies the consumer. The pickles are really good, though."
smashburger-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/smashburger-chicago-2,12/22/14 , 5 ," Went out for lunch with my mother on her recommendation. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg, smash sauce, grilled mushrooms, as well as the traditional lettuce ketchup mayo etc. I thought the burger was well flavored and balanced, with their special sauce adding some extra flavors that the other ingredients couldn't contribute. The yolk of the fried egg was broken and a little more cooked than i would have preferred (i usually prefer them sunny side up). Overall I felt the burger was better than average but not mind blowingly amazing.I got their special smash fries (cooked in rosemary oil) on my mothers recommendation but retrospectively would have preferred the regular fries. The fries themselves were fresh, golden in color, and lightly salted (I felt really good quality I just didn't like the oil seasoning).My mother got a vanilla milkshake which was creamy and flavorful, achieving a good balance between liquidy and chunky.This place mostly gets 4 stars because I thought the service was supererogatory for a fast food type of burger place. Our server was really friendly and helpful, checking in with us to make sure everything was ok and offering to clean our dishes/plates afterwards.OVERALL: exceptional service at a fast food burger joint with above average food that is reasonably priced."
trike-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trike-chicago-3,11/09/14 , 5 , Got the cruncy spicy tuna maki. Very good...I only had that and it seemed really fresh. The place was clean and the service was good. The water is infused with cucumbers. It tastes nice.I liked that they were playing Britney Spears and N'Sync randomly haha. Really added to the atmosphere. Cool place! Would definitely try their other foods.
rockwells-neighborhood-grill-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rockwells-neighborhood-grill-chicago-2,06/09/09 , 5 ," Sadly enough, I must say that my overall experience was mediocre---3 stars for ya Rockwell's.  I was really hoping for better since I love the location being so close to the adorable ground-level Rockwell El stop.  Rockwell's is one of maybe 3 restaurants in the radius of 3 blocks or so.  This is probably why it has tons of advertisements from the surrounding Manor and is swamped with families and children screaming from every corner of the room, ay!  Thank goodness Yelp reviewing doesn't require good listening skills.I guess Rockwell's could be considered a 'gastropub' but the food wasn't all that stellar.  I tried the Louisiana Eggrolls as all the Yelpers recommended.  They were homemade egg rolls (just like a Chinese joint but Tex-Mex style) stuffed with a mix of andouille sausage, jack cheddar cheese, chicken chunks, onions and maybe two other ingredients.  With the accompanying chipotle ranch dressing I will admit they were fairly yummy.  For those sensitive palates, it is a tad spicy but definitely do-able.I will give RWs a thumbs up for offering a Wheat/Hopps-free beer but too bad practically 75% of the menu includes wheat products (lots-o-'wiches).  I had the Chicken Breast Sandwich and my partner had the French Dip.  Both were just average and if it weren't for the homemade french fries, I could have gotten the same thing at Portillos for cheaper.  They do give you a choice of sides like a good sized side salad (get the dijon vinnagrette), homemade pasta salad, and a black bean & corn salad.A note to the owners, the decor is primarily old framed images that have no thematic connection and cover the entire wall.  Please add a little more something...please."

We'll we were hungry and all the restaurants closed way too early so we decided to stop at this place before we went out dancing.A football game was on and people were actually pretty nice. I hate grilled cheese but my boyfriend loves them, why? God only knows, because grilled cheese is just a punishment! He ordered the macaroni and cheese grilled cheese and I had the tater tots, a side of french fries WITH MAYO!!!! He liked the grilled cheese and my tater and fries were decent. I think this place would be delicious when you are complete hammered and are starving!"
kumas-too-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kumas-too-chicago,08/03/14 , 5 ," After hearing so much about Kuma's Corner on featured TV segments and food blogs, I was so happy to finally visit the sister restaurant, Kuma's Too! We found free street parking on Cannon Drive near the arboretum, and went with the girlfriend at 6 PM on a Sat. We were expecting a long wait, but we were whisked right in!We ordered the Kuma and Lair of the Minotaur. Now, I don't think I expect too much for a $13-14 burger, and to be honest the food would have been excellent - if it wasn't sitting in the kitchen for over 10 min. My medium-rare burger was unevenly cooked for some odd reason, and my Gf's medium was on the verge of well done. The meat itself was great, but not cooked to my order. The topping were unique and would have tasted great if the darn food wasn't cold when it arrived. The fries were mediocre, limp, and just plain ordinary.Service was OK compared to other reviewers, but I did not shell out this money for a 30+ min wait and cold burgers! I would hesitate to go here again, but I will try the original someday just because I was so let down at this location."
ñ-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/%C3%B1-chicago-3,08/16/12 , 5 ," Ñ is a bar that apparently is owned by someone who wants to make sure that you can't find it when you search for it online. I'd love to know the thought process behind the name as you can't find it in your GPS, it's impossible to find on Google, and if I hadn't checked in when we got there I'm not sure I would've been able to find it on Yelp to review it. So, good job on that, I guess. Maybe they're going for some sort of super exclusive secret thing, who knows.The bar seemed pretty typical for what I've come to expect out of most bars in the city. Small, sort of crowded, weird seating, really dark, live music that seems cool at first but then just becomes obnoxious as you can't hear what anyone is saying, etc. I don't know, I'd love to leave a more respectable Yelp review for this place as it feels really sort but Ñ to me just felt like every bar.Their beer selection is decent, I guess. I was able to order a 5 Rabbit there which you can't find everywhere, and Delirium Tremens is also available. The mojitos they serve here are good, and come with enough citrus in them to fend off scurvy for months. At least parking nearby was easy."

Really old school style mole with nice tender chicken and fresh corn tortillas.  Flavors are really authentic. Atmosphere is fun and cozy and drinks are really good. Try the mojito or the cilantro margarita.We also tried the pork chop with red mole and avocado that was also really good. Pork was probably a little dry for me but it satisfied the crowd.  Salmon and shrimp dishes were good but nothing to shout about.Portions are sort of small for the price point though - expect $18-20 per entree. Guac as a started was also good but also small for $7.I wound come back for the dark mole and drinks for sure."
