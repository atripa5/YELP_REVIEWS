the portions are huge (the employees are so generous with each topping, unlike places like freakin chipotle where i have to ask to put more protein or rice each time) and i'm usually left with leftovers to eat later on in the day (they have lids that closes the bowl).I ordered the salad bowl with half lamb, half chickpeas as my protein with a creamy garlic dressing.Got the rice plate for lunch and can guarantee you i'll be hungry before 4.Finally, i absolutely love the chicago / indian inspired mural on the wall.Simple easy menu that still have a nice variety because you can mix and match the proteins, sauces and toppings.Rice - they only have white and brown rice, which is cold.I picked paneer as my protein (as i am a vegetarian) as that seemed to be my only choice.."frontera-fresco-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/frontera-fresco-chicago,2,").I purchased a rick bayliss cookbook.The sandwich also had a pickled red onion it is so there was lots of acid.Don't be fooled, though: it is gourmet..)the chips and salsa were just so-so, but i loved the chipotle chicken tacos..50 for a soggy bland short rib taco that came apart after 1 bite.Rick bayless in a food court inside macy's? a little out of the way but that certainly didn't stop us!

it has become a favorite taco place for me! their version of mexican food and the atmosphere overall keeps me coming back.Taco joint is located on halsted and armitage, it's pretty busy in the area, not too much parking on the street.What's not to like about tacos? get the al pastor for sure, but really you can't go wrong.Especially liked the cevice taco, mild bit still distinctive.I tried 4 different tacos here, the guacamole, and the queso fundido and i thought everything was just ok.."cafe-orient-33-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-orient-33-chicago,2,"Very highly recommended for a quick lunch or dinner.Kelly and her husband (the owners) are genuinely nice and make you feel welcomed.Cafe orient33 has a home style taste of korean food.It's homey, warm and airy, which is such a contrast to the up and coming neighborhood.I came here last week and just got the fried rice and it was just as good! i had to take my fried rice home because i couldn't finish it.I wish they had more ban chan (vegetable side dishes) but overall it was a good experience and would definitely come again.She's very warm, welcoming and turns out great product consistently.It's a little bit out of the way for me but i wouldn't mind returning if i was nearby.The sauce is tasty, and the crispy texture of the chicken wings is perfect.There's no shortage of places with really good style korean wings but for me, these are my favorite.."lowcountry-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lowcountry-chicago-2,2,"The beignets are very light and delicious.Go early early early!!!.Loved this place!

my husband had been trying to get me to go for awhile as we recently moved in to the neighborhood, but i was hesitant about 'eating with my hands out of a bag'.Yum! yum! yum! i wish i was eating some right now!it does get super crowded here, so they lose a star for not accepting reservations.Can't wait to be back.I want to start off saying that i have been here 4 times and this place is amazing!!

Â i have not been more satisfied with a meal in a very long time.First, it is in bridgeport, but not the bridgeport everyone is used to seeing--this is under the bridge, by the river bridgeport (no river views though, which when it comes to the chicago river, is definitely a plus).."lukes-lobster-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-chicago,1,"50 better.You can also eat outside if the weather is nice.There was no people there...I had their lobster roll at the do division street fest..Swung by for a late lunch (read: avoided the crazy prime time line).A little pricey for lunch, but worth the splurge when you are in the mood for a treat.My only complaint is that i expected the roll to be a lot bigger for the price i paid.."rickshaw-republic-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rickshaw-republic-chicago,1,"Really enjoyed our meal here even with a group of mixed eating preferences.It may have taken me a while to get there, but it won't take me that long to come backhighly recommend the babi kecap (make sure to upgrade the rice to coconut rice)!! amazing meal, love that it's byob and will absolutely come back to try more dishes!..Finally, the mee goreng was asked to be extra hot, and boy, they delivered! so hot to the point of being inedible -- but that's what i like! addictingly painful and numbing.I would come back, if only with a smaller group to not have such a wait!..Rijsttafel!i've had rijsttafel at other locations around chicago, and it it was a bland, dull affair..Do not!

as a big fan of the previous stickyrice location, i was thrilled by sweet rice's recent opening.Good/ fine.We also had kimchi and a crab rangoon appetizer.Same owners as the sticky rice chiang mai previous incarnation but with an expanded menu that includes sushi, korean food, and perhaps more interestingly thai street food in the form of a selection of mini-boat noodles and over rice dishes for $6 each..This place has a delightful menu of boat noodle soups for under $10 each and in a variety of broths and toppings.It was the #1 option on their bowl specials.We ordered the pad see eiw and red curry.."au-cheval-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/au-cheval-chicago,2,"Just be prepared to get your hands dirty.'.So, needless to say, i'm deflated.Also, if you have the ability to sit within view of the bar, it's so wonderful to see the cooks make a ton of burgers all at once, doling out the perfectly fried eggs one by one.The garlic aoli is to die for.We arrived just in time, around 5pm on a thursday.This restaurant was on my friend's must-go list when visiting chi-town so i knew i had to go! oh man, she warned me about the wait but i didn't know it was 3 hours long?!?! but the foodie gods were looking down on us with pity and my party of two only waited 30min during prime dinner time on a sat.But it is worth it i guarantee.Holy shit this burger was amazing!!

Â kids meal was perfect even for my picky eater, and the sauces we tried were great..Efficient, quick, a good value and (best of all) tasty -- the bright wok kitchen is a solid lunch option in the loop.This place is awesome!!!
