pierogi-heaven-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pierogi-heaven-chicago,1,"Pierogi all kind lukewarm.it is a great place to get a snack and try something new..my friend had the borscht soup, which was also excellent.they take credit card, which is always a plus in small places like this :) i know this is one of the places i will miss the most when i&#39;m not in chicago for school.authentic flavor and very satisfying.some of the best lunch spots in the loop.the fruit pierogis were just ok, the thickness of the dumpling overpowered the meager fruit, in my opinion.get a side of their polish sausage along with the dumplings and also the bacon, onion, sour cream on the side or sprinkled on top to complete the awesomeness! it&#39;s a small private little place and the environment is quiet but that won&#39;t change how the food taste.so, so amazing.this is just delicious happy food :-)  and grab more to go for dinner.i&#39;m pleased that i&#39;ve found another great lunch spot to add to my loop lunch list.maybe take pierogi to go next time.can&#39;t say more than that.i also ordered a side of mashed potatoes and although they were good, they weren&#39;t great.what&#39;s not to like about pierogis with various fillings served with bacon and onion toppings, hot borscht, and kielbasa?  the service was friendly and the food was served at the right temperature and with little wait.they will let you order them by the threes, so we got 3 potato/cheese, 3 kraut/mushroom, and 3 meat.bacon.i think the mushroom were nicer.its hardly noticeable so i passed it a few times searching for it, but that only increased the allure for me.didn&#39;t enjoy the sweet ricotta ones, but that&#39;s more of a personal preference thing adn so not their fault.best pierogis in the area..hearty lunch.we ordered a mixture of several different kinds - meat, cheese, you name it.at first i thought the the potato and cheese would be too bland, but the bacon and onion are the perfect addition to spice things up a bit.while freezing may be the way to go sometimes, fresh is best, and the reason my go to pierogis is grandmas!.either way, un-friggin-believably good l..def recommend this place!..hmm i don&#39;t get the high rating.that is no good.the young guy who make my to go containers was a cutie and super helpful.they have options for toppings, but we just choose sour cream on the side.dry, tasteless, balls of starch.pleasant service.no frills, just good people making good food.everything cooked on a basic kitchen stove, i just love the concept.i like the simple but traditional/good menu.this might be as good as pierogi gets in chicago although i really do need to brave more polish restaurants before i should say so definitively.if i&#39;m back in the area, i&#39;ll be back!.tried the pierogi &#34;sampler&#34;, 3 of each cheese, meat and potatoes, loved them all! tried the sausages also and the cabbage rolls, all really good! must try if in the area.love this place! potato and cheddar pierogis are delicious.we ordered the meat and potato and cheese pierogi&#39;s.staff/service, a little meh, but the food is really good.yum..the stuffed cabbage is my favorite.but they were super nice and made us an order even though they were almost closing! :ddddd thanks for your sweet and welcoming service!!! try them out if you are in the neighborhood!.but we actually tried all of the fillings and they&#39;re all great!the stuffed cabbage is out of this world! and don&#39;t forget their sausages, they were cooked to perfection.super soft and delicious dough filled with the tastiest fillings!it was perfect comfort food for a low price.this place is a little hole in the wall but the food is amazing.pair that with some delicious polish delicacies and you&#39;ve got yourself a date!.they&#39;re half the size of your fist and filled with some tasteful ingredients but here&#39;s the kicker they cover them in bacon get the bacon shower i repeat get the bacon shower.prices were average for what you are getting.this is just the place for yelpers wanting to try out as many food options as possible.3 of the kraut and mushroom and 3 of the plain mushroom, got a can of soda, and sat down and waited.it was very good.to be full off pierogies only, i would recommend getting 9.walk into said restaurant and are greeted by incredibly helpful and friendly staff.:)pierogi in our family = potato + farmers cheese, but she told me to get a few of the meat for good measure.don&#39;t miss it!.both were exceptional with the added condiments on top (sour cream, fried onions, bacon).also you can buy 2x 6 pieces for less than 1x12 pieces, surprising but good to know.always solid.the grilled onions and bacon on top are a very nice addition!..only thing i was change as the own is the plates they were kinda ugly.2) 6 pcs of pierogi.love this place!  the sour cabbage and mushrooms  pierogi are the best.the borscht was the perfect balance of sour and sweet.this place is so unassuming from the outside but had the best pierogis i&#39;ve ever had."

oriole-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/oriole-chicago,1,"Small bites but powerful flavors.and for the exact same menu no less.the courses that stood out the most for me were the alaskan king crab, the a5 wagyu, and the capellini.i appreciated that wine was available by the &#34;half glass&#34;, so i could experience the different pairings without getting overwhelmed by alcohol..the greeter welcomes her guests with herbal concoction that is gentle and sweet - enough to ready the palate for an eclectic culinary arousal.portion sizes were just right, so that we never felt over-stuffed (although we would have happily consumed another six orders of just about anything we were served!)rather than attempt to describe individual courses, which change anyway, let me just list those items that topped those i&#39;ve had at the best michelin-starred restaurants in the world: sea urchin, foie gras, alaskan king crab and japanese a5 wagyu.everything a fine dining experience should be.my least favorite part of the meal if i had to choose (because truly it was all amazing) was probably the almond croissant which was served last.i really cannot express how awesome the staff is about this.it was both beautiful and tasty.one thing i wished was different/better about my experience was the cleaning up of the kitchen.if you&#39;ve been to most of the &#34;biggies&#34; in chicago, you&#39;ll love this and you won&#39;t get sticker shock.best restaurant that i&#39;ve been to in a while.lighting is good, bathroom is stocked with cool essentials (hey-oh, aesop hand cream!)highly recommend: get the drink pairing to accompany the meal.and now, i feel so incredible lucky to have eaten at oriole.we celebrated a birthday and had a gluten free diner among our group and both were handled with class and grace.the cocktail/wine pairing is spot-on and has generous pairings as well, with the rotating staff ensuring that our starting bubbles were never empty so we could toast the night away.even excusing myself for the restroom was noticed and the restroom was stocked with anything you may need.despite 15 courses (and take-home pie!) was satisfied and not overfull.here at oriole, it&#39;s softer, more delicate, subtler, more introverted, and yet brilliant.one of my top meals to date.service, atmosphere, and of course, the food are all top notch.a team.at a time where fine dining has almost lost its way with many places shuttering and a bunch of fine/casual restaurants opening, this is a place that renews your faith and love in true fine dining.the wagyu beef, truffle pasta, lamb belly and foie gras were incredible.i could go on and on about the entire meal.for me, i have to admit it was the first time i was willing to try eating a raw oyster, and i quite loved it.out of all 15-16 courses, there was not a single course that i didn&#39;t like and some of the courses really elevated simple dishes to be amazing.i could not have enjoyed a restaurant more.we came to oriole to celebrate my husband&#39;s 40th - i agonized over what we should do and where we should eat - as i wanted to make it so special for him.oriole is a nice space that is contemporary and comfortable but still elegant.what was even more impressive was the overall vibe, service and attention to the little things that transformed the night to a lasting memory...wonderful service, beautiful space and the best food i think i have ever had..everything here is fantastic.) which perfectly accompanied each dish.service was exceptional, food was unbelievable..damn this is what beef should taste like.this is the best restaurant in the city of chicago.however, the overall experience could have been better as the amount of food is tantamount to criminal.maybe they should make sure the chefs are fed before they start working.get to oriole now, while reservations are still relatively attainable.the restaurant has a wonderful cadence, not only of the courses, but also of guests being served.the fifth star could have happened if i felt challenged, was required to think.overall 6 star for location, great flavors,services and yummy food.)  it was a delight.as she did with senza, cara sandoval leads the front-of-the-house at oriole.stop worrying if the open-to-the-dining-room kitchen will stress you out - it&#39;s probably the happiest, chilliest kitchen in chicago (maybe next to schwa)..&#34;i love this!&#34; &#34;oh my, what is this?!&#34; and &#34;this is my favorite!&#34; ."

greek-islands-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/greek-islands-restaurant-chicago,2,"I&#39;ve sometimes had to wait at peak busy times but never for too long, and it&#39;s always worth it.love that they have valet.not expensive and portions were huge..planned on getting food but the wait was 25-45 min, and no food service in the bar area.we ordered the saganaki of course and it was amazing! we would have been totally happy with just eating that all night! i had the salmon with a side of fresh veggies and rice.you can&#39;t make a reservation- so be prepared to wait.oan all the waiters are very handsome.the food isn&#39;t overwhelmingly delicious, but it is tasty and reasonable.pros:- expansive menu- reasonable prices- everything is goodcons:- few things are great, nothing is extraordinary- touristy and gimmicky atmosphere, everyone around you will order saganaki, every single time- waiters act strangely and treat you like you having been there before is an impossibility- service is spotty, but the wait for food usually isn&#39;t bad.the wait staff were well mannered, pleasantly enthusiastic and expeditious with the water refills.never a good sign in my opinion.i got the chicken kabobs which were amazing! so flavorful and tender.greek islands is like so many other greek restaurants i went to in the fact that it is set up banquet style (think reza&#39;s) with large rooms, opulent over the top greek statues, white-wash walls (as if all of greece was santorini), with too many dining rooms to count.perhaps, given the hype, i set the bar too high.for our entrees we didn&#39;t want anything too big so we got a plate of the gyros to share..maybe the pastitsio could have used a little more cinnamon, but it was still tasty.i have never had a bad meal.went here today for a team lunch.the following dinner dates have been a la carte with both food and wine, and there has yet to be a time where i didn&#39;t enjoy my experience.there was about a 1/2 lb of gyro meat, 1 slice of tomato, and onion slices hidden under the bed o&#39; meat.i am totally in love with this place.my favorite dish is their roast loin of lamb, always tender and with a lot of flavor.i love greek food.couldn&#39;t end our lunch without tasting the delicious ambrosia dessert! beautiful.the service at greek islands is amazing and our waiter was attentive throughout our meal...cooked perfect.their lamb is superb, absolutely!!we had a lovely time and looking forward to going back again...flavorful and tender.would go again, but we still think cross rhodes in evanston is the best and cheaper for good quality.this place is great always consitant.both pork dishes were good, i preferred the kontosouvli.and the dessert plate had a nice generous assortment.some good ol&#39; spinach and cheesy goodness.came here around 1 on a tuesday afternoon.placing a to-go order is easy and the food is always good.the bad: service was very &#34;get to the point&#34;.i had the traditional greek chicken with veggies.greek islands is one of the best greek restaurants in chicago.this place was fantastic! i&#39;ve.the decor is authentic and beautiful...not worth $50 between two people.the gyro was good, and the food was plated in the open near us which was fun to watch..i wasn&#39;t impressed with the food unfortunately so i won&#39;t be coming back.the lentil soup was ok.warning: do not go here is you are not ready to eat!great food at a great price! you must order the village salad, saganaki and taramasolata.order the pan fried smelt as an app with cocktail dipping sauce and you will not be disappointed.i don&#39;t know why he started yelling at me not the other people.6.they&#39;ll walk out of here with 5-star type phrases, tell the rest of the family how great you are, tell them that you&#39;re their number 1 kid who takes them to authentic things for different life experiences.if you want to have a great time and enjoy some of the best greek american food, this is the place!!.i don&#39;t understand how this place has so many 4 and 5 star reviews.cold spreads: these are all delicious, more than we could finish.started with saganaki and it was the right mix of salty, nutty, and a hint of lemon.roasted tomatoes? lots of garlic? it was absolutely delicious, and i wish there had been more.from start to end the food was so amazing..i will say though, our server assistant was on top of everything and worked very hard.a big shout-out to nick, the other waiters and manager on duty for helping me to deal with an emergency situation that arose with one of my guests.the bread was ok, and definitely needed improvement, but overall would definitely visit this place again to try something from their extensive menu.had a couple of small greek salads and both had chicken shish-ka-bob (tender, moist and delicious) with roasted potatoes and rice...it&#39;s nice when a place is consistently good because it shows that they clearly know what they are doing and do it well."
hyde-park-taco-station-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hyde-park-taco-station-chicago,1,"Great neighborhood taco shop! it is mostly a take-out place, though there is some seating.we got about 1/6th of our order and we were unable to contact the restaurant to even get refunded or discuss this with anyone.unique flavors and great taste...welcome to hyde park, taco station.consistently fresh food.so i went back about 2 hours later and it was filled with people.it was delicious and well balanced.slow service over priced mediocre food does not make for a happy returning customer.disappointed with the tacos here.i thought it was very affordable given the amount of food.i attended one of the soft openings they have been conducting (if you don&#39;t know what that is then watch bar rescue or look it up or just educate yourself).i did want to place my order over the phone but that is not an option just yet.the tacos were ok nothing fancy..my friend had a meat taco and also found it bland.loved the chicken tacos and the elotes were amazing! i am a foodie and respect restaurants with a passion for food.this place has amazing food! i don&#39;t understand why people are complaining about prices..cheese, avocado, i think.service okay.i will use the green sauce to spice it up.this is a great little taco spot right in the heart of hyde park.fish inside of fish tacos was hard and completely overcooked..it is expensive, that&#39;s for sure! don&#39;t quite understand the extra price for cheese, so there&#39;s a miss.first and last time here.hype parkers are aggressive and picky..i love that they were making the guacamole fresh right in front of us and it was incredible..although there is better mexican food elsewhere in the city, this place is on-par with a lot of the chic taco joints in wicker, lakeview, etc..thanks, hyde park taco station for being a great neighbor!.i didn&#39;t know that and arrived at 3:45 and had to wait for it to open.good option though.highly recommended.50 each on the menu!.not authentic (parmesan cheese?!?), unoriginal, overpriced, and low quality.i ordered the al pastor burrito for $8, and while it was quite flavorful for hyde park, the burrito was smaller than what you&#39;d get at chipotle or qdoba.and they have elotes, vegan tacos, and mahi-mahi/shrimp tacos that dave doesn&#39;t!..it all tasted all right, but nothing tastes as good as it could when you feel ripped off (especially after waiting in line for 40 minutes)..the tacos are amazing, some of the best i&#39;ve ever had."
mity-nice-chicago-14,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mity-nice-chicago-14,1,"I had a chicken salad, coffee and dessert and all 3 even the coffee were not worth the price.so needed to lift the spirit.highly recommended!.if you are dining there and have food allergies ask for martine.10/20/14 follow up: thank you to tom s.their root beers looked great but some were $4 so i passed.every time i come to chicago i have to make a stop at this place.the service here was excellent and our food came quick.big bar too!.our party kept it simple by ordering the thanksgiving turkey dinner all around -- it was thanksgiving in canada, where we were visiting from, so the option was hard to pass up..we started out with the mac n cheese which was the best! my partner in crime had the pot roast wth roasted veggies.my sister went with the fish special and loved it.the vodka wasn&#39;t too strong, and it had an amazing ginger flavor.was not crowded like all the brunch places are on a weekend.&#34;everything down on that bottom part of the menu is 15 bucks and comes with a soup today,&#34; says the server.i asked our waiter what happen and he said someone at the bar wanted to watch the indy game.tip: join their email club to get a coupon.this place was delicious- everyone was happy with their meals.great place, awesome service..the atmosphere was nice and quiet, was seated and served promptly.this place is tucked in the back of the water tower place food court, but it&#39;s pretty nice.according to every one, the orders were flavorful and satisfying.i&#39;m glad i did -- mn has a lot to offer: decent food, friendly service, comfortable surroundings, and that overall lettuce entertain you polish that generally provides a good dining experience.we ordered the sonoma salad and after a bite we had to send it back, it was overly salty none of us were able to eat more than that.it&#39;s perfect! the sauce that comes with the skirt stake compliments it perfectly, and will leave you wanting more after you&#39;re done! also, every sunday for dinner the entrees are all $15 so you can&#39;t beat that price! you gotta try this place!.extensive gluten free menu for my celiac husbamd.the ambiance seems to be a weird hybrid between a sports bar and restaurant.i also thought that my tuna burger was slightly bland...skip the cheesecake factory and overpriced food at the hotels.they also have some craft root beers which is definitely a highlight.two options - be seated in restaurant area in back and order off of menu or use the food stations in front and but ala carte.i alerted management and it was immediately taken care of.meat and potatoes r great.nice service all around.sometimes when you go to places to shop with a food court you wouldn&#39;t think the food would be good but this place is good and i would recommend it to others to have lunch when they shop here.service was awesome, but the kitchen needs to step it up and stop microwaving or quick making these wrongfully pre made foods.i guess that&#39;s the end of the review.my brother loved his grilled cheese and my mom enjoyed her fish tacos.the cheese rolls they serve when you sit down were amazing.throw in the odd-yet-bland decor (my husband&#39;s observation:  &#34;it looks like they stopped somewhere between &#39;hunting lodge&#39; and &#39;apple store&#39;&#34;) and i just don&#39;t see us going back.g.i think the food and the staff always meets my expectations.that is a good day because wine is $5 a glass..the maze of choices was a bit overwhelming but we decided on &#34;sit down&#34; instead of a la carte and were escorted through the maze to this place in the back.definitely recommend and i am coming back!!!!.too much filler, and their mushroom gravy has been replaced by catsup.also, you can get a mix of sweet potato fries and  regular fries which i appreciated.i&#39;m not sure why this place comes up at &#34;mexican&#34; it&#39;s more of a new american type of place..french onion soup is great as well.everything was very tasty and the staff was perfect.:)cup of baked french onion soup ($6) - 3 cheese worthiness with a hint of asiago.i also like that they have quite a few gluten-free options.and the cheese rolls are legit.a solid place to eat in the water tower building.it turns out to be almost identical to the cinnamon apple pancake for the original pancake house..mity&#39;s has some awesome food i love their burgers and i try to come here as often as i can when i hang with my home slice for a girls day out.our experience there was phenomenal.awesome experience!!! had the steakhouse meatloaf and it was phenomenal.i ordered the corn cake benedict and my boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles - again both were fantastic! my boyfriend says this was one of his favorite parts of our trip.&#34;  except for the entrees, the meal was served family style and everything we had was excellent.my daughter said the salmon melted in her mouth.highly recommend.the bread here is soo freaking good.all in all, a great spot to get a bite mid shopping! and away from the crowd at the food court - which i loved!.i am definitely experienced with salads and this was one of the best."

la-chaparrita-grocery-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-chaparrita-grocery-chicago,1,"Seriously the quality of huraches, tacos are second to none.the table salsas are as good a trio as you&#39;ll find, from a medium bodied tomato, a fiery green and an equally incendiary habernero, all three cut the fattiness and put the tacos over the top!parking is challenging, but well worth the trip.huraches great too...they have a special taste to it, definitely coming back for more.in this case, they were also deep fried, and damn daniel! it was a stronger flavor than i&#39;m used to but very good.everything you could ask forin a taqueria.5 stars for the salsa.this is pretty much just a taco place, though the serve a couple huaraches, tamales, home made potato chips, and a couple other items..i have never seen onions so perfectly and equally chopped.25%) on soft drinks, but instead implied that the restaurant had screwed up.it&#39;s all real food.there have been in enough articles to put their name out there but the location is not desired for most.best tripe taco i&#39;ve had anywhere - so crispy and meaty without any hint of off-putting funk.their tripe tacos won the award for best taco in chicago via the chicagoist last year, i&#39;m personally just not that into tripe, but you should try it regardless.i dream about these authentic mexican tacos.my favorite.this place was awesome, we started off with somethin called a huarache, which was amazing.the restaurant felt like being in mexico city - yes, that authentic."

velvet-taco-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/velvet-taco-chicago,1,"Either way, i loved them both.the last two left a lot to be desired in flavor...unique flavors and fairly priced.the place was fairly crowded.5 4&#39;s, 1 5 and 1 6.once i tried these guys, i realized that i had been missing these tacos in my life!! so darn delicious! i had the buffalo chicken taco which was a little on the spicier side, but the taste was so good that i didn&#39;t mind.the place was big and spacious, plenty of seating, and very clean.bland.we ordered in for our meal, so i can&#39;t speak to the atmosphere or decor.the entire inside of the taco was mush, no &#34;crispy&#34; tots to be found..oh my goodness, they&#39;re sooooooo freaking good!! my friend ordered the fish taco and she said it&#39;s really good as well.for a first timer, i highly suggest getting a bunch and trying them all.get it..i had steak tacos and the queso dip and can honestly say those were some the best tacos i had eaten in a long time.the shrimp and grits taco and the chicken tikka were my two favorite, although i imagine they are all good.the breakfast style tots were out of this world, as well.the menu is prolific but my wife and i chose 3 tacos to share..this place had some creative combinations.this place is amazing! we yelped it after a cocktail party and were blown away! every bite is a party in your mouth..normally it&#39;s always a black bean option, but they have three unique options (falafel, paneer, and a tofu).a+ for variety and quality.i personally loved the fish and chips! tots with some fancy sauces and put an egg on it, um yes please..get out of here.you honestly can&#39;t go wrong!.the taco were amazing.the elote corn is the best item.filthy kitchenordered $20 back door chicken (wouldn&#39;t recommend)employee hands chicken to employee who was mopping who hands it to the cashiercashier sniffed his armpit and was generally inattentivecook scratched his head, touched the egg in the pan (for our tater tots) often to break up the white and make it cook faster.i took the taco back and the staff put the chicken, pico and sauce mess in a new taco.*cough* l&#39;patron *cough* is best for that.good heavens, those tots.i don&#39;t understand the mass appeal of this place as the tacos are underwhelming, yet overpriced.the cons i found: uncomfortable sitting, just oooone bathroom for the whole place, and the falafel tacos came in a tortilla made of lettuce!.the bleu cheese is real.yes, we shared the tater tots and they were still delicious as i remember.the tots are served pilled up with goat cheese, smoked cheddar, bacon and topped with an egg.last but not least my all time favorite.there&#39;s not one bad item on the menu..love all their tacos, especially the falafel and chicken tikka.we stumbled across it while looking for someplace near water tower and it exceeded our expectations.took about 25 minutes for my order to be ready, but the wait wasn&#39;t bad relation to how busy they were.the crispy pork belly was delicious but kinda felt a bit skimpy on the pork belly and overall fillings in general.fast, friendly service and the racks were outstanding.placing the order was a breeze in spite of the number of patrons, and i coupled my tacos with a delicious ginger ale.what a great addition to the neighborhood.what more can you ask for..i think out of all the food we were only able to finish the chips with queso on it..but after the first two tacos, it was slightly wanting in more assertive flavor.the wait can get longer at peak times, so plan ahead if you are hangry.spicy tikka chicken, buffalo chicken, crisp pork belly, ahi poke, cuban pig..the steak was beefy, chewy, and nicely charred, though i didn&#39;t get the balance of flavors the other toppings (portabello, fresh oregano) promised.one of my friend is obsessed with tacos so we always end up getting drunken late night tacos at the end of the night.look at the menudocs.they top it off with some sort of curry mustard.if you&#39;re looking for authentic tacos, you&#39;re out of luck.chicken tikka was amazing..the stand out is the monday backdoor chicken special for $10 is the best.this place is legit.margaritas were worth the $6.their main attractions are their tacos, with a good variety of meat options, one &#34;taco of the day,&#34; and 3 vegetarian tacos.it&#39;s a really small place off state street and there&#39;s a lot more seating upstairs.tried the paneer taco and the falafel but on a tortilla instead of lettuce wrap.i ordered the vegetarian trio, but somehow ended up with the buffalo chicken taco which was delicious.the only reason i gave it 5 stars is because yelp does not have 15 stars."
grandpas-delight-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/grandpas-delight-chicago,1,Highly recommend..only downfall of this place is the very bad coffee ive been having.just what mckinley park needs! highly recommended!.no tamarindo candy straw or mango chunks.i hope they do well in the future...gandpa&#39;s delight is such a bridgeport&#39;s hidden treasure! you should definitely come check it out!.
acanto-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/acanto-chicago,1,"Skinny little breadsticks??? how about some real bread fresh from the oven with every main or starter?food and service were terrific, and the duck egg noodle pasta was execellent.lovely option for a pre-show meal with food that isn&#39;t ridiculously heavy.the soup was great (even though it had kale), chicken piccata was amazing and the lamb ragout was even better.the food was delicious - very unique pasta dishes, prepared really well.who would have thought blackberry and rosemary could go so well together? the gelato was perfectly smooth and creamy and the rosemary with the tart blackberry perfectly complemented the sweet pizzelles.whenever i go to the art institute, i head here afterward for dinner.this was one of the best meals i&#39;ve had in my life and with every bite was even more amazed! truly an experience to remember!.the dining room was darkened, intimate, warm, relaxed and highlighted by mismatched plates of a fresh take on italian cuisine.it was light and very approachable.super delicious but definitely not your typical italian place.fate would have it that within a week, i dined at two places in this block and i had the privilege of adding acanto as a third.reason for 4  is if not because the location then nothing special.just eat here, you will no regret it!..food - would say the food is average.so no star.this restaurant was fantastic! our server was very helpful and helped us create a perfect menu for our evening.my friends and i did some order coordination, getting and sharing the black peppercorn rigatoni, duck egg spaghetti, gnochetti, and bigoli.so happy we decided to come to acanto.the general manager even cane over to recommend a wine and he was spot on!  the prices are high but for a reason so just go in and expect it.i don&#39;t know what happened but when the waiter brought over the check he said it was &#34;on us because we want you to be happy&#34;  wow!  they were eating desserts and drinking coffee so it wasn&#39;t bad enough to get up and leave.between the pastas, not one was better then the other.it came with bread and what i believe is called mostarda.food was simple but extraordinary..i ordered a pizza, i know wow right.i don&#39;t know that there is anything bad here.the interior is very homey but in an upscale way..just realized they have a huge patio as well, will be packed for summer people gawking as they walk along michigan avenue.while the food was great, the service was not.their margherita pizza, the wine (great advice from diego our server), the duck egg spaghetti.i went friday and then again saturday because both nights i needed to accommodate friends with food allergies.a friend had recommended the restaurant and the yelp reviews were very good as well.great food!  portions are a little on the small side so don&#39;t come hungry unless you&#39;re gonna drop a lot of cash.we left full and happy- everything was absolutely delicious, and it has a luxurious and beautiful atmosphere.damn good.most of their wine is dry, i had the sangiovese and it was really good!.wonderful service, wonderful food, and wonderful ambiance.i&#39;ll note: i&#39;m a foodie and a female traveling alone.while more casual than it&#39;s predecessor, acanto is the perfect stop after work, before the theater or just when you are looking for some great food as you stroll down michigan ave or visit millenium park.good for special occasions.i wouldn&#39;t run back to this place anytime soon.the two pasta dishes&#39; portions were so small, they looked like children&#39;s dishes.w.we also ended up getting the bombolini (iike a fried donut) and house made gelato for dessert.my favorite italian restaurant in chicago! great food, warm service and nice atmosphere.desserts had stunningly huge portions: the cookie platter was easily dessert for four, but the budino was the favorite of the night.the chianti classico was perfect, and i loved rigatoni lamb ragu and the chicken piccata i shared with my wife.i never knew or met billy before.both dishes were out of this world - fresh pasta, beautifully crafted sauces, and the right portion size to satisfy but not overwhelm..this is a first rate place and we will definitely be back soon!..i think the intimate size of the establishment helps them make this a personalized dining experience in the hustle and bustle of michigan avenues grant park.the experience was so top-notch that i would have gone back every night if i wasn&#39;t already committed to corporate dinners on the other nights.had creamy and delicious artichoke and spinach risotto the first day and the special lentil salad the second.great flavor and just the right combination of cheese and sauce.way better than average.ryan our waiter was great he recommended everything and it was great! flavors were great my wife and i both had the specials.the vibe was cheerful and relaxed with tons of personal attention.even the tiny zucchini &amp;squash on the side were cooked to perfection.because i have ibd and am terrified of race day potty situations, i played it safe with a salad.i&#39;m glad i decided to give acanto a try, despite its emptiness in comparison to other local restaurants.we were seated right away without a reservation.excellent service and reasonably priced too.in truth we ate too much.the service was attentive and overall impeccable.on the evening we were there, the lighting was far too dim for what would be appropriate.due to the nature of the meeting, we kept it simple and only ordered entrees..our server was fab!  she offered suggestions, joked around with us and just generally was very attentive.the veal parmigiano was basically a flavorless veal thin tenderloin, which was too rare to be veal, flooded in an ocean of black sweet glaze.my colleagues got the salmon that was cooked to perfection and the chicken special was a huge portion.the waiter we had was very good and always came back and forth to check up on us to see if we need anything else.omg delish!  we also had the aranchini which was gorgeously prepared with leaves of roasted brussel sprouts..there were some small chunks of lobster in the sauce..sadly taste like gelato.great cocktails."
jubranos-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jubranos-chicago,1,"Delicious food and the owners are wonderful and personable.i had a veggie burger from here and it was pretty good! only thing is that for the price i wish i got a bigger burger.this place is very inexpensive and affordable..) the restaurant itself is small and simple, nothing fancy (i prefer take away).this place is definitely my go to for wraps from now on.this place is chintzy and mediocre, multiple times forced me to order a drink just so that i would spend a certain dollar amount on my visa (illegal by the way), and wouldn&#39;t let me sit in the restaurant with my co residents when all 6 of them ordered a meal but i brought my sack lunch.i wish the spicy sauce was spicer.this place is awesome--it has a great variety of food including burgers, wraps, middle eastern food like gyros, etc..definitely going back.first time to jubranos.thank you, yelpers, for reviewing this place because if it weren&#39;t for all of these great comments, we probably would have never tried it.i read the reviews and decided to check it out--- will definitely be back here!they sell gyros, burgers, shawarmas, chicken fingers (as well as many other items)..they were all good ingredients but i don&#39;t know if my tastebuds were capable of appreciating them all together because i just tasted a bunch of meat and i was just overwhelmed by everything else going on in this sandwich.the falafel was probably the best i&#39;ve had, it was crispy on the outside the way that i personally like it...so amazing.a very nice owner serves up some good, honest greasy spoon grub at jubrano&#39;s.a tad long (1 hour) but no biggie since i didn&#39;t feel like going all the way to taylor st.the staff and cooks were extremely nice.the only thing that makes it unique is its location - about a mile away from the greek town mecca of these places..well, on top of my falafel sandwich being disappointing, i had to trek over to get it myself.not impressed, i&#39;ve had better.mushroom swiss burger- 4.and the meat was quality, not grissley(sp?) or fatty..i usually get one of the wraps and falafal, or the gyro burger.anything i get is always perfect - you feel so satisfied.super quick service as well which is always a plus!.the food is yummy!.it&#39;s enough for lunch and dinner.the reason why i&#39;m giving this place 3 stars rather than 4 is because of the fact that i found the food to be good, but nothing worth drooling over..thats for sure.wished they had dropped a few packets of hot sauce in the bag though..my shawarma plate was around $11 and for the quality of the food/restaurant, i think it should of been a little closer to $7.this is a very good fast food style restaurant on taylor street.the coolest part is they use halal meat for their gyros (not sure about other sandwiches) which is a smart choice given the local community..however, i was pleasantly surprised! i had the chicken tikka masala wrap, it came with a zesty little sauce and fresh iceberg and tomatoes.fast service, great food and very affordable.the side salad was a bunch of bland iceberg lettuce with one small tomato slice.the falafel is so good here and there hummus is awesome.the fries were also seasoned well.and it&#39;s really affordable! it&#39;s always made fresh too.it&#39;s fast, it&#39;s friendly and it&#39;s right around the corner and that&#39;s what counts.jubranos somewhat relieves that pain.great burgers and sandwiches.i cared less about being told where i could pray in the restaurant and more about how rude and disrespectful he was to me in the process, not sure if i&#39;ll ever go back and it&#39;s a shame cuz we don&#39;t have enough zabihah options.not even the gyros is pre-packaged and you can definatley taste the difference! owner and cook are friendly and often make menu items that didnt exist prior to me asking for them..their food is really good, i always order the greek salad and hummus, my husband loves their fries and chicken salad.go for the gyro burger if youre feeling meaty.i&#39;m still on the quest to look for a my favorite gyro cheese burger place in chicago.cheap and good burgers.the owner cooked our food and he takes pride in what he does! very nice guy and very nice place.they hand make them fresh.i grab one once a week or so..the cheeseburger gyro was like heaven in my mouth.can&#39;t wait for the next time am in chicago.first off, yes it&#39;s halal which is of course bonus points above all else!my husband and i go here every now and then but we used to go here often while we were at school at uic.every time i am there, they greet most of the patrons by their first name!   plus they go out of their way to make your meal fresh and how you ask for it.my burgers at jubranos always come out to be in the $6-$8 range, so it&#39;s not bad at all..they weren&#39;t bad but they weren&#39;t that great.had the gyros cheeseburger, but for how much i paid for it, the portion was small..that really pissed me off because feeling sick for a couple of days and boding with my toilet as i gurgle sucked."
mak-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mak-restaurant-chicago,1,"They offer healthier versions of the most popular dishes from various asian cuisines.my beef was cooked to perfection, super juicy and not too chewy.eggplant is good too..this place is great! i showed up a few minutes before opening and the guy at the register said it would be a few minutes before he could take my order..a great spot.staff didn&#39;t know the menu that well but was friendly nonetheless.this place is worth a try and such good food! i want to go back to try the mak pad thai soon!.our friend tried the general mak-shrimp.given that the food is already made (on constant rotation so it&#39;s fresh), the assembly line style meal should have been assembled in a few minutes but we must have waited an extra 15 with only a few other people ahead of us.went to this place a few times when it first opened.can&#39;t wait to come back and try the mak beef and the chicken wings..mak chicken is so good!.i know it&#39;s just a few dollars but it&#39;s more the principal for me.i will be going back for sure.also, what if the food juices ran down the chopstick when you turn it upside down to use it as a fork?! lol.all the dishes here are good, meat-eater and vegan a like; they use fresh ingredients.i usually stop in on my way home and it only takes 10min or less for my order.other issues:1) when i placed an order on the phone they told me it would take 20 minutes.this place is awesome! just what the neighborhood needed.i didn&#39;t try any of those, but i did enjoy the chicken wangs!!.i do pick up here probably once a week.overall a decent dinner choice once in a while.: &#39;).even ordered hot the kick was kinda lacking.homemade mak sauce was also a highlight.paying 11.great food, fast delivery, and reasonable prices.portions were large, which meant she had lunch for the next day and my inner fatty was satiated..we got miso and a tofu and veggie bowl (spicy).today i tried the hot &amp; sour soup- it had more pepper in it than im used too but it was still super good!overall this is my go to spot for a hearty, healthy delicious meal!psthey have this hot sauce that is insane! its way too hot for me but i think my boyfriend would put it on everything if he had the option! so definitely good for people who love spicy!.i&#39;m from seattle where you can find places like this on every corner and they do a very good job with the quality.mak has great ambience, friendly staff and can turn out fresh food fast...the donuts? meh..i love asian food but i often struggle to find healthy options and often have to specifically ask to not use msg, skip the corn starch.we had the general mak, the fried rice the broccoli, the green beans and the wangs, and as i said, everything was good, nothing was amazing.this is a good place to take those unaccustomed to a stronger asian flavor profile or intimidated with their meal being too ethnic.i recently tried the fried rice and should&#39;ve known that would be awesome too.food was ok, i was not a fan of my pad thai.so considerate, just so super thoughtful and kind, and chill..highly recommend.stopped in with a friend to grab a bite.this place would get 5 stars for the food, but they are so.the restaurant is located at a nice strip though and sitting outside on a summer evening was quite nice.every time i come in the owner asks how the meal was and asks for feedback.so at the end of our meal, we threw away 2 plastic bowls, 2 plastic plates, 2 plastic forks, 2 plastic spoons and 2 plastic cups, while dining in..it&#39;s hard to find a good chinese restaurant in chicago, unless you get down to chinatown.i came here one tuesday night for dinner around 7:30pm with my boyfriend.i was meeting my girlfriend at 2:30pm in the area,  and she suggested we eat at mak..fresh, tasty meals.other than that - it was awesome.if you like flavor and lots of sauce, this isn&#39;t the place for you.try the quinoa! yeah a little pricey for fast casual."

sable-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sable-chicago,1,"Highly recommend it with fair pricing.we went with the churro ice cream sandwich and the lemon polenta cake, both were extremely well done and there were no leftovers.my friend ordered the bananas foster french toast, and he loved it.i would come back just for the forest mushroom flatbread - it&#39;s so flavorful with the mushrooms and truffle without being overpowering.we would eat there again.candace would check in with me throughout my meal.great place with amazing ambience, some cocktail&#39;s are hit or miss based on what you like.5.sable is your typical trendy bar - pretty generic.we had 1/2 dozen oysters (pretty good), ceviche (good, but not a best in class), beet &amp; buratta salad (very tasty) and steak tartare (good).lloana was the server and so happy and helpful from the first until the last interaction.the service and the food were phenomenal! the ambiance of the restaurant was also wonderful.there were plenty of vegetarian options that sounded incredibly appetizing.i&#39;ve never seen such a wide selection of liquors in my life.yuck.i&#39;ve been to sable before for dinner and cocktails and had an excellent experience.hubby got a bunch of fancy drinks and he loved them.elegant amnesia.the place was packed inside and out at the tail end of rush hour.so that&#39;s why 4-stars.our waitress told us that the new chefs have to do their own thing and don&#39;t want to keep the favorites..it was a daily stop during our chicago trip.i tasted other family members dishes and it was all top notch food with a lovely presentation.it&#39;s been three years since we last dined here..i&#39;ve only come here to drink from the fountains of the best bartenders on the planet.filipino chef = filipino inspired names and dishes!portions are a bit small but you&#39;re paying for the classy trendy ambiance.sable was an awesome find on yelp! my wife and i were on a layover in chicago and we made our way around downtown and knew we had time for one more drink before we had to get back to o&#39;hare.make yourself comfortable at the bar in one of their high chairs with seat backs.after we ordered they informed us they didn&#39;t have any oysters left.so good! our waiter was fabulous, helped direct us on how much food to get and allowed us to order a few things and if we wanted more, we could order more! so we started with the mac and cheese, the carrots (so good), and chicken and waffles (so so good), and that was enough! also a delicious mocktail, and yummy beignets (not my fav, but i want chocolate in my dessert).i went in wanting the pork belly egg sandwich, panting for it , but they changed the menu.my partner and i love this!!! :) can&#39;t express how i love this place.it&#39;s interesting because this place is meant to be &#34;shared plates&#34; but they don&#39;t exactly make it easy.our waitress was super friendly and very knowledgable about the menu and offerings..from the trendy atmosphere (loved everything about it!) to their amazing staff (can&#39;t remember her name but she was awesome!) to their very unique and extensive list of drinks, i spent many hours at sable.great ambience and cocktails! we had mussels, scallops, beef sliders and young at heart cocktail and also a flatbread for takeout -- they were all very unique and delicious!.both drinks were refreshing and not too strong where you can&#39;t enjoy it.we loved the chic setting and the new revival of the menu and stuff - tried the kobashi sliders and the frites both were beyond amazing !.definitely not even spicy.when we walked in, there were several empty tables, but we were asked to wait for about ten minutes before being seated.sliders: i don&#39;t know if my taste buds had orgasms or if it was the runny egg yolk goodness on this delicious little piece of meat.the desserts are a bit out there, but check it out!.i am not supposed to like this drink.great experience! i can&#39;t wait to come back to sable!.you can choose to enjoy the bar scene or seat yourself in the modern dining room.mescal drinks made by bartender were unique and creative.the waitress literally ignored us on multiple occasion.however, service was spot on and the recommendations made by the waiter were on point.although it has been many months since my last visit, i cannot get the deviled eggs out of my mind.i had the sliders and they were tiny and didn&#39;t have much flavor.man oh man.in my four visits to sable, i&#39;ve shared many small plates with friends.finished up with the apple beignets and hakashu 12 year single malt.really enjoyed everything we had here:asparagus &amp; mushroom flatbreadwagyu beef sliderscoconut curry musselsadobo pork bellywarm beet &amp; buratta saladfor cocktails we shared war of the roses and the hendricks with cucumber and rose petals, both very refreshing and delightful.amazing drinks all around! these guys know what they are doing and use very fresh ingredients in all of their drinks/food.sable was good and tasty, but the vegetarian dishes we sampled were far superior to the meat-based ones.dessert: charros and a chocolate brownie trifle w/candied bourbon bacon and peanut butter mousse.this place makes slamming cocktails.we have been here multiple times, mostly for drinks and once for date night.so be aware! i posted a pic of the dinner menu for those who would like to see it.the meat had a different flavor and was underwhelming.the table shared the pancit lug lug noodles, wild mushroom fried rice, wagu sliders..in the back they have a beautiful dining area.my fiancé ordered the chorizo skillet but was disappointed that the food was actually cold despite the skillet being hot (how does that happen).waitress was walking around impossible to flag down.it&#39;s a nice place to meet after work for some small plates.atmosphere: 8/10service: 8/10food: 8/10.i will come back (more than once) and bring friends!4 stars: i recommend this under certain circumstances.."
luellas-southern-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/luellas-southern-kitchen-chicago,2,"Washed it all down with the sweetest of sweet teas.i also got a side of cornbread, which was delicious.third, the michelin guide named it as one of their places to eat in their 2016 guide.in fact, i&#39;ve been kind of dreaming of them since.i tried both the classic sweet tea and the fruit sweet tea.menu has some interesting items on it, but they need to add more things that can function as quick aps if they do not increase the speed of their operations; otherwise, you could be sitting for a very long time with nothing to snack on..the service was excellent - the guy behind the counter was able to give us a few recommendations and there was a girl walking around cleaning up, taking empty plates and making sure everybody was ok.we made the trip up north to lincoln square.will return and recommend..we came for a family dinner the other night after my mom heard the good reviews about this place.we ordered picked up our food and don&#39;t exactly live close so i was worried it might not transport so well but everything was really good.multiple tables.we had a the shrimp po&#39; boy which was really good, the biscuits which were amazing, the shrimp and grits which were amazing, and i ordered the special seafood gumbo yet was rung up for and given chicken gumbo (i didn&#39;t notice).the food -- we had brunch on sunday morning -- was so good.i got the chicken and waffles, and it was probably one of the tastiest pieces of fried chicken i&#39;ve ever eaten.wonderful.we will return and recommend highly!.the best southern kitchen (next to my mom&#39;s kitchen) that i have ever had the pleasure of dining at.the shrimp grits are mind blowing!  biscuits and jam, a must.i&#39;m not familiar with our southern food joints up in that area but this is definitely worth checking out.this blew me away.we came back on a tuesday evening and there was no wait around 6 pm..this one was a bit of a letdown though.so be prepared to wait.i&#39;m tempted to go back again to try some of the other dishes, but i&#39;m not in a rush.i don&#39;t normally put hot sauce on fried chicken, because if it&#39;s good chicken it shouldn&#39;t need it, but after eating a piece, i changed my mind and requested the hot sauce if only for the salt.we&#39;d ordered the beignets with the rest of our food, hoping to avoid a long wait after our meal, but it took another 20 minutes after we&#39;d eaten for them to come.the food was good (chicken &amp; waffles and shrimp &amp; grits) and the portions decent, but the plating on the shrimp &amp; grits was odd.best fried chicken with excellent collards.where do i begin!! the food was so delicious! textures, flavors, portion sizes all spot on.it made the rest of the meal very uncomfortable.aside from the bomb food, the service was fantastic! for a place where you order up front and then grab your own utensils, we were expecting a panera bread type of service (basically they bring you your food then leave you alone).there is no a/c but the fans did ok.this was the first time i have ever heard of such a thing, but being that they are a fairly new place, they haven&#39;t gotten used to the dinner rush yet.i really can&#39;t say enough about luella&#39;s southern kitchen.i thought the food was really good.looking forward to my next visit.i think some of their other dishes might be more to my liking, but even considering that, if you enjoy southern food and live in chicago, i think luella&#39;s is definitely worth checking out.the food was amazing.like i was mention, i love supporting local businesses...wow is one word to describe this cute, modern soul food heaven! my mother and i went to luella&#39;s last night for a sit down dinner to break up the week.he worked with us to provide a deliciousseminar dinner for our guest from japan.the biscuit was so delicious!!! and the chicken was so flavored (we got the nashville version).the staff is very friendly, but the service is awful.i&#39;m a sucker for a real, actual beignet and they lived up to my expectations.i got the fried chicken and my friend got the shrimp and grits, and they were both amazingggg!! wish it wasn&#39;t so far up north, but it&#39;s only a few minutes away from the western brown line stop!.i waited until i am almost 50 to have some grits that i like.we had great service and cleared our plates! the place was packed with locals by the time we finished up so it&#39;s not a spot to linger and catch up with friends.byob.i swear!! no joke.i would recommend the food but can&#39;t say much for the service.i&#39;m leaning towards a five star joint here, the food was just phenomenal! we tried the cornbread skillet (must have): perfectly cooked, right consistency and great flavor profile..can&#39;t wait to go back.the corn bread is worth the 20 minute wait, as it&#39;s made to order.i personally love the biscuits! they are freshly made to order.and waited.and i didn&#39;t say anything about it!  voila, i had it for lunch the next day!  ha!  (is that mean?) sometimes a girl needs some alone time anyway.divine chicken and waffles, and the shrimp and grits was so flavorful.luella&#39;s southern kitchen is addictive!!  friday, lunch was catered to my office for 10 people.i am from the south and i am extremely skeptical of any place that claims to have southern cuisine this far north.i can&#39;t wait to go back for the shrimp and grits!  woohoo!.i wish i could get that hush puppy recipe! the short rib mac n cheese was amazing! huge noodles, perfect cheese, perfect salt balance and lots of short rib! the staff was super nice and conversational.i&#39;m looking forward to leftovers! the skin and its texture is amazing.shrimp and grits top notch, fried chicken and collard greens were amazing, ended the meal with beignets but could barely eat because i was so full.we lucked out and the big 8 person table was open so we were able to sit right down."

i wen&#39;t to new york for the good food and was disappointed.the ramen is decent/average but the fried chicken is out of this world.this place isn&#39;t my fav but i would say it&#39;s worth a try!.great sangria too.i made the trek here with a friend on a particularly muggy day (not a great ramen day) and we decided to share three buns (pork belly, duck breast and shrimp tempura) and the oiimen ramen.really don&#39;t think you can go wrong with any of the options there.we sat around for a while before another staff member came by to check on us.for the price this dish is an amazing value.oiistar was one of the early entries in the ramen game and has become one of its strongest fixtures in chicago with its korean touch on a japanese classic.i got the oiimen ramen.after all, they are advertised as asian fusion, not ramen shop.if u come here get this for buns get: shrimp tempura, pork belly garlic fried chicken and musclemen! crembule! the dexelle was ok, saltembocca was ok oiimen i did not like at all donuts were good not great there jus the buns with sugar n cinnamon on itshrimp tempura bun- its so fricken amaizing like u will order more and more of it get extra sauce on the side and you can dump your fried chicken in it and any other appetizer u get so good u wont regret it!pork belly bun-omg this is the best thing on the menu its so deliocus its not supper fatty as u would think n the condiments on it are greatfried chicken sambal- very crispy the sauce it comes with is great not spicy at all wish it was but u can put hot sauce on it make sure u get the shrimp tempura sauce extra on the side so u can dip ur chicken in it!

good for taking the leftovers home, for a rainy day..this place is an excellent one.i&#39;ve been coming here for some time now and it&#39;s always been consistent.&#34; but it wasn&#39;t alright, i was hurt, confused, and abandoned.we both had the oiiman classic..honestly this was some of the best ramen i had and even the buns were delicious.this is the best ramen you are going to get in the city, an awesome hole in the wall gem.love the bonito miso taste in the broth.their food is def the star of oiistar!! we ordered:1.somehow, the leftovers were even more magical; as i was eating some for dinner the next day, i told a friend that they were basically the best thing that ever happened to me.and less toppings.the garlic chicken is so good i find myself drinking the sauce like a crazy person.this is my favorite ramen place..the mussel ramen is amazing as well.a great little spot! came here with my friends, one has just moved to the city..i should say that i&#39;m not very picky about how ramen should taste, as long as it has plenty of hot broth and plenty of toppings.the korean style fried chicken wing is so delicious and you must try! i always order the spicy ramen (that&#39;s not too spicy)..we had to work fast in them, because the savory sauces and juices from the meat was totally absorbed by the steamed buns.however, as soon as my cousins and i entered, a large group just left thus allowing for us to be seated right away.i love oiistar! my boyfriend and i ventured here because of yelp and we are so glad that we did.i ended up ordering this mussel dish which was seriously - so effing good i&#39;ve been thinking about it nonstop since i&#39;ve been there, almost 3 weeks ago..the abundance of green onions on top were also great, it was also nice that all portions were larger than i expected...fried garlic chicken - i can&#39;t resist asian style fried chicken whenever i see it on the menu.the ramen has a unique sweet flavor to it that i haven&#39;t had anywhere else.oh and my fork had some food on it when i arrived, so again 3 stars for the cleanliness as well as food flavors.it all comes together so wonderfully to accompany their house noodles which i highly recommend..fast forward to today, and someone made a ramen dinner suggestion.completely obsessed with this place.my friend and i ordered the pork belly buns, oiimen, and musselmen.in my opinion, the texture of the noodles is a bit too rubbery for my taste and the broth is a bit weak.come hungry, leave happy!.oiimen - not the best ramen i&#39;ve had, but i thought it was decent.this is just a japanese named noodle with american style..order extra soft boiled eggs.i want to start with that.there wasn&#39;t much space between the tables and my chair was right up against the corner of the fence.the nice thing is the restaurant will call you so we were able to stroll around town for a bit while we waited.there is outside, inside, and bar dining..i love the food at oiistar! the ramen is awesome! they recently have updated the menu so that you can choose your type of broth, meat, and noodle.cool vibe, huge portions, a little crowed because it&#39;s a small place.our waiter explained that it was his grandmother&#39;s sangria recipe.it&#39;s a heaping portion and the best broth i&#39;ve ever had.it&#39;s definitely a quality ramen place, and the food is always tasty! don&#39;t waste your time at furious spoon, oiistar is definitely superior.the ladies enjoyed their sangria..he had been praising this place for having &#34;the best ramen in town&#34; and boy.great noodles, nice creamy broth, and tender juicy pork chashus."

my favorites are the crunchy shrimp and the dragon rolls.my only compliant is that it was quite cold in the restaurant.it is superb!!.deducting 2 stars as they had very loud trance music making it difficult for me to have a conversation.we got a couple rolls, i recommend  the fire dragon maki! red curry and cashew chicken are amazing as well! after bottles of wine saki vodka, and a whole lotta food the  bill came out to around $20 per person wow.very good and affordable thai food.i&#39;ve only gotten takeout from this place but their sushi is better than thais thai options.i especially appreciated that it was byob! i&#39;ll defiantly be going back!.the price range for this place is $11-$30, great price point.the service was good and pretty quick which we needed since we were in a time crunch..their sushi is so nicely decorated i don&#39;t want to ruin it by eating it!my favorite dishes are the pad see eiw and penang curry - must get with tofu for the vegetarianscame here for a birthday party and they can accommodate big groups.i love the ambience the techno beat of the music is a really good vibe.when is shushi ever bad?i&#39;ve dined in once, but typically get takeout for convenience..his has so many vegetables, basil leaves and kaffir lime leaves - so if you like curry, get it here!carlie m..if i could leave this establishment no stars i would.placed a pick up order here over the weekend and loved everything! from spicy tuna rolls, where tuna rolls, pad thai and the fried rice, we tried it all! the lad thai and fried rice were incredible.i had high hopes for this restaurant as i have heard about it from multiple friends but was definitely disappointed.we got takeout - pad see ew and, garlic site fry, and egg rolls and it was horrible all around.they use the wide noodle which is far better than the thin ones so many places use now.vietnamese spring rolls were beautiful but could have had a little more protein in the filling.if you want a great dining experience, go now and make reservations for dinner..there&#39;s a good bit of heat to it, but not too much for me and it was delicious.the sushi we had was fantastic.i get the restaurant was busy but sheesh we still had some ways to go with our wine.they kept giving our table of 4 to other people.warning: i honestly can&#39;t think of anything.i enjoyed the tom yum soup! the rolls were amazing..but the pad khee mao was excellent with caramelization on the noodles and veggies and great flavors.really good sushi..i called and learned that this had happened before due to an outdated address on yelp.it was boggling since every other table in the restaurant clearly was being seated while waiting for other people to join them!would definitely visit again, but probably not on a crazy friday! people love this joint!.the sweet potato roll is soooo good.best thai i&#39;ve had in chicago in 4 years.great, friendly service that was quick to take and deliver our orders.portions are big too, so leftovers will happen..didn&#39;t knock my socks off but then again only ordered thai not sushi.it&#39;s a 4 star restaurant  but i took off one star from the review because the seating area didn&#39;t look clean.i really liked butterfly sushi, but they are discriminating against me because i am on the south side.we will continue to be patrons of this fine establishment..not blame the customer.chill environment and great for a first date..i&#39;m not, but still appreciate what they do with the vegetarian dishes however, the sushi is amazing.great restaurant with both thai food and sushi.this is definitely overrated.as a result, this morning i was so sick from the food.i think their swirls are made of unagi sauce, spicy mayo, and regular mayo (if it&#39;s not cream cheese, or wasabi mayo.we&#39;ve had a couple sushi rolls last time we dined at the bar- their sushi is also very fresh and tasty.will go back!.even when we dined in with byob, the experience was great.went last night the good very good but had to knock off a few stars because i felt rushed almost rudely rushed.) i also thought that the garlic chicken dish was a bit bland.they actually messed up our order and we had to have it taken back because there was a hair in our food.tempura tasted like it had been fried in 3 month old oil.i get nigiri because i love the delicate taste of the salmon.stayed optimistic cause it smelled good and i was craving maki rolls.we love it so much here.i&#39;ve ordered delivery from there for the past two years and finally checked out the location.but if you are looking for a good sushi spot with nice atmosphere that won&#39;t break the bank, this is your new place!."
star-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/star-kitchen-chicago,2,"Definitely recommend the kimchi fries! love them, people here are very nice also.wish there was more sauce but great late night dinner.i ordered chicken wings and they came with some weird cheese fries.kimchi fries are amazing, the way the fries, sauce, and kimchi comes together is to die for..again, the meat had a really weird texture: it felt as if the chicken had been cooked too dry and then made soggy afterwards.ever since my drunken night, i&#39;ve developed an addiction to these kim chi fries &amp; def.the food tasted like reheated leftovers.and they just send me one.best late night munchies spot.i haven&#39;t had any other situation when it would take a place so much time to deliver food and have no explanation why 2 hours after i ordered food i still don&#39;t have it.good filling combo for $6.defiantly recommend the kim chi fries ! the fries are so flavorful...new spot in the bridgeport neighborhood prefect for my late snack cravings.order a side of kimchi fries and damn that shit was in point.the pepper steak was pretty good but the portions are smaller than most chinese places i have been to.it was good flavor but super mushy and way too much onion.they even deliver until 2 a.you know how when you&#39;re a little drunk everything that&#39;s just average tastes amazing? well the food here tasted.big disappointment from the great (fake) reviews."
quartino-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/quartino-chicago,1,"The deserts were amazing and the expresso was too.i have to say, the food here is exquisite.she loved it as well! we had a reservation for 5pm, but arrived 30 minutes early.but again, we may have ordered the wrong things..so you order a bunch of dishes and there are small plates on the table and you pass them around.we got the white bean spread, escarole, pasta with broccoli rabe, and olives, and this was the perfect amount of food for two people.we got the following:olivesprosciutto plateveal meatballsbruschettacavatelli pasta dish.they are very accommodating with large groups and provide quality service for so many people.you really do get that traditional chicago italian feel to it as well.mix it up.the hosts (there appeared to be 3!) were all smiles and seated us quickly to a window facing table for a happy compromise.the wine selection was also good.being from out of town, i&#39;m always looking for good places to try, especially italian food which is my favorite.the pasta itself was great and the sauce definitely tasted homemade however there was no spice and 15 minutes later some crushed red pepper was brought to the table.still was pretty tasty though!the way we finished off with the hot chocolate cake and ice cream which was basically just a lava cake but wow it was so good! the perfect amount to split with another person..the paste was very fresh and you can taste the white bean, but it was just so thick.but if we were picking for any other reason such as food, service, and ambiance, we would&#39;ve chosen any place else.we sat on the patio outside which was really lovely and had excellent service..well tough luck boys, it&#39;s my day!luckily we all walked out of quartino completely stuffed and loved every course.i think we got at least 8 or more things on the menu in which were tasty.the menu consists of a broad range of items.arugula salad: light and refreshing start to the meal! a recommend for the saladbrussel sprouts: i always enjoy brussel sprouts, but the others in my party thought there was nothing great about this dishcalamari: a crowd favorite and quartino does it best!!gnocchi: excellent pesto sauce, great pasta texturelinguine with clams: the favorite of the pastaspenne a la vodka: nothing special, a little too al denteorganic veal skirt steak: a superb meat dish here, excellently marinatedbraised pork shank: soft and tender, deliciousbrodetto: kind of like a seafood stew, nothing too specialoverall, quartino will not fail you if you&#39;re looking for an italian crowd pleaser! enjoyed my experience thoroughly!.very tasty, though i must say that in a blind tasting i&#39;d probably have taken it for beef rather than veal.on point here.the walk to the restroom was rough, thank you to the people that helped me on the way, i wouldn&#39;t have made it without you!.the waitress said the portions were huge as well, but it ended up being small and tiny that we were still hungry after the meal..had a lovely lunch at quartino yesterday.love that it isfreshly prepared...50, which was exceptional value given the generous portion, and the entire menu was priced accordingly.the gelato tasted extremely artificial and the screaming shade of pink of the strawberry gelato did not help one bit.our table was also shoved against a wall with a shit ton of stuff on it (plates, plate holder, etc) when the table was pretty small in size to begin with, and it was next to the kitchen so my chair was either kicked or in the way of every single person going in and out of the kitchen (due to the narrowed walking space because of the large 16 lady party)...the manager was great and even offered us some complementary wine on the house.we ordered the quattro formaggi pizza, fried calamari, and tortellini.tortellini in alfredo with peas and prosciutto - good amount of prosciutto to provide the right amount of saltiness for the dish.the first thing i noticed when we walked into quartino was all of the serie a soccer jerseys that the staff were wearing.other than that, this is a great place to visit if you go to the city.its easy to get to from uic and the atmosphere is so warm and inviting.this place is delicious.i dinged it a star because our meals all came out different times, with the last one coming over 5 minutes after the others.not on the menu, but of course they make it.a toast with a delicous fluffy goat cheese spread, bacon wrapped blue cheese filled dates, and a meat platter with (i believe) pickled onions of some sort.wine is by the glass.the place was packed (which obviously means it&#39;s good).the service here is impeccable.fine with me and my friends, but not the best when i brought my mom.food:i ordered the spaghetti pomodoro and eggplant parmigiana.but the food they have is soo bad.kudos on having a great team and good food.i think with this place u need to be selective.truffle mushroom risotto - creamy, buttery, perfectly cooked.the ambiance, price, and service all really add up to make this a five-star establishment in my book!..we had to be so careful not to devour the whole thing in one sitting, otherwise, we would have not been able to eat the rest of the food!we ended the night with a delicious dessert of zeppoles.the portions and price was small which is fine.i will certainly be back again soon and continue to highly recommend this place!.our malbec was delicious and go check out the bathroom they are quaint and they use borax instead of soap.risotto with aparagus, polenta fries, gnocchi, and cavatelli all were very under seasoned and bland.it definitely tasted fresh and fairly chewy but nothing to rave on and on about.i would have skipped the bruschetta if i could do it over again..overall just amazing.i couldn&#39;t really remember the other types of salumi and formaggi that we chose, but overall it wasn&#39;t memorable.this is 3rd restaurant  in just weeks time that have been nothing but impressive."
federales-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/federales-chicago,2,"The service: 2/5.the food was horrid.my friend and i ordered the same food so they brought the food for us on one giant plate but the sides were only one-person portion for us to share.the chips that come with the salsa and the guacamole are also really good.the crowd is on the &#34;younger side&#34;.sure if you want to wait in line and pay for over priced drinks and deal with bitchy bartenders who hate their job.$9 for 1 ounce shots of tequila is why i only give it one star.the food was meh..came in on a thursday night for a friend date.there is no fucking way that brendan sodikoff has anything to do with federales.i had fruit ceviche that was excellent.it&#39;s definitely a spectacle, especially when you factor in drunk guys throwing ice-glasses at a bell across the patio.2 micheladas which were pretty damn good.&#34;.my only complaint is that it is open seating, first come first serve in the entire place so you have to hover over other tables that you hope are getting up.&#39;s.if you walk in and feel like you found a nice open place to stand near the bell outside, think again.$18 for tacos sounds ridiculous.great new bar/restaurant in the west loop.the manager is very friendly and made sure we were okay.anyhow the food was great, recommend the taco platter it&#39;s very fulfilling and great for two ppl.we explain this to him, and he stares at us blankly and leaves.i went with the $18 taco platter where you can select 4 tacos out of the five options.starting with the salsa and chips were far above the usual to the apps we had, the sw salad and guacamole each one was outdone by the next.oh, federales.meh, not impressed..food wise--  i&#39;m still thinking of the fish tacos-- sox2 flavorful, with quite a generous slice of grilled fish in each taco.i liked the &#34;platter&#34; ordering concept, as when i&#39;ve gone to a la carte taco places and everyone orders things from $3-$5, splitting the check can get confusing.not coming back..because there&#39;s no place to wait, we literally had to hover over people to wait for a big enough table.the salsa has no flavor really needs more spice as well!i&#39;ll be back all summer long to hit the bell.so worth it!the chips and salsa were much better than the food in my opinion.tacos here aren&#39;t bad-- i had the fish tacos.i will definitely be back for the atmosphere and food...i have been here a handful of times in which it was great with amazing service but had to knock it down 2 stars for the way the bartender treated us on my most recent visit.seating was a bit hard on a friday after work, but worth walking around until something opened up.the overall ambiance is great- the outdoor patio and choosing your on spot to sit! however, the food (especially for vegetarians) is terrible..yes, now this is what you want in a mexican bar and restaurant.federales is the place to be this summer, and the latest taco hot spot to open up in the hot west loop."
el-faro-restaurant-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-faro-restaurant-chicago-2,1,"If you&#39;re a vegetarian, you do not need to be relegated to the typical beans and rice choices at your usual mexican restaurant.love the food those vegetarian burgers are the best and what about the desayuno faro mmmm delicious but be prepare to not order extras because they will not add them to your order but they will still charge you for it and if you are thinking to speak to the manager or someone  at they register they will treat you like you are trying to get away with out paying for your meal and will tell you that you are lying.the tacos were great, we had the lengua, chorizo, and carne asada - all were tasty.the carrots were old, the waitress did not smile once and very rude, they charge extra for avocado, they don&#39;t serve no chips, the torta was dry they put barely enough sour cream or beans you needed to soak it in salsa which had no flavor!.he said his food okkk.the service here was great though.i tried the pineapple fruit drink and it was creamy and tasty.- loved the super frutas drinks and horchata!- had chile rellenos dinner, nomnomnom- bf had veggie torta and was mighty pleasedalso thanks to rmf for the neighborhood comment.inexpensive.i would recommend it to anyone who is vegan or not vegan.best mexican food in chicago! and awesome prices.i live in the north side and drive a good 20-30 minutes to eat here.service is mediocre, atmosphere is authentic enough!.i would recommend someone to go there only if you don&#39;t mind eating reheated food.while scrolling through yelp, i noticed a lot of people raving about the black beans so i had them.i think my favorite was the soy chicken and cactus.we sat down and checked out what was on the menu only to find a plethora of vegetarian items and healthy smoothies/juices.the torta was ok but not as outstanding.i&#39;ve been coming here since before they took over the lawn drugs section and every time i come back i know why.there are a lot of staff so there isn&#39;t much of a wait..the soy chorizo taco is incredible followed by the soy chicken.i would take my family back.they don&#39;t even know how to treat a customer appropriately..mmmm good.freshly made tortillas accompany generous portions.kuddos!.the pico de gallo tacos are the best!! love their cantaloupe water too!cons: parking lol..wait staff was very friendly and helpful as well..the platillos are nice.- seat yourself- there is an entire page of vegetarian options, and they are all good- my favorite is an assortment of the fake meat soft tacos- horchata tastes homemade- tres leches cake and el faro cake are both good; the tres leches cake does have a lot of whipped cream, though- breakfast on the weekend is crowded, but you will get a table quickly- there are daily specials for meat eaters and vegetariansyum.maybe we had that pissed off chef and the bad batches that evening, but nothing we ordered tasted like it should.so, since i get my hair cut near 26th &amp; pulaski, a bike ride to 31st &amp; harding isn&#39;t too far!i pretty much worked my way thru the vegan options over the past year and look forward to my biweekly run to el faro! i&#39;ve always gotten great service and a friendly smile (i order in english, spanish and spanglish!)--i also love their juice menu and i think the portions are most amply and filling! the best part about mexican vegan food is that it&#39;s never bland as you can add all the salsa you want! yum!.my dad and i decided to split the super frutas drink which has like 13 different crazy fruits in it.a true hidden gem.the nopales platter was good on a whole, but i got bored of making taco after taco with the tortillas they provide.weekly stop for me and my family.we walked in to an area with busy people behind counters and were a little confused, as there were no signs or waitstaff to tell us to seat ourselves.e.i ordered tacos and they were not good at all..i love the tortas de milanesa..every time i come here i order some thing different and i have never got something i don&#39;t like.we were both really confused when we entered because we weren&#39;t sure if we were supposed to sit down or order at the counter.the food is true to mexico, this also includes a delicious vegetarian menu.the taco was stuffed to the gills with roasted poblano strips and cheese, and i wish i had room for more.everything is super delicious and fresh..the nopalitos guisados are delicious, but swimming in oil, so only a sometimes treat! the soy chicken taco with a slice of nopale and jalapeño salsa is lovely with a bowl of black beans!the husband always enjoys his huevos mexicanos (scrambled eggs with tomatoes, jalapeños and onion) or huevos americanos (scrambled eggs with tomatoes, onion and cheese) which come with rice and refried beans.tacos are lacking substance but if you ask to add sour cream cheese and beans with rice (for an extra fee) they are fantastic..when i found out el faro offers a lot of my favorite foods with meat alternatives, i was stoked! i recently starte eating meat again, but i continue to come here for the veggie tortas and tacos! whether you&#39;re vegetarian or not, you will find something amazing here.tacos - i got a steak and al pastor taco and while they don&#39;t skimp on the meat, it was just okay to me.have had several of their veggie weekly specials which are equally great.the rice was yum!my husband liked the bistec chili pasilla (pardon any mispelling), and we left with a $15 bill.highly recommend..&#34;.never having food here again, please check before you bite in.the best.next time i think i will just stick with the vegetariano burrito and an agua fresca.the chocolate flan cake &amp; horchata are also incredible! i love el faro."
cafe-central-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-central-chicago,2,"This is a totally low key, cute place that looks like your typical old school american breakfast place.my boys are still tasting &#34;heaven&#34; as they reminisce about our lunch, my husband did enjoy the croqueta sandwich but it could&#39;ve had a little more ham in it.we got the steak and shrimp jiburrito, both were  delicious.we had jibaritos which were very good.when we go we usually have the papa&#39;s rellenas, the steak jibaritos (amazing with american cheese) and the lechon plates which come with arroz con gandules and beans.i ended up taking lots of food home!bottom line: if you want to get the most for your money, come here.50, i couldn&#39;t resist.the same people are serving and the same clientele still comes.no worries, the yummy steak sandwich made up for the waiting.not to mention the closest puerto rican restaurant from the loop and just a short cab ride, you won&#39;t be disappointed.will try somewhere else for some nostalgia.the tostones were not crispy..i have been here numerous times and not for the ambiance but strictly for the food.pork was amazing.during our most recent dinner my bistec was very, very dry and my platanos (maduro) were under cooked.ridiculously tasty.after reading most of the reviews, i decided to order the pork jibarito (minus the cheese)..wow! my new favorite restaurant in the neighborhood.food is exceptional, service is exceptional, location is clean and well maintained.not sure what restaurants getting these great reviews.if i&#39;m ever back in chicago i&#39;ll give this place a visit again.i wish i had more time to sit and savor the deliciousness.so being puerto rican myself, i think i know whats authentic tasting.i been here about 3 times, but i think because i was trying to force myself to like it.chuletas de puerco con habichuelos.firm custard body and light-sweet caramel honey glazing..im done.i only had an appetizer as it was close to closing time, but it was really good.this is a greasy spoon.the food is just off-the-chain good.it&#39;s housed in a nondescript building that is easy to walk by two or three times before you realize you&#39;re standing right in front of it.i should also mention at this point that the their selection of juices and carbonated drinks was fairly extensive, including kola champagne.but the roasted chicken is awesome.but it is that good!we were greeted by a friendly wait staff who proceeded to make recommendation for a few items to try out including the beef stew, the steak jibaritos, the pork chop that comes with scrumptious yellow rice, and to top it all off, the fresh mushed garlic.they brought us some bread and butter which were ok but let me tell you.&#34; not even close.we sat in the back of the restaurant &amp; it was a bit noisy &amp; very chilly inside.blah blah blah racist.i also love their caldo (soup) because it is extremely flavorful and hearty..the best puerto rican restaurant in chicago...blue linoleum and all!not a bad stab at the plaintain &#39;n&#39; steak lover&#39;s sandwich of choice, but it&#39;s on the &#34;mini&#34; side.how have i never been here before?  wow.good puerto rican food but the beans are not well seasoned and the steak n onions could be better..chuletas, bistec encebollado, arroz con gandules, tostones, morcilla, jibaritos are just a few of my favorites.well let me tell you i was wrong.how can you beat that?!the jibarito itself is what brings me here though.i&#39;m glad i did! the plantains had just the right amount of sweetness and i left satisfied :) also have to mention this place is very affordable...i had some plantain sandwich this afternoon, and it tasted like something you&#39;d see on &#34;diners, drive ins, and dives&#34;.if i had a puerto rican grandmother, this is how i hope she&#39;d cook: great flavors, big portions, piping hot.great food &amp; nice owner/staff!.the rice and beans were okay, just slightly underseasoned for my taste.great puerto rican authentic food.which means a place like this is definitely worth checking out.so, i am here, and i am enjoying space, the music, the people, my malta, and the awesome aromas that continue to be made around 50 years later..o happy days! (clap)i woke up with a hunger in my tummy for a jibarito.especially mexican or puerto rican.i was happy this place was byob because having the wine was a nice treat.in other words, don&#39;t visit a puerto rican restaurant in chicago and not get one.17+ years.arroz con gandules has pork, would be better without it..my friend got the jibarito and i got the marinated steak.the decor could use an upgrade on both the inside and outside, but the staff is friendly."
sticky-rice-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sticky-rice-chicago,2,"I could have eaten a few more of these, and can&#39;t wait to return to try their bbq pork salapao.kinda ruins your appetite.unusual and fresh spices made the meal a level above standard thai fare.best place ever.so happy to have been turned on to you, looking forward to eating here for the next 35 yrs+.i love this place!!the sticky rice is really good, their staff was great and some thai dishes that my sister and i didn&#39;t know about and willing ordered and tried.their noodles are where it&#39;s at..i had the gang hung lay, a pork dish, and quite enjoyed it.i also get the coconut green curry tofu (comes in an actual coconut) it is pretty darn tasty.i recommend their siopao, calamari and sticky rice with mango (all addicting).great authentic thai food with a lot of authentic and unusual dishes.if you&#39;re in the mood for for authentic thai cuisine and miss having to think twice about getting it spicy, this is the place for you.of the four dishes we ordered, i&#39;d only re-order the tom yum soup.the reason i gave it 2 less stars was because of the service.the pad woon sen, green been basil, and garlic chicken are also stellar.all i tasted was spice! we ordered another meal which i can&#39;t remember at this present moment (useful, i know) but it was essentially inch wide noodles that tasted like dumplings, with bits of rubbery chicken, and globs of tasteless gravy.my other big complaint is they can&#39;t seem to consistently put out the same dish at the same spice level.the shrimp in blanket appetizer, we actually got for free for signing up with their online ordering system (other options for your free dish included bbq pork wonton noodle soup, papaya salad, and one other option i can&#39;t recall.- i wasn&#39;t a fan of their spring rolls - so i wouldn&#39;t recommend those.we went with some other recommendations, which were all amazing.there are northern thai food is really spot on.byob and close to home.loved it.this may be my new favorite thai place in the city!.we were told there was no good thai in chicago, but this met our craving...sweet milk in red reminds me a bit of cream soda with a slight after taste.no food, no phone call.i had a stew mostly of pork.since i have a low tolerance for spicy, everything was a notch or two too hottt for me..we ordered the mango chicken, an order of crab rangoon, and thai iced coffee.not particularly friendly, but not terrible either.chicken egg rolls=cabbage rolls here.i can see why there are so many reviews since this place is cheap! a lot cheaper and better tasting than their newest location, chiang mai on western.our appetizer of chive dumplings were terrible.just a head up for those who eat spicy like i do.warning: watch out for thai spiciness because they don&#39;t mess around.the staff is very attentive and friendly.i&#39;m also fond of the sausages.this is real deal thai food like as if you were eating it in thailand.the menu is extensive, with new and creative dishes showing up every time i visit.great food and we were seated immediately on a thursday night.naem khao thawt or nam kao tod) is a thai salad that consists of crumbled, crispy, curried rice croquettes, fermented pork sausage (naem), slivered pork skin, dried chilies, shallots, cilantro, shredded carrot and ginger, and peanuts scattered over a bed of red lettuce.we ordered:shrimp pad thai - just rightcrispy pork with green beans - the greens beans were naturally sweet and the pork was fried perfectly.love the food.the rice was great.if this place was a block from my condo, i would be there everyday for dinner.well maybe you should modify your togo menu because i did not get a pineapple fried rice, which was what i ordered..better than average.all in all, sticky rice was a decent precursor to an evening of bowling and heavy beer drinking.nam prik ong!!!!! what the what?! loaded with ginger, chillies and garlic, this bolognese like dish is served with the sticky rice.this is the third item i have found in my orders over the years, first was metal from the wok cleaner.because:- byob- huge menu with diverse selections- good food- quick service- friendly service- reasonable prices...they&#39;ve added a new menu item which i wanted to try -- called &#34;salapao&#34;, these little meat-stuffed buns, not entirely unlike those you would get at wow bao, except they&#39;re larger and taste much better.he just kept arguing, saying it was my fault for ordering something they don&#39;t make.can&#39;t wait to return and try lots of other menu items when we move in a couple of weeks.."
shake-shack-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shake-shack-chicago,2,"The chicken sandwich was amazing.they do make their buns like a hotdog style to keep all of the food inside of the burger which is a cool concept..it comes with a signature shack sauce but to be honest i couldn&#39;t really taste it on the account of the cheese oozing out of the mushroom.quick lunch date with my honey here, and good lord, the lines were long!!!typical american fast food cuisine (burgers, fries, dogs, floats, shakes).i&#39;m definitely coming back tomorrow and whenever i&#39;m in town.he didn&#39;t do anything work related unless flirting with guest and standing in the kitchen on his cell phone counts.but their holiday shake menu sounded amazing!great quick, inexpensive, warm place to congregate on a chilly chicago day.ordered myself a shackburger and a shack-cago dog and fries..this year, we opted for a trip to shake shack because none of us had been and we thought it was a good opportunity to try it out.one night before heading to the john hancock center we decided to stop by..i knew we&#39;d need to find our way back here for lunch..seating is plentiful and the line moves very quickly.we had a late night and just wanted to grab some quick late night eats and shake shark is definitely a better option compared to macdonalds.just some &#34;fun facts&#34; about the joint::1.the frozen custard wasn&#39;t good, it no way tased anything similar to smore and the ice cream was just a sole store bought vanilla and chocolate.the cheese is perfectly cheesy and melty but somehow fresh tasting - like all of the benefits of nacho cheese without all of the chemical nastiness.i ordered their shakemeister..the fries were not as hot and fresh as i would&#39;ve liked it i ate them covered with ketchup and pepper.my visit to the chicago location was underwhelming.i thought the fries were definitely a bit of a let down.my order: shroom burger (god yes)pros+ food: i&#39;m really not much of a fast food or burger person but this was absolutely lovely! i loved deep fried mushrooms.all in all, i enjoyed the food from the michigan location, and also from this location.i had the shack burger, fries, and a chocolate shake..maybe shake shack should have just stuck to nyc.total price for my water, cheese fries, burger, and dessert - over $20.if you&#39;re downtown shopping and would like to grab something, it&#39;s pricing is better compared to the restaurants around it.to be expected.i admit, ~$6 is expensive for a shake, but it&#39;s nice to treat yourself once in a while...for no specific reasons, we don&#39;t feel the need to visit shake shack again.i don&#39;t get the hype..never really liked crinkle cut.that&#39;s not a burger, it&#39;s a work of art (or something, idk), but shake shack is just an average burger (it&#39;s actually quite small too).you can&#39;t resist.i now live in chicago, so californians can&#39;t kick me out anymore since i&#39;m already away (lol)!now for the food, you&#39;ll be safe with any burger really but get the shroom burger.this is my first time trying this place..the buns are crispier and dryer.can&#39;t compare shake shack with in n out because they&#39;re different.the potato roll is finally starting to catch on nationwide and it&#39;s long overdue."
two-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/two-chicago,1,"If there&#39;s one thing foodies love more than calling themselves &#34;foodies&#34; it&#39;s this restaurant.i will give it another try.i was going to try and single out a few of these dishes for being particularly exceptional, but i really can&#39;t.the cheesecake was also good, but i was so full at this point.i had the ramp risotto and the roasted cauliflower with fondue cheese.fresh.the duck egg fettuccine was good, but the duck wasn&#39;t fantastic.i enjoyed the salad, but it was fairly basic.we were starved after work and just wanted to order something to munch on.i spotted multiple tables getting a big loaf of bread, so i asked one of the employees if the bread was complimentary.we made reservations beforehand for a sunday am brunch, but they really weren&#39;t necessary as much of the restaurant was vacant.we enjoyed three full courses plus the bonus dessert course (which was just the right amount of food).the meat was shredded and the flavor was well balanced with the garlic.my favorite dishes were: the banger island mussels, ramp risotto, banana bread pudding.two nailed it.from downtown, it&#39;s about a mile or so walk, a $2 bus ride down grant, or a cab ride.we had a very nice experience at two.heirloom tomato salad: super fresh tomatoes, and homemade bacon and burrata with an amazing vinaigrette made with the coveted ramps (like a scallion on steroids regarding flavor).excellent! it&#39;s &#34;shared plates&#34; style so they suggested 2-3 plates per person.wish it was a restaurant we could visit often!.they&#39;re very accommodating to my gluten free needs.i&#39;m not a fan of peanut butter, but this was a stunning dish - 5/5...the lamb belly was one of the best dishes i&#39;ve had anywhere.i highly recommend the risotto with duck egg.here are the items we had:* duck jam - great duck flavor and salted perfectly..our favorite of the night was the prawns.the food is always amazing.we really enjoyed this place.we also got brussels sprouts because you need veggies you know? i honestly think you can&#39;t go wrong with any of the plates.my 80 yr old mom is hard to please when it comes to food but said she enjoyed the food, too! pleasantly surprised and impressed.the pumpkin cheesecake dessert earned it this time as i was planning 4 stars for a very solid and enjoyable farm/local dining experience.this was my first time visiting two and i can confidently say that this was one of my favorite dining experiences i&#39;ve had in the city.prices really aren&#39;t insane, but they participate in restaurant week if you&#39;re looking to try them out on a budget.the food, the atmosphere and the service were all excellent..black truffle risotto - good truffle flavor mixed with the runny yolk of a duck egg, perfection.however, my best friend &amp; her bf loved it &amp; ate it clean! (5?/5)(2) lobster toast ($18): this dish was on the saltier side &amp; you definitely get a whiffff of the fishiness from the lobster.the bad: the ambiance is noisy because it&#39;s open space with no sound absorption.the real deal.two, where have you been all my life?  i am a huge fan of locally sourced restaurants that promote seasonal local farm to table eating.generally with groupon, i feel like the staff is either really happy you&#39;re trying out the restaurant or they&#39;re pissed that you&#39;re getting a deal and probably taking a portion of their tip with it.the chunks of beef were so crazy tender and i&#39;m a little more willing to forgive them for the once again overwhelming flavor of salt because the potatoes were also good.such an enjoyable experience too.3.the sorbet on top of the cheesecake mousse was extremely tart, i had to eat it separately from the mousse, which i enjoyed.we always like to try out new restaurants when we visit chicago, but would definitely return here again.the main course i picked was sea scallops, served on a bead of sweet potato purée, a drizzle of herb vinaigrette, and rutabaga chips.the food was really, really good.menu changes periodically so catch those great dishes when they come around.the food at two has balanced flavors, interesting textures, and are creative.attire: causal, jeans and t-shirt will do just fine.nothing particularly wowed me, and be price point is higher than i&#39;d like for the quality.it was crunchy and sat upon a small mound of what seemed to be mayonnaise.pretty sure i ordered most of the dessert menu..was a wasted evening trying a new place.i could actually talk to my husband and hear him.i love it.highlights include the duck egg pasta and the puppy chow, but the menus changes.at the end, we ordered a heaping portion of the puppy chow and couldn&#39;t have been happier (or felt more like kids).service is friendly and knowledgeable, ambience is causal yet a bit on the elegant side, food is amazingly fresh (farm to table) as it should be - the centerpiece which allows for awesome conversation and fun.- bacon jam - amazing! great bread too.just a fantastic meal overall.we were left for twenty to thirty minutes without any attention, aside for getting to order a second beer, though this too would be greatly delayed.the polenta was a good accompaniment.there wasn&#39;t a time that i had to wait very long to address any of our needs.i thought i was full, but there&#39;s always room for sweets.that being said, it was a very solid and delicious meal.the only thing i&#39;d skip is the asparagus."
woodies-flat-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woodies-flat-chicago,2,"Love the smoke house burger, and they have a great beer list!  there is also an outdoor seating area for when the weather is nice, and it is cute that the hostesses and bouncers hand out cookies to dogs passing by.i received school lunch quality mashed potatoes, that were cold by the way, mac and cheese, and horribly overlooked/dry chicken wings.the food here just wasn&#39;t up to par.visiting this place from ohio so we could watch the osu game with our chicago friends.she was so attentive and knowledge on the menu as i am one of those terrible people that can not make up there minds.exceptional smiles, great music, chatty locals with easy conversation.barely got in here because we weren&#39;t 21 even though we just wanted to eat.check this place out!!!.really enjoyed the burgers and beer selection.the monday specials are great and beer selection has something for everyone.i&#39;d definitely go back if i&#39;m in the neighborhood.i was looking for a certain type of beer and she discussed it with me in length without being pushy or annoyed.my mom ordered mac n&#39; cheese (not hard to mess up) and it was cold so we had to send it back.looks like a party crowd.called to place a take out order and got an answering service.the prices were reasonable and the portions were good.either everyone that works here is an eskimo or it&#39;s one of those ice bars that are so popular now.good.our server was great and the people working out front were really nice..maybe my expectations were too high based on reviews and that big cookie sheet they&#39;re served on, but i was let down.they were so good we ordered more.they reserved an area  for us and we had ample room and seating.it might of been a bad day for them but in the end it turned out alright.we ordered margaritas and when we tasted them and realized how horrible they were, we tried to ask for a different drink.decided to write a review nearly a week later based on a terrible experience i had at stout burger in louisville yesterday.spicy blood mary has some heat behind it but i love it..we went straight upstairs and saw nothing but a sea of blue shirts.this was all my friends choice...i cannot thank them enough for their hospitality..i&#39;d avoid this place on friday and saturday nights though, as its way too young and crowded for me.the dish had a generous helping of delicious fried chicken and cheesy mac and cheese.not only did she book the best area in the bar for my party, but she also surprised me with a cake and fish bowl.this is a place for my out of town friends.food is really good.we will definitely come back for food and drinks but might have to go elsewhere for games.visiting chicago from ohio, so fun to find a little piece of home and watch our buckeyes! the house was packed, and service was quick and friendly..the mac attach burger is what really stole the show though.cool place can get crowded for ohio games but would be cool for small groups.although the food&#39;s great, their customer service is even better.after walking by a thousand times we decided to come in on a weekend afternoon..i will be coming back soon!.however i sat upstairs and found the sound too loud as i was chatting with friends at a table.had such a great experience at woodie&#39;s flat! thank you so much to our server jess for her great hospitality..weekday few drinks and dinner saved woodies from zero stars and brought it up 2.like some 1960&#39;s living room mixed with several steam punk bits and bobs, and a large injection of what can only be considered glam camping? i don&#39;t get it but it works.friendly service and good food.the sangria is my favorite..i found myself in old town and decided this was a good place to eat! the bouncer asked me if i was waiting for someone and when i told him it was just me, he helped me find a seat at the bar and told me about the specials.she made me try the green lakes christmas ale with the brown sugar rim, and being weary, i still tried it.they have 2 floors and a patio in the front.walked in and walked back out immediately.i&#39;ll definitely make a trip back soon.we both ordered and enjoyed our burgers, but the pretzel sticks and beer cheese were the real winners.i will return tonwoodie&#39;s flat real soon.awesome staff, fun atmosphere, &amp; great specials throughout the week! my favorite is thursday night 1/2 off sangria pitchers!! also cheap mimosas for brunch on weekends!! i would definitely recommend their food.if you go, please make sure to try their pretzel sticks.i got the wfc (woodie&#39;s flat chicken) and man, that&#39;s a lot of food! also, super tasty.tried this place out tonight for the first time.i like a good time so i stopped in.good spot on wells.she suggested woodie&#39;s as she had walked by the day earlier and noticed it was new."

this was just the first of what was truly the finest service we&#39;ve had anywhere! water was provided, then victoria was next: friendly, knowledgeable, animated and passionate about the food! she described their style of pizza and we dove into the menu - and craft beers!first up, the toscana salad, with fresh pear, gorgonzola, spring greens, walnuts, all incredibly fresh and served with a nice balsamic - a superb combination!victoria had explained that their red oven cooks fast (800 degrees!) and the pizza arrived promptly.i also recommend trying one of italian craft beers they offer, and don&#39;t forget dessert, i&#39;ve only had the canolli, but if rest is half as good as this, you won&#39;t go wrong!.the rapini was very strong and just overwhelmed the pie, probably a personal taste, but be aware when ordering.thank you forno rosso for being in our neighborhood and having some of the best service and food around! we will be coming back soon!.margherita pizza was almost immediately devoured, but luckily light enough to afford room for a couple slices of locale, a combination of locally sourced, savory sausage and mushroom.the caponata is still my absolute favorite - may not sound too appetizing but it&#39;s amazing!the arugula salad is a perfect starter to the pizza..when you want to step out of the chicago style make this a must on your pizza list!  oh and it seems they cater their service to the type of meal you are having (business meeting, date or with family) which is nice as they are patient with kids and help draw things out when you want to linger with that special someone.everything we had is made with the finest, freshest, ingredients! authentic, vpn certified napoletana pizza nestled right in the heart of the west loop! best pizza, burrata, eggplant, and chile infused evoo (for dipping), i&#39;ve ever had!second, outstanding service quality!! sam was our server and went out of her way to make us feel like we were visiting a local mom and pop pizza shop where everyone is family.we ordered a decent bruschetta and prosciutto e bufala for appetizers.love the fact that pizza is &#39;cooked&#39; in 90 sec.not just the pizza, but the martinis too.we had the burrata, the bruschetta appetizers and the prosciutto pizza..my pizza had lots of good flavor, but it was soggy which was very disappointing.the drink selection is thoughtful and unique, the owner is a gracious host, and the pizza is truly a neapolitan delight.it tasted like i was in italy having authentic food.great pizza.another vote for the burrata.5 stars for service , ambiance , decor and pizzai have often visited the other location near harlem and addison and the flow at this location is very similar and familiar.had to order another lg pie from another place.this is one of the three restaurants in illinois that are vpn certified (verace pizza napoletana)  which means &#34;vera pizza napoletana&#34;.will definitely be coming back..specials are really good!staff is really great too! bar is fun and sitting outside on a beautiful night is really nice.mommy daddy please.i&#39;m sure they have to charge accordingly, given the prices in west loop, but 16-20 dollars for individual sized pizzas is ridiculous.the perfect combination of chewy (but crisp) crust, sauce and cheese!  you can tell the ingredients are high quality!  looking forward to coming back again soon and trying the gluten free version!  thanks!.we ordered the locale pizza which was pretty bomb - the sausage was great.the pizza was flawless....instead of the hostess then greeting us, she looked right at us and walked passed us to go walk outside, which i thought was sort of rude and set the tone for the service to come.so glad this opened down the street from us! we went with a group of 8 and ordered a few pizzas.this is some of the best pizza in chicago and the absolute best gluten free pizza anywhere.pizza was indeed served within 90 seconds or so.since pizza takes 90 seconds to be ready, looks a bit like just taken from the microwave a little chewy.perfect pizza every time, super fast, excellent outdoor space and consistently good service from the lady who always takes care of us.the waiter was attentive and the service was quick.the atmosphere was so great, very warm and inviting yet cool.the service was quite friendly too.authentic, friendly, and just super good.delish! we were trying to give an added half star! the outlying half star was reserved solely on account that the crust is best eaten with fork and knife which slowed down the process.i didn&#39;t try the dessert as i was extremely full but it was nice to know they had options...great ambiance- not too loud and not too intimate! perfect for a family dinner.this is my go to place to treat myself when i crave authentic neapolitan pizza.they are both good but nothing thrilling..i will dream of these pizzas and can&#39;t wait to go back...it&#39;s a really nice interior too.wednesday - starve yourself and have some wine (it&#39;s almost the weekend.great.both were excellent as was the $38 bottle of chianti.otherwise, everything was great!..a weekly dining tradition for our family!.tried this place for the first time on a wednesday night and it did not disappoint.the strawberry-basil martini is a must have! salute!.came here with family, tried the buffalo mozzarella which was huge - but wasn&#39;t very fresh.as an italian myself, i can definitely recommend this place.the pizza bread itself is delicious.great additional to the west loop ! we will be back !.their pizzas are amazing..due to the quality of the food we plan to return and really hope that our service was a one off experience.you have to try it when you go there.talk about some true italians that know how to make some goooood pizza!!.once was great, the other wasn&#39;t that great."

golden-bull-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-bull-restaurant-chicago,1,"Also this place is not expensive either so that&#39;s a plus in my book!.that&#39;s still no reason to be plain rude.customer service was the worst here.we ended up going here based on reviews and regretted it.we didn&#39;t know they had a lobster special but we saw others ordered it..it seems very clean and the service is good.we made reservations for the following week during the saturday before mother&#39;s day.it was a great decision.i&#39;ve came here after came back from toronto, but i came here plenty of time before.ordered five dishes and amazingly, one came out first (salt and pepper soft-shell crab) and then the other four came out.service was fast and friendly but the food was bland and ordinary.not going back again.some of the dishes were really authentic and delicious were as others are very americanized.one of the best cantonese cuisine in chinatown, the food is very fresh and the environment is good too..really good cantonese food served with a side of incredible savings.and this meal was $18 + tip! i will make a point to go back here the next time i am in the chicago area, and in the meantime, i am recommending it to anyone and everyone i can.this is the place i want to bring my family to for the most authentic, delicious chinese food..they truly know how to take care of customers (especially since we were a party of 10 ordering over 10 dishes)overall, i will be going here again and await my next return..if you are from the east coast and can&#39;t find any good chinese food in the city of chicago - go to golden bull!  it&#39;s worth the trek.their sweet and sour pork chops are crispy and meaty.the service was fairly quick and we ended up at $90 for 5 people, which is hard to beat.so, after, literally, racking our brains for a place to eat after at trip to the casino, my friend and i ended up at golden bull - thanks to yelp reviews!  it was completely empty when we walked by, so we were a little hesitant about going in.i have yet to find a resto in nyc that&#39;s better.i wasn&#39;t wow&#39;d the food was good, but just took way too long.the service was great and it did not take long for them to serve our food.i had the lamb in cumin sauce and it was very good.golden bull is a small restaurant that i feel produces very good quality food.would come back if i was in the area....food portions are a bit small but well worth it.my go to place for salt and pepper soft shelled crab! great service and deliciously authentic chinese food at a low price point.the food is fresh and delicious, i had the crab rangoon, sweet and sour chicken, fried rices, and bbq ribs.the food is excellent and the dinner specials are hearty.very disappointing..the place is kinda small and it can get packed fairly quick, so i would definitely recommend making a reservation earlier in the day if you are going with a big group.that would be my grandfather&#39;s cue to bolt (&#34;no crowd? no good!&#34;).local residents, a birthday party with three generations, suburbanites and chicago cops.best chinese food i&#39;ve had.i ordered beef and chinese broccoli, pork fried rice and won ton soup.we got the walnut shrimp, pea pod shoots stir fried in garlic, and eggplant &amp; salted fish casserole..needless to say, not going back.tan is great! their food good is always fresh as well! i highly recommend..we also got the crab rangoon which was the most disgusting thing in the world,  not really sure how to describe it but it was super sweet, just horrid..the bill came out at a pretty reasonable price as well..we were very pleased n look forward to returning!.and icing on the cake - it&#39;s byob! no corkage fee.the dining room make over takes them from ghetto to glam!menu had nice offering of chef specials to family fixed value meals.enough said.my favorites were the hot and spicy chicken and the beef rib tips.our group of 5 got to choose our seats as we pulled together 2 tables to sit together.&nbsp;truely authentic..their service is very good and tried to take care of every customer&#39;s needs.the only reason for one less star is that when they are very busy and packed i feel the quality of the food goes down a bit.their food is decently priced, since they have pretty big portions.they also brought out a complimentary red bean tapioca soup at the end.what can i say? you&#39;re just wonderful.to much cornstarch.i love this place.the food was averagely nice here, but the service was a turn-off."

(my personal recommendation is the chicken kabob)all the yummy eats + byob = definitely a 5 star review!.because of this we mistakenly miscalculated the bill.the meat was overcooked and really oily, and i don&#39;t think it was worth the cost.this is most definitely a &#34;mom and pop&#34; type place, and highly authentic.appropriately priced, authentic (to me) mediterranean food.tabouleh, baba ghanouj is flavored just right.the price is what brings this place down."

(.and often!!.seeing how this was my first day of drinking since ash wednesday i don&#39;t recall two much from this brunch after the 2nd of 5 bottles of champagne.i love this place.impressive!hb, thank you for having a great staff, but please make some adjustments to your food.home bistro serves 5-star food at a reasonable price.it came with greens in the side and they were so bitter that we weren&#39;t able to eat them.the salmon was also cooked well but also under seasoned and nothing special..this was the very first time i left more than 1/3 of mussels ever in my life.food was bland and unappetizing.even the bartender at sidetrack questioned our dinner choice before we came here.every.when our server returned, i reminded her to take our entrée order.so off i went, on a cold and rainy wednesday evening..lamb burger w/truffle fries ($20) - 4 stars.but over all experience is positive in this restaurant:).there is a 711 for beer across the street.the only minor knock was the fettuccine was slightly undercooked.the food was very delicious and the server was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly."
amk-kitchen-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amk-kitchen-bar-chicago,1,"The pot pie could have used a little more chicken, but the bites with the chicken were super flavorful.first day of their new spring menu and i guess it takes 2 hours to make fried chicken.chicken was nice, but at the end of the day it was still pretty much just chicken.the bartenders are so fun, especially raul (i think that&#39;s his name?), the waiters are also very entertaining.we&#39;ll definitely be going back to try something else on the menu!.really great food with some pretty decent/ more rare beers on tap.super friendly service and awesome ambience.literally 20 min before i had a beer in my hand and 30 before we were even asked if we were ready to order..good music selction and the food was great.if you want some dressed up comfort food, in a funky upbeat atmosphere, with super nice people and good prices, i&#39;d point you straight to amk.we were able to sit immediately which was great! the menu wasn&#39;t very extensive, but had some interesting items.fantastic food! our waiter (jason?) was funny and knowledgeable..she didn&#39;t know the specials, was horrible with service.being from kentucky, i appreciate bourbon, and their bourbon selection is excellent, rivaled only really by longman &amp; eagle, ls&#39;s best whiskey bar.the salad was the perfect way to begin the meal..the service was astute.you don&#39;t get if you don&#39;t ask, right?  :) i explained that i am an &#34;elite&#34; reviewer and so they were nice enough to grant my request and to my surprise, comped it which got them major cool points with me.will be back.salmon for my main plate and my date had the buttermilk fried chicken..but by no means was the place empty; when we were wrapping up every table was taken.also the chicken that we ordered was tough and dry.it was jammed packed and even though we pretty much took up half the restaurant, it took over an hour to get food.whoever is expediting the line has no clue what they are doing.so why do i only give 3 stars? to be honest: it&#39;s the music.seem like they were copied and pasted from elsewhere.this was our third time here for brunch after a really bad first time and a good second time.my salad was the bomb with pork belly.we had the fried chicken, pork belly, and kale artichoke pizza.there are no tvs which you don&#39;t see often but it makes you feel like you are in the comfort of your own home with family and friends with a unique style.i&#39;m sure i gained some weight after that lunch, but wow, was it worth it!met the chef, very nice guy!they have a good selection of beers.don&#39;t come expecting health food.came here for my birthday and the food was amazing! we got the meatballs, cheese curds, and mac and cheese to share - everything was great, i seriously can&#39;t pick a favorite.highs: not too noisy but bustling, prompt service that wasn&#39;t overly attentive, great brussel sprout salad, great meatballs, great asparagus (yummy asian-inspired dipping sauce)average: cocktails, chicken wings, casual decor - good weekday dinner outlows: soggy pizza, all menu items are pretty heavyi&#39;d go back, but only if i&#39;m looking to indulge.interior is cool with a great soundsystem, would love to dj there during dinner.i&#39;m also a fan of the tomato jam.awesome brunch after walking the 606! this gave us a nice opportunity to walk through bucktown before eating.all were so good!will definitely be back, no wait, good food and prices? done.put your name in if you are considering this.our server didn&#39;t check in with us at all.3.the ambience is great, food plates are between bar food and gourmet and having h to the izzo, big pimpin, amongst others in the same genre was quite annoying.we were too full to finish it but it reheated well the next day (i did the stovetop pan method due to the fresh toppings).we then split the turdunkin meatballs which came with cheese bread and the whole dish was huge and mouthwatering.a cool atmosphere, kale and mushroom frittata was good, average i would say...decent amount of seating between the long bar, booths, and small tables.again, i would have enjoyed a drop or two of some habanero sauce.i would imagine on the weekdays it&#39;s hard to find a close spot.this may sound silly, but i thought the garlic cheesy bread that came with the meatballs was even better than the protein.i truly live around the corner from here and i&#39;m sad it took me so long to try it! we were offered a table or just a seat at the bar and went with the bar which was great! the bartenders were wonderful (shoutout to tony and raul) so attentive, and great conversation.it&#39;s a great place to go back and try other items on the menu.)won&#39;t be back.came in on a late night when we&#39;d first moved into the area and they took the time to really make us feel welcome.we ordered drinks (basil 46 &amp; old fashioned) which were good and the food was good as well but a bit on the pricier side.nice beer menu and they&#39;re not shy about playing wu-tang either.it did look pretty crowded, but it didn&#39;t look like anyone was really waiting for a table..and as an added bonus, the music selection was on point..i&#39;d say it was a successful dinner.he knows the menu well and had no problems guiding us through a wonderful dining experience.we went here tonight for dinner and i can&#39;t wait to go back again! everything from the service (dylan k was fantastic), the food, and the drinks was absolutely phenomenal.&#34;my boyfriend got the fried chicken.the ambience is great and they place awesome music.if you want to get in on the weekends, best to make a reservation a decent amount of time in advance.ok, now onto the foods..the kale and artichoke pizza was so good, that i was nibbling on a slice from my to go box, on my way home in the taxi.."
homeslice-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/homeslice-chicago,1,"They have a rice crispy treat ice cream sandwich and oreo crusted cookie dough balls! try both!.if you enjoy over-priced new york style thin crust pizza, this is the place for you.his snot bubbles are adorable.pizza - we had the knife &amp; forkner and it was so damn good.love the loud, fun music.we started with the goat cheese breadsicks, and holy smokes were they good.i had the boyler room pizza.i came with a large group of people for my boyfriend&#39;s birthday party.eggs.my faves! definitely coming back! and definitely making myself a regular!..the service is really nice as well.not the biggest fan of pizza since i don&#39;t love marinara sauce but the brunch/breakfast pizza here is so good.me me and my 3 gf&#39;s decided to go for different pizzas and munch off each other.i will probably steal it.however i was proven wrong.does seem like a college hangout with fratbros hanging about with chapter sisters, but we just avoid that area.i&#39;m not writing homeslice off though.they were so good! we were in heaven..we ordered the sheffeld salad, which was perfectly dressed, light, but still tasty, and a small pizza to split (we weren&#39;t very hungry).delicious!four of us shared two salads (which were huge) and then three small pizzas.this place has the best slices of pizza in the city, the price is right and the service is top notch.it doesn&#39;t matter ones age nor race.great atmosphere overall and especially the outdoor seating in the back.1) bean dip appetizer- this tasted good at first because of the extreme hunger but as we continued there were more chips.buon appetito!.s.the watermelon salad and goat sticks were great for dinner! the atmosphere is so fun!.and i loved the terrace, having diner here when the weather is good feels so comfortable!.we decided to walk along the street and find a place that had some space, in we walked to homeslice -- and i&#39;m glad we did!we were told there would be a 15-20 minute wait, we perused the spot (the super cool interior includes a cabin feel, red lighting, and penny floors in the bathroom), grabbed drinks at the bar, and already received the text that our table was ready! we were seated at the community table towards the back, which was nice because we could sit on the same side and watch the game on the large tv right in front of us! fyi - if anyone had been sitting across from us (and later someone was) it would, of course, block the prime viewing spot!beers were great, pizza was great..i will be here again as well as recommend it to others..we&#39;ve tried specialty pizzas &amp; create your own and they all seem come out bland.i liked the interior design.perfect neighborhood spot to get dinner and/or drinks.love this spot! what a great addition to the depaul/lincoln park neighborhood..they basically denied us into a restaurant because we weren&#39;t 21.a few bummers though is that the wait takes a bit of time (totally worth it though if you get a pot outside on a warm day) and the staff get a little caught up from time and aren&#39;t super timely with service.amazing food and atmosphere! highly recommend checking it out.the company was the best.that said, my review is for their brunch menu.it&#39;s always on my doorstep super fast.i usually order a small pizza for myself and take half of it home as it&#39;s a very good portion and inexpensive!but don&#39;t you dare leave without grabbing yourself a pizza topped bloody mary! yes, you read that correctly.other staff were not so bad, but kelly was horrible.3-stars (updated to 4) that i will come back to over and over..omg best gluten-free pizza!!!service: our waitress was great! as soon as i mentioned i was &#34;gluten-free&#34; she inquired on specific measures that the kitchen needed to take.it was a beautiful day so we sat outside but she can hardly talk because the train is directly above you.delicious food.no really, the crust is out of this world.would have given 5 stars otherwise..so delicious!..they were all great! the meet mary satisfied the red sauce, meat pizza craving.lots of vegetarian options that are unique flavor creations!!!.some of them are really creative and unique..note that they have outdoor seating in the front on the sidewalks as well as out back on the patio.they only have gluten-free crust for the small pizzas but they are big enough for me to eat half and save half for later..i had gone once during the day, but really didn&#39;t have the experience like i did when i was visiting this past june.the pizza was good but between the el trains every few minutes (you are sitting almost under the  tracks) and the screaming kids, it was not an enjoyable dining experience..the meatball appetizer is one i would definitely recommend too.i also always have the same server -- caesar -- and that poor guy has had to tolerate me with a variety of family members, friends, and co-workers.you won&#39;t be able to stop yourself, and it&#39;s okay!i had the zephy pizza with the goat cheese again and it was very good and great the next day too.the pizza was good.we had a small misunderstanding when she thought we ordered a medium pizza but i was pretty sure i stated small.no exceptions.stinks that patio closes at midnight.before you can sit down and stuff your face with the pizza and other tempting appetizers you have to get carded when entering the restaurant.they have gluten free and dairy free pizzas that are actually really good.when i went it was packed so be patient to get seated because the food is worth it! also all the signs and decorations make for great instagram pictures! :).they were great!  i could talk about each of the appetizers or how good the pizza is but trust me, you will not be able to order anything that isn&#39;t fantastic..it was still pretty hopping until 8/9 o&#39;clock.didn&#39;t catch his name but the manager who helped me while we were there was so accommodating to my friends and the dietary restrictions we had in the group.."
nico-osteria-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/nico-osteria-chicago,1,"Many of the dishes on the menu are gluten-free on their own however some have sneaky gluten like the short rib that is dusted with flour.this place is situated nicely in the gc neighborhood and has some great brunch and dessert.ribeye and lobster spaghetti was perfection!.for such a swanky place, they really should at least wish their customers a happy birthday.salt crusted branzino is a great entree to share, perfectly tender and nuanced with smoked and marinated eggplant.unfortunately, i had to flag down someone from the bar, who didn&#39;t wait tables to let them know that we were waiting to order our lunch.i&#39;m so disappointed in this place! i brought out of town guests here and the food wasn&#39;t that great!the octopus appetizer was great but that was the only item we ordered that was good.amazing totally worth the wait !!! pasta to die for !  the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because we waited at the front bar for our table and the bartenders were rude.all the stress from interviewing was eased as soon as i walked into nico osteria.i came back today and ordered it immediately.meat, pasta dish, sandwich, fries, fig torte -- all average to below.it was my fathers 70th, long and short of it is we waited 45 mins to sit.we seemed to have several servers throughout the meal, which was interesting, but our service was decent overall..in fact, i&#39;d order 10 of these dishes.it wasn&#39;t much of an addition to the burger, but definitely added more grease and juices.btw the cocktails were great--crafted with good ingredients and served quickly.truth be told, when i first heard that one off was opening a restaurant in the viagra triangle, my first thought was &#34;why?!&#34; super touristy area.as for my entree, i ordered the branzino.to sum up nico: 5-star service, great atmosphere, limited menu, tiny portions, expensive.thick cuts of bacon topped the spaghetti saute&#39;d in onions, egg yolk, black pepper, and bottarga.00for desert we did enjoy the warm flour-less chocolate torta and the ribiola rochetta and after dinner drinks.we eventually got our tiny cheese plate and roasted olives, which were quite good, and our cocktails, which weren&#39;t.when we saw the manager coming towards us with the bottle and glasses, we were apologetic that we could not accept his gesture because of time constraints.a neat spot, great service, but what makes nico tops is the food.we came here for brunch, the food is very tasty and well crafted..chefs table!  it&#39;s the only way to go to really appreciate the art of preparing this magnificent meal!  i can&#39;t stress enough how amazing this was.i missed out, what with my pregnant belly and all, but it was a wonderful gesture by the chef.you won&#39;t find any traditional brands of alcohol.at the end of the dinner, we asked a manager for our check because the waiter never came back to our table post food delivery and he did not even try to get our feedback when we were complaining loudly.to start, we ordered the roasted asparagus and the brussel sprout bruschetta..i&#39;d expect a bit more at a place like this.i don&#39;t know if this place is understaffed or poorly staffed..the roasted beet salad we started with was interesting - it&#39;s really a caesar, with actual fried anchovies and pickled roasted beets.or.a great place to see and be seen!bathrooms clean.that alone is enough to give nico a proper rating.kudos to the chef.that&#39;s the best one!chicken liver bruschetta!bolognese sauce anything! it takes them multiple days to make that sauce, so deep in flavoroverall:has delicious, thoughtful, well-portioned experience! the service is also awesome despite how busy they get.i wish we would have eaten here more had we know how nice it is.they have a nice wine selection - we got a greek red.the servers are so friendly and explain the dishes well! they are  attentive to dietary restrictions and allergies.i would like to come back and try more pastas.i wanna invite my waitress to family picnics.finished with the branzino, again delicious.i enjoyed bigeye tuna crudo that worked harmoniously with breadcrumbs for great texture, and chilled lobster served with horseradish crème fraiche was delightful as well.i would come back for their cocktails.i had a drink called cloud #1 and i see why it&#39;s called this.we were promptly greeted by our server.be brave and try something you&#39;ve never had, you won&#39;t regret it..you can&#39;t go wrong here!!.we tried the chef&#39;s crude tasting, the orecchiette, the lobster spaghetti, and the chocolate torta.i went to this restaurant for brunch.(i&#39;m sure there are some decent wines on the bottle list, but by glass is sad.combo of some sweet and bitter greens with the salty fishies and sweet roasted beets was great.sure, this place might set you back a few dollars but go for it! amazing seafood and apps will make you a happy foodie.the hosts, who are very busy, could not have been more delightful.classy creative atmosphere with cozy nooks for lingering.when our food arrived it was beautifully plated with a great detail to presentation, when i took my first bite of my pasta dish i could taste every component of what it listed in the menu..had it at nico osteria and will have to order kouign amann on every subsequent trip.not to mention the place is beautiful! there is a bar side which is more intimate and a huge restaurant side and both are beautifully decorated.came to nico osteria on a beautiful chicago day for brunch and was fortunate enough to snag one of the last tables outside..the prune saved the dish and i wish there had been more of it.i was asked before mine was taken, but not my friend&#39;s.it is pricey, but the food is excellent.3."
beezzee-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/beezzee-chicago,2,"We have recommended it to many people and they have all liked it and come back.also yummy! she&#39;s picky and she really enjoyed it!.but it&#39;s doubtful i will eat in again..so glad to have this on my street! the people who work here have been really nice and the store is very bright and inviting.we were craving for crepes so we searched through yelp and beezze came up!we had to travel from downtown all the way to lakeview for the crepes.this is my go to for days i don&#39;t want to cook..this is the best.fun atmosphere too.awesome spot for lunch! their ingredients are so fresh, and you can&#39;t go wrong with any of the protein (chicken, salmon, etc) that you add to your meal.i could eat here everyday.they deliver very fast and they&#39;re always very friendly and excited to give me yummy food.this place is amazing! food is always fresh and very tasty.will make this a regular place.a top choice for me.from salads to wraps to delicious crepes, you can satisfy most people with their menu..food is perfectly seasoned, cooked exactly as i like it, and all of the ingredients are incredibly fresh.very clean, attractive place.delicious smoothies and juices! definitely nice to have a fresh place for a drink or salad in the area.so i came in for a quick smoothie and an omelet.it was pretty solid.i will grab that the next time i go there, which is hopefully very soon.i&#39;ve been there twice and loved everything! their shrimp skewers are delicious! my boyfriend tried the pork which was great, it had a lot of flavor.i decided to try beezzee today after reading all the great reviews.i ordered the chicken plate.the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because though they do use some fruit in the smoothie, they also use sugary syrups.womp womp.the atmosphere is cozy, always fresh and clean.to go to the next level would require gourmet ingredients like dark chocolate.it&#39;s so delicious and i ask for a side of this sesame asian sauce.a must go restaurant.but there&#39;s still something about a creperie that makes my heart skip a beat! then, on a chilly fall evening, i was walking home from dinner, and i saw beezzee, and i knew i had found my newest best friend.only thing would change would be portion sizes; however the prices were on target for what they were.the place is pretty much self serve, order ah the counter and there are 2 person booths for sitting.having just come back from california, where the juice trucks have way more interesting and nutritious options, it was a bit disappointing.encore!.i have class right next door so not only can i get something tasty and fast, but also yummy too! love this.this a follow up review.beezzee was first on our list of new contenders and was a pretty solid choice.street parking was available at mid day on a monday.steps off of the diversey brown line, some outdoor seating, clean and bright interior, friendly staff.i love that you have free wi-fi, and that i could stay here for hours with no issues.everything is made to order so do plan a bit more time for that..$5 for a smoothie isn&#39;t outrageous but they were not using fresh fruit.over all its good food, house dressing is awesome.beezzes is simply fantastic.i love this place for breakfast on saturday morning or a quick snack after the gym.it&#39;s by far the best place in the area to get a freshly prepared, healthy and still delicious meal for under $10.amazing salads, crepes and frappes (european style).at least if separate, i can slowly fill the bun as i eat, and keep some type of etiquette.i was also at the store today when they were dealing with an unpleasant delivery experience.you can grab a savory and share a sweet with someone and you won&#39;t be disappointed.i ordered the original crepes with extra nutella ;) and cappuccino, she even make it pretty for me so i can take a picture (i&#39;m a lifestyle photographer).wondered past here and decided, why not! what a good decision! so damn delicious.got the salmon plate with veggies and salad.i really liked my mango spinach smoothie, which made me feel better about myself for inhaling the crepes.good place if you are looking for clean eating foods.but the kind employees always have good suggestions..skip the chains! this place is fantastic, the chicken plate with rice and veggies is nuts.it was very icy, and when we were done, there were huge chunks of ice left over.oh my to the chocolate cream with walnut dessert crepe.highly recommend!.the most amazing salads! they grill the chicken right in front of you and for a large salad, you can pick six ingredients.i ordered a custom salad, strawberry smoothie, and green juice along with rotisserie chicken, a wrap and sides to share.i ordered a mango spinach smoothie and a mushroom, spinach, and cheese crepe.my boyfriend and i will occasionally treat ourselves to the crepes as well, which are to die for.so, when i finally get home, it&#39;s now over 30 minutes since i picked up the order and the supposed hot food is now cold.everything at beezzee is fresh and delicious.however, my fiance once got a savory crepe and did not care for it, so he just got his favorite banana walnut nutella crepe the next time we visited.."
chavas-tacos-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chavas-tacos-chicago,1,"The service is quick and friendly..this fresh gem of a mexican restaurant is a great place to eat authentic mexican food in the area.in my opinion, people on here are giving this place unjust praise.they are open 24 hours, but the quality of the food doesn&#39;t reflect that (i&#39;m used to 24 hour places having not as quality food!) their tacos are fantastic, quesadilas are great (though they are not your traditional quesadilla -- think a larger taco, basically) and anything else i&#39;ve tried was equally as good.it definitely needed an additional hit of salt.but nonetheless, being as this shop is closer to my house than my favorite taco spot.i haven&#39;t loved the eggplant preparation either time i went, but the minor imperfection just allows this place to be touchable rather than in the realm of angels.it&#39;s quaint with a nice atmosphere, reasonable prices, good food, good service.the best veggie taco in town!!  comes with rice, beans, lettuce, tomato, cheese and a generous portion of delicious guacamole.you must go here , the food is incredible.the staff in the early am hours are super friendly.stay far away.i usually gauge the mexican by the beans, and honestly, i loved &#39;em.service was great.the dine in area was small but the service was really nice food was cooked fresh on the spot and prices were not outrageous.the mexican &#34;sausage&#34; tasted nothing like meat and left a very strange taste in my mouth..i really like the food, it&#39;s good, fresh, never had issues.i have never lived in chicago proper, always the suburbs, though i have had my fair share of great mexican food due to living in primarily hispanic neighborhoods for most of my life.i randomly had a craving for tacos at 8:30 am on a sunday...the steak had no taste to it like it wasn&#39;t even steak at all but boiled beef.i&#39;ve gotten tacos before and they were good.tortilla is awesome.ask for a side of limes and that yummy green hot sauce.the food has always been tasty, flavorful and portions are good.i only like to come late night after work..and veggie tacos are not easy to make amazing.i also asked to be called on my cell so i could come down and my landlord was awoken to pounding at the front door from the driver.very well made.good, real coke served in a glass bottle.reasonable prices for lots of food.the chorizo is my favorite! this place has never failed me once and they&#39;re open 24 hours! if your looking for the best mexican food in the city this is your place.this place is just down the street from us and i am a big fan..bomb tacos and they&#39;re open 24hrs.delicious! ate outdoors on their lovely patio and had great service.i quickly learned i have to ask for my tacos with onions and cilantro, which annoys my snobby tendencies, but i gotta pick my battles you know?on the days i&#39;m feeling uber lazy and not wanting to cook, chavas is a good option for food delivery.so bland that if the styrofoam containers it came in was swapped for the meat, i would have given this place two stars.rice is good as are the beans..weird shaped quesadilla but very tasty n fresh.i have pretty much tried everything and everything is fantastic! i&#39;ve had at least 50 friends and family try it when they come over and they have all loved it too.i can eat tacos for every meal and if i had to choose one place to eat tacos from for the rest of my taco eating life it would be chavas for sure.and don&#39;t try to tell them that they&#39;ve had you waiting b/c they will give you attitude.great delivery mexican.i go here about once a week.i love chavas so much! it&#39;s quick, tasty, and delicious..big patio, needs some plants but nice.that being said, chavas has just about my favorite mexican food in the city.meat was tough, lacked flavor, and contained mostly lettuce.really disappointing.all of their burritos are really good too..so authentic that when we used to call in our order from work we could only have spanish speaking peeps do it.chips and hot salsa arrived.the only other place that comes close is tacos veloz.the place it&#39;s smalll.came because i saw good reviews but i honestly it sucked!! we tried the basic alpastor and asada for 2.my favorite neighborhood mexican spot!.other than that it&#39;s a well cleaned, good eats place!.excellent food, good service and awesome salsa.foods good as i&#39;ve eaten here multiple times before, but reading other reviews i&#39;m not the first person to get sick.i also had some of the refried beans and mexican rice from becky&#39;s vegetarian taco platter- and agree with her that they are some of the best in the city.all in all the food is great and outweighs the cons, so i will definitely be back.i&#39;ve loved this place for years.a lot.chavas is one of my staples."
fahlstroms-fresh-fish-market-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fahlstroms-fresh-fish-market-chicago-2,2,"Oh yum !!! (yes it had to be said twice) we will be back soon :).we both cleaned our plates.one of my favorite fish here is the canadian walleye which is pretzel encrusted and served with tarter sauce and also a potato pancake.5 stars all the way around.75 extra for sour cream for the pancake..i&#39;ll be back soon.oh yes! this is the perfect spot for a pre-show dinner for plays at either the 773 stage or the other one right next door on belmont!!!.at this new spot you will find the same wide selection of entrees and the same relatively high prices--but we get it, it&#39;s fresh seafood.this was a extra special sammy!i ordered the watermelon, feta cheese with basil as a side and it paired perfectly together.my husband has tried the trout and walleye and both were equally good.we got patio outside it comfortable..wouldnt be opposed going back, as im a big seafood fan...the shrimp taco was seasoned well, but i don&#39;t love it and want 3 more of it.definitely recommend..bottom line.great food and a perfect date place.for starters, dependably good food in a full-service restaurant in lakeview is a treat.i&#39;ve been a few times now, and i love the seafood cioppino so much that i can&#39;t resist ordering it.the coconut shrimp was great, it was lightly battered with just the right amount of coconut covered.first off, the service was a little scattered and hectic.the salmon was cooked to perfection and best of all u can see into the kitchen and the cook has gloves on!!!! wonderful!!! i truly like this place and we will definitely be back!!! two thumbs up!!!!!!.i love sea bass, halibut, crab legs on tuesdays.if you love fish then this is your place! their fish is always delicious! i ordered the scottish salmon and it was to die for! cooked to perfection..great food! so many options, it was hard to choose just one each.i really dug the smoked shrimp fettuccine.love the casual atmosphere of the restaurant! there&#39;s a great variety of choices, ranging from breakfast all day to seafood.the desserts? worth getting.always great.this was followed by the clam chowder.food was excellent seriously excellent.had a great seafood meal here with friends, enjoyed the calm ambiance, great date spot.i got the crabster king crab roll and it didn&#39;t disappoint.there are a few seafood dishes i want to try but i&#39;m heading back soon to check the cioppino, it must be so good during these cold winter nights.after 15 mins my friend realized something was wrong and came looking for me.favorite local seafood spot.since my first time at fahlstrom&#39;s, i have been back several times for the fresh fish, drinks, and great atmosphere.cute outside area too.paired well with a capital supper club lager..i cannot wait for my next day off so i can come back here and eat oysters for hours!.my personal recommendations are the jambalaya (which has a bit of a kick to it) and the smoked sturgeon blt.either  the menu has changed a bit or the kitchen has changed over.our check ended up being higher than anticipated, but it was worth it.here&#39;s the mix:smoked shrimp appetizer: very good..the food is good--nothing amazing and it adds up quickly.go blue!.our waiter was very accommodating &amp; attentive.i&#39;m not giving up on fahlstrom&#39;s just yet.stopped in randomly for lunch yesterday with the wife as we had been wanting to for some time.alex, when realizing the crab legs were taking long to arrive, comped us with the most delicious plate of delaware oysters, which were so meaty and delicious.i prefer an egg white omelette and it is never over cooked! i like to have the vegetable of the day as my side - it is usually asparagus - perfectly prepared to order and snap tender!the husband enjoys his whole egg omelettes here which are not overcooked and browned hard like a &#34;burrito&#34; (his term for overcooked omelettes).first they were out of the beer that i wanted (half acre gossamer).had the new orleans scramble.i got the scallops.jambalaya is also great.i&#39;ve been here twice, and i absolutely love it for brunch!their food is outstanding.whoever doesn&#39;t like this place needs to just go to mcdonalds and get yourself the mcfish fillet (or whatever it&#39;s called) because clearly that&#39;s all your pallets can handle and you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.the fish was decent but the bananas foster was soupy and we couldn&#39;t finish it.we ended up cancelling our main entrees and walking out because the chef refused to make any accommodations for a dietary restriction.the bussers and food runners are fantastic about filling the waters but i guess they are instructed to not refill tea by the supervisors? the food, while ok, is not worth the price.for drinks, i had sangria and my boyfriend had an old fashioned - both spot on.so we decide what we want and food is prepared and comes out in a reasonable amount of time, piping hot.chicago cut has a &#34;lobster-cargot&#34; and this is similar in concept but i almost liked this better.great food.my date went with the seafood salad with a crazy mixture of smoked seafood then what we thought was cheese but ended up being crab meat."
doc-bs-fresh-kitchen-river-north-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/doc-bs-fresh-kitchen-river-north-chicago-4,1,"They kept refilling our water..the restaurant is loud and somewhat crowded but the food tasted fresh and the service was very good.amazing food choices and made well..this review is strictly for delivery, but i feel like it&#39;s well past time i pen a little love poem to doc b&#39;s:oh doc b&#39;s, you really get me,your menu fits me to a &#34;t,&#34;with your delicious, fresh wok bowls,and salads that speak to my soul,there&#39;s nothing i&#39;ve had that didn&#39;t make me feel whole.decadent and delicious.i absolutely loved the chill atmosphere of this place, with its upbeat soundtrack that&#39;s not too loud, and its modern ambience.food came out in about 20 minutes fresh and hot.i had the crazy beautiful cocktail when i came for dinner which was a tasty drink, very unique.i went with spicy thai.topped with cheese and avocado with this great sauce, it&#39;s filling and satisfying.the guac with sweet potato chips are to die for.the thai noodle salad was tasty as well, but the peanut sauce was a little overwhelming..my friend and i were suggested to come here by a hotel employee who said it was a good burger/sandwich joint.do not miss this spot.the filet was good and the crispy chicken dinner was huge.the vinaigrette was light and refreshing and the kale dressed well.will definitely check out other locations.hate esb..super awesome that they delivered to our office and the food even came 15 minutes earlier than we were quoted.my salad was soooooo good.i think the only downside is that the beer was a bit pricier.i ordered the number six here with sweet potato fries.the salad had a great texture and fresh taste, but i&#39;d go without the bland radishes.it&#39;s such a nice start to your day.are you kidding me? doc b&#39;s was great.first time i had a burger with candied bacon on it (omg!) amazing!  the second time i got the california salad and chips/guac- both of which were great.we were both very happy with our healthy lunches and satisfied..i personally tried the chardonnay and wok bowl.i had a question about the menu that she did not know the answer to, so she said hold on and let me ask the chef.excellent lunch.very vibrant place with friendly service.the seasonal white fish that they used in the sandwich was lake perch..this review is only based on delivery but it was fan-tastic.it was greasy with the egg and everything, but not so much where it was disgusting.it&#39;s tasted like plain spinach dip with tortilla chips.good for kids and adults.great food, good selection of beer.the burger itself was really good and juicy, i asked for medium rare which was cooked exactly how i wanted, the combination of all the ingredients went very well together.i ordered a regular cheeseburger and it was fine, nothing special.okay we are at the langham, and saw some great reviews here but my son (7 years old) saw the dragon burger and wanted it!!&#39; we stopped in and the service was amazing..cobb salad amazing.as luck would have it we were having that where to go conversation and she suggested doc b&#39;s and then said, and don&#39;t get a burger.nice two brothers ipa draft beer, excellent burger with really tasty fries..solid foods..it&#39;s a mess to eat but the flavors work really well together..the food was delicious and the service is very attentive   would highly recommend.great place.i also got the brussel sprout salad, which was very filling.and to make matter worse, this time he specifically asked the waiter if that is how they serve the chicken now because if so then he would get something else and the waiter was like &#34;no, ill make sure you get a good piece&#34;  - apparently that is how they serve it because it was no better.the chips are delicious, and they give you tons of guac-it was the perfect amount for 5 of us, so i can imagine smaller parties get a ton.full bar with great drinks.if you are in the area try it out!.surprisingly, our best meal during our recent visit to chicago!  ambiance was pretty corporate, but the carnitas sandwich was excellent!recommended.you can choose the protein, sauce and grain.i couldn&#39;t find my way to the bathroom and a guy in a chef outfit (i assume is the cook) led me the way.best vegetarian salads ever!  i&#39;m used to the typical: $12.at fist impression, upon entrance of the open floor plan of the restaurant, it had the vibe of a modern asian restaurant because of the clean lines &amp; pops of red, but then you see the kitschy street art hanging &amp; realize they are more playfulmy boyfriend &amp; i wanted something different since we had a lot of italian food, pizza &amp; the night before had food from a steakhouse.this time i had the perfect house salad and she had the wok-out bowl.yup, i am a fan.did fries instead of the coleslaw that came with it and they were perfectly seasoned.in hindsight, i can tell i did this all wrong - it&#39;s definitely a place where you want to enjoy the dining experience with good company.like i need more bacon in my diet..this place wasn&#39;t too busy on a friday night compared to some other restaurants, so i was expecting it to be a little bit faster.definitely a great start for my first chicago meal.if i lived in chicago i could see myself making this a regular spot..blt was good but the cobb salad was just ok.the baked wings are legit!! i took my girlfriends when they were in town and they crave them now."

grand-lux-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-lux-cafe-chicago,1,"The food is great..really friendly, great service at the take out counter (by the bakery at the top of the escalator)..went here for mothers day with my daughters.it&#39;s the same thing except the cheesecakes.i got the parmesean crusted pork chops with carrots brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes.and on top of that i got food poisoning with the chicken pot pie! it ruined my day visiting chicago.they both were so accommodating and willing to help me find a non-dairy alternative to my drink choice..thank you marvin for your great service.this time around i had a blt combo with clam chowder and a salad with calamari as a starter.so good! not overly spicy, great flavor and goes well with their ranch dip.my initial reaction was that i felt like i was at the cheesecake factory, minus the cheesecake.our waiter, johnny, made our experience even more worth the while..we always start out with the asian nachos-possibly our favorite thing on the menu.it&#39;s worth the wait!.overall, you will wait a really long time for average food and sometimes slow service.save yourself the hassle.if you can, request to be seated by the big curved window for a quieter and more fun dining experience.we started off with two appetizers.(11 ppl) we didn&#39;t sit together but we were close enough to interact with each other.overall, 5 stars for the food and cozy atmosphere!!.hmm, old style looks, and it feels like a cheese cake factory without that much cheese cake.i had the chicken and waffles and a lemonade and it was all delicious.everyone is bound to find something they like..we haven&#39;t had a bad experience ever here.the only item we didn&#39;t care for was the pasta.for our entree, we ordered the tofu dish with vegetables.the restaurant has incredible food and fabulous service -- always a treat eating at the grand lux cafe.this restaurant has always been one of my favorites.grand lux has a very large menu.i have been to grand lux a few times, and i agree that it is a lot like cheesecake factory, minus the cheesecake.i&#39;ve been here plenty of times before and it&#39;s been a good experience- until now.i recommend the sunday night pasta.came here for lunch with a friend.the strawberry cheesecake was fantastic as well.so if you like cheesecake factory you will like this place.this restaurant is very cold so please take a jacket.we asked to have it redone of course because what we got was unacceptable..the menu is very large, almost too large, as it&#39;s overwhelming and hard to decide if you don&#39;t already have an idea of what you&#39;d like to eat going in.the location is pretty sweet though.i ordered the pasta with chicken, mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes and a sonoma salad, and was quoted a wait time of 15-20 minutes.food and drink quality is fantastic, waitstaff is attentive and the location is perfect for a lunch or dinner stop after a day of shopping on the mag mile.our server was kind of mia but that&#39;s ok because it was late!.just some fries with roast tossed on it.always a great spot to come to while in chicago! i could come here for breakfast lunch and dinner and won&#39;t ever get sick of it.would not recommend ever going back to this place.our waiter was nice and the place was beautiful.all in all, it&#39;s a reasonable place for dinner.interior is very similar to cheesecake factory.and the three sauces were unnecessary."
devil-dawgs-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/devil-dawgs-chicago-2,1,"It was an easy walk from our hotel with quick, friendly service.had the chicago dawg, chicago polish dawg, and a blue demon dawg 1/4lb...all in all i think it&#39;s a great spot we met the owner and got to see some of the nfl playoffs while eating drop in and try it out if your shopping in the area.price is reasonable, atmosphere is good for fast food place.great dogs and fries..i put together a better dog.so the devil dawg was supposed to be hotter.the dogs were great.hell best place we&#39;ve eaten all weekend.the hot dog was snappy, the pickle good and sour, the tomatoes fresh, and the onion biting.the chicago dog was spot on but my absolute fave is the bag o&#39; rings (onion rings).and for $5 it&#39;ll fill an average person up...the fries are covered with cheese inside the bucket and really were covered all the way from top to bottom nicely.the venue is decorated with fun hotdog paintings, and the location was convenient on south state street.the chicago dog was delicious, as was the chicago italian sausage.i came here on a sunday morning and ordered two items as if i was hangover.my favorite was the chili cheese fries!  wow that was great..get the clucker and you&#39;ll be dancin&#39; all the way home from how good it is.getting everything delivered still hot and delicious is awesome.it is quite tangy and has a nice burn..the tables were filthy which wasnt too cool.i moved to south loop a month ago and ive been here 10 times at least.myself and two of my coworkers stopped in and never having tried them before, i asked the cashier &#34;this might be a stupid question.disclaimer that i was a little tipsy when i ate here.although i&#39;m a vegetarian, i can definitely appreciate this place.we didn&#39;t grab any milkshakes but noticed everyone else was.i felt the need to try another one later in the day and came across this place in the yelp reviews..we wanted a good chicago dog, but were disappointed.all were excellent.the fries were perfect and the onion rings were so crispy.awesome shakes and hot dogs.while i don&#39;t know what the first two ingredients i listed are, i can tell you that i had no problem scarfing this beauty down, and i liked it more than my chicago dog.it&#39;s perfect to go with your fries, and speaking of fries, this place sells them in little buckets! definitely a generous portion, although the fries could be a little less greasy/soggy.the heath bar shake..otherwise, this place was great, and i would definitely return to try other items on their menu!.get some dogs, get some fries and definitely get some shakes.the green tea milkshake was perfect (not too sweet for a milkshake).it could be that this kind of food is only good when eaten seconds from the fryer; i also hated five guys the first time i tried it, but eating in the restaurant i liked it better.anyone providing a bad review to this bastion of deep fried love is a no good lettuce eating, paleo dieting chauvinistic piece of quinoa and should be sentenced to a lifetime ban on yelp reviews! do you guys seriously get off to ripping on unhealthy &#34;non gluten free&#34; establishments? pathetic, you have all made an enemy for life!.the menu was pretty broad.delicious hot dogs with all different twists and awesome fries that you will not be able to finish all for a very affordable price.so freaking good!.chicago dog was everything i expect of a cd..good for the price i guess.latin beat had a fair amount of ancho chile powder mixed in, but not enough to give any kick or cut the sweetness of the medium-large shake.to us, it&#39;s truly the best burgers we&#39;ve ever had.the fries were greasy..this place was entirely toooo heavy and got me and my friends feeling not so hot.the fries and milkshakes were also delicious..the chicago dogs were yummy and flavorful.the chili was a little sweet but still tasty.i&#39;m not certain the wiener itself was of the best quality although it was probably the same vienna brand dogs as seemingly every other place in the city.my only complaint is that there was no bathroom for clients to use and i couldn&#39;t get them to refill the lemonade.hot dog fans, let me make it easy for you.with all the positive reviews, i was hoping to have a great meal! i got the chicago style hot dog with small fries.we also tried their regular burger which was also yummy (they say it&#39;s a mix btwn a white castle and a steak n shake."

blackwood-bbq-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blackwood-bbq-chicago,2,"The bbq beans were quite good but i found everyone else,..food is okay.i personally prefer the chicago and kansas city sauces as they provide some sweetness with an underlayer of heat.when i entered this place there were a few guys in suits,.they give you whatever sauces you select on the side and they ahve six to choose from..i honestly don&#39;t know why i didn&#39;t come here sooner when i literally passed by this place on the way to work every day and smelled the delicious barbeque, but better late than never right?i got the breakfast bowl with brisket with the kansas city style sauce...i said yes, one cornbread for mine.we both chose the chicago style sauce.slow-cooked and the flavor is on point.the corn bread was pretty good, but not as good as the other two..i didn&#39;t order the brisket due to the reviews on it, but everything i had was a1the mac and cheese.&#34; i took the in between and he proceeded to stack one lean  brisket on top of a fattier brisket and then carve off a good half-pound for me.not gonna get it..seems to be more of a take out place.it&#39;s cheap too.the breakfast of champs! they do serve the la colombe coffee too for 99cents.i went with the in between and choose all the toppings to go on the salad plus the apple dressing.first and last time i&#39;ll visit blackwood.i had the kentucky bbq sauce and it was very very good.if every restaurant in chicago could emulate this recipe (great food and customer service) i would be a happy camper!.unique though..service is always friendly and speedy.&#34;fast food&#34; bbq that is actually good? i am as shocked as you are.i went with the &#39;smokey woo woo&#39; which came with two dog and was amazing! i&#39;m craving this as i&#39;m tying this....i stopped into blackwood bbq last week for lunch since it&#39;s right by my job &amp; i&#39;m glad i did because it was a great meal &amp; customer service experience! the ordering process is setup cafeteria style where you give your order at one station then move down to the next - everyone was pleasant and friendly! i even got a free cornbread muffin because it was my first time there! i ordered the brisket platter with it being &#34;in-between&#34; fatty &amp; not so much with the memphis style bbq sauce  (which is sweet &amp; tangy how i like!), a side of mac &amp; cheese (amazeballs!) &amp; the cornbread muffin with actual bits of corn.as carrie s said, this place is dangerous if you work nearby.all of the meat looks great, but i recommend the pulled chicken in particular.i had the bbq pulled pork sandwich with kansas city sauce and it was pretty spicy!! i would definitely go back to try a different sauce.went here before the loop lunch rush.i used to order lean or medium.my office is just around the corner so i come here often..you can&#39;t smell any bbq while walking by making me wonder where they cook their meat...then as you go down the line, you get to pick and choose what kind of side items to add to your platter/sandwich/salad..great lunch experience.i got a little smoke from some pieces of outside, but it wasn&#39;t that much.just make sure to keep your eye on the person squeezing on the sauces because sometimes they can get a bit heavy handed for my taste.i tried the north carolina which is a vinegar-based sauce and kansas city which is thicker and spicier.this is your place.a great lunch spot in the loop.the brisket was tender and the you can&#39;t go wrong with any of the sauces! macaroni and cheese was also very good alongside the meat.the staff was so helpful in helping me choose which sauce i wanted for my pulled pork sandwich even allowing me samples to try until i decided..i had the salad and it was just ok.we ordered pulled pork, chicken and beef brisket along with all the sauces.i&#39;ll try the cole slaw and corn bread next time around! we also had the home made lemonade which was a bit on the sour side but a good pairing with the bbq.definitely worth a try.now if only you would open a joint in dc, my life would be complete :).pulled pork sandwich was delicious, though the bread was bagged bread, i think toasting it would have made it better.highly recommend.they stick to a pretty basic script here: do a few things and do it right.the mac and cheese was pretty good and definitely fresh out of the oven - good crust and rich cheesiness, although i would have liked a little more spice.i&#39;m so impressed! we need more food like this as a lunch time option in the loop..the chicago sauce has too much beer taste to it and the kansas sauce had too much of a spicy bite.you select from pulled pork, pulled chicken or beef brisket, served in a bun or as a stand-alone meat platter accompanied with a side.first time here today with some coworkers.they keep increasing their prices..it&#39;s basically chipotle, but for bbq.the mac n cheese is so good! super crispy, but it is oily..how could you not love this place?  pulled pork with spicy kc sauce was done just right.i feel it necessary to update my review - because after all, doesn&#39;t everyone have a bad day now and again???.where they have faltered is their delivery.this place is popular with lines out the door."
breakfast-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/breakfast-house-chicago,1,"And best of all it&#39;s byo to boot..great breakfast place, sat outside.i love this place so much! i almost wish i could give them a bad review so the word doesn&#39;t get out you can actually get a table sunday morning for brunch.this spot is closer to 4.bonus for free street parking! it&#39;s also byob :).great little breakfast spot on grand..those little things impress me.i&#39;m not sure if i can ever order anything else now that i&#39;ve had their chiliqueles! all components are amazing! intelligencia coffee is so tasty also.-cappucino/latte (hazelnut-flavored)- could have been hotter, but satisfying.incredible service, delicious food and no outrageous waits for a table! affordable and a perfect start to a saturday! we had the vanilla waffle, breakfast burrito and house potatoes.5 stars, but i&#39;ll round up because of how friendly and helpful the staff are.the food looked very good.absolutely delicious and big portions for really decent prices!  definitely one of the best brunch places where you get the most bang for your buck..i ordered the 3 egg omelette and a meat sampler.their food is fresh and delicious.i love brunch, and the competition in the city is daunting..the reason for the five stars: best chilaquiles in town..the decor is understated and classy, but not pretentious..chilaquiles are a must try! only my first time going but i will be back.portions for both were massive.my dish came with two flavorful corn cakes, perfectly cooked over-easy eggs, and ham.++++++oven baked french toast was awesomenice, clean, homey--------kept on having to ask for cream for my coffee.the only reason i can&#39;t give a full 5 stars is due to the size of the place.the chilaquiles, the juevos rancheros, or just your plain old over easy eggs and sausage.it&#39;s a cozy breakfast spot with a good selection on their menu.group of 4 happened upon the breakfast house when we needed a good, quick, sunday morning breakfast on our way out of town.i love this place because they make solid food in general..very disappointing coffee for a breakfast spot.50 for unlimited intelligentsia coffee is already a win..prices are a little expensive for breakfast but at least the food is very good!  i would highly recommend it.honestly, i am a little regretful to have lived in the neighborhood for almost 2 years but only coming here for the first time last weekend.like real oranges).the menu is just right with several choices and not over bering, it&#39;s great for groups &amp; family or even to watch your favorite teams play on the screen tv&#39;s in back room.-good value for your money.following the staff from now closed ina&#39;s to breakfast house was a good decision.absolutely one of the very best breakfast places in the area.yummmmmy! loved this place so much,  i came back for seconds with more family members.i&#39;ve tried other items and been happy, too..check out their specials as well as the menu for some interesting variations of gourmet breakfast standards.it&#39;s also well staffed, which means you&#39;re not going to wait long to be catered to, something you need if you haven&#39;t satisfied your caffeine craving yet.the line outside had us thinking 30 minutes but they seated us in less than ten.it lived up to the other reviews!  it&#39;s nothing fancy which is what i love.we usually get chilaquiles, banana pancakes, the skillets (they&#39;re all good).i&#39;m not trying to be harsh, but just honest.they forgot 1 of my coffees so there goes a few bucks :(.chilaquiles was good but not the best version i have had.you only get one as a side.had the chef&#39;s special breakfast burrito.breakfast and lunch.service is wonderful, and seating it fast.smh.i ordered the breakfast burrito and it was perfect! the service is always great.i noticed it when it opened but we just went in for the first time last weekend &amp; we loved it! the staff are super nice &amp; the food is fresh- nothing is sitting on the side prepared..this is a little place on grand just north of the warehouse district.anywho, i ordered a short stack of 2 pancakes, bacon and eggs.the space is no frills and they have attempted to create outdoor seating out front on grand ave (i don&#39;t know who would opt to sit on this side since there is nothing remotely appealing to look at) as well as on the wood st side (at least this part of the block is tree lined and pretty)..the environment was clean and inviting, and well worth a return trip.its simple.i hope to come back again to review their other dishes! i was disappointed by the presentation of the salad.when eating in, their silverware is wrapped in white napkins, and their extra condiments (butter, jam, etc) comes out in single, individual packs of plastic.the missus usually gets an &#34;uncle joe joe&#34; not on the menu but easy construct from the bfast options.this hungry hound gives it 4 stars..waited five minutes to be seated and although they were limited in menu options, they made up for in service and taste.ordered the chilaquiles (a special).crispy bacon!  fresh squeezed oj and intelligencia coffee!!!    i just don&#39;t understand why more breakfast places do not serve high quality coffee."

joy-district-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joy-district-chicago,2,"My first time trying out joy district.i had a few apps and they were mouth watering.waiter was never around.it was surprisingly good; i didn&#39;t know what to expect but it didn&#39;t disappoint.only sitting at scotts table.had the scallops with sweet pea risotto- good but not great.the food presentation and attention to detail was top notch.finally we enjoyed the banana split (with bacon!) dessert--delish.period.but i will say the waitress came and asked how it was and after hearing about how we did not like it she took it off the bill, which was nice!overall the dessert options lacked soft cake selections.i would recommend coming here for dinner!amazing service overall, thank you scott for making this a fun evening for us.love the rooftop- the restaurant was a fail.it is my friends birthday, we bought a bottle, yes full bottle service, and we are not allowed to go upstairs...colin was super attentive and really made our experience at joy special.bridgette also lied and stated she contacted me 3 times and i never called back.specialty cocktails are expensive at $15/drink.awesome place! food was out of this world..i went on a saturday and it was packed to capacity it seemed..it was so hot outside so we opted to sit inside.maybe ask us first? maybe we were actually of thinking of disassembling it ourselves..., able to go right up to the 3rd floor, no cover.drinks were a bit pricey ($11 per drink on an average) but hey, it&#39;s what it is....the chicken skin was crispy, while the meat was juicy.all of the staff was top notch!...this brand now downtown eatery/rooftop has revived what was a pretty (in my opinion) stale and bored epic.the roof top bar with dj and a mister fan is the best way to spend a summer night.they&#39;ve done an amazing job with the renovations and have really taken advantage of the space, making all levels including the roof accessible.not impressed.this review is couple of weeks overdue.rachel was our server, and was so sweet.great place to meet for a drink then head somewhere else for dinner.some of my friends ordered the scallops which they enjoyed..terrible service, terrible food, unreasonably high prices for garbage."
nepal-house-indian-and-nepalese-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/nepal-house-indian-and-nepalese-chicago,2,"We have had the curry chicken, butter chicken and garlic, cheese and regular naan so far.look at this picture.chicken was tender and done right.food is mediocre &amp; super expensive..we had the dal, napli goat khasi and matar palau.my partner and i have been coming here for a while now since i moved in the area and their food has never failed our hunger.delicious food, excellent service.staff was very attentive and pleasant.shit (tatti) food.the tea was almost as good as what i had i.great location on michigan ave as well!.enjoyed dinner there with friends last weekend.the food is so delicately spiced and so clean tasting that i have to say it might be the best indian style food i have ever had in any city.we and here form out of town and had the buffet for lunch.my glass of water was always full, the restaurant is so clean and the food is excellent.great food..i&#39;m actually upset i have to leave this place with two stars when i would have given it five had this guy not served me the way he did considering the food is stellar.this is not a family place so be aware.everything was delicious and the service was great!.i&#39;d say it&#39;s definitely worth a visit and i will try it again the next time i am in chicago.we will definitely come back here again!.the garlic naan was good, but nothing special, and a little thick for my taste.you&#39;re here for the rice and noodle base from which you can build your savory house of desire.this a great place with excellant food.excellent food and service!!we had a great nepalese entree and indian chicken.it was pricey, but i expected that after reading the reviews...love their chicken makhni , dal makhni , chicken dum-sum and garlic naan.chicken makhani, gajar ka halwa, and tandoori chicken hit the spot..great quality food, good service, good ambience, and great value for money.i don&#39;t need to drive to rangoli now for the paneer butter masala fix!! yay!!.in chicago for a conference and was looking for an interesting place to grab lunch.with different dipping sauces.there were quite a few vegetarian options but none was tasting good...also, the waiter was kind enough to refill my tea cup like 10 times.cannot comment on this as that was nepalis special and i am not sure about the nepal taste.all and all, we had a wonderful experience, and are super excited to come back.it&#39;s a little pricey, but you really don&#39;t need to order much.the paneer with red sauce ( forgot the name) was good.we&#39;ve come here more than once, and always have gotten seated right away - there are always people in there, but it&#39;s not overly crowded.i&#39;ll definitely be back and seems like this will be the go to indian spot in my new neighborhood!.i would suggest this quaint place to anyone..everything came out quickly and tasted delicious! out of all the dishes we got, the butter chicken was our favorite.i have had nepalese food in the past and enjoyed it which is why i thought it would be a good idea to try it from here.dishes were very well spiced, naan was soft and chewy and the vegetable samosas were possibly the best i&#39;ve ever had..the masala was boring and the goat was hard and not cooked properly.my husband and i frequently dine here.definitely recommend this restaurant, and the items are fairly prices.the dishes are flavorful and hot!! this time we got chicken curry, tikka masala, and lamb korma with some naan.the food was amazing with the spices.we ended up drinking a lot of water after the meal which verified our suspicions.definitely coming back -- loved their curry chicken.i&#39;m not sure if they were just misplaced but chicken and lamb is very different..atmosphere was really intimate , this would be a great date spot.if you get a chance come by for the lunch buffet.have both dined in and ordered delivery and the quality of service and food have remained consistently good.the dal was a little bit too soupy, but that was probably just an off night for the dal.i would recommend khasi ko sekuwa as well.best food in the area.the food was delicious (shoutout to the palak paneer) and they didn&#39;t skimp on the rice like some places do.i&#39;d like to think i&#39;m seasoned-buffet goer, especially to indian ones, or in this case, ones with a strong indian influence.ordered chicken madras and chicken makhani (butter chicken).they make you feel very uncomfortable if you come in with children so, make sure you come in by yourself..host (maybe manager) of the restaurant asked us to leave so they could use the table..."

( omg sugar comes in grains right? i&#39;m like fully a foody but sometimes i goof up ingredients ) they also had mega cute front ponytails that were all pointy! #hairgoalsaf.the sides weren&#39;t all that amazing, but otherwise, this place is awesome.being a pilsen native, i really wanted to love this place...the bad.to me, walking in here felt like walking into a random local country joint on a road trip, which i kind of liked..i wanted all the side dishes!.the choice of sauces were decent though i would have liked to see a spicy one.one of the best rib joints in chicago..the food was good...the $2 extra goat cheese is goat cheese crumble in a little cup? not a goat cheese spread on the actual sandwich, which i thought was a little strange and over-priced.music good, service good.the music in the front room was good, but the volume was blaring so loud that i could not think while making my order.in terms of the food, i can&#39;t totally speak to the quality because i was the last table to eat, so the chicken was a little dried out.what a bonus.great food, good band, horrible service.pass.if i had to guess, this was amazing a few years ago, and time has leveled the performance of the kitchen off to a standard that doesn&#39;t rise to previous quality.make sure you try the candy bacon!!!.service overall not impress me at all even when asked for the check we have to wait a lot.the only negative thing  is nowhere to park, but worth the little walk.go to lem&#39;s bbq on the south side for the best bbq in chicago..disappointed that they didn&#39;t serve french fries/sweet potato fries/tater tots, etc.from the baby back ribs to the dry and cold brisket and pulled pork i would have thought maybe it was yesterday&#39;s left overs, but no...order it.there are a lot of ways i could approach talking about the food, so i&#39;ll just say what you should get when you come here - ideally with two people.dry as if it was in a heated oven for a long period of time.just terrible.50.the sauces were good, but nothing out of the ordinary.great music, cozy room for dancing.the band! they&#39;ve been here for seven years, and i ran into a friend - the fingerstyle guitar player - that i&#39;d not seen in about that long.the wings at honky tonk could be the trick for accomplishing world peace.i would def go back order same thing.after returning to this favorite spot of mine where i love to listen to music, i was suprised by the waitstaff and poor training to maintain a professional attitude through the night.awesome salads and green tomato blt!  omg!strong and tasty mixed drinks."

come here for amazing dim sum!..i&#39;ve been making my way around chinatown and so glad to find this place! came here for dinner with friends and everything was fresh and portion sizes were generous.the best is their happy hour at 2pm.first off this place did not have 3/4 of what we originally wanted so we should have taken that as a sign and left immediately.this is going to be my new go-to chinese restaurant.they also kept pushing alcohol from their bar for me.we really loved the durian pancake, it is not smelly but they had the real durian fruit in there, very nicely made, and surprisingly refreshing.the blonde pony tail guy who works at the bar was rude.dolo is off in it&#39;s only little corner on the other side of the walgreen&#39;s.the main ingredients really shine here and are boosted with extra color and flavor from the accompaniments.for a cheap sunday snack this is one of the better bets in this area.eggplant with minced pork and fish: love this legit chinese dish.inside is very clean and modern finishes with cozy seat.the menu offers from hands on food to some unique chinese dishes that i haven&#39;t seen on any menu in chinatown before.score!100% asian clientele and my mom got to speak cantonese to the wait staff.dining room is fancy and waiter is good.i especially loved the egg tart and shui mai-but honestly though, everything was absolutely delicious! now i am thinking about it.lightly fried large shrimp in a gooey sweet white sauce which was very delicious and served with sweet toasted walnuts.weekdays they do 20% off between 2-4.service is sketchy if you don&#39;t speak chinese,  so beware of that.but if you like bitter-sweet things, this one might be for you.typically love their dim sum.i did not opt for dim sum but wanted to try their lunch specials.u could choose different ways of cooking your seafood.food are delicious and hot.asians do tapas the best!if you check in on yelp, you get a 10% discount.free (small) parking lot, clean interior, great food.the couch like settings are very nice.i wanted to try it though.the menu was not extensive but i feel like there are some non-menu items that you could probably still order (i.we averaged $30 per person.parts fried and crispy, other parts chewy.don&#39;t over promise when you can&#39;t deliver.overall, though, we really enjoyed the food, and i would rate it as good if not better than some of the other popular dim sum restaurants in chinatown.my fav was a pork bun that laid on top of grilled onions and peppers.so, so, disappointed; especially, when we invited a friends to show them how our first experience was.this place offers an interesting spin on dimsum and chinese food that is a little different from the typical chinese restaurant in chinatown..esquire rated this as one of the best new restaurants in chicago.first time at dolo and i can honestly say that it has now become my top dim sum place in chicago.they brought our check right after bringing the first dishes and kept doing rounds waiting to pick up the card which i thought was uncomfortable.recommend pan fried vegetable and pork bun, pan fried stuffed eggplant.free parking is a big plus!i will be back, i wish i could eat here every night!!.the seafood is amazing and the service is excellent.wonderful food.this dish had a really good kick to it.absolutely satisfied! my favorites were the salt and pepper enoki mushrooms, fresh shrimp and lobster.the shot isn&#39;t necessary and the red sauce on top didn&#39;t have a great taste, if you look pass all of that the beef itself was pretty good.went in to surprisingly empty place so also had attentive staff (given there was a lot of them!).they have tables in the middle, booths on the side, and separate rooms in the back for bigger parties..there were a few instances of misunderstanding and an inability to find out whether they offered desserts or not.best in chinatownfree parkingwin win.i love gray.we came here on father&#39;s day for dim sum.we pretty much ordered everything on the menu and i must say it was all amazing.overall, everything is pretty top quality and on par with other dim sum places.the asparagus was crispy and fresh, while the mushrooms really added another vegetable that was needed in the dish.i could barely taste the enoki mushrooms because they are literally super fried, but it was good..their food is fresh and tasteful.the waiter, andy, was really helpful.service - 3 minus - so total of 4 stars will be the right one here.we had our usual (steamed pork buns, siu-mai, har gow, all really nice), and tried a few other things (slippery noodles, and shanghai soup dumplings, not so wonderful).all in all, a great place to go for dim sum, particularly as noted for a few of those items out of the ordinary..the atmosphere is extremely cute and the service was spectacular.the shrimp dumplings were just ok but the tendon and stuffed shrimp were good and i would definitely return to try more."

ixcateco-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ixcateco-grill-chicago,1,"Not your typical taco joint.next time i&#39;d like to try the duck.food was excellent and staff was super friendly and accomadating.stop reading this now and go there.the service was great.bravo!.that was sort of a bummer.the service was fantastic with very friendly servers who really kept us entertained.delicious.the home made mole sauce with the lamb was quite good.and  i mean amazing.my wife and friends enjoyed their dinner and the wait staff was on point.yumyum.we had 2 different kinds and they were distinctly different.so he sees a lot of quality of food and where it comes from.we hope he keeps the menu simple and sticks around.byob.i could&#39;ve eaten a gallon of it.another mexican gem takes form in chicago! thank you, chef ramirez, for a fantastic meal and outrageously good tres leches cake.the room is too bright, having virtually no sound deadening materials.&#34; he&#39;s a delight.wonderful food.they give you just the right portions! i cannot wait until they start serving brunch and liquor :-) all in all this was a restaurant that served very good.i went there a few weeks ago and have been craving it ever since!  the salmon and mashed potato enchiladas was amazing, and the chicken in mole was the best-cooked chicken we&#39;ve had.it even tasted good on just the rice once the shrimp was all gone.the picaditas came in two but she said she&#39;d add an extra one, no charge, since there were three of us.the four dishes were all delicious and we made out with a $50 tab.you get chips and salsa.food is easily the top mexican in chicago!  ceviche is super fresh, camarones are delicatable, and you  won&#39;t find a better carne asada dish cooked medium rare!!!!! if you don&#39;t come here, you are not eating great mexican!!!!..the hostess was so friendly as were the servers.holy mole!  (yep, just went with that) - went last night for dinner - its a bit out of the way, but worth the trek - had the chicken with black mole and friend had the flank steak -both were fantastic - one of the best chicken dishes i have ever had.outrageously delicious and authentic! wow.it is delicious.but bam the wing had blood inside.also, luis is a great server.i want to stress that the even though the service wasn&#39;t that great the staff couldn&#39;t have been kinder..chicken mole was sooooooo yummy..hidden gem!!  we loved everything!  had picaditas for starters.the chef is very thoughtful in his pairings--i love that it is byob and the wait staff are so super friendly ( go on a tuesday and ask for d- he is loads of fun).for our main course we ordered puerco a la lena, salmon frutero, caren asada, pollo en mole negro...this is not your typical mexican restaurant.thank you for being knowledgeable, professional and accommodating.started with picaditas for an appetizer, delicious then had carne asada for my main meal and in my opinion could go toe to toe with frontera grill.i am definitely a fan of their ceviche (not too overpowering with the lime which is a big plus and very balanced).i&#39;ll definitely return to try some of their other dishes.the pork is also rich and spicy, and the freshly made tortillas are superb.it&#39;s nice to finally have a spot like this in my neighborhood! my friends and i had such a great dining experience! not only was the food excellent  (which was expected) but the staff was just as amazing! they all were attentive, helpful, and friendly.we asked for red salsa and were told they did not have it, but if we wanted something spicier, our server offered to bring another salsa.guacamole appetizer was quite good also..the food and service exceeded our expectations.same delicious menu, same decor, same great byo policy.the waiter was new but very helpful and answered our questions.the meal had a different flare to it.all was delicious.my favorite dishes are the veggie enchiladas and pork in the red mole.i had the carne asada and my wife has the shrimp.picaditas: masa canoes filled with poultry carnitas, topped with avocado cream, pickled cactus, and queso fresco.from the service to the food, they killed it.if we have a complaint, it&#39;s that the atmosphere is a little dingy.all the flavors and more of a frontera or topolobampo for a more reasonable price and less wait.the staff was very nice but service was very slow.you would need more if there were more people.the only thing that could have been improved would be the service but i understand given the size of the group i was with..keeps me wanting to come back! i will be back.a no frills place and still byob.overall very good experience.our server was very attentive and the host was accommodating since we did not have a reservation.the chicken mole is out of this world and highly recommended.everything was delicious and we began planning our return visit, perhaps for dinner, before we left the restaurant.so happy to have such an incredible option in the albany park area - please never leave!  we will be back many times..the pollo mole is rich and the home made tortillas are top notch.i have owned 4 restaurants myself, and this is one of the best i have ever eaten at.service was great, and the price point is an exceptional value for the quality of food you get.i loved this place and i cannot wait to go back and try a few other items."

joy-yees-noodle-shop-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joy-yees-noodle-shop-chicago-2,1,"I usually choose my favorite fruit to combine with lychee and it&#39;s amazing.i was hungry when i walked in and hungry when i walked out after paying a $20 tab.my favorite of all the locations - spacious, fast service, and great location by the uic area..if you are a uic student, you might get a discount.i&#39;ve been to both the chinatown location and this location and i feel that the quality of the food is better at this location.beer glass.menu is also huge (literally) with pages and pages of pictures.of course this is quite hard to do if the employees&#39; attention is diverted by their iphones.everything has been good every time and the portions are very large.i tell ya that the portions are large enough to share with 3 people.the tapioca (boba) can be a hit or miss, sometimes it&#39;s a bit too chewy or hard otherwise it&#39;s usually okay.decided to give this one a try.)this location is byob.also can&#39;t forget my mango avocado smoothie w lychee popping boba! clean spot w great service just wish the seats were more comfy.i also asked for extra sauce - and nothing!.there is no doubt in my mind that this is probably the best place to get chinese food from around campus.food was so below average that neither i or my date finished our food.they are known for their smoothies.95.the broth reminded me of wonton soup, but at 3x the price.the interior is fairly clean but could use some work.my kids love it.of course, there is the classic beef cubes, tender little cutlets steeped in a mouth-watering sauce, so delectable that sweet little cherubims will come and serenade you with each bite.anyway, came here on new years day at 11am after a night of partying and obviously my group was the only one here..lousy service, manager has a rude, un-inviting, zero friendly attitude.the portions are huge so be ware you need to be extra hungry to finish them.the other guy came around finally, but by then we had finished our dinner and didn&#39;t want the missing item.i&#39;ve only sampled one dish that i didn&#39;t like (some weird veggie soup)..who knew that coconut milk could really work as a base of a boba drink - plus the grass jelly, green tea pearls, and fruit on top really rounded out the flavors..ordered mongolian beef, chicken pad thai noodle and crab rangoon for dinner.joy yee&#39;s has really good food.i wanted to dive in and swim in it...this place has the best smoothies! the food is also on point.very strange.also had the honey peppered steak.the green curry was this synthetic-green color, but it tasted pretty alright.there is another location not far from here, so when placing an order for pick up they will state their address and it&#39;s happened before that i called the wrong location.their &#34;pho&#34; is definitely not worth ordering here.her smoothies are fresh and you can see all the fruit they use.at least it taste like so!.what really put me off was that they gave me a hard time for sitting down and wanting to drink my smoothie and eat my fruit.given it was a hot day and it&#39;s large portion, i was extremely satisfied with the drink.great food, i got the seafood udon which was alright.as a result, everything taste mediocre."
lukes-lobster-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-chicago,2,"The crab &amp; shrimp roll were the same, none being too dry nor too saucy but with just the right amount of meats, mayo &amp; spices.food is good.nice change of pace from typical midwest favorites.i understand that prices might fluctuate but caveat emptor to customers.i could have eaten five of the rolls, and the slaw was pretty tasty, too.yes, people say it&#39;s pricey for a small roll but it&#39;s lobster.if you prefer to eat a lot of carbs and filler just to feel full / you got your money&#39;s worth, fine by me, but personally i&#39;d much rather reserve precious stomach space and calorie intake on things that are actually worth it.the lobster was very fresh and yummyonly downside is you are paying an extra $2 for a gf bun, so its almost $20 for a lobster roll...to appreciate what it is, you need to get your booty over to 134 n.also ran into the mayor of chicago at city hall across the street.i don&#39;t think i could afford to eat here every day tho - the tab for my lunch was over $20 for just a sandwich (comes with cole slaw) and a bottle of soda.like their bread more than the lobster.for me it was a transformative experience - quality and deliciousness are more important than quantity.i had the taste of maine, and all three rolls were great.apparently this chain is big on the east coast, but as a midwesterner, i&#39;d never heard of them before they sailed into chicago.it is definitely the best lobster roll that i have ever had.i stopped in here on 4/16 and had a fantastic variety of food.i&#39;ve been there a few times and it never disappoints.this place is a must! the area was pretty quiet when i was there, but the food is amazing!! i had the lobster and crab sandwich and i say they taste better than the ones i had in san francisco (i am from sf).please don&#39;t serve me moldy food again..the rolls at this place are fresh and delicious...so surprised, but it was amazing!!! a lobster roll that&#39;s not filled with mayo and makes you feel so gross after!!!the lobster roll was the best but the crab roll was good as well.my second time here and it&#39;s still a great meal! it is a bit pricey but it&#39;s to be expected because it&#39;s seafood.this is the best lobster roll and worth every penny.delicious! filled with tons of lobster! definitely worth going to if in chicago! big chunks of lobster, little bit of mayo, and a roll! simple by delicious..that would&#39;ve even been okay if it had been the most delicious crab roll ever but it was also just fine.i would have liked it slightly more if it had a tad more mayo.the total came out to be around $45.we also ordered the new england clam chowder which was delicious.overall i felt that the food, location, vibe and service were all more than on point, but would hesitate to go back because of what i feel were unreasonable portions..luke&#39;s lobster is worth the visit! i&#39;m gluten free and told the woman taking my order that i just wanted my food on the plate but was informed they have gluten free buns! the portions are spot on and the flavors are delicious.if i had the finances, i&#39;d eat here 3x a day, that&#39;s including breakfast.when we got back home and took out everything, both coleslaws were missing.their gluten-free bun is good (the bun is the reason my review isn&#39;t one star)..and i ain&#39;t got sh!t to do..the food was delicious! my favorite was the lobster roll..the location that they have now is right in front of the city hall.it&#39;s a small spot, with a few outside tables as well.grabbed some food to go.people don&#39;t wait in a straight line to place their orders.they have the lovely wooden tables and chairs as well as a board saying: &#34;out for fishing&#34; when it is closed.the bread i felt is a lot better than da lobsta as well..i made the best decision i feel.they serve their lobster chilled, just how i like it on a hot day.luke&#39;s does a good job of not chilling the lobster too much.this place is definitely excellent! i ordered the lobster roll and the lobster was fantastic and the buttery bun was also fantastic.&#34; perfect!like i said, just a couple service hiccups so this was going to be four stars but i have to dock on that punch card deal.worth a try.the staff was super friendly and quick and the place has a nice chill vibe to it.i will definitely return but it will be a &#34;treat&#34; to splurge on for me.this restaurant is a must-visit for seafood lovers.i was going for the lobster roll but on the advice of a worker there i got the crab roll.yeah it&#39;s pricey- but it&#39;s real lobster in the midwest, what do you expect? i couldn&#39;t afford to go here for lunch regularly but it&#39;s a nice treat here and there.the lobster meat itself was some of the best in memory - fresh, sweet, tender, succulent.in town for business and needed a quit bite.luke&#39;s has one of the best lobster rolls in the city.my lobster roll tasted fresh - no fishy after taste or smell and it was a classic recipe.amazingly fresh food!! worth every cent.it was $50+ for two people which was super expensive though all the items were delicious..definitely come here for delicious food!."

greenriver-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/greenriver-chicago,1,"I immediately did! the decor and ambiance is beautiful.having said that i&#39;d come to have a drink on the patio.i got the steak-frites and i loved it.i live a block away and i&#39;m &#34;big on yelp,&#34; lol.i tried 5 difference cocktails, all recommended by the bartender.the lunch menu was small and condensed..that being said, if you absolutely hate cucumber i would avoid ordering this dish as the &#34;sauce&#34; was significantly cucumber-infused.great food and drink: steak tartare and beer selection.it&#39;s so chic and inviting that i wanted to stay all afternoon.for the prices, i expect better.there service was rather good.the restaurant is inside of northwestern and you really have to be looking for it to find it (you definitely won&#39;t be accidentally stumbling into this place).in a word, spectacular.my scale:5 stars: i recommend this without any exceptions.yes it was worth the $20 for one drink, maybe you wouldn&#39;t go there often but it&#39;s well worth it because that&#39;s how special they are.nice art work on the walls( and glass in the lobby downstairs.yum!!!i was also pleased that i didn&#39;t have to sit there and wait for my tea to brew (common practice which i find very annoying) they brought out my tea in a pretty glass pot, with a wonderful aroma, completely ready for consumption, at the drinkable temperature!everything about this place was set up for a perfect evening, timely and delicious.still a decent neighborhood place to bring out-of-town guests in a pinch.we celebrated my mom&#39;s birthday last night and had exceptional service from our server and the entire staff.fortunately, the positive experience didn&#39;t stop there.trying too hard..i will definitely go back again.highly recommend!.that&#39;s all i can say as the perfectly cooked skate wing with roasted squash and black lentils has left me speechless.the best was my friend&#39;s cauliflower soup.it has the most outstanding rooftop with a spectacular view of the city that will blow your mind away.greenriver was promptly added to my &#39;to try&#39; list as soon as i found out it was opening inside northwestern memorial.i plan to be back on a nicer day and sit in their outdoor patio.people are starting to find out about it :-)the oysters were to die for, hamachi amazing, but the best thing on the menu was the skate wing! go there, you won&#39;t regret it!.the view of the chicago skyline is beautiful, i recommend going right before sunset for the magical pink sky &amp; buildings..5 starsdessert - while we were pleasantly stuffed we made sure we saved room for desert.they really need to read the comments in their opentable requests.my friend got one mocktail and i ordered one drink, the alderman - rye based -$13.rude.both were cooked perfectly and had lovely flavor.they have over 25 bitters, none of which are labeled but the bartenders just know them by where they are placed in the row and by color and viscosity.loved every second of my experience.lastly, supernova was a drink similar to law-maker with a less sweet undertone.definitely try to get a table by the window if you can.this place never disappoints - best craft cocktails in chicago.drinks: my husband had the old fashioned...we sat on the balcony and it was one of the best views in the area! we live in streeterville and are always looking for great close places, this is now one of our staples.gnocchi lightly carmelized outside, mushrooms with great buttery flavor and tang, creamy slightly nutty green sauce.the view from the terrace is open and airy which means it isn&#39;t surrounded by a lot of buildings similar to other chicago rooftops.the service was excellent, and the food was nicely crafted with much thought put into the ingredients, preparation, and presentation.first of all, the atmosphere is quite breathtaking, as we sat on the 18th floor and had a beautiful view of the city.all around it was good, but just good.i liked how the menus explained the history behind each cocktail, interesting stuff.there are so many locations in chicago with great charm and ambience, why would danny meyer put a place here ?  would he do that in nyc?bathrooms dirty and poorly maintained.but you are in streeterville what do you expect?the bar staff are very knowledgeable and entertaining.it&#39;s just not classy to let the servers drink at the bar, even if they are not on the clock.the best restaurant in chicago for me!!i&#39;ve been to few famous restaurants in downtown area but this restaurant is the best for me.the microgreens added a hint of raw vegetable juice to the english peas and mushrooms.order those 3 things and you&#39;ll be happy!..i mean really--how bad can a fried chicken sandwich be?  the frites were also very delicious.well then.we started with the beef tartare which was a nice sized portion and good for sharing.double neat if you have a doctor&#39;s appt there and your parking is validated, you have to go then!i waited for 15 minutes at the bar until i could get someone&#39;s attention.we went for a bachelorette party dinner and they welcomed us with champagne to celebrate..the place is great and mixologists are better!.ok so now done with the complaining and on to the food.i took a seat at the bar and was immediately greeted by friendly and attentive bartenders.the host was calling me less than a minute later to let me know they had it up front waiting for us...cooked medium rare and too perfection, it was one the best steaks we have had in a while.not many choice for vegetarian, but they were able to do it and it was amazing.the drinks were phenomenal as well.cheesy fries are good.i ordered the pork belly for dinner and just about died it was so good.excellent food and even better service."

naf-naf-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/naf-naf-grill-chicago,2,"The pita is amazing.mighty tasty middle eastern fair, great for a quick bite at lunch time.there&#39;s a good amount of seating, but because it gets so crowded, i wouldn&#39;t recommend bringing a group.the menu is reduced, i&#39;m sure to facilitate quicker service.staff is super friendly and helpful.also, the line was moving quick, they have the lunch rush down.the only thing i found confusing really was that they have schnitzel listed as an item on their website..the line was long but they move pretty quickly.i am not sure about the chips, but if you are into soggy fried potato type things, you might like these..the chicken shawarma is delightful and their lentil soup is wonderful on a chilly day.falafels were average to a little smaller and hot.i will def come back though, i loved the main dish!i&#39;m updating my review from 4 to 5 stars because the more i come here the more i love the food..it&#39;s amazing to me.it has the same assembly line concept as roti, chipotle, and subway and the line is out the door at noon.i had the steak swarma and the naf naf fries.delicious pita and the best falafel in town!!!  my new go to spot when in the mood for this kind of food.they are one of the reasons i&#39;m addicted to this place.pretty fast for a long line.it is a whole dollar more but worth it because it is a very filling salad and the best part it still comes with that fluffy as a pillow pita!!!!  there is not any other place that makes their pita as great as this place.line goes out the door during lunch time.i used to work at a building just down the street from this place.the sauces they have are impeccable too...this is my favorite place ever! i&#39;m a vegetarian so definately a right place for me, but what i love the most about this place is the good vibes!! it seems they have my playlist! 311 rebelution and bob marley while eating the smoothest bread and most crispy falafel? not bad for a break!! finally an affordable fast food restaurant with perfect environment.the bread is the bomb (so soft) and the fries (thin like potato chips) aren&#39;t half bad either..simply put, get some easy labels to put on the glass, so i know what you have.we ordered our shawarma and customized it (chipotle/subway style) with hummus, cabbage, and sauces.fast food done right.with places like taza and benjyahuda on our regulars list, it&#39;ll be hard to justify hitting naf naf for anything other than a change of pace every once in a blue moon.i really dont get the hype over naf naf grill - yes its like a mediterranean style chipotle and yes it has soft pita and nice salad and ok shwarma but it is nowhere as &#34;good&#34; or representative of mediterranean food as chipotle is of mexican food.seriously, super soft and almost pillowy.and, best to talk as much as you can beforehand, because your breath will make your personal space open up quite a bit afterwards...wtf! as in, what the falafel!hands down, the falafel at naf naf grill is king.food is fresh.naf naf is the new winner!  $7 for this was a bit of a crime; five small pieces of falafel mixed with the other items left me fairly hungry, and nothing about this was special.nevertheless, i&#39;m fairly sure i&#39;ll be here again soon!.in downtown chicago it&#39;s always nice to have more healthy options, and i enjoy mediterranean food which is about as healthy as you can get.love this place!  i usually get the rice or hummus bowl with steak and you can get as many sauces and toppings as you desire (hummus is extra $$).the line will stretch out the door and down the sidewalk.you order your food assembly line style and the service is very fast and efficient.there&#39;s a cucumber salad mix you can add to your bowl, which is absolutely delicious.i always devour it and then feel terribly full but i can&#39;t just eat half! great place, very fast and efficient service, consistent food..a chicken shwarma bowl with baba ganouj or hummus and one falafel hits the spot with their amazing pita whenever i&#39;m in the area for a quick lunch.that&#39;s it.the hummus, tahini, and spicy chutney are the best i have had anywhere, not to mention the crispiest salad.the chicken shawarma bowl was really good, the lentil soup okay, but i was unimpressed with the faux-puta bread even if obviously baked on site.i get fresh herbs and spices and tenderness and juicy and ah!  i love it!  i&#39;m not sure that a pita came with a bowl all along, i think i may have heard or read that it didn&#39;t but you get one pita with your bowl now.veggies are fresh and crunchy, falafel are crisp on the outside and perfectly seasoned, and the bread- oh my god the bread- is so pillowy soft that you&#39;ll forgive your indulgence immediately.i got the chicken schwarma bowl with everything and turned it into a meal with the lentil soup.be weary of heading here at lunch time.also the line at this location is crazy long during lunch hours.thankfully it&#39;s behind my work building so easy to get to and convenient.oh my god! what is this hardened, orange paste in the bottom of my salad bowl?! did they give me a dirty bowl!?  nasty!! i hope this doesn&#39;t make me sick.the menu is a little limited and the ordering process is a little rushed (per my two experiences) but the staff are friendly, the prices are good and the flavors are really outstanding.the chicken and steak were dry and lacked flavor..beware of the lunch rush line! moves fast, but still a 5ish minute wait.a subway/chipotle style shwarma place.it&#39;s a great lunch spot in the loop!.it&#39;s quite a walk, considering how i only have an hour for lunch and there was a long line extending to the door when i arrived at 12:30pm.it was mesmerizing..the menu is pretty basic, a few different variations of the same foods, namely chicken shwarma, steak shwarma and felafel.i opted for a hummus bowl with chicken and the veggie salad on top with garlic sauce with a free pita on the side for just under 10$.great concept, great food.you won&#39;t have a long wait, this place moves!i tried the chicken shawarma bowl with rice and all the toppings and a garlic sauce...the line was already building up at 11:40 am today.seriously so much sodium goes into that bowl.this is a good go-to place when a schawarma craving hits.this place is amazing."
giordanos-chicago-18,https://www.yelp.com/biz/giordanos-chicago-18,2,"So worth waiting 40 minutes for the stuffed pizza.it  mwas definitely different than the usual pizza.only negative thing to say is that we only saw our waitress when we ordered and when we got out checks.my god is this pizza good or what!? my waitress geneva was just as good as the delicious food.but my stomach does not feel good after that.if i hadn&#39;t had a flight back home, i&#39;d still be sitting there eating my way through the menu.my order was ready when i got there, and it was a great lunch! lou&#39;s pizza is too bread-y, gino&#39;s is too sauce-y, but giordano&#39;s is extra cheesy which is what i like! you can literally see the layers of it all when you cut through it, which is awesome..giordianos is consistent, tasty, and always good service.giordano&#39;s has deep dish pizza in its purest form...they didn&#39;t even put my parties name on the list and had to wait 1 hour before asking if i was ever going to get a seat.a must visit in chicago!!!!!!.i ended up ordering the garlic fries and pepperoni personal sized deep dish pizza.now i know people from new york city have a hard time accepting a pizza you have to eat with a fork but i have a hard time accepting a slice of pizza that is folded in half to eat.just a lot of cheese and not much else.the sausage and pepperoni is plentiful in these pies and you can tell theyre made with fresh high quality ingredients.it was fantastic.5 for the bruschetta.if you&#39;re at the sears tower and craving deep dish, you should come to giordano&#39;s for some good pizza.side note: the pizza is actually much better cold when the sauce gets a chance to congeal and solidify.the restaurant has three seating areas.will i try it again? prob&#39; not.decent lunch deals but my deep dish crust tasted as if it was stale.got a personal deep dish pizza and a small cesar salad.can you find better options?  probably.and a lot of that thickness is cheese.the pizza was good, it was unusual to me, because the sauce was on top.it&#39;s a delight for meat eaters and pizza lovers.overall; definitely a good pizza, it just has tough competition!.originally went off the other reviews, but some friends confirmed their love for the deep dish pie after the fact.you might don&#39;t feel good.we have their pies shipped down here to texas.food wise, we didn&#39;t try their pizza because we didn&#39;t have time to wait for an hour for the pizza as we had a train catch but the food hat we ordered were tasty.the outside always wasn&#39;t burnt and the marinara sauce very zestful.apart from the wait time of 45mins for our pizza, everything was great.but worth it for a better experience than the randolph location- i would not recommend it.imagine dying and going to pizza heaven where when you take one bite and a symphony of orgasms hits you in the face like a 10 foot wave crushing down on your soul.they told me this was the place to go in chicago.regardless i would come back.my disclaimer is that it was not bad pizza by any means.pepperoni on one side and the other side had sausage, green pepper, and onions..lots of options to pick from.the pizza took 45 minutes to cook fresh, so it was fresh when it came to the table but honestly nothing special.when traveling with a large group, you sort of realize that food and service will be iffy and our trip to giordano&#39;s lived up to that trend.i came here after visiting willis tower.i can&#39;t wait to go back to chicago just so i can eat here again.you are good.obviously chicago style pizzas are going to be expensive, but if i&#39;m paying $21 for a medium cheese pizza, i&#39;d want better quality consistently than what i got.i went to the one on jackson street! the easiest way to order take out, is online.this place has the best chicago pizza ever.this place was delicious! we went after going to the willis tower.i really think this place is completely overrated.the place was ok but they made me sit at the bar."

umai-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/umai-chicago,1,"I ordered spicy shoyu ramen.the staff was friendly and responsive.my main problem is that i felt so rushed.their service is always outstanding.all were good.great portions and price, however, the food really was just okay.i didn&#39;t get to try too many things on the menu since there was just two of us, but i thought the food i ordered was really good.there was a small patio outside so we opted to sit outside even though no one else was sitting there.the restaurant is always full with other patrons, but we&#39;ve never had to wait long to be seated.one of the managers tried to mitigate the situation, but at that time we had been sitting there for well over an hour and did not wish to wait another half hour for our food.i definitely have to come back to try that!!.the style of restaurant is nice.ginger cinca cocktail: was ridiculously sweet.generous, generous portion of noodles and slices of chashu, very filling.a friend told me later this place is great for curry, i would return for the value and try that instead.(i&#39;ve had same server three times over five months, inside/outside! and he is always smiling.stopped by this spot because i was craving sushi...we were craving some ramen and sushi and found this gem on yelp.i got to stop in here for lunch while i was in the neighborhood, and luckily there was no long wait though the restaurant was full! right when you walk in, the amazing smell greets you, which you know is a good sign for things to come.servers were friendly, the store itself was aesthetically pleasing, and the food was great! dipping noodles for me and curry for my love.delivery came late, sushi was poor quality, miso was bland.i can&#39;t remember anything we ate that wasn&#39;t delicious.lastly, the yakitori skewer items (pork shoulder and beef tongue).it is expensive, yet it is so delicious! my friends and i recommend eating salmon sashimi, it is so delicious!!!besides the service isn&#39;t kind! like my order was made wrong.not sure what possessed me to order a mojito, i seriously never drink, drinks like that, but it was really good!.i have never eaten something from there i didn&#39;t like!.i tried the tuna and salmon.my server was attentive and not overwhelmingly so - especially since i was eating by myself.as for the ramen, the noodle texture were more like egg noodles (full disclosure: my guideline for ramen is santouka).the salmon was dressed in a sweet sauce and cooked to a firm texture.i ordered salmon sashimi on sushi rice and the spicy roasted garlic pork ramen while my colleague ordered the soba noodles..noodles were still a little al dente so to speak, which is something i prefer, and it also had great texture.this along with a few kirins and it was a good night.good lunch specials during the weekday if you can make it..check it out!!.the service.unfortunately, my dish of spicy garlic ramen tasted suspiciously like shin ramyun black ($1/bag) ramen with a few bits of meat and garlic put in.the taste of tempura is far from the one i had in japan.usually you want the opposite.the unagi don was good, the sukiyaki is very so so, too salty, filled with soy sauce..it&#39;s a good and cozy little place.it wasn&#39;t what i expected.the bus boy wasn&#39;t even serving us for the whole time.the service can be a bit slow, and the drinks aren&#39;t the best.giant, hot bowl of slightly spicy ramen, what more is there to love? great appetizers too (try the ika butter!!), and great atmosphere.had the sake sashimi and umai roll and both were fresh and delicious.haven&#39;t tried reman yet, looks good tho.the broth had great flavor and the pork was cooked perfectly.my favorite was the smoked salmon sashimi.this place is a total gem.the food, however, gets a 5 stars.it tasted okay and i can live without it.the soup is slightly on the salty side..especially when i am in the business trip, i miss my country food.highly recommend the spicy garlic ramen - the broth was super savory with tiny bits of meat infused in it and the noodles were nice and chewy.they have a good sake list, as well as great quality sashimi..we finally get one who seemed to be missing the whole time during dinner.third wheeling on a friend&#39;s date with her boyfriend? go here.never coming back again.our party of 3 ordered a few different items: one had a generous serving of sushi with maybe 8 or 9 different types of fish which were all really delicious.nothing was fresh,broth tasted like water and soy sauce,shrimp and chicken was overcooked, the molted egg was in a cupcake holder like they did it in the microwave.the waiters and waitresses are all great.good quality food!they have lunch sets ($10 - $15) &amp; is enough food to put you into a food coma!their soup noodles are all really good - beef sukiyaki, tempura udon &amp; pork belly ramen are all a must try!the nigiris are very fresh and they are large cut, draping over the rice.the spicy unagi, bbq cauliflower and shitake mushrooms are all delicious."

green-street-smoked-meats-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/green-street-smoked-meats-chicago,1,"Crusted with a rub that had lots of whole mustard seeds, this was so good!!  fatty in a perfect way.it&#39;s fun and tasty..the pulled pork was probably the best i ever tried so was the hot link and brisket.the pork ribs were the best - perfectly smoky, juicy, and tender - but only ~2 ribs to the 1/2 pound, meaning each rib was close to $5! the pastrami was very tasty (not katz&#39;s level deliciousness) if a little salty.awesome place.great atmosphere, a little interesting entrance, kind of like an &#34;secret ally&#34; type esk like pub...don&#39;t squeeze the lime onto it and you&#39;ll be satisfied.but who really cares?the brisket.i look forward to trying the other menu items!.the food here was so good.the elotes corn in a cup was fresh and flavorful and the broccoli salad was fantastic..i learned my lesson though, never order their macaroni salad.i shared it! all of it was delicious! brisket was super tender and delicious! pulled pork was flavorful and juicy! the sides we surprisingly not too heavy and complimented well with the meats.after hearing reviews that the food was good but expensive my husband and i gave it a try.if you come at night or weekends be prepared to wait; but if you come for lunch during the week around 1:00pm - 1:30pm the wait is pretty much nonexistent.drooling just thinking about their bbq..sliced brisket3.the outdoor seating is picnic-style seating.i loved the atmosphere of this place tucked away in the west loop.good food and a fun night!when you walk in the door your order food from the counter in a cafeteria style set up around $12 per main dish.not being born yesterday we snagged it and parked it.a big thank you to mike and his staff for letting me hold a cake that was meant for my boyfriend.tender, juicy,  flavorful, melt in your mouth good is the only way to describe it.the macaroni salad was good too but nothing like the other two.cafeteria style service, paper boats for the food, rolls of paper towels on the picnic tables and tubs full of bottled beer..the ambience is fun and energetic.the decor is quite cool and i like the ping-pong table.i had the pork belly which was melt in your mouth fantastic..the smoke was perfect not to smokey just had a perfect smoke ring which wasn&#39;t to overpowering u could still taste the meatpork belly:if u love bacon you&#39;ll love this even more..i would highly recommend this place to all those who are new to chicago.salt, contains sodium which regulates blood pressure, supports nervous system function, enable water retention, maintains electrolyte balance and prevents muscle cramping etc.now onto the sides, we got the beans which i&#39;m generally not a fan of, we got the corn elote so they get a star for that because that was pretty bomb and we also got the broccoli salad which my husband seemed to like and the spicy pickles weren&#39;t bad..went again and tried some same and some new.first, the decor of the restaurant is mesmerizing.great open atmosphere, music is played via a record player and there is no tv.* apple crisp - kind of a letdown.don&#39;t make an excuse, just come here..i was too full to drink so i can&#39;t comment on the bar, but i loved the venue and the bulb lit alley patio.i would have say, green street smoked meats gives any small town southern joint a run for its money.the coleslaw was of the vinegary variety.no complaints here!the &#34;legendary&#34; line for food was virtually non-existent and i even became the lucky recipient of a complimentary scrap of brisket left behind by a penny-pinching customer that deemed it to make her overall order &#34;too heavy..i tried the sliced brisket &amp; some sides; i must have been the first one there cause they pulled out a fresh one ladened with bark and cut her up! he gave me some bark, some fatty, some lean.unlike some bbq places, there aren&#39;t a plethora of sauces, but what they have is excellent.service is good, they know you&#39;re here for a good time and to get dirty with industry.i wish everything was a little bit cheaper, because i would have loved to try every single meat.the pastrami was out of this world tender and delicious.planning on getting there earlier next time to try the pork belly..ambiance is very cool--picnic tables that have ample supplies of much-needed paper towels.i didnt get enough..i got the beef brisket and it literally melted in my mouth; the seasoning and the thickness was just right! i got the broccoli salad and the corn and lets just say the corn was gone within two seconds.i absolutely love the atmosphere and it&#39;s great for lunch, dinner, snacks or just drinks.the barbecue sauces were also delicious.the best item, as raved, is definitely the *pork belly*the belly was braised perfectly, and the tender cuts of pork literally &#34;melted with the fat&#34;.they&#39;re everything you want out of baked beans: smokey, meaty, sweet, salty, tangy, dialed all the way up to eleven.i&#39;ll come here since i live in chicago now.-it smells good inside-its a lovely spacious room-the atmosphere is nice, music, etc.the interior is rustic and has a hipster vibe, but it&#39;s warm and inviting..yes, it&#39;s a bit pricey, but absolutely worth every dollar!!!ordered the beef brisket, chopped brisket, macaroni salad, baked beans, broccoli salad, and the elotes! so far the best bbq joint i have tried and the interior is beautiful and sets the mood for a good time!the briskets were so flavorful and tender and fatty in all the best ways.it&#39;s got a casual/divey theme going for it but it&#39;s also very classy looking at the same time.sawada coffee is located in the same building.they have a great selection of local brews.they have good beers as well so it&#39;s perfect to go at any time.the oh-so-tasty fat on the brisket and the pork belly was just that: oh-so-tasty.spicy pickled veggies- great! cute server- yay!so yeah- go here.there are sandwiches as well, but when there&#39;s meat to be had, i don&#39;t like to fill up with too much bread.we popped in around 4pm on the weekend and there was no wait, although it started getting packed around 6pm.we&#39;ll probably return to try something else next time and hang outside for a bit.if you are looking for some good bbq, check this place out in chicago.overall: 4.there&#39;s a picnic like table setting which can accommodate up to six persons.if you eat halal meat, just ask them and they will get you the halal meat.food is served cafeteria style.we got coleslaw on the side, along with macaroni salad, and they threw in some of this pickle/onion combo.finally made it here and it did not disappoint, the company and conversation might have but its not gssms fault!we probably over ordered but in order of best to not quite the best:elotes! yes i know it&#39;s a meats resto but the woman saw how disappointed i was that there was no mac and cheese but a mac salad  she recommended we try elotes and they were so good."
perennial-virant-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/perennial-virant-chicago-3,1,"Our appetizers were uniquely presented and delicious.one of those places you feel cool just sitting there.i keep coming back to this place.hit and miss when it comes to flavor and price..i prefer the brunch, which is a solid four stars, but dinner is just mediocre, maybe even two stars.my husband ordered a chai latte which was served as a diy with the tea and milk separated to pour as you please.average food.the hotel has a cafe in case you have to wait.although i thought this was a peculiar question, danny knew exactly what my friend was talking about and instead recommended the asparagus soup knowing what taste preferences he was seeking.it was garnished kinda sparse, with just a single pickled asparagus and i missed the celery and citrus.everybody enjoyed what they got we got everything from french toast to salad and fries..omelette had some really fresh vegetables and the pork wrapped around it was a nice touch.&nbsp;im a huge fan.however, this experience made me want to return more than i did in the past, maybe for dinner next time.the portion was sizeable (won&#39;t leave you stuffed but will fill you up), the chicken brined perferctly, and dressed well (not too much but just enough).the server told us to choose any table we would like, and so we took another one further away from the bees.of course, all reviews are!my french toast was amazing.located in the lincoln hotel, it was a fun visit to lincoln park....was too salty for me.additionally, they said it came with pork, so there was a sliver of a cold cut on top of the omelette.spring and summer are the time to go! their close relationship with green city market and local farms make perennial the best stop for seasonal dishes.a friend ordered the broccoli salad and it was moldy, the scallops were burnt and the two burgers we ordered medium rare were well done.standard oatmeal with fruit compote and brown sugar on the side.get the sticky bun.rhonda came over and introduced herself and made sure we were well taken care of! rhonda and my cousin took the liberty of treating us to some delicious chocolate chip cookies, a cupcake for the bride, and champagne for all! it was such a great surprise and so appreciated!! the group on a whole is rather conservative when it comes to money, so this was an awesome treat for us!everything was amazing and the atmosphere was beautiful - we took tons of pictures and didn&#39;t use any flashes because the lighting was perfect.we had the 3 egg skillet and mimosas and it was amazing..brunch is decent.i didn&#39;t see anything on the menu that popped, and i really wanted surf and turf for an anniversary dinner and didn&#39;t see anything close on the menu.i&#39;m sure there were several i didn&#39;t see because it was nighttime.the service was incredible too, (andrea &amp; stacy (sp).charcuterie board is a must.for mains we had:~ pan-roasted chicken ballotin - a chicken leg/thigh deboned and stuffed (french style) with chicken sausage.he and his team makes use of pickles, jams, or preserves appear in most dishes..putting aside the fact that perennial virant is the stupidest name ever for a restaurant (or for anything, other than as an ironic band name or literally a flower), this place is fine.this place is absolutely stunning and while i haven&#39;t had a full view of the hotel portion, i&#39;m sure it&#39;s in the same range.second, having eaten french toast all over the world, when i see it on a menu i order it.3 things i liked about perennial:1.it is so addictive!..the staff was 5 star.very good food.had a wonderful breakfast.visited a few weeks ago while searching for brunch, especially a place that takes reservations.not that pv is necessarily mediocre, but i agree with what several others have said here that the food was unremarkable or underwhelming.i&#39;ve been several times and each and every time the food is excellent, the staff is wondrous and insightful, and the space is just beautiful both inside and outside.the atmosphere is bright and airy on the inside, but if you&#39;re feeling like a little sunshine, they have outdoor seating and a cozy side patio.i found the egg skillet to be too fragrant with way too much lemon, but this could be a seasonal ingredient (i&#39;m guessing it was the sage).my server informed me that this gnocchi was roman style and not the usual pillowy dumplings one would expect.the cheese plate was fine, not amazing but good.came here with reservations for a saturday brunch with some friends.swung by here after seeing the lincoln park zoo lights and warmed up to some exquisite cuisine and awesome service in a brilliant atmosphere.it was cool and trendy while also being incredibly gorgeous and spacious.by far one of my favorite bars/restaurants in all of chicago.hopefully you have better luck!only redeeming quality was our server..selected the braised pheasant and dumplings for appetizer, cdk beef combination and pecans vanilla bean sundaes.we anticipated the pickles would be arriving shortly, however all that came next was a significant wait.there is a large outdoor patio space that is shaded, but it&#39;s on a very busy, loud and chaotic intersection."
chi-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chi-cafe-chicago,2,"Chi cafe&#39;s used fatty dark meat but no flavor.love this place!!..the fish filet was the best nice dark rich sauce and freshly cooked fish at the right firmness.we got the rice roll and brisket and it&#39;s exactly what i want in a noodle dish! we had the wonton noodles soup and my boyfriend was in love with it because the noodle broth portion was perfect.for such a pretty looking place, the food is quite inexpensive and worthwhile.after having paid, i figured going to the restroom before going to my car might just be the right idea, so i was about to ask some waiter for the restroom (and yes, it was yet another person i haven&#39;t met before!).love this place, they slide a hot cup of tea at ya 1st thing.the waiter added a tip onto my debit card without my knowledge which is fraud.seating was pretty quick since i was the only one.hot n sour soup- filled with veggies and shrimp, more of a stew!atmosphere is basic but great place for a meal.it&#39;s open late and no matter what time you go, food comes out hot and in literally minutes after you order..-sizzling beef tenderloin with sweet saki sauce: these were a little too sweet, but the meat itself was tender.the atmosphere is nice and modern without looking too much like one of the chain restaurants in chinatown.i ordered singapore noodle, which is usually served with thin vermicelli noodles, but here the noodle were large and wide and i don&#39;t think it was as good that way.we&#39;ve eaten here twice now and have not been disappointed.the food was decent just like any chinese resturaunt down in chinatown.and now your clothes don&#39;t fit.early in the morning they have breakfast deal that i enjoy getting because its a deal and i enjoy eating noodles in the morning.we had various noodles, rice porridge (xi-fan), etc.seriously love this place!  their salt and pepper tofu with jalapeños, garlic, and scallions is so good!  there are two options, though, and i&#39;ve had both.i&#39;m traveling from ny where you can find the best chinese food cooked by new immigrants in flushing..we are indeed in chinatown but not in china, so lower your voice.very fast service!!!! excellent because i was starvingvegetarians: several options considering its chinese food.i&#39;ve recently become a regular here and i&#39;ve come to realize how bad their service is.alright place for food in chinatown if you aren&#39;t exactly looking for a place that is authenticate chinese food but nevertheless they still make my tummy happy.good amount of food to split between 2 people.will be back here for more good ol&#39; hong kong food when the mood hits!...m....absolute favourite place in chinatown (and i&#39;ve tried a ton of places since moving to the neighbourhood).ugh, will not be returning.eat here.lower price point and good quality chinese food.full disclosure, my trip to chi cafe was late night.authentic, cheap, and tasty! when i was at a conference at the mccormick center, i came to chinatown several times to eat lunch, and this was my favorite spot.i enjoyed it however i feel like there was a lot of fat as opposed to actual meat.also, they have a secret menu!.would definitely recommend!.i celebrated my birthday late night craving st 4am.they remodeled a year ago and the place looks great.i would bookmark this place when i&#39;m back to chi-town..if it is your first time being here, make sure you will get yellow chives/ shrimps with scramble eggs and half shredded chicken! they are so good! it is my to go place when i miss my mom&#39;s cooking.you can&#39;t go wrong with most of the dishes here.5/10overall: 9/10.this is not that type of a restaurant.for example, lao shanghai (sadly under construction right now), across the courtyard has been pretty good consistently in person, pick up and delivery.deep fried beef intestine was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.great place to get chinese food late at night.the stir-fried string beans are one of my most favorite vegetables.reasonable prices, more asian than americanized dishes, and super fresh unusual ingredients.the room was chaotic and modern, but welcoming, the service was fast, and the food was really pretty good.6) ramen soup= didn&#39;t have any, but heard it was good.garnished with two pieces of bok choy* salt &amp; pepper pork chops - okay..we asked for water and they seems to ignore us..everything is pretty reasonably priced as well.for the most part, i&#39;ve liked everything i&#39;ve tried.and the plate is a good size portion too.pretty decent chinese food.i had to be dropped off to make my order to go.hangover cure:1) take two advils, they&#39;ll kick in by the time the food arrives.i ordered the eggplant and shrimp dish and when it initially came out, there was a slice of beef in it."

sweet-rice-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweet-rice-chicago,1,"So they do get some points for that.lots of great options.with the mini-portion size, its a great way to sample many dishes.some of the best food i have had in the area.we ordered some mini dishes from special menu and some from regular! all of them are above the average than what i had at other asian places.we ordered the pad see eiw and red curry.everything was fresh, portions were big, my order was ready fast.wow!  words cannot describe the amount of joy we both felt once it hit our taste buds.this location is definitely more intimate, with a rich ambiance and dark wood decor..just thought it was a bad day the first time i ordered.hopped off the 606 and decided to check this place out."
bar-marta-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-marta-chicago,1,"Plates piled up, drinks took a long time to refill, etc.ambience aside, our waitress (shortish curly black hair, red lipstick) did a great job of not making us feel left out..did i say how much i love that chicken liver toast?gimme more!.i just thought there was a little too much cacio to pepe ratio that tipped it over.one of the best desserts i&#39;ve had in a while.amazing addition to the neighborhood..however, the service was horrible and the server was actually extremely rude to our entire group.i forced her to make eye contact which led her to bring us a menu after about 10 minutes.it was a saturday night, they were slow, and i was sitting by myself at the bar.she expertly decanted the wine we brought in (no sediment from a 10-year old bottle of syrah), her recommendations were great, and she was by turns conversational and hands-off as the moment seemed to call for..what a surprise.great drinks menu.we will be back!...all of that has been great, from the perspective of value proposition..our second visit to bar marta was just as tasty as the first! the cesar salad, chicken liver toast, the cacio e pepe, and the banana rum cake were among the highlights.the deserts are huge and hard to finish between two people.what a cool looking spot! that&#39;s all this place has going for it.ask to be seated on the top floor if you can.drinks could be better.the restaurant is beautiful and the food was very good, especially the toast with chicken liver.bartender and server were both knowledgeable, friendly, efficient, and had great recommendations.it&#39;s like gilt bar but without the river north boug/scene..we didn&#39;t get our cocktails until after the salad arrived, which annoyed me, a good 15 minutes from sitting down.next we enjoyed the clams and mussels.i had the steak frites, and hubs had a pasta dish.great menù and very very good drinks.it was noisy, busy and had a heavy chemical smell.i thought is was good.a+ addition to the neighborhood.i imagine it will have staying power.the lamb tartare was incredible and the pork fat fries were bacon-y and perfect.while i was tempted to try the roasted chicken, which appeared to have the most mentions on other people&#39;s reviews, i ordered the skirt steak which had a side of their handcut fries with aioli which was pretty good albeit salty.boo marta..contrary to the winter reviews with dark, insular curtains, the exterior opened up to outdoor sidewalk dining on a glorious day.great food, great environment, great drinks, great people.it&#39;s really cute inside, but since last night was absolutely gorgeous weather, we decided to stay outside.this is a true winner so don&#39;t pass by without stopping in!.both very well prepared.love this little unassuming spot off chicago ave in humboldt park.in a word excellent!!! flavors are interesting and complementary.and i regret it.pastas were pretty amazing, i could have eaten about 5 bowls each.had a great dinner there.5 min later we see a few bar sits open, she tells us nothing.o son, the relatively small, intimate space was nearly full but we were seated promptly at a two top.the meatballs and pasta stand out in my mind as being exceptional!.i do hope to dine again, but at the very least i would go back and enjoy cocktails at the bar.we went with the classic..great, well thought out plates that ooze with richness."
jackys-hot-dogs-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jackys-hot-dogs-chicago,1,"From your typical hot dog, to your gyro plate, you cant go wrong.i then looked for the register and seen a woman standing there.this is as good as it gets for me when it comes to chicago hot dogs/polish/gyros/etc.yummy..none have ever heard of or had the pleasure of jacky&#39;s..it&#39;s pretty much a pizza pocket, but made with love..can&#39;t miss with jacky&#39;s.95 for a bowl.) in the west lawn neighborhood..shakes are good.yum.one of my dislikes of a place is if they mess up on your order.but being a business man i can&#39;t hate on his approach to suggestive selling.cash only please.it is one of the best place around..the food is great but the place is small and the service isn&#39;t that great..it&#39;s all about the chili dogs for me.one day, two employees from neighboring burger king were chowing down, in uniform! other times some cops are holding down the bar stools, their radios chattering away..the polish with grilled onions and hot peppers and chicago the chicago style vienna hot dog always hit the spot.old school!.so when it&#39;s my rest day for yummy fast food i go to jackys ! hot dogs there are the best!..jacky&#39;s is all right.jacky&#39;s is a neighborhood fave.those things are good but i can&#39;t give them credit because they just reheat them.real great food, fast service, and open late.i am a big baby fan, the burger is not too big and not too small, among many of their delicious greasy menu items.why it was on &#34;chicago&#39;s best&#34; is simply mind blowing."
davanti-enoteca-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/davanti-enoteca-chicago-3,2,"For a large group, it&#39;s reasonably priced for its large portion.the truffle egg toast was amazing, and charcuterie/cheese board options were ample.i was djing a baptism here today, and i wanted to say how amazing everyone was to me, including managers chad and anthony.he was just no where to be found and seemed that we were an annoyance rather than customers who were going to tip him.both were amazing and highlights of our meal.the food is flavorful and the service was good.looking forward to coming back for their food.truffle egg toast had limited truffle flavor, was overall bit bland since no strong flavor to carry the dish.thank you for the wonderful experience.&#34; there are lots of tables so they can accommodate most any size group and it is satisfactorily lit to help keep the mood/vibe strong.since i had to work at 3 pm on easter, i had noticed davanti had availability at 2 pm throughopentable.it&#39;s served with shoestring fries that are sprinkled with a bit of salt and cheese.our antipasti choice was the veal meatballs.it has a beautiful almost rustic maybe medieval-ish atmosphere and the wait staff and host were super friendly.had breakfast here and you need to be prepared for a wait before you get your order but it was great once it arrived.my boyfriend and i ordered the beet salad, focaccia with the honeycomb, the spaghetti e pepo (can&#39;t remember the name of it) and sea food linguine (w/ sea urchin and crab).we decided to stop in sunday around noon and were very happy we did.great deal! the food was inventive and delicious.cacio spaghetti was spicy.and it was!last weekend, in the bitter cold, we walked the streets of chicago to make it back to glazed and infused to grab a treat and while we were indoors, decided the stay and have lunch at davanti enoteca.the dishes arrived one by one - as they were prepared (to be fair, we&#39;d been warned that would happen)..i had the beef with a side of horseradish sauce.but seriously, try their ricotta + honeycomb.the food was always great, too, some inventive items, not just classic italian.though my spicy sausage dish was great!.must get and try this dessert.i got rave reviews.we sat at a booth and noticed that there were a lot of available plugs for smartphones and laptops.we got pizza, mostacholi, spaghetti, gnocchi, ravioli, pork belly, beets, and toast with ricotta cheese and honey..this dish was very underwhelming and the shrimp were quite small.not sure if someone actually looks over this, but if they do, they should probably be replaced.the maple gelato on top was really the icing on the cake.had a glass of montepulciano and also a glass of sangiovese.so, score right there! the restaurant&#39;s ambiance is not impressive and its location, while convenient, is too busy to feel relaxed after a long day at work.&#34; we literally shared every dish, and everything came out ready to be shared (example - ribeye was already cut into multiple pieces, as was the grilled octopus.i also got a glass of wine that i guess did not pair well with my dish because it was super bitter and they were kind enough to replace it with another that was much better..and no joke, all of them were on the salty side of the spectrum..the place was dead at 2:00 saturday afternoon but were told it was the calm before the storm.the sluggish valet told me that he was leaving in an hour, so he had me pay upfront and literally drove my car up 10 feet into the loading zone right outside the restaurant.the decor is fabulous, on a serious note! very comfy, inviting atmosphere and a nice staff.davanti enoteca was decent, but i struggled to find anything special enough (such as an amazing atmosphere like il porcellino&#39;s, especially inexpensive prices like those at quartino, a trendy vibe like rpm italian and siena tavern, etc.hope it was an off night..it was st.the octopus is superb, the ravioli is melt in your mouth delicious, and the flatbread with ricotta and honey comb is simple and outstanding.the bill was around $60 for 4 people - a good deal - especially for the quality.and bread is fantastic - if you&#39;re in to bread.best italian i&#39;ve had in a while! loved the mushroom and truffle oil pizza.the fish from mcdonalds is flakier!! there are so many other options in chicago to eat than this place.food is fantastic.i&#39;ve been here quite a few times and i&#39;ve always left satisfied..really like this place!..i have eaten breakfast here twice, had dinner once and had drinks several times..all of the pasta dishes here are so called &#39;small plates&#39; that are meant for sharing.the bruschetta &amp; veal meatballs are a must! the employees are down to earth people who are real and full of personality..and bring a sweater - the place is freezing!.while i was there a gentlemen came in just for ice tea while he waited for his group who was planning to go eat at another restaurant, and when the guy asked for his bill, the bartender said it was on the house."
nandos-peri-peri-chicago-11,https://www.yelp.com/biz/nandos-peri-peri-chicago-11,1,"We got it plain and i&#39;m glad we did because that way we were able to try out a lot of the sauces.you can tell that they&#39;ve put a lot of money and thought in the decor.not sure if they watered it down for chicago but the same chain in south africa lives up to what peri peri is supposed to be.we got the whole chicken half lemon herb half mango lime and ordered the portuguese rice and butternut squash and corn salad and also the pea slaw and a side of olives.i did - and i&#39;m so happy that there are others like me who voted for chicago!my favorite, all-time go-to meal consists of lemon-herb flavored grilled chicken, macho peas, and chocolate spoon cake!i also like the way the label their bathrooms - it is definitely very gender-friendly!and by the way - i have started going to the nando&#39;s branch close to me - the one on lake streeet in oak park.every time i have gone into nandos they have given me an excellent experience from the service to the amazing chicken that makes me question why you would need to fry chicken if it can be made to taste better grilled?.chicken is the best in chicago.atmosphere is cool and unique.since i really haven&#39;t eaten portuguese food, the flavors were full and interesting - giving what would have been a very normal chicken sandwich a completely different flavor profile.i got the quarter chicken leg with corn on a cub.plus the bathroom is one huge chalkboard.love butter?   try the mashed potatoes.the chicken was tender, juicy, and the medium was the perfect amount of heat for me--i usually err on the side of caution and always go mild.love this new location, it has a different set up to it from the lakeview one but as always with any nandos you are gurunteed amazing food with top notch banter.the &#34;peri chips&#34; were just seasoned fries that were very salty and coldish (definitely not crispy).you have have to chose your table before even seeing it.1 side with my orders.the chicken : juicy and so good , but get the super hot flavor.its very tender and juicy.and they serve alcohol.delicious chicken! nice break from the countless chicken places with pita bread and salsa.the chicken is very very good.the way their dining works is you come in, they ask you for the size of your party, they give you a table number and walk you over to your table.prices seem reasonable, excellent food..we split chicken wing platter and it was probably one of the best decisions i made in my life so far.also got the bottomless frozen yogurt, which is delicious.everything chicken - my favorite is the 1/4 plainish with the wild herb on side.it&#39;s the only place that i can think of that excites our kids as much as it excites our kids.and they&#39;re somewhat pricey clucks.when we walked in the server gave us menus and pointed us to a table.we found that the portuguese rice was forgettable.i ordered the 1/4 chicken leg and thigh with 2 sides.the only reason i give it a 4 and not a 5 is that it is pricey..i found that customers appreciated a good tip in their favor, a little goodwill brings a person back in.we sat in the basket seats in the window and made plans to attempt to recreate this back home.this location is huge and has a ton of seating options from booths to regular tables to the hanging chairs in the front that is perfect for people watching..i like the decorate.overall, don&#39;t think i will come back.i wasn&#39;t sure if i&#39;d like the way they came out.i&#39;m a small girl with a medium appetite but this place definitely does not fill me up in the least.such good chicken.i got the flame-grilled chicken breast with medium sauce and my friends enjoyed their country salad (very generously portioned) and halloumi wrap.however, i got food poisoning last night from this location.bill came out to ~$30 before tip.we came in at a time when it got busy, and they do not take names or create a wait list.they were just okay.their food made me sick the entire next two days.also, really awesome artwork!!! ill be back to nando&#39;s on my next trip to chicago..everything was delicious!! the staff were super friendly, and there&#39;s a ton of seating inside and in their semi-upstairs patio area.it was so flavorful.seeing nando&#39;s bring back my high school memories in asia.bc peas garlic bread and potato portion i wouldn&#39;t pay $2 for that! our bill was $42 by the way.the &#34;chicken breast pita&#34; with one side felt more like a small salad with a couple pieces of chicken wrapped in a pita.what a joke..mash heaven.next time i go i wanna try the butterfly chicken breast and macho peas.the leg/thigh serving looked like it came from a small cornish hen..the chicken breast sandwich was good, the sandwich somewhat disguises the chicken so you can&#39;t fully enjoy it as pure chicken, but i liked the sandwich.the other nando&#39;s i&#39;ve been to include dressing and a few packets of peri-peri sauce by default."
epic-burger-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/epic-burger-chicago,1,"Always get the fried egg and bacon on your burger.fresh burger with simple flavors.not too bad.very friendly and welcoming.we eat alot of burgers.luckily my friends and i were able to ultimately get all the components of my meal which were missing, but i had lost my appetite initially due to the sub-par customer service.i only eat turkey i will definitely be returning to this place soon oh i had my burger delivered from postmates.i got a classic burger with raw onion, pickle, tomato, lettuce and epic sauce..i went here to try a burger since i love me a good burger.went to epic burger for lunch one sunday and i was very pleased.this was a much improved experience from the streeterville location.epic? that&#39;s a pretty tall claim, but let&#39;s find out.what&#39;s frustrating is that i get take out and every time i ask for &#34;everything on it&#34; i only get onions.the customer service has been exemplary without her.when they served me my burger, i could tell why its more expensive since the burger was soo good! if you&#39;re in the loop area of chicago, i&#39;d recommend this place.i went with an epic classic burger with bacon---no onions, no tomatoes..my friend&#39;s hamburger had almost the same problems.i would also recommend the shakes - i had the pb&amp; j soy milk shake which was awesome.and their peanut butter chocolate malt is actually epic.the cooked patties are then surrounded by the sweet, sweet love of an excellent bun.however, the bun was organic whole grain, ingredients were good, not too salty, fries were good, staff was nice.not too expensive for what they offer! mai was a great cashier.i did forget to mention the fries though!  well, thats because they were absolutely forgetful.dare i say, it was epic (see what i did there).maybe they were not in a rush and were able to correct it.pretty good! juicy burgers.comparable to five guys standards is the best way to put it.excellent food!   charlene is a true at to the company.this place was delicious and super easy to find an autoimmune protocol, paleo diet friendly meal here- plus the meat is antibiotic free! also very fast service..surprised to see there was bleu cheese &amp; avocado.we came here for dinner after a long day of playing tourists downtown.still, it&#39;s s great tasting burger.i recommend the harvarti cheese!!this place has great customer service ( i had the pleasure of being helped by isaiah today and he was great,  helpfully engaging in conversation and insuring that all of our dining needs were met) i will definitely visit this location again!...this burger joint has a nice look to it but the fries were just alright and the burger was a bit greasy, there are better places around but it&#39;s not terrible...in town for the football game, had our vikings gear on.i cant even begin to describe how delicious the burgers are here! i have tried both burger and turkey burger and both have come out perfectly cooked and well seasoned...while it was cheap and there were plenty of good toppings, i didn&#39;t like the flattened, grilled meat patty.very delicious option for burger craving patrons!  try their double patty with fresh egg, and their legendary epic sauce.i looked up the reviews here and decided to stop in.amazing! i had turkey burger with avocado and special sauce..quality ingredients, delicious meat, really a great place, but please start offering gluten-free buns now, it&#39;s a little hard eating a burger salad on the go..we were eating in, clearly stated that it was for here.i would definitely return!...he loved it.can have a grain fed, all natural beef burger make a difference in taste and texture?  i am happy to report that it does.great juicy ethical burgers."
tuscany-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tuscany-restaurant-chicago,1,"I had a pomegranate martini and it tasted like cough syrup.5/5 (i just love batches with a lot of tentacles!)crostone con salome - grilled ciabatta, house cured salmon, stracchino chieese, wild cress poached egg, picked onion: 5/5coccoli e speck: speck prosciutta, stracchino cheese, fig mamalade, fried dought 4/5salad &#34;mela e cicoria&#34; - escarole frisee, watercress, apple, smoked bacon vinaigrette 3.so simple but it shows you how good simple ingredients make the difference..we got the tagliolini alla carbonara and the linguine vongole.drinks kind of overpriced.the food is always spot on, never had a bad meal or poor service.they served us plenty of wine and beer, but all their beer was bottled not on tap, for a fancy place with a bar, you&#39;d think they would have beer on tap, but no it wasn&#39;t.i like tuscany much better than rosebud or mangianos.i also enjoy the mussels, cozze, barbe rosse, minestrone, carpaccio di manzo, spaghettini di mare pasta and spicy linguine con scampi pasta..triple chocolate mousse cake with the rasberry sauce was delicious..pastas not my thing.of course we had been waiting under the sign that said, &#34;order gelato here&#34; for over ten minutes and multiple people had gone ahead of us.my bone-in pork chop was perfectly cooked.many good pastas.i asked what kind of sweet wine she can recommend, she said that they only have riesling.delizioso!  grazie!.we went with two different options instead and they were awful.a quick, expense account based lunch is something i am always up for! for this occasion, i received the call and was out the door in a flash!on this occasion, i dug straight into the pear ravioli! delicate flavors blended artistically to create a very memorable dish!i also tasted a pork ( good, but not my thing) and a tortellini dish.we also had the fried calamari which was great.i usually order a chicken or pasta dish.one thing that always bothers me is that i never leave enough room for dessert.there was no doubt we were in the middle of little italy of chicago either.calamari appetizer is $13+ for a decent portion.the only negative thing i encountered while at tuscany was the slow service.to be honest, i was initially irritated with her because she declined to pour me the glass of wine i requested.this garlic was so amazing we asked for another!  talk about filling up on bread before dinner-we couldn&#39;t help it!we started with house salads which were nothing to write home about.reminded me of tourist traps in italy.reservation was made for party of four and we were on time.came here for my friends birthday dinner.it is a blessing to have your favorite person to have dinner with, to understand that my blessings are only because of god&#39;s grace, the mercy i get is also god&#39;s mercy, and the love the is shown also come from god&#39;s charity.yes, he is!  mario is the best waiter on taylor street..50): roasted pear, parmigiano, toasted nuts, sun-dried tomatoes, mascarpone cream.one of my favorite places to dine in chicago.they have a lot and charge 6.i think the food is really great and as italian i truly appreciate this restaurant&#39;s cuisine.we ordered the mussels, penne with seared sea scallops, and linguine with clams in white wine sauce..also, they portion size is massive so we had left overs :)we also got the chocolate mousse cake for dessert..this is the original tuscany restaurant and the food is outstanding!when i think of fine italian dinning in chicago, this is the only restaurant that comes to mind.we&#39;ll definitely be back again and again!.the servers were attentive enough.great service..unfortunately we were not starved due to several pre dinner cocktails and noshing on their delicious bread with olive oil and garlic so we skipped appetizers and went straight for ordering pasta dishes.seared chilean sea bass and for dessert- tiramisu!! wonderful menu options and great atmosphere!!!.of course we got fresh bread and olive oil, but we also ordered a margherita pizza as an appetizer and it was sublime.does it  have eggs?their response - (dumb look) not sure.the food was good, strong italian fare.ambiance perfect..can you really go wrong with chicken with prosciutto, fontinella cheese, a chardonnay reduction, and spinach?be prepared for a loud environment.we were seated almost immediately by a very friendly hostess and after we got situated were brought fresh bread parmesan cheese, olive oil, jalepeno olive oil (surprisingly tasty) and roasted garlic which the server then mashed with cheese and olive oil right at the table - so so good with their bread!we all ordered different things, but one thing that was a stand out was how the server let us know we could get what we want how we want.food and service were amazing..i also liked the little spread the make on the table, consisting of  of roasted garlic, parmesan cheese and olive oil with bread.every time i&#39;ve been here, i have an awesome time and great food.favorite italian fine dining restaurant in chicago.the staff is knowledgeable of the menu and their wine.i never went back here.my wife and i have been dining here for more than 20 years and love it every time.had dinner here the other night and it was absolutely fantastic!  delicious food, fantastic prosecco and excellent service.best italian food i&#39;ve had, good atmosphere, kid friendly since it&#39;s loud anyway, and wonderful service."
lou-malnatis-pizzeria-chicago-9,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lou-malnatis-pizzeria-chicago-9,2,"We are visiting from arizona and our son recommended this restaurant for good pizza.the medium pizza was perfect for 3 people, we also ordered the wings, which were finger licking good , and a few beers.place was busy for a reason but the service was great.it was like heaven in my mouth.instead, i would recommend it as a leisurely option after the chicago art museum (a quick walk away).siri ended taking me around and around probably because i was deep in the heart of downtown.the salad dressings were delicious.if you&#39;re in chicago, this is where you want to go for chi town pizza.they have an app where you can see your position in the wait line and they also send you text messages when your table is ready.i&#39;ve settled the great chicago (tourist) pizza debate.but without a good foundation you don&#39;t have a great pizza.came here at 3:00 on a saturday and it was packed but service was still great.not entirely sure why.this was one of the highly recommended places to have a deep dish pizza in chicago and we were not disappointed.they don&#39;t take reservations so we arrived around 5:45pm on a friday to a 35-40 minute wait for a table for two.family style salad is so big- better for 6-7 people! but the salad was good and pizza amazing!we also ordered the chocolate chip pizza for dessert which is baked in a deep dish pan and topped with ice cream and whipped cream! we loved it, wait was long but worth it!.i am a pizza lover and i was disappointed..perfect cheese/sauce balance and the meet pie has just the right amount of juicy and not overly greasy meat.that good.like all deep dish pies, lou&#39;s pie is quite substantial, so expect it to sit on your stomach like a brick, and plan accordingly (i forgot this the next day and regretted it).when the waitress placed a slice/piece, it was intact..the servers cut and serve the pizza on your plate for you, which feels like an elevated experience.i split the chicago classic with three other people.lou malnati&#39;s is my most favorite pizza ever!..it wasn&#39;t just the thickness of the pizza, it was so absurdly covered in cheese and the sauce was not very good.pretty much like most ppl said, you really will wait for a while for your food.yes please!.there&#39;s something about lou&#39;s that i just didn&#39;t care for..the pies come in different sizes: personal, small, medium, and large.the cheese was the best part and they put a lot of it on the pizza.i thought that the point of ordering first was that by the time we got seated, our food would be ready very shortly..ordered their deep dish pizza and we&#39;re told it would be delivered in an hour.i prefer more cheese and less tomato chunks for my pizza, but this is chicago and when in chicago i have to respect their style.hearing this, my friend &amp; i walked down to the south loop branch &amp; after some server contemplation, ordered the sausage deep dish.:).we waited 30 minutes for a table and ordered while we were in line.i don&#39;t know how this compares to the other pizzerias, but our party was very satisfied with our food.hands down one of the best pizza places that i have ever been to.i get a call from bill the manager a few days later, and he offers to make a whole new pizza for me on the house because of the inconvenience.each to their own i guess, because the line was crazy to get in, so maybe i am just wrong,but give me a standard slice every time.we did half plain and half lou..did not want the pizza but we had the meatball and beef sandwiches..no wonder this is on of the top 10 deep dish pizza of 2016.tried their deep dish pizza.a few of the natives mentioned that lou malnati&#39;s was definitely the best in town.crust is flaky and holds.it&#39;s different and nothing less than satisfying.i had ordered our useual for carryout and was there to pick it up after the hassle of parking bcos of all the construction.coming from new york, it&#39;s hard to beat new york&#39;s thin crust pizza..if i lived near this place, i&#39;d be back.some parts were very tough and difficult to chew.what a wonderful place to enjoy chicago style deep dish pizza! amazing food and great up beat service by kristina jones.the daily special is $8.i came here because of the good reviews on yelp.i got an order of the personal malnati chicago classic which has 4 big slices.a must in chicago.great chicago style pizza!  individual size is perfect for 1 person..the service was a little lackluster and slow, but other than that, the pizza was tasty.as compared with giordano&#39;s and uno/duo, the crust is flakier and butterier.the classic is my favorite!they don&#39;t take reservations and you&#39;ll probably have to wait around 20-30 min for a table.one of the best meals we ate.."

howells-and-hood-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/howells-and-hood-chicago,2,"Incredible beer selection &amp; super knowledgeable waitstaff--the flight setup is great, as the beer menu can be a little overwhelming..never have i been so ignored as a paying customer.it was a very standard burger and it satisfied my craving...over 40 craft beer in draft.we came away disappointed with no reason to give them another try.h&amp;h has a great location! they have a big patio are and an even bigger seating area inside.i tasted about 20 beers, but they all tasted &#34;off...overall i just didn&#39;t like the vibe.lunch for four was good but from a great experience..i love the beer selection here and i love the size of their small pours.fish tacos are a favorite.been here a few times, and the food and beer selection is great.like seriously, none of us had napkins until after we had almost finished the apps.not bad.i chose a cider.my food was average.i tried the prosecco, tequilla drink and it was good..go here just for the outside patio and central location.they have a sizable bar area with an incredible amount of beer options.the service was good, prompt delivery for both food and drinks.we got here too late for brunch..my only complaint is how loud it is.they do have tvs for sports fans, but the volume isn&#39;t on and it&#39;s really only visible at the bar and indoor area.overpriced -- traditional poutine is barely $5, with some pork shank maybe $10.big restaurant in the main downtown area.we ended up at howells &amp; hood..on a very rainy and busy friday night, howells was able to seat us immediately.great spot located right on michigan ave! the outdoor patio is amazing in the summer, with fire places and tvs.stick with the beer if you end up there imho.the number of beers they have on tap is quite impressive.i had the most amazing wedding last weekend and i have sara @ howells and hood to thank for making my dream day possible.3 chicks: pastrami sandwich, fish tacos, hamburger, 4 beers, 2 wines, 1 desert = $100.it&#39;s hard to find good fish and chips in the city but this place has it.sides include spicy coleslaw and olive oil parsley fries."
the-promontory-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-promontory-chicago,1,"Rapidly becoming the dominant &#34;place to grab nice drinks and maybe some food after work&#34; in hyde park.today&#39;s lunch experience was different.all food is cooked on a wood fired grill.outdoor deck is prime with a covered roof and lots of space..the food knocked our socks off (caveat: we biked here from uptown without eating anything first, so we were incredibly hungry when we arrived and that always makes everything taste better).i came for the brunch and had the beignets and cheese grits before a show i was attending at their concert venue.the inside of the restaurant has a very cozy, inviting interior and a beautiful patio on the outside.i would definitely want to come back here the next time i&#39;m in chicago - there are so many more things i&#39;d like to try! (and i need to have that toast again).it has more of an eclectic type menu which is not up my alley ( ie the burger was made of lamb).the helpful staff of the promontory are there to advise you and guide you through the best not-overly expensive dining experience in hyde park.people are checking up on your table, refilling water frequently throughout the meal, and making sure everything is just right.coffee was surprisingly mediocre -- we had better at o&#39;hare this morning.went to the halloween event to celebrate with my sisters and we had a blast.a great place to impress some out-of-towners with some south side love.nothing on the brunch menu jumped out as something i really wanted, and i ended up getting a very mediocre tuna panzanella.went to watch nba finals and had a terrible experience.all in all i think this is a great place for vegetarians.i have been here at least two dozen times now, mostly when a10 is full or my friends want to go here for some specific reason.i thought the meat was very well seasoned and the chickpea fries were a nice touch.all in all this is definitely a place i&#39;d go back to and recommend.(it&#39;s the weird little things that i notice.would definitely come back for drinks, maybe not dinner.the service was okay, but our waitress acted really snooty the whole time, so i would never want her again.it&#39;s an interesting combination of prawns, sausage, kale, okra and grits.but this was really odd and we felt like we were begging them to let us give them our money...excellent cocktails that are all priced at $10.go for the lively ambiance and drinks.chicken was cooked to a level of perfection rarely equaled.we ordered a fruit salad with balsamic vinegar to share between the three of us.family had brunch here this morning.i ordered the lamb burger and it came with chick pea fries.an awesome dish if ur hungry and want alot order this its so tasty would order it againapple fritters: amaiaizn..i&#39;ve been to a few shows here and it&#39;s a great venue for it.the hummus and tapinade go greatly together, especially on their hearth made flat bread.okay promontory, it is lame that your happy hour specials are the same price as the regular menu.we will never go again.&#34;like we&#39;re a smartphone or tablet taking photos and videos and opening windows, and at night we plug into a desktop that stores all of this stuff, all of this information, we&#39;ve accrued while,&#34; he uses air quotes, &#34;we&#39;re &#39;on..holy delicious french toast.i came over after an awesome dinner at a local caribbean restaurant and wanted to grab drink here.everyone welcomed! wonderful dinner! highly recommend! we got lucky finding this place our first night here! excellent service too!...nice place to have brunch with friends in hyde park.the cocktails were particularly amazing but we really enjoyed our food too.the burrata was amazing.maybe it was a texture thing.for a party of 2, we split a crw dinner course and some a la carte items.i was so happy to taste that the venison sausage was well seasoned, had an absence of game flavor, and great mouth feel from the casing to stuffing.i had the carbonated daiquiri to drink and it was major blerg--first, it tasted nothing like the name would suggest, and it had so much lime juice that hubs almost spit it out when he tried a taste.this was my favorite bar while spending 4 days in chicago.with all the rye they put in there and other house ingredients, they shouldn&#39;t have bothered putting any pimm&#39;s in there.we finally had our orders taken 30 minutes after we sat down (we were approached too early and then i guess forgotten about?).we always ask the bartenders for suggestions and they never steer us in the wrong direction.the place was empty and i&#39;m sure that&#39;s why we got all her attention but she gave us so much information about the liquor we were purchasing..great music, great vibe and great people.all in all, a good small venue to watch a show and no major qualms about it!.food came and the presentation was amazing.just not my cup of tea.the golden raise emulsion added a sweetness to the risotto which was just delicious but cut nicely with the tang of the granny smith apples."

viaggio-ristorante-and-lounge-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/viaggio-ristorante-and-lounge-chicago,1,"We came with reservations for saturday evening at 5:30 p..i felt like i was taken into a time warp where only middle aged men were supposed to be out dining.seriously? that meatball was the best ball i&#39;ve ever had in my mouth.manager even saw we were waiting for the weather to lighten up and called a cab for us.i espeically liked the greens and dressing, it is not just some veggie they throw together to make a salad, the dressing is very refreshing and greens very freshthe pork is very tender and great texture, highly recommendportions are hugewe especially liked the owner would drop by to see how we enjoyed everything, very tentative.next i&#39;ll try the rigatoni w/sunday pork gravy..overall this is one of my favorite italian restaurants and in my opinion probably the best one in the west loop.salads, pastas all outstanding..desserts were huge and definitely for sharing.if you do one thing when you come to viaggio, it&#39;s order the parpadelle with vodka sauce.pancetta was needed.you may love it like the rest of yelp; i&#39;m not sure, however, that i will be back given that there are so many other restaurants in the city, and viaggio did not quite meet my admittedly high expectations.for me, nothing is better than ownership / management giving a personal hello.the mashed potatoes were melt-in-your mouth amazing.we ended with tiramisu, which was decent.viaggio is a great, old-school italian restaurant.i was craving italian food then found this gem near by me.but goodness is this place delicious!! can&#39;t rain to come back to chicago to get more! a must stop.we were about 10 minutes late but we still got seated within 5 minutes on a friday night.friendly and efficient service.the lunch specials are fabulous, try the veal marsala!!!top notch dining.this was appropriate since we had just been standing around in some freezing ass weather.i will definitely go again when i&#39;m craving italian....the cavatalli was undercooked for our liking..i also have to comment on the amazing service.the whole staff.-- &#34;that&#39;ll be twenty meatballs&#34;!.tight seating so make a reservation.a bottle of sangiovese was perfect for the roasted peppers / bread, and the rigatoni in a creamy delicious vodka sauce was definitely the highlight.bring back the lobster mashed potatoes!..the food is good here, but the service is okay at best.just really really good itallian.(period).came here because of the reviews here on yelp, and left disappointed with the experience.after all, we had experienced some highly places that were in more insular neighborhoods that were just.we were always checked on but without it being too much.wow!  first time here.that marinara sauce is something else, mixed with the tangy vinaigrette of the salad and maybe just a little parmigiano, yum!!..but the big stand out was definitely this unique dish.the atmosphere is modern and comfortable, and service was excellent--competent and unobtrusive.motherfuckers know what&#39;s up.the whole experience was very disappointing i&#39;ve been wanting to try this place for ages, but all three of the mains my group ordered were sub par..service okay! inside is cramped and warm.i highly recommend this restaurant.the owner is phenomenal, makes you feel like family in 2 seconds.perhaps test it out before a hawks game?! :)..but i did enjoy my visit, will go back to the bar where most regulars sit, i just wont order the seafood.that will be on our agenda soon.amazing!!! so happy i finally tried it..i can&#39;t forget about the house peppers - i can eat them every single day.where do i begin? the front door hostess was very nice, the owner operator dave who could not be a pleasurable person or the bar staff which is extremely engaging.i had made changes to the amount of people at least 3x and they were so accommodating and nice.can&#39;t wait to come back to try the lasagna, have heard great things..my wife had the eggplant stack for dinner, which was delicious.service at tables is slow.really good italian for a reasonable price! i&#39;ve walked past it a hundred times and finally was able to try it tonight.it looked cute and welcoming, and we kept meaning to go in! finally did last week and it did not disappoint! we were greeted so very warmly, they bring out delicious seasoned peppers and bread (and offered refills) and the food was really great! the service was excellent and consistent.it&#39;s within a walking distant.entrees were shrimp and broccolini and the carbonara.great service.the waiter gave us a free desert for the delay - that&#39;s how to run a business.i&#39;m so happy with this new year&#39;s eve dinner choice..inside is what i would call an atmosphere of traditional italian (a little bright) and they also have a little patio outside for when the weather is nice.great food and amazing service."
furious-spoon-logan-square-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/furious-spoon-logan-square-chicago-4,2,"I&#39;ve read a lot of reviews before going there, which i suppose gave me high expectations, and led to a huge let down.otherwise it was a perfect dinner and we want to go back.it was great here! the vibe is as if samurai champloo had its own ramen bar.that being said, i have been here a couple of times and would recommend.i opted for the chicken shio ramen and added egg and the furious sauce (a habanero sauce).the poached egg with it adds that richness! the takoyaki (when we finally got it) was amazing! just wish our orders weren&#39;t wrong.the order was mostly correct, but not 100% and we were unable to use our coupon we had for signing up for the emails.like biting into them was the opposite of a pleasure.it feels like it&#39;s everyone&#39;s first day on the job.price is fair for chicago dinning.one of my favorite places in the city! the veggie ramen with fury sauce is always on point! i highly recommend furious spoon.my husband ordered a rice bowl which didn&#39;t come for 15 minutes after my order arrived.sake and beer are also on the menu.i may try their other location to see how they are.definitely a good ramen option in logan.that&#39;s the word that came to mind when sitting down to eat here yesterday.great experience!  had never been to the original and was very excited to try out the new location in the neighborhood.every time i have gone back i try something new and it keeps getting better!!!  a must go if you like ramen!!.this place is amazing.i have been there for lunch a few times and haven&#39;t had anything shy of a great experience!! the employees are so fun and definitely have a great knowledge for noodles! i can&#39;t wait to go back!!!.however, at furious spoon it was just plain salty and lacked flavor depth.it is very nice to have outdoor patios to enjoy the chicago summer, but its close vicinity to the l line makes it extremely loud and hard to carry out a conversation without distraction.i can&#39;t stop eating here - even in the hot summer months, this ramen tastes absolutely amazing &amp; feeds my soul.i won&#39;t be back.just give it a taste yourself.perhaps i will give it another shot with a different flavor.furious spoon&#39;s noodles are made in-house, and as someone who grew up in china (la mian, anyone?), there&#39;s nothing better than homemade noodles.apparently, they&#39;re doing $1 tallboys of hamm&#39;s on wednesdays? ordered one of those to simply cut the heat, but their bar manager les made sure i got a chance to check out some of their other offerings.i had lunch for the next day.don&#39;t profile your anglo, middle-aged customers, please!  ;-)  the ramen bowl was damned good, nowhere near &#34;hot&#34;.guess its back to wasabi for me!.it was a spring roll just like the ones you have had at every other restaurant.i had the soyun ramen to eat, and a hard knock spice to drink.i was slightly underwhelmed by the ramen though - the noodles don&#39;t have the homemade chewy feel i&#39;ve come to love in delicious ramen, although the flavors were all good and not too rich..amazing ramen; best i&#39;ve had thus far.&#34;i could go for the usual furious ramen, 7 on the spicy scale, at this new location.other then that though, totally recommended.cool place and i love the ramen/hip hop vibe.the staff is always nice and always helpful.not a ramen snob but for the price and the lack of options, i wasn&#39;t impressed.concentrate on the pork slices, they play a key role but stay mostly hidden.i think that the food is appropriately priced for the quality and quantity of ingredients,so it would be a great place to check out if you are in the logan square area.inside is really loud, so i like the outdoor area better if the weather is okay.first, it&#39;s waaaaay overpriced.on top of the food and drink, both hour server and bartender were so attentive and nice.the music they played was uncomfortably loud and not tasteful, if you don&#39;t like the idea of spending 15 dollars to eat some angel hair pasta and a tofu disc to the tune of extremely loud lowest common denominator rap  music do not eat here!..the ramen taste like spaghetti you buy at wallgreens, vegetables taste like it&#39;s from a can and so does the meat, and you order food like you&#39;re at a fast food restaurant.50 each to be exact.it felt.i will definitely be coming back.she did offer to get me a fork if i wasn&#39;t up to it, but i was able to learn pretty quickly!great restaurant, good music vibe.i come to pickup a rice bowl to-go and get denied service.the hip hop atmosphere and music was an awesome addition.to start off, i ordered the ahi poke tuna rice bowl..send someone out there to wipe the tables after a rain shower and don&#39;t have patrons clean them! assist the disabled! get better beers! make better ramen!.but i get it, distraction and ambiance is key when your food is mediocre as hell and anything but as advertised.great atmosphere inside and outside on the patio.the atmosphere and employees are as laid back as a ladyboy."
antico-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/antico-chicago,1,"We went with the browned butter and sage.he made the experience that much more enjoyable.my litmus test for italian is the gnocchi, and theirs will melt in your mouth!.it seemed to me that they pride themselves in having their staff know/ taste how good their food is.the second time i had the steak.highly recco/ hidden gem.the fantastic service was the cherry on top to this delicious meal.excellent food, for the quality the price is reasonable but it is still an expensive night out.so, unfortunately, there are too many other places with similar quality cuisine that look to make a reasonable but not ridiculous mark-up on wine that, hands-down, beat antico out.this is real deal italian food.all of the pastas are so simple and high quality (probably a highlight of the meal)..portions are pretty small and it was a little pricey but overall good food.service was great, both our waitress nadia and jonathan were attentive.this is the reason i love living in chicago for neighborhood restaurants like this.sad.the food itself was divine; warming, comforting and delicious.for entrees, i had pappardelle with smoked pork -- perfect pasta, rich &amp; succulent meat..always cooked to perfection with just the right mix of lemon and spice-gnocchi: even people that don&#39;t traditionally like gnocchi should give it a shot.we split a pork chop in wine reduction (the sage leaves were so good) and staggered away without room for dessert.then we had fried cuttlefish, sort of like calamari.great date night spot.antico made such an impression that i am inclined to claim it as the most pleasurable dining experience i&#39;ve ever had.they make all of the pastas in house and they they also braise (or smoke?) all of the meat on their fire pit in back.i live only a couple of blocks away, so i may go here more out of convenience than anything else, but antico certainly isn&#39;t a bad option to have in the neighborhood.great experience here, from two very discriminating diners.the service:  perfect.another great meal! this new restaurant is destined to be in the upper echelon of chicago italian eateries..we had heard good things about it - and decided to try it out.cute neighborhood spot!  very good food - i had the fish special and it was great.the panna cotta and zepule are our favorite desserts, along with port and coffee..this place is small, so wait times can be long..either way, she made an excellent choice on the venue.we wanted to get a bottle of wine and asked the server for a recommendation, long story short, this server was one of the best servers i&#39;ve encountered, and that&#39;s saying a lot, and i&#39;m a tough critic..the staff is friendly, fun, and attentive.we met the owner and he is obviously passionate about his food and his restaurant.great outdoor patio, service and appetizers but don&#39;t be tempted by the meat dishes.i highly recommend the butter sage gnocchi (it&#39;s always on the menu).the bread was delicious, the food was good (smaller portions) and the outdoor patio was fabulous.it&#39;s very a cozy/romantic spot...we had an incredible meal at antico! the owner was cooking and we tried several of the specials, which were absolutely delicious.i was heartbroken that they had run out of short-ribs, but our substitutions were quite good.can&#39;t wait to go back.i am officially a pasta lover and a gnocchi obsessor.overall, all the food was well executed, the service was fantastic, and the ambiance was nice; however, the flavors themselves lacked the amazing factor that would&#39;ve made this a solid four or five star establishment.you&#39;re aware your tip is based on the bill size, ya? we had to ask for what we wanted.will i use my man-card if i call this place adorable? sorry folks, that&#39;s  the first word that came to mind when i recalled our evening at antico.i had the salmon with michigan asparagus and it was also spot on.great food and exceptional service.good wine list and recommendations.very intimate and delicious food!! the waitress was very helpful and the chef even came out to explain some ingredients to us! top notch service.i highly recommend antico.the pate is amazing and the pasta sizes are just right.three of our 4 person party had small plates of pasta while the 4th enjoyed half a roasted chicken..we were not rushed and were able to comfortably linger over dinner and wine.love how small it is, how romantic it is, and how good the food is!!!my husband and i went to antico for our wedding anniversary dinner...we had their special: pumpkin gnocchi with sage butter sauce.i would not go back..we will definitely be coming back!.eat in the patio area if you can.you&#39;re technically in the &#34;yard&#34; section of the property, but they&#39;ve decorated it so it feels like a bistro garden.the back patio is the place to be on a great summer night, the staff is awesome and the food insane.the food otherwise was divino: the gnocchi with sage is drool worthy, the pasta is perfect, the mushrooms and onions cooked in butter over polenta could not be any more delicious.amazing service, everything made in-house and was super delicious...perfect for a saturday night! the staff was exceptional!.it&#39;s where i&#39;ve chosen to eat after my last two job promotions, and where my fiancé took me to eat before he proposed.standouts - diver sea scallop special was a complete home run, our caprese was really simple and wonderful, the sage/brown butter gnocchi was excellent, vanilla bean gelato with nuts combined with the italian doughnuts was incredible.and then comes panna cotta with some pink reduction.."
knife-and-tine-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/knife-and-tine-chicago-2,2,"I didn&#39;t order the burger but wished i had.the orange juice was delicious (fresh squeezed?) and the coffee was good.this restaurant has some of the best fried chicken in chicago! oh and the beet salad.i will be going back to knife &amp; tine soon!.great pancakes!!.good portion &amp; nice light flavor.date night here was fantastic..the friendly staff were focused and efficient from the moment we arrived until our final &#34;good night&#34;.highly recommended.can&#39;t recommend this place more highly.my boyfriend ordered the fried chicken, which was good but not amazing.we sat in a beautiful limestone room.wow! i had never heard of this place and to be quite honest, my husband and i had different plans for the evening.i can&#39;t wait to go back on a date again, with friends, with family, solo, anyway i can get back!  a must try and a must go again, and again, and again, and.the burger was very good and the awesome sauce was awesome.we came here as a large group and had a very nice time.can&#39;t wait to come back!.i don&#39;t give five stars very often, but kt earned it.another plus is the cleanliness and atmosphere of the restaurant...the only reason i can&#39;t give them 5 stars: we made a reservation, showed up on time, but then ended up waiting about 30 minutes to be seated.i got the lamb tacos: their were too many problems.they also let us bring in our own cake, no cake cutting fee.the service and the ambiance were nice but the reason one goes to a restaurant is for good food, especially if it is a bit pricier.highly recommend this place!.the good: everything i ate was really good.hubby had pork shoulder benedict - it was to die for, seriously, the giardiniera hollandaise &amp; tender pork was melt-in-your-mouth.it&#39;s a cute place with a quaint, romantic ambiance.but the crab cakes on the other hand was a great pallet cleanser, nice flavors and great balance of citrus and herbs.it was not the best burger i have had but it was just a small notch below.anyways, props to the staff!.not to brag but i&#39;ve had some pretty great pancakes in my day, from london to hong kong and i believe the cinnamon bun pan cakes maybe the best pancakes ever!also had the signature hash and also great.nice touch! everyone enjoyed themselves and we will definitely be back!.for me, this place was eh, mediocre.the food was also great; the blended burger (with mushrooms in the patty) and pork shoulder benedict were particularly big hits with our group..allison (sp?) was very personable and super courteous.cheers knife &amp; tine and keep up the great work!..it seems like a great spot to take a date (there were a lot of couples here).i particularly loved the chilaquiles, and my son&#39;s bananas foster pancakes were decadent and amazing.small, cute date spot.best brunch ever!!! we came here for my birthday and could not have been happier  yummy donuts, freshly made, perfect appetizer! each of us ordered something different and ended up sharing across the table - all delicious..corn frittas, awful.the food is so good we found ourselves sharing between our plates which makes for a great romantic dinner out.great service.very nice cocktail bar with highly talent staff.they were able to seat us in 15 minutes and as soon as we arrived i knew we made a good choice! this place is beautiful! i wanted to walk around and take pictures of everything! the wait staff was superb and made our dining experience stupendous.the knife &amp; tine is part of the renaissance of southern flavor sweeping through new american dining.but it was basically dead on a friday night and the food lacked flavor (including the mussels, what a shame!) and everything was quite overpriced for what they were serving.since we opted not to have dessert in the beginning of the meal, we ordered the always filling shrimp and grits and honey butter fried chicken w/ biscuits.we were one of 3 tables there on a thursday night - seemed odd, but they&#39;re new and not in a highly traveled area i guess?second - the food took a while - why?third - the food wasn&#39;t that great, small portions in my opinion (for the apps) and nothing to write home about for the price.for any other meal (or even breakfast if you really want) you can&#39;t go wrong with their burger.the $12 cocktail was good, but under poured.i highly recommend this place.everyone was very accommodating.knife and tine have it all right now.i came here on a wednesday evening after having made a reservation through yelp.finally, we ordered sandwiches and fries as the entree.the atmosphere is awesome very relaxing and the atrium is a cute little spot for more light and an outdoor feel..the drinks were not memorable.everything else was so good - even the almond stuffed dates, which were a nice change to the usual bacon wrapped dates.no one cared for the green chile breakfast burrito.the setting is one to be adored and you are never left feeling underserved by the team efforts of the entire staff.small portion for the size and marinade was overpowering for such a good cut of meat-although it was tender."
new-rebozo-chicago-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/new-rebozo-chicago-chicago,2,"I specially love the chorizo and cheese mole.we had a really great experience at new rebozo.here&#39;s a link that will tell you what a rebozo is,en.we will defniietely be back!.we were the only customers on a saturday at lunch.great food slooooowwwww service!!! tortilla soup was phenomenal! it just took forever to be ableto get anything.i would say that prices were fair for the portion of food that you get and they offer a decent selection of adult beverages.my husband &amp; i dined out on the patio, it was a great view &amp; our waiter was very attentive.if you go to rebozo you need to try their tamarind margarita and their mole enchiladas.i just couldn&#39;t get over the fact of paying $25 for it.so far, the best mexican restaurant in chicago, couldn&#39;t ask for more.i would prefer going to one of my favorite spots in the west suburbs that is 100% authentic for a quarter of the price.every bite is delicious and this location is very cozy.we had the mole, which was fantastic.i found this place on yelp -thanks ! some of the most flavorful mexican food i have ever eaten.enjoyed the food immensely! fiesta mole was delicious and loved the spicy salsaservice was great and staff very courteous.this was our first time dining at new rebozo, and we will definitely be back soon! we had the fiesta mole and the veggie tacos, along with amazing pomegranate margaritas.the food was pretty good but the service was horrible.the guacamole was good,  steak tacos were amazing..after we ordered our food we waited like 45 mins which it made us very angry.service was nice and fast, we had beef fajitas which were just perfect.they work really hard here and the food was really tasty.50 each time you ask for a refill of soda, which was a little annoying.if in chicago, stop by for a tasty meal and excellent service.they make a mean margarita too (an important, but oft disappointing, staple for mexican dining)!this place has wonderful service; they are very accommodating with gluten free options - yay! - and other food allergies/dietary restrictions.the salsa was spicy and yummy.i&#39;ve actually never had pineapples in a taco before, and the combination of that with the spices in their al pastor was fire..service was impeccable.this hits you after a few seconds.i wasn&#39;t a big fan bc the cheese inside became pretty chewy.it&#39;s like a spicy chocolate!!!.given that he does it night after night means it&#39;s not an act but he really is someone who loves his work and his customers.we are vegetarians and he picked the most amazing dishes.this is a fantastic restaurant!  my wife and i came here around 7pm on a friday and chose to sit outside on their cute &amp; quaint patio.i enjoyed my small table on the patio.i just moved into river north and i am so excited to have such an amazing restaurant to go to.i present you a list of 23 top tacos you can get in our beautiful city for way less than that.they have a wide assortment of mole entrees.the service was really excellent.we were celebrating our friend&#39;s bday and this place was perfect venue.great selection of different enchiladas with dozens of mole to choose from (cashew, peanut, pecan, chile, chocolate, etc.this is a hidden gem! if you are looking for authentic mexican food in river north, this is the place for you.i&#39;ll definitely be back on my next visit.jicama salad was light and so delicious.i had the chile rellenos and it was excellent.it must have been an &#39;off&#39; day as both the food and service wasn&#39;t that amazing, it was average at best..dessert: the best 3 leches cake ever! i also had some phlans.it was a lovely dining experience.stopped by for a mid afternoon snack, ordered the queso fundido and, after waiting 45 minutes and it never arrived, got up and left.everything exceeded our expectations.if you drive, the bar across the street has valet parking or there is a parking garage around the corner on rush (but know that option is expensive ($35)i think it was an off night given the rave reviews on yelp.i got the chicken fajitas &amp; they were quite possibly the greatest fajitas i&#39;ve ever had.chips were amazing and so were fajitas ! enjoyed the lovely ambiance and friendly service..very interesting menu, well presented and tasty.the steak was nice and loved the poblano mole.you guys are seriously incredible.then, echoing other reviews, the waiters were simply awol often.congratulations chef paco on a masterpiece of an experience.fantasic.i was told that the manager is in an important meeting (at 10:00 pm tuesday night !) and cannot come to the phone and the person who answered the phone at the restaurant could not help me at all.i thought it was a fluke, but it happened twice in one month.this is definitely not your typical mexican restaurant.you have been warned.the atmosphere  was relaxing and romantic for those who are looking for a place to take their significant others.i ordered a steak with mole sauce and the presentation was stunning..odd..we are huge fans of mexican food and can never get enough.tamal de mango was also quite tasty and decadent.good people watching from the patio."
old-lviv-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/old-lviv-chicago,1,"The waiter was very helpful in explaining what all was available and what we were about to eat.i&#39;m ukrainian, had trouble funding real ukrainian food in the us; found it! my american friend said, &#34;the good is so good, if you eat here women will think you&#39;re a superhero.didn&#39;t know what to expect coming here as it was my first time eating ukrainian food, but i was thoroughly impressed and definitely will be back especially on cooler days.the buffet is simple but delicious.i have been to many foreign-rooted restaurants that are far from being fancy and i usually love them.heads up though - cash only.best ukrainian food hands down.50 that i paid for it, well worthwhile.all the stuff is prepared fresh (by a ukrainian grandma) and tastes great.food is testy and fresh, and very good service.in search of a unique ethnic dining experience, my partner and i found old lviv and were very grateful that we did..and try the dranik which was amazing.warm borscht (both red and green!) will warm you to the core..but whoever has taken over running this place has not made it worth it..the food was very authentic.they&#39;re all great, but the borscht is my favorite.talk about simple food, ethnic food, and good food, and this place is on the top of the list.and the food proved law #346 overwhelmingly..crepes with berries.we enjoyed dinner here, and staff was so kind and respectful.even better is the collection of cheap ukrainian beers and vodkas maling the experience quite intoxicating.i have been there at least 3 times and the rest of the buffet looks like its been laying around for days..the restaurant is very small and be sure to get there before 8:00 pm and 7:00 pm on sundays.they could add more variety of dessert items but overall we were pleased with the experience.the people are nice, though a little slow - be prepared to stay chilled.service is a little bit awkward, especially with just 4 tables.truly, it was like hanging out with the cousins and in laws in grandma&#39;s kitchen.from the borscht to the warenyky, old lviv is a hidden old world treasure in the new world.administration: run by an authoritarian commissar lady/owner, and her subservient yet covertly resentful lieutenant/son, this buffet brings back the warm memories of the old mess hall..i love the atmosphere and the food and we&#39;ve started going here on saturday&#39;s for lunch after the gym.not every house wife can prepare this well.it&#39;s a buffet.most of the dishes have a heavy  meat and grease ratio, this is a place some people might need to be in the mood for.a couple years ago, this used to be one of my favorite homestyle, grandma-feeling places to go eat.one thing is for sure, you are not going to walk into this restaurant and find a men&#39;s a capella chorus standing in the aisle and singing silent night in ukrainian in the middle of january while the kitchen staff stands around listening and all restaurant functions come to a halt.get ready for some spelling errors.cash only..i recieved a large bowl of nearly flourescent/deep pink soup.excellent red borscht too!  however when i think of a buffet, i envision a wide variety of foods both hot and cold and in substantial quantities.awesome stuffed cabbage, pea soup, and meatballs! also the cabbage soup is actually pretty good.my first taste of soup at old lviv, loaded with dill, took me back to the home cooked meals of ukrainian kitchens.so what besides the crowds that come in and still order borsht in the native language and the cute decor make this memorable? well the amazing food made by the authentic ukranian cook.you walk in there and you&#39;re transported into old ukraine like coming home to your ukrainian grandma for a nice warm meal..i came in with my two american friends, and we received a great treatment at old lviv..the buffet ($10 on weekends/holidays, $9 other times) is well worth the value - and is full of delicious potato, cabbage, and lots of meaty options to sate your palate.the sorrel soup was incredible, slightly sour, very flavorful and perfectly garnished with boiled eggs, etc.i decided to be brave and for some reason unbeknonwst to me, declined any sort of guidance through the buffet line..small dining area..this is &#39;eat as much you can&#39; type of a buffet, in addition you can have a box of 4.polish people started to americanize and alter their recipes to accommodate yuppies, so i go to this sweet little lady to have some real european food.i only wish there was a restaurant like that in ct.only problem is it&#39;s kind of tough to communicate so just walking in and you&#39;re a little confused how to go about ordering.the owner is extremely nice woman.very affordable and very solid ukranian/polish food.like during the time of great depression (as somebody here already said)..i had called in advance to find out the closing time of the restaurant, and whoever had answered the phone failed to tell me they were actually closed that night for this private event.i called and someone inside said they open in 20 minutes."
zenwich-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/zenwich-chicago,2,"Overall, zenwich is a solid choice for lunch in the loop.zenwich recently opened on van buren near my office, in the space formerly occupied by burrito buggy..i am not a chip fan, so i usually give them to someone in the office.like the fact that they have a separate veggie menu.the service is quick and the food is good..the food was good, i enjoyed it a good deal, however the weather door attached to their outer door on the building is a pain to deal with and any restaurant with seating and no restrooms available to customers is just not someplace i would ever consider eating at twice..my guess is because the owner was there, but i won&#39;t be going back for a long while!.i came in at around 12 40 and there wasn&#39;t a line here.i used to frequent the elmhurst location when i worked over there, and loved everything - especially the spicy shrimp sandwich, katsu sandwich, and the toffee bars!  i got the groupon for zenwich, and headed on over to meet a friend for lunch.first thing to know: check your order before you leave! two out of the three times i&#39;ve been here, the order has been wrong or missing something.i&#39;m more of a sammie traditionalist, if that even makes sense.but it looked like a really well put together sandwich..this is absolutely up to par with that other location.the peanut dressing was perfectly rich and light at the same time while the chicken was cooked perfectly and fresh! my salad also came with a side bag of chips, i&#39;m not a big chip lover but these were so good! covered in paprika, salt and some other spice -- delicious and flavorful!price: $10.since i&#39;m no longer a downtown commuting regular, visiting &#34;zenwich,&#34; honestly, wouldn&#39;t be the first choice on my mind.nate and his wife are great and the food is great! the two sandwiches we always get are the crab cake and the spicy shrimp.we got there towards the end of the lunch rush and we were able to secure a table.you know how you might love the first bite of a sandwhich and then, by the end of it, you kind of hate it by the end? i kind of had the opposite reaction to this sandwhich.as for the sandwiches some were a hit and some didn&#39;t get touched.every bit as delicious and about half as crowded cause city folk don&#39;t really know about it yet.they were crispy and seasoned to perfection.i was so happy to find out there was one in the loop now.unique asian fusion sandwiches in the loop with homemade potato chips.the people that choose to stay and eat there, as we did, wait at tables and the food is delivered to you (which is nice).i recently called zenwich one evening and asked if they could cater lunch for 150 people the following day.the food and service here are top notch.prices look to have drifted up since we visited their flagship elmhurst store back in january.on the plus side though, i&#39;m not even close to tempted to come back here.prices were reasonable maybe a tad high for the chicken but both tasted excellent.i visited the loop location for lunch and was thrilled with my culinary experience.ordered a side cucumber salad which i lived.huge fan of this place.sandwiches are delicious.bought a groupon and the employees are super sweet but the hours are frustrating (only open til 2:30pm mon-fri), so the groupon was difficult to use.you never go wrong, its like, asian but not asian, american but not american, your palate will get so flabbergasted you cant wait for the next bite.the staff is also very friendly :).the fries were probably amongst the best i&#39;ve ever tasted! i&#39;ll definitely be coming back!.you also get a pickle.will definitely be returning with many coworkers in the future..came in with a group in offer, totally worth it.these are not your typical french fries.oh my god worst customer service every so rude the store wasn&#39;t even busy i don&#39;t understand must of been having a bad day but no need to take it out on your paying customers."
bangers-and-lace-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bangers-and-lace-chicago,2,"The potato chips that came with the hot dog where fine and went well with the beer.fun spot on division!...we ordered our food.by far my favorite bar in the city.bathroom is a one seater = only pitfall.it was served with chips..the bathrooms are cool.throughout the next hour she barely paid attention to us however still stopped at all the tables to check on them..came here for brunch and was incredibly impressed.i went here for drinks and really enjoyed the overall feeling of this place.sad.horrible customer service.nice little place in wicker park with friendly staff and a fantastic beer list.that beer list though! i consider myself quite beer savvy and they had tons of beers i had never even heard of.and, both times, i left without anything too memorable--but, maybe that&#39;s okay?the hot dogs are solid.great time to have!  cool atmosphere that isn&#39;t presence.stay tuned.they&#39;re not terrible, but w/ so many places doing sprouts so well.great selection of beers - had a couple of sierra nevada and lagunitas brews i haven&#39;t seen in toronto before.they came with fried green chile peppers and an aioli dip- yum! we will be back :).great beer selection, and the sausage list us pretty impressive but that&#39;s as far as it goes and really that&#39;s all you need! we usually have the cheese curds, some sausages and a few beers each and it&#39;s always a good time.i recommend it if you want to have a nice and friendly evening with friends..the whole &#34;bite&#34; concept is a novel idea..accompanying sauce for the cheese curds was a bit thin, but tasty, and the cheese curds were excellent without them.atmosphere is amazing! only had desert but it was spot on! had the eggplant caviar, basically fried cheese with tomato and eggplant jam.no reviews for food unfortunately.it also didn&#39;t come off as being very clean..(such as cucumber &amp; strawberry)the menu was mostly appetizers but lots of fun choices.we were given menus and sat down, excited about the interesting beers and the delightful-looking sandwiches.just updating - this has become a regular place in our brunch lineup.everything was delicious.don&#39;t go if you don&#39;t want to be surrounded by finance bros and bittys.the really fun part was that my friend is a big whiskey fan and bangers and lace had a crazy expensive and potentially rare whiskey (pappy van winkle&#39;s) that he would typically not have the opportunity to try otherwise.but only a couple.the waiter was attentive, the food was tasty and they have s&#39;mores for dessert.really fun bar atmosphere and great patio for the summer.as the evening wore on, it got progressively louder and louder, so we ended up having to shout quite a bit just to hear each other&#39;s conversation.i liked the decor.modest-sized but outstanding craft beer on tap and the best pretzel i&#39;ve ever had! just two blocks from the trains and right around the corner from dusty grooves record shop..very good upscale pub grub.although the filling of the egg was incredible, that outer husk was an innovative surprise!i chose the duck blt ($9) for my entree.i highly recommend this place if you are in wicker park and that way you can start the night off well!.we&#39;ll be back!.and that&#39;s it.bangers and lace was perfect for all of that.slow service compounded it and no water refills was icing on the cake.for my meal i had the duck blt which was good, but a little tough/chewy..our total was $25 for 2 beers and one of the worst appetizers we&#39;ve been forced to endure...i&#39;ve tried a few of their speciality cocktails and those have been good too...nice interior design and the option to sit outside too.a little loud, but still good places to sit and chat.sorry but you&#39;re hipsters, not the robin leach elite - get over yourself &amp; your shitty bar."
riccardo-enoteca-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/riccardo-enoteca-chicago,2,"Luckily my girlfriends and i were in no hurry and enjoyed the wine and pizza we got on the house for having to wait!our order:octopus and peppered been carpaccio were great.i loved the ambiance -- so cozy and relaxed feeling..you could tell they made their own pasta and the pizza made in the wood fire oven was outstanding.a neighborhood gem.we also ordered the margherita pizza.i don&#39;t know about weeknights, but if you are going on a friday or saturday evening you must must must have a reservation.this was served with 3 pieces of asparagus.it&#39;s a cozy and intimate restaurant.similarly, the veal panino lacked flavor, and the bread was not toasted, so the hot insides were placed on cold, doughy untoasted ciabatta.we ordered the fava beans, mussels, vongole pasta, and risotto, all of which were recommended and enjoyed.the wine options were just a little more expensive than i wanted to spend that night so we stuck to beer, which went well with the pizza and pasta..prices are fair and reasonable for the level of quality and service you receive.can&#39;t wait to go back.decidedly better than sex.my husband and i were trying to go to chicago oven grinder pizza, fortunately it was packed so we walked across the street to riccardo&#39;s trattoria.the chicken marsala was completely bland and when i told the waiter he acted like he maybe cared but not quite.riccardo&#39;s is so hard to get into it.this place is on the list!it&#39;s a cozy, small place on clark &amp; webster with a rather inviting menu.i got a pasta dish made in a wood fire oven and she got a sandwich.great lighter fare.the small, intimate environment makes this a perfect date place.all the staff is very friendly and welcoming, but ask for christiano, he&#39;s the best!..the food was good but the service was bad.great for what it is - a casual local place with good service, wine and food.i&#39;m also not a huge fan of wine in tumblers instead of glasses and the wine list leaves a little to be desired.we got lucky and got the last two seats at the counter/bar near the kitchen overlooking the whole restaurant.if you like seafood, you must get the grilled calamari app..i&#39;m just saying.also could have handled so much better -  communicate with your patrons that the food is taking a little longer (not sure why pasta took so long)place is so close to my house that i wish i had had a better experience.we sat at the counter that looks over the small cozy restaurant.wine list is nice.i probably sound like a brat saying that, but it can be too much at some places..perhaps tomorrow.if you haven&#39;t been, and wonder what italy is like, try this restaurant.i&#39;m so happy i came here!  i now have another favorite italian spot! it&#39;s a small and quaint place, so it&#39;s perfect for small groups or dates.stopped by after zoo lights without a reservation so ended up sitting at the bar which was not a problem.they sent out some bruschetta, compliments of the chef.i enjoy the dark wood throughout creates a warm and cozy feeling when dining.my favorites were all the appetizers.decent wine collection but food was alright...my fiancé wasn&#39;t too happy with his pizza, but only because he failed to realize that the caprese pizza would have whole slices of tomatoes on it.i can think of a few comparably solid, well-executed italian food experience..excellent service, wine etc.what a great addition to the neighborhood!its a smaller space in part of the old clark bar spot.the food always delish, and the wine offerings are lovely.the food has always been good, but the service was non-existent."
pollo-express-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pollo-express-chicago-2,2,"Can&#39;t say enough good things about this place.only bad part is the  wait and that they only take cash and you have to pay for parking out front.after the first bite, i new i found my new flame grilled chicken spot.for me, the only thing lacking was flavor in the chips and salsa, but hey that was free.even when my brother left his $400 ipad in the place, they ran to us and brought it to us! i also love this place because when you get tortilla chips and condiments, they give you three things!we had the chicken.ahh-maze-ing chicken!! so juicy and flavorful when you get it fresh off the grill! you get half a chicken free tuesday and thursday, highly recommend you call in your order because there can be a long wait especially during dinner time...there us an atm, but you gotta pay extra 2.if you are on this same quest then switch to a healthier option like grilled chicken, and if you want the best marinated and grilled chicken in the pilsen/university village area then don&#39;t pass this place up.5 chickens, a big mound of rice and beans, and a generous serving of fixings for byo tacos.i came here the first time with my co-workers.the walkin wait is about 30 minutes plus street parking fee.i&#39;ve been coming here for years--the chicken is always super flavorful and perfectly cooked, the grilled salsa is the best, the guac is always fresh and delicious, the cebollitas (knob onions) are always worth the 10-15min wait.how i wish there was something like this in walking distance from my house.dude, this chicken is straight fire.their chicken is a bit overcook (for my taste), but it was good for my husband..i don&#39;t typically frequent cash only establishments because of the inconvenience but pollo express is an exception.on tuesdays and thursdays you can get a 1/2 order of chicken for free with a whole order.i don&#39;t live anywhere near the area, but would definitely be back!.not only the food at this place fantastic and inexpensive, but it&#39;s run by really fantastic people.i think the good deal is tues-thurs where you buy a full chicken and you get a free half chicken.but really? im going  to recommend this spot to everyone 100%, but i will definitely tell them to make sure they do it the express way!.so if you happen to be on 18th st and smell chicken, whether you&#39;re a degenerate alcoholic mexican drinking bud light in front of a liquor store, or a white hipster who can&#39;t even, don&#39;t resist the urge to check this place out.cash only, with an atm available inside.we looked around and there were no menus or signs anywhere.the chicken itself was totally amazing--perfect spices, grilled and charry, moist and delicious.chicken is amazing! great flavor and charbroiled to perfection ! sides had great flavor and tortillas were nice and warm no need to reheat.oh, and coke from the bottle is a must!.inexpensive giant chicken dinner.it includes rice, pico de gallo, roasted chili salsa, two charred jalapeños, and one dozen corn tortillas as well.call your order in ahead if you can.the order includes a chicken and a half, a dozen of  tortillas, large side of rice, large side of beans (refried or charro, you choose) and salsa...this can easily feed 3 people (or if you&#39;re a big eater like my husband, maybe just 2)..call ahead! tue &amp; thu you will be waiting for a long time if you dont.it came with rice and a choice of beans..wish i lived closer to take advantage of weekday specials.perfect for a those nights when you don&#39;t want to cook!.it has amazing chicken (so much better than a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store) the beans and rice are fantastic, get the charro beans, and get those grilled onions too! then have fun with all the salsas.great grilled chicken, guacamole and arroz!p.i order extra salsa and load up a ton of tortillas.the rice is also very delicious and it&#39;s so hard not to eat all of it! i usually call my order in ahead and pick it up.a few tips for first-timers (i learned the hard way) because this place has character:cash only!!!ask for a menu because one is not postedif you order and wait, it will be a 20-30 minute waitif you call in to pick up, they still pack your food when you get there and will take care of anyone that has been waiting before they take care of you (~5-8 minute wait)if you want delivery, it will be about 45 min-1.my wife and i ordered a whole chicken with sides for $15 for dinner and ended up having plenty for lunch for the next two days as well! great spot.everything also wraps up nicely in tortillas.amazing bang for your buck..the peppers served with chicken are spicy, but again cooked perfectly.don&#39;t forget, cash only.i finally made it in last week and regret not coming in sooner.make sure you get charro beans and extra marinated onions.it ended up being so much food that we had a ton leftover.if you love grilled chicken on the bone like i do this place has the best!!! make sure you write the address down because you probably won&#39;t notice it when you pass by.yes, it hit the spot!  great tasting chicken.i started this review about a year ago and just found it again now..you get a free 1/2 chicken to the chicken combo.ask for the special on tuesdays and thursdays! (chicken and a half, rice, beans, tortillas) make sure to get the chips and guacamole! ! you will not be disappointed! run!.run, don&#39;t walk to this place.freezing in chicago,warned up to some spicy wonderful mexican food.would go out of my way to stop here when leaving chicago to head back to champaign, without doubt!.thats because everyone realizes what an insanely good deal this is.could have fed four and was so good.perfectly seasoned and cooked grilled chicken, along with roast onions and beans.i love the tuesdays and thursdays specials of this place you buy one chicken and they give you half free...on tuesday, i can get the 1.if you order the whole chicken dinner, you get rice, beans, full package of tortillas, three salsas and chips.me and my co-worker jumped on divvy&#39;s and rode down to pilsen for some chicken.these are the first three thoughts that might cross your mind as you walk into this place.if you&#39;re seriously anywhere within 20 miles of this place you need to stop in and try it.it was delicious, it was hot, and it was so much food for a great price.maybe this wouldn&#39;t of happened if the bitch would have got off the phone."
kitchen-17-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kitchen-17-chicago,2,"Can&#39;t wait to eat here again and again..we&#39;ve also ordered a pizza from them and loved it.i had the best burger i&#39;ve ever had in my life (bistro).the owner (don) is an extremely kind person, and the restaurant is no-tip because he provides good compensation to all of his workers.i&#39;ve been here a bunch of times and i&#39;ve never gotten something that wasn&#39;t amazing.the side salad that came with it had the best &#34;ranch&#34; dressing on it, as well.but not only is it possible but its mind-blowing perfection! it&#39;s a must go!.sooo good..i got the rosemary burger and it was pretty good.will def come back again and again and again.you can&#39;t wrong here.unfortunately my experience with this second visit was that the quality and consistency in their pizzas is lacking.i couldn&#39;t believe that it was vegan! the nachos were so warm and comforting and even had kale on top...i&#39;ve been here multiple times, before and after converting to being vegetarian.if you like eating more oil! the parchment paper (which isn&#39;t super absorbent by nature), was again, soaked with oil!- the double bacon cheese burger was good, but oily, and super messy, again because of the napkin issue you will have oil all over your hands and clothes..the menu is always rotating, so there&#39;s always something new to try.it&#39;s the absolute best, could eat it alone with a spoon (and have).their menu is wonderful with many options from burgers to mexican to pasta.everything was amazzzzzing.his deep dish pizza is out of this word and definitely better than any non-vegan pizza i&#39;ve ever had..we were so hungry i completely forgot to take a picture! while the tacos were delicious, the cheesesteak definitely takes the cake.i hadn&#39;t had deep dish since going vegan - theirs tasted exactly as i remembered!.come and see, very nice atmosphere though a little small.i haven&#39;t had red meat in three years, and this burger tasted so close to a beef patty i almost didn&#39;t believe it was vegan.but the chicken club, artichoke dip and phillycheeseatake are good.it takes a little time,  but the food is the best vegan we&#39;ve had in chicago, it&#39;s sorta our vegan junk food spot..if you&#39;re a vegan and you need a safe place to eat at..it&#39;s a must try place!!.best vegan gyro and pizza i have ever had !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i travel to chicago just to eat here.the owner is also the head chef and he&#39;s happy to make you whatever you&#39;d like- he wants you to feel comfortable and leave happy.i&#39;ve loved everything i&#39;ve ever tried.the sweets!..great vegan place! they offer menu items that i haven&#39;t seen else where.the desserts are also fab.i love the byob.they were just awesome..we shared the pepperoni pizza, jerk chicken sandwich and meatball sub.the crust on the pizza is amazing but i still wouldn&#39;t get it again.it doesn&#39;t bother me at all (thus the 5 star review) because i completely understand but i also understand others may take issue with this and to a certain point i think that&#39;s reasonable, but probably not as reasonable as some might think.the vegan cheese filling was so creamy, it was almost like ricotta.about the pizza.above all, have fun and enjoy eating.one of my favorite vegan restaurants in chicago.the food is fantastic.the &#34;cheese&#34; was a bit much.our meat-eating family stared in admiration while eating their greasy burgers from 5 guys down the way..the only thing is that there isn&#39;t a lot of room to sit and the food takes a while to come out.very satiating i highly recommend this place.the best vegan restaurant in chicago period, and one of the best restaurants period.5.if i could put 7 stars on this i would.so even if your not vegan this place can be amazing!the prices were cheap, the food was organic, high quality, great service, owner passionate, and great tasting food.awesome homemade vegan deliciousness.small but mighty!! great vegan food and friendly staff!! my husband and i tried the pizza and split a parm sandwich.despite wanting to enjoy the food, every time i have eaten at kitchen 17, i always end up getting really sick and/ or experience extreme intestinal distress.i do now understand the freshness of the concept and that he runs out of products because he cooks with homemade items that himself prepares.this place makes a delicious deep dish vegan pizza, it might be the only place in the city that does.after leaving, the horrible smell of it was on my clothes and in my hair.staff is badass food is amazing! atmosphere is wicked (wall of art) need to go back soon! if you&#39;re interested i made a short clip about this place showing some of their great food.i could tell they take a lot of pride in what they do and i&#39;ll definitely be coming back! yum!.i&#39;m not fat but i&#39;m happy..one really bad thing - they use extremely bad take-out packaging made of polystyrene.the mozzarella is on point! the seitan is to die for! the crust is flaky and scrumptious! what more can a vegan need? oh, the veggies and sauce were something to write home about.the place is very welcoming and has a home cooked vibe."
kusanya-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kusanya-cafe-chicago,2,"Speed up the food and its a five star for me!! oh food and drinks are good!.this is a really nice cafe with a great vibe.their food and service reflects that.i even got a bag of ground kusanya coffee to go! on top of all that, the staff was friendly and welcoming.this place is dope!! great space, music, and decor, &amp; apparently they have community yoga here too?? the staff people were all super nice.awesome decorum good prices and they are very kind.so excited about kusanya! incredibly affordable and homey.i plan to frequent it more once my schedule permits..i saw many regulars take advantage of the free wifi and bright sunlight to get work done.nice conference work table in the back.) i also like the lemonade because it&#39;s fresh squeezed from real lemons.great music always playing and the baristas are friendly and welcoming.wow, so good.go kusanya!.i had to ask twice if it was decaf because it was so delicious.and try the homemade granola.nice little gem on the southside.the chicken noodle soup will be remembered fondly until it is in season again.great place to eat and hang out! i had the barbecue chicken salad sandwich, i know sounds weird right? it was delicious! great atmosphere and it isn&#39;t simply an escape from the surround neighborhood but celebrates all that&#39;s good in the hood.i found a gem in englewood.typical northsider mistake because on the south side odd numbers are on the south side of the street.i almost didn&#39;t eat any, but the meeting dragged on.i just can&#39;t find a better americano anywhere in the city.also yummy is the broccoli cheddar soup!! really a must!! the friendly service &amp; relaxed ambiance, along with the healthy &amp; trendy meal options will keep you going back for more!!!.the food was good and the place was clean and peaceful.the ambiance is dope and the people are extremely accommodating.only issue is there is only street parking and there are no other options besides sandwiches and wraps.my co-workers ordered from here a couple of times and i&#39;m always impress.a coffee oasis in a desert of starbucks and dunkin donuts! mellow and welcoming vibe, industrial decor, great place to relax with a latte.creative, delicious, well-priced food with amazing staff, too!  i highly recommend it :).my hot chocolate with soy milk was great though.coffees have great flavor- smooth without bitter aftertaste."
coopers-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/coopers-chicago,2,"I&#39;ve been here several times and a positive review is long overdue.ok food.after looking at an intimidating beer menu we decided to have iced tea..food wasn&#39;t that great and from reading other reviews for some reason this place understaffs, ashame.they have a wonderful selection to satisfy each palate, but the draft menu could use a little work (ie: needs a little more variety).amazing beer selection2.my husband and i split the andy&#39;s fried cheese which was nothing special, just a large mozzarella stick.i recommend the pulled pork and bbb (bleu cheese, bacon and black olive) pizzas.the only worrisome thing i&#39;ve seen is the place being kind of empty on weeknights; perhaps if they had another tv outside or by the bar, it&#39;d attract more passersby.she&#39;s quite rude and just wanted to get rid of us.unfortunately, those places usually come with long waits and high prices.had such a great experience at coopers!first, the drinks: $5 martinis on wednesdays, tried the key lime pie martini, which tasted exactly like a slice of key lime pie (the lime gave it a nice punch so it wasn&#39;t overly sweet) and the cooper tini, also tasty.i would not go back here at all.5 star range.definitely great for a causal get together.the service was a little slow but it was well worth it and he was a gracious server.i&#39;d go for a drink or two but and maybe some snacks to share if there was no where else to go but this place wouldn&#39;t be my first choice.very relaxed..i am a huge fan of this place.i have worked 2 blocks away from this joint for 8 years and never stepped into it until last weekend.good overall spot to eat at.we were told the kitchen was closing shortly after getting there at 9pm.the pulled pork pizza is crazy good.i came in on a artic saturday afternoon and they gave me 5-star treatment, even though i was just having a couple of beers while waiting for my daughter.the food was really bad..thank you sir, may i have another?!apparently, i can&#39;t take my own advice..it seems like i&#39;m not the first one to have a bad experience with the service at coopers..all in all, it&#39;s a great place to go post show occasionally, but it put a huge dent in my wallet going two or three times a week.75.the calzones are enormous.the service was very good, however..i&#39;ve been here 3-4 times and every time i enjoy myself.there is delivery too.and eat lots of food, and laugh a bit too loudly and too much.the patio is wonderful and the bbq is delicious.nice little neighborhood place that does their own bbq but you wouldn&#39;t know it if you walked in.i&#39;d definitely go back!.cooper&#39;s is about as solid as you get in lakeview.how does the management not understand that on a friday or saturday night you should have more than one waitstaff!we sat for 20 minutes without anyone attending to us then ordered drinks and food from the bar.overall, cooper&#39;s is a hidden gem in the neighborhood but has the total package: great beer selection and great food.the beer selection is fantastic, you&#39;ll feel right at home if you&#39;re used to somewhere like hopleaf.but if you&#39;ve had a few and are looking to save a few bucks by ordering a miller lite, don&#39;t bother.we had the half chicken and a brisket sandwich.i&#39;m thinking nachos with the brisket!.we&#39;ve been there 4 times now since the start of 2013 and love the feel here.a nice place to hang and watch the game.not kidding you, every time i went out for smoke between beers or to the bathroom, there was an &#34;innocent, tourist looking&#34;  guy following me.they make their own ice cream too!.the waitresses and bartenders are always amongst themselves chatting and texting on their phones while they rarely attend to their tables..beer first, and then my sugar.they have a great menu, good prices and the staff is fast and friendly.if my second expierence is as good as the first, i can definitely forsee an increase to a 5 star rating!.i joined some friends for dinner before they went to a show across the street.no complaints."
lyfe-kitchen-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lyfe-kitchen-chicago-2,2,"Some would argue that it&#39;s a bit pricey, for the environment i&#39;m personally ok with it.i ordered a side of sweet potato fries.healthy food that&#39;s actually tasty.the cucumber mint drink cured my dehydration instantly!.wonderful, happy, willing to help staff.i frequented lyfe when i first discovered it.first time trying this place and i loved it, they serve breakfast til 11:00 daily and 3:00 pm on sunday&#39;s.i showed the manager the undercooked burger and he didn&#39;t care.my sister and i went here for lunch since we were in the area and needed something relatively quick.because of my experience here i will definitely try my best to dine at this location over others.i added salmon but, sadly, that didn&#39;t really help much.northwestern wildcard can get 10% off discount.happily i&#39;m changing my review of lyfe kitchen! after their great customer service from their corporate office i was happy to give lyfe another try and absolutely loved it! i decide to stop in for some friday night takeout and it was delicious.11.mahi is tricky and i was skeptical, but they got it right! we also had the bbq chicken flatbread which was great as well.highly recommend the quinoa crunch bowl with grilled mahi.and the food is yummy! plenty of options and something to satisfy everyone&#39;s palate.also i was eating with a vegetarian friend of mine, so being able to cater towards those dietary restrictions(they also do gluten-free), is worth something.friendly staff.customer service is also usually on point.this is a fast casual style restaurant where you place your order at the counter and then they bring it to your seat.tasty, healthy options.the mahi tacos were among the best i&#39;ve ever had (i&#39;m from arizona and eat them all the time).if the calorie content is true it was a filling 350.i had this same dish before at this exact place and it was much better!.they do have a happy hour for flatbreads / pizza - $5 from 4-6 during the week, so looking forward to trying that out.couldn&#39;t care less.closest things were 2% and half and half.it should also leave you feeling better than before you ate it.this is really really unacceptable and feel pretty terrible and nervous now as my friend also has a fish allergy.the format can be a little confusing if you&#39;re new to it: you order and pay at a central counter, and receive a &#34;beeper&#34; that tracks your location in the two-story space.this is a delicious restaurant serving food that&#39;s not only good for your palette but good for your body as well.i also tried the &#34;unfried&#34; buffalo strips and baked sweet potato fries - i found the buffalo strips to have a really strong flavor which was a little overwhelming at times especially because it was literally just chicken strips in sauce...portions were healthy, felt full before i finished.great place, great food.filling and delicious!!.let&#39;s just say i picked my hotel cause it was in walking distance.highly recommend if you&#39;re looking for lunch in streeterville.the unfried buffalo chicken strips are a favorite, but this time around they were mushy and cold..i had the farmer&#39;s market salad and my husband had the buffalo chicken salad.place was really busy and a little tight..employees are very very helpful..just the right amount of spice balanced out this dish of quinoa, rice and veggies.the food was delivered to our table in no time.i could taste every veggie in the omelet, the cheese was not overpowering or heavy, the relish was a great extra taste with the omelet.especially their smoothies.but whoever did it was very good, in less than an hour he/she had tried to use her cards in a variety of stores online and brick and mortar stores.cute, casual place with heathy food.they have fresh squeezed juices and actual cup sized water cups (with sparkling, chilled, and room temperature to choose from).you have 3 menus to choose from, (everything, gluten free, vegan/vegetarian) and a lot of menu items.turkey sausage was like rubber..very disappointed..i inserted myself back into line and placed my order with distracted cashier.service was really slow.everything on the menu is fresh and is made in a health conscious way.if you are a vegetarian, then i think you will love this place.this is our go to take out place for weekdays with enough healthy options for dinner.love that they have so many gluten free and vegetarian options! i&#39;m a huge fan of lyfe but the river north location.very clean restaurant and great serve.tried the banana coconut budino dessert once and while delicious, $4 is a stretch.so good..coming to chicago and worrying about healthy eating made this restaurant perfect.the burger came with fries and it was baked which was awesome."
cafecito-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafecito-chicago,1,"The only real downside is the wait--it can often be a good 15-20 minutes as they make your food.i can&#39;t wait to try their sandwiches or plates.it came with 2 small breasts in chimichurri, black beans and rice, tomatoes, and plantains.got the cuban and it was delicious.funky, casual and very comfortable vibe and friendly staff and patrons.only open for breakfast, lunch, and really early supper.i&#39;m not one to say, &#34;i just can&#39;t do this&#34; when it comes to food but i could not believe the lack of presentation and the lack of effort they put into making this sandwich.solid iteration of the classic and pretty good value for the money.what a great place bursting with flavor...for a pressed sandwich it was lacking any crunch whatsoever.the pollo chimichurri platter on the other hand taste like meal prep food if your trying to loose weight.a friend of mine told me i could get good cuban fare here since he knew i was moving nearby.their customer service is average, and their sandwiches are greasy.my favorite one is chivito.to each their own..we came here at 2 pm on a weekday, expecting it to be pretty calm.you might think it would taste like a breakfast sandwich but the flavors of the meat were different enough from what you normally expect from those meats that it was a very unique taste.other than that, it was delicious.i will be back to try everything on the menu.i know you will.perhaps this is because they use a homemade mojo sauce..i always order the ropa vieja sandwich and the cafe con leche.service was fast and friendly.simple, but done absolutely perfectly.went on a monday evening with a friend for the first time...i think the barista overheated the milk before pouring it, which spoiled the flavour of the mocha as well.i&#39;d love to go back and try more of the menu items! it&#39;s especially a good value for the price, with most of the stand-alone sandwiches around $5 and then the platter meals around $10.do you love the smell of hot fry oil and meats? oh good, because by the time you get your food, you will be imbued with that scent for the rest of the day.made fresh, &amp; gets busy, so expect a short short wait.nothing makes a drizzly wet chicago morning better than a toasty cuban sandwich and a large cafe de leche.boy, oh boy am i glad i finally made it out!these sandwiches are potbelly-priced.walked in, ordered togo, walked out.awesome hole in the wall sandwich shop, a must try during your stay in chicago..if cafecito was closer to my office, i would be at least 10 lbs heavier.upon entering, it was a casual, cafe-like deli.for all you out of towners, come here and see why.very well sauces and on the moist side of sandwiches.how can you open a restaurant and not have a working phone number or website?stopped by yesterday again at 4:00 pm.!.as i&#39;m eating the jerk chicken sandwich i&#39;m panting haha it&#39;s so spicy! i&#39;m mexican so i have a high tolerance! therefore  is really saying something about the heat value.if you are looking for a quick sandwich place to eat in the loop, definitely go here!.stopped in for a quick coffee/breakfast sandwich.another surprisingly great sandwich is the chivito; steak, ham, bacon, fried egg, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, onion, and citrus mayo..cafecito also has amazing breakfast items!! you can get an egg and cheese sandwich with chimichurri sauce that is so rich and perfect.located inside the hostel..i got the combo and wished they had more selections for chips, but the core of the meal was delicious which is all that really matters.i will certainly go back..that is my only beef with this place...cafecito is small cafe tucked away off the main drag in downtown chicago.i visited this place twice while i stayed in chicago..messy to eat and and even if you finish one, you need to brush your teeth immediately after.tried the chimichurri chicken pressed sandwich and it was so good! very filling, so you should be hungry before u come here! husband tried the jerk chicken and loved it as well.my mouth is watering just thinking about it as i write this review..highly recommended.i settled on the cubano and it lived up to its name.its located next door to the hi chicago hostel.we tried the cubano sandwich, which was my top favorite, the jerk, and guava-q.and probably get more sandwiches.i normally write a long a winded review, but i think that i will keep it short this time."

porter house, prime rib, boar chop, mac n cheese, brussel sprouts, spinach, chocolate bacon (never deny yourself life&#39;s most amazing delicacies), and amazing drinks! definitely a must if you&#39;re in the city looking for a great steakhouse! also, ethical practices never hurt (grass fed, no antibiotics to name a few)....all the best-terence &amp; rose.the portions are reasonable, especially the salads.i made reservations here for my husband&#39;s 30th birthday and asked if they can offer something complimentary for his special day, and boy, it was a dinner to remember! from the atmosphere, to the servers, to the food!we ordered the seafood tower, the bacon drizzled in the dark chocolate, the ribeye we shared, some wine, and another side and it was by far, amazing! the steak was the perfect size to split for 2 people and they even cut it up for us, you did not even need any steak sauce! our server was so attentive, he was outstanding!my husband and i had such a great time and it&#39;s been a year since we went, but he still talks about this steak til this day and compares it to so many other places, and it hasn&#39;t really been comparable.it&#39;s a very thick cut of pork belly with a sweet maple glaze and it&#39;s served over a thin layer of dark chocolate.everything was fresh and delicious.nice addition to the chicago steakhouse scene , a lot less stuffy then some of the more traditional steakhousesvery comfortable feel inside.filet and kansas aged strip were tender, flavorful and perfectly cooked.i suppose i&#39;m just conditioned to expect large side portions at steakhouses.i&#39;d go back but likely to the bar..we started with the fried chicken app and oysters.the show was really cool, but the dessert wasn&#39;t the best tastingoverall a great experience - our server was very knowledgeable and extremely friendly.very delicious and beautiful presentation.the food was delicious, the atmosphere was beautiful and fun! the manager craig was super nice and friendly.sadly, it really was a dreadful piece of meat.it&#39;s was my birthday celebration and the waiter sent a cylinder chocolate thing to the table and he poured hot chocolate sauce over , which melted everything , whatever that was, boy was amazing !!!.they literally cater to your every single need &amp; want.our waiters were very nice and polite, but slightly off while forgetting a refill order after having asked if she wanted one.my food was horrible, bar service horrible &amp; now i see why.saw the rave reviews and just stopped here for lunch with my girlfriend.there&#39;s an abundant selection of wines and their cocktails are inventive and tasty.4.place was super busy so we sat at the bar even though i&#39;m trying to avoid bar at the up scale places but i this that was the best thing that could happened like i said before even was super busy everything was excellent service drinks food atmosphere.so i can&#39;t complain that much, but i made a reservation on friday for saturday, and the only times available were 5 or 930 pm, definitely could have walked in and got a table at 6 or so, so that kind of messed up my schedule (but i&#39;ll overlook that for now)!!the atmosphere is pretty nice, sometimes you&#39;ll go to steakhouses and it&#39;ll be too dark or too loud.it comes with freshly made horseradish :)house cut bacon - for $14 for a slice of bacon that is one inch in height and about 6 inches length.if you have enough time and money to go to only one chicago steakhouse, do yourself a favor and choose this one.for our entrees one of my friends had the chilean sea bass and the other 3 of us split a porterhouse for 2 and a ribeye.can i get more than a bread for $4 a piece?bottomless coffee ($3) -- by lavazza.get the limecake, it changed my life.-took three requests to get bread and most amazingly on the last request he said &#34;oh, i thought it came out and you ate it already&#34;-tried to remove my friend&#39;s drink before it was finished after a polite scolding the waiter was terrified to try to remove the empty glass again and so it sat on the table for the next hour, through desert.our server was nice so they get a star there.after reading all of the reviews i was really excited to come here.i am literally in the process of booking another reservation at this place as i am typing this review..i was very happy with everything we ordered.the tomato and onion salad was surprisingly delicious, so was the super thick cut bacon appetizer.our waiter and new friend joseph pascual was awesome, smart and wanted by the feds for being so great!!!  lol!! we all felt pampered and we appreciate the great service and atmosphere.we also noticed that the crowd here on saturdays is very interesting.it costs about 120 bucks, so this was definitely a disappointment for us.was a little too much for my liking but the mac n cheese and sprouts were delicious.all 5 of us agreed that the $150 each was well worth it!cannot wait to come back! this new yorker approves!.they make the best old fashions.the prime rib sandwich and the blackened fish sandwich were phenomenal with the proper amount of seasoning and punchy flavor.service was attentive, but assumptive too..once we finished our meal, they set us up outside with ashtrays, cigars, and our drink of choice.hands down, thee best sides in the whole entire universe.lovely meal..the filets were cooked perfectly, and was the second best filet i&#39;ve ever eaten.1.here it&#39;s $99 which is outrageous.4 people, and over $700 for dinner.it was okay, but it wasn&#39;t amazing.the dessert s&#39;more is my favorite! it is super good and very presentable! the only thing we are not very satisfied is that the server is very slow and we couldn&#39;t find her.it&#39;s free so why not?!.the service was great..we already discussed returning.perfectly smoked bacon with the sweet taste of the chocolate..and last but not least, our waiter mike provide amazing service.my boyfriend barely likes desserts and finished this one clean.to put it simple, we were both uncomfortably full to the point i hate to unbutton my pants yet we still forced it down out throats, and we both hate chocolate.if you are more of the dress up type, you won&#39;t feel out of place either."

balena-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/balena-chicago,1,"How did chicago magazine put this place on their best list?pasta --  above average; you can tell handmade and high quality and tasty.the seafood sweetness was perfect and not overwhelming.this is a great place to bring visiting friends or relatives! the restaurant itself is very cool and an easy walk from the l.we had the verdichio - two bottles.first, the staff is delightful! came here for valentine&#39;s day, quite a busy day, and though i hadn&#39;t realized the wait or time lags, the waiter brought us a round of a wine glass each.maybe a little..only based on a brunch frittata this is a decent choice.it was so soft and crunchy and full of flavor! oh and they sent over a glass of champagne for my husband and i, which was totally unexpected and nice!i literally have nothing negative to say about balena.balena isn&#39;t a cheap place, and the food that came with the prix fixe menu was more than enough to leave us all very full, so i&#39;m not sure why he was pushing other items so hard.i must say, dinner was delicious.they have a lovely wine list so i picked a nice montepulciano to go with my meat.i could have used more sauce and cheese.been wanting to try this place for quite sometime.our waiter was super nice in the beginning, but it seemed like he cared less and less about our table as the night went on (in fairness, the restaurant was packed all evening).what a great spot! i loved this place after coming with a group of friends last friday.i had lamb meatballs in a tasty red sauce, pork ragu pasta, brilliantly cooked skirt steak (perfectly medium rare), and a chocolate torta (not the greatest dessert ending but still decent).all around great, sides were fantastic and the pizza was yummy.don&#39;t pass up their polenta either!.have been there 3 times and had 3 delicious meals.i had the tagliolini nero which i thought was also okay.they were packed on a friday night so i am left wondering if the food shines more than the appetizers.visited balena for the first time on 4/16 for dinner.highly recomended especially if you&#39;re looking for a place before a show at stepenwolf.nice chewy crust.the servers sure get a workout here, as the kitchen sits a small flight of stairs up from the main dining room.very simple but tasteful.bravo!.the staff is so sweet and accommodating..the cocktails were delicious.the dishes are on the smaller side, so be sure to order enough of them for the table.i highly recommend this restaurant.salads were okay and on the pricy side.not just because of the reviews, but the ambiance really sets the bar.we both chose to stick a glass of sauvignon blanc for the night but they did have a wine pairing option with each course.the whole staff were really dedicated to giving us a 5 star experience.the food was incredible! everything we had was delicious.they gave us well done although we ordered medium.we chilled there for a while after eating the crew was awesome!.everyone on yelp loved it so i had to order it, but it must be an acquired taste bc neither me nor my bf enjoyed it.cool interior, friendly staff.beautiful atmosphere, delicious homemade pasta, and creative cocktails.there are plenty of restaurants on the block that deserve patronage, but not balena.we were seated in the back room, away from the bar noise, and it was very comfortable.for me, this was more of a snack than a meal.but with so many phenomenal italian restaurants in the city i probably won&#39;t be back.on our second course we ordered the fallen grape and the southern, both of which were successful although i think we liked the first two cocktails more.with the high ceilings and rustic decor it is very breathtaking.the table had a jar of peppery thin breadsticks that were nice and crispy.they have seating for all types of parties.disappointing...our favorites were the mushroom bruschetta, tagliolini nero with crab meat and sea urchin, the brussels sprouts as a side, and the caramel budino for dessert.the food was creative and interesting, but the smoked almond cake dessert was actually inedible, service was slow and throughout the meal the food was kind of cold.the sesame brittle tasted a little burnt.i don&#39;t remember what the pasta was called but it was difficult to pronounce and tasted more like eggs than pasta.but i had about four slices of the pizza at balena.very interesting menu.drinks were on point.service is amazing! attentive, outgoing and knowledgeable!i am so glad i included balena as one of the stops and dragged my friends along with me!.downstairs they have a neat private space that makes you feel like you are in a wine cellar.i had the frittata with a bloody mary.although this place is wonderful, these service challenges did hurt my opinion of balena, and that experience in itself was probably worthy of no more than three stars..overall, balena is a great spot for groups but also a good option for a date night."
avec-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/avec-chicago,2,"Had a terrific meal here last night! arrived at 7:00 and was seated for two promptly.they were finger licking good!!if you are not a fan of lamb or goat cheese, skip the sausage.i ordered a turkish float (lemon gelato + strawberry malt soda) and chocolate sesame truffles, and both changed my life!!!they also have a wide selection of international fine wines and cheeses, but i didn&#39;t order those (unfortunately)..i love this place, i just can&#39;t go back there until this dish is back.just amazing.finding a reservation for this is as hard as finding a spot to park in downtown chicago :) :)my suggestion is to go here by yourself so you could be seated at the bar..if i visit again, i will definitely be back!.it most definitely held up to the standards..these dates will good you food dreams that will have you drooling when you wake up.overall a good experience however it does get really loud with the large groups.done.we had lunch here and was impressed with the quality of the food, service, and ambience..the food is phenomenal, though, and the pork shoulder dish has vaulted to the very top of my favorite dishes in not just chicago but the entire world..the wait was about two hours on friday night, which wasn&#39;t bad considering you drink somewhere else while waiting and they text you when your table is ready.service was great tho!.he was on top of making sure our water glasses were full and our eating space was clean.if you don&#39;t mind communal tables, then do take the chance and have a meal here.i did like, however, how the pita was draped over the mussel cookware it was served in - you can tell it was baked fresh on top.maybe it wasn&#39;t his day.it&#39;s less busy when you come for an early dinner.i stumbled upon avec, and always wanted to go when i visited, but for whatever reasons i didn&#39;t..she carried on the same way when a couple other members of my group ordered appetizers as their main meal.on the other hand we got to see all the dishes everyone else was ordering.the pork shoulder was just a rich dish of meat but without any greens or bread to counter the heaviness of the dish.so depending on the day or time, it&#39;s not exactly intimate.all the sandwiches and tartines come with a choice of marinated lentil salad or spiced chips as a side..7:30-9 it was hopping- people were waiting.she knows the list and menu inside and out, and anything she suggests will blow your mind.one of my favourite dishes came from here and i would happily come back to see if it&#39;s on the menu.community style tables added charm and our service was impeccable.the food was great, especially the salmon and brussels sprouts and pork shoulder! and negative was waiting for a half hour standing in a small cramped area by the door when we had reservations! if you&#39;re in a hurry don&#39;t go here.you&#39;ll sit in close quarters and stare at the surrounding plates wondering - hm should we order that? yes..definitely worth a try if you are in chicago.all of the dishes we&#39;ve ordered were excellent!i highly recommend the chorizo-stuffed dates and chicken liver crostini.yum!.we ordered the shakshuka, which was bland and came with regular bread (where&#39;s the pita?)4.i had to do some serious zen to not let her ruin my meal since your neighbor is no more than 2 feet away.i&#39;ve never had dukkah before, but i didn&#39;t mind it at all! i would have preferred smaller slices of the carrots though, much easier to eat! the half portion of chorizo-stuffed dates was just right with a good balance of sweetness from the dates and saltiness from the bacon and chorizo.the shared dishes vary in size, but are all both filling and surprisingly affordable.food was delicious, wine recommendation was perfect and servers were very attentive and polite.i had a couple of small plates like the chicken liver patte, steak w/ hummus &amp; walnut, and lastly, their well-known chorizo-stuffed bacon-wrapped dates, all of which i highly recommend.we got there right at 5 and were seated immediately.showed up early, around 5.by far, the highlight of the meal was the burger.i don&#39;t recommend going in a large group, the place is small, no reservations, and seating is cramped and it&#39;s a pain in the neck to get up to use the restroom.only area that i have found in multiple cities that serves basque cuisine..our server and the hostess were both kind of.not sure how this particular burger fits into the &#34;mediterranean or french&#34; menu, but it is worth keeping!i&#39;ll venture in for the burger, and for the eastern mediterranean dishes!.it was fresh, seared and delicious.we loved everything that we ordered.so let&#39;s go through the dinner i just had:tabbouleh salad with so many things going on your palette was jumping like a frog.the bread was fresh, chewy inside and crunchy outside.came here because i heard so many great reviews about this place.firstly, the restaurant is very small, doesn&#39;t take reservations, has shared tables and is extremely noisy! i could barely hear my fiancée and this made conversation difficult and uncomfortable.--- 3/5there were three things that really caught my attention:1.we decided to just go veggie for the whole table to keep it simple and we ordered a trio of cheeses (say yes to the honey.the large plates are all really good deals (because they are double the size, great portions but pretty much the same price).my favorite restaurant ever.additionally, i was very pregnant, and squeezing past diners wasn&#39;t very easy.it&#39;s a very small place and again they don&#39;t do reservations, so perhaps i would come back for lunch but dinner might be too much of a production for me.avec just made me fall in love with chicago a bit more...on top of that, the shoulder meat wasn&#39;t the most tender and the dish really needed the fat from the sausage and feta to balance that out."

delicious pizza!!! - awesome wine - great service!!!! - unique atmosphere.thin crust heaven!  we stumbled upon this pizza place while wandering around the streets trying to decide what to have for dinner.as for our actual waiter, he was a delight.incredible pizza, attentive staff and great ambience..fast takeout service as well..margarita pizza.so many places serve spongy, densely packed meatballs, tigah almost forgot what a good, homemade meatball tastes like.when i saw they were building out the space, i questioned whether putting another pizza place in really was that good of an idea.great spot for after work happy hour, small and cozy with a good selection of wines, craft beers and cocktails..a great spot away from the maddening crowd of michigan ave.the crust is absolutely perfect, and the toppings are a creative combination of pure deliciousness.you can smell the pizza love from down the street.we&#39;ll be back to try other pizzas.we were warmly greeted and they were able to seat us right away..crust was light &amp; thick.for drinks, i did their rpc manhattan ~ belle meade sour mash straight whiskey, la quintinve vermouth royal rouge, dash angostura bitters, &amp; luxardos maraschino cherries ~ wasn&#39;t expecting much, but that was a damn good manhattan!we started with their roasted beet and baby kale salad ~ roasted beets, goat cheese, pickled red onions, candied walnuts, &amp; champagne vinaigrette dressing ~ excellent.i also had an empty wine glass and our server was not paying attention..friendly staff and the pizza is delicious.we love the thin crust and they had that down along with a chewy but crispy texture.good staff.i have dined at robert&#39;s 3 times and look forward to going back.i also interacted with the namesake owner who has studied italian pizza and dough making and brings his prior experience to the establishment.my husband and i saw the reviews prior to our decision on going there, and boy are we ever glad that we did.i still recommend the pizza the crust is outstanding thin crust and chewy..we ordered the chicken spinach artichoke heart pizza and it was amazing.we were very impressed with our pie and look forward to trying out the different types and toppings (roast duck pizza, we&#39;re looking at you).you can&#39;t go wrong with the seafood pizza (topped with lots of calamari, clams, shrimp, and octopus) or the prosciutto arugula pizza with tons of arugula on top..i&#39;m reluctant to share this review for fear that it will increase the popularity of roberts pizza, but their newest special with heirloom tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella is melt-in-your-mouth delicious.if they had been great meatballs, then the price would have been fine, but they weren&#39;t amazing, just good..i cannot wait to go back.staff is super friendly!  pizza is so so good!   love the chorizo on our pizza and the crust is perfect.never knew i cared about crust until roberts.everyone in the place was in a good mood and happy!  well done!.great pizza and atmosphere.all i can say is it was amazing.our daily special 14&#34; pizza had fresh seasonal heirloom tomatoes, cheese and basil for $21..we ordered the same one chicago tribune had rated as one of the best pizza places in chicago.since moving to chgo we have been on a mission to find thin pizza.sadly my quest for delicious pizza in the neighborhood will continue to go on.we will become frequent guests as this establishment.great selections of topping.this place should expand as they have a solid base in place.from out of town and after trying to find the best pizza for the next 3 days, i was a bit pizza&#39;d out.the sauce is perfect and the salads are great too! give this place a shot, you will not be disappointed!!.pizza was delicious.this place makes a phenomenal pizza.the few times i was unhappy with the quality, the crust was hard, burnt and did not rise.the menu is unique.but i read one review that said &#34;tons of fresh toppings&#34; no way! the topping list is small and unconventional (at least ordering online, maybe if you place an order by phone they can put on more customized topics - for example online order, there&#39;s no selection for traditional toppings like green pepper, tomatoes, jalapenos or basil, toppings a vegetarian would like).we had the burrata and carne pizza.the pizza dough is perfect.understandably, our service was not quite as attentive toward the end of the evening.they were served on thin crust and were absolutely fabulous.ah so delicious and a pizza we will dream about for a long time.great mushroom pizza as anywhere i&#39;ve had, tho the crust can be a tad thinner.we live in the building so we have been looking forward the new joint opening up.they have veg create your option.like other reviewers i too was a big fan of the pizza at the previous flour and stone.every ingredient cooked right there.there are a lot of places to eat pizza in chicago but this is definitely the one to try !!."

hopefully i can check it out next time! all in all if you&#39;re around the neighborhood pop in the general!.just tasted like fried white meat.great neighborhood &#34;go to&#34; when my significant other want to grab a quick bite to eat and don&#39;t want to break the bank.the brisket taco ordered by my friend was not as flavorful as described.um i went back and had the chess pie for dessert and it was amazing.i plan to try this place again in the near future.ouch.great food with interesting flavor combinations.was so good.the bar seems cool, but i will not be back for brunch.nice vibe, laid back,  amazing cornbread and super cool employees!! im not a bar person but if i was a younger logan square-ite, i could see this being one my hangs.(the mudcat taco is my favorite!) they sell beer to go.was just walking by, but the giant windows opening onto the patio and people sitting at eye level inside seemed inviting--a gentle neighborhood hangout.she was very friendly and after talking to her we&#39;ve decided to come back with our new dog to the front patio and for brunch on saturday for the bluegrass band and bloodies! they have an $8 beer/ taco/shot special that is completely amazing-po&#39; boy special and bonded david nicholson really clinched it..not overwhelming like some places in town, but very good and unique.we had a couple beers that were decently priced and their daily $4 boot special is a total steal.two thumbs up!!.it&#39;s hard to give honest feedback in person.delicious food at reasonable prices.service was awesome - attentive, friendly, appropriate recommendations.the decor in this place is strange and a bit confused, they are going for rustic chic but then have massive flat screen tvs to display their drink menus (which have fonts to make it look like it&#39;s written in chalk).i love the old saloon feel of the place and it has the feel of being cozy for winter but airy for summer.i&#39;ll definitely be back for a boot of beer, hopefully on taco tuesday!.it&#39;s like they tried to be several different things and missed the mark on all counts.i love that you can buy some grocery staples and booze from the general store area.beautiful, rustic decor is charming.we were dogsitting a couple blocks away from the general and saw good things about it on here, so decided to give it a try.i liked the space and the service was great., was incredible!  she walked us through the menu which is full of unique tacos and a huge craft beer selection.great service great food try it out.the food is delicious and the tacos are really creative.went to the general with my wife for dinner and a drink.totally lackluster  service and very small portions (for the tacos), even considering the recent opening.delicious food and great atmosphere, a super fun place to hang out! the handmade guac is to die for and i highly recommend the mac and cheese with pork belly added, as well as any of the tacos.i&#39;m just really glad they are here.the server was very good- knowledgeable, attentive, and kind.0 search results for &#34;hipster chili&#39;s&#34;..we made a reservation on opentable, which was easy and convenient, for 7:30 on a saturday.gonna break down the specifics of the important things going on in this establishment:1) the staff is delightful2) the fiddle player in one of their bluegrass bands is my future husband (fingers crossed - if you&#39;re reading this call me)3) you can buy beer in a boot.the drinks were delicious! would definitely recommend this place.the corn bread was good, but pretty standard.the server even split our checks between the three of us! isn&#39;t that nice.clearly it&#39;s something they can not help.sweet little neighborhood taco joint in logan square.the owner&#39;s ate down to earth to!food is bomb would recommend a taco and the mac &amp; cheese!  yum!.it&#39;s close and has a great vibe to it...the service is great and the food is amazing! we came for the bluegrass brunch and the live music was as good as the food! the cinnamon rolls are warm and delicious and the chicken mac and cheese is creamy and well seasoned.but if you&#39;re a upscale taco restaurant and you opt to keep the kitchen open, you have to dance with the girl who brought you and serve tacos...the place was empty and drinks took forever to get to our table(the only table in the bar!!)food was mediocre at best and overall the place seemed like a local that is trying to elevate itself but just increased prices and not the quality of the food.cool cocktails and cheep beers.within a few weeks, prices were lowered and a variety of food and drink specials were added.shot-and-a-beer can chicken stuck out as a favorite.will come frequently to his place."
tacos-palas-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-palas-chicago,1,"Maybe the tortas or the soups/stews on the menu are more worth it? warrants another try again!.i tried their steak burrito, and i was able to see the whole cooking process because you&#39;re literally in a grandma&#39;s kitchen.only got one taco but will definitely be back again for more.not for the claustrophobic, tacos palas is the place for fresh, home-made food.the experience is worth the trip.i will certainly try it again!.not what you expect, but the food is authentic and prepared very well!.awesome authentic mexican food! enjoy -.pretty legit place.i also enjoyed the addition of retried beans on my chorizo taco, but i know this might not appeal to everyone (and you can get it without).its the red door to the left that looks more private than for a business.hands down a fantastic home cooked mexican meal no matter when you come in.she promptly filled my horchata once i drank it without having to ask.we topped each taco with a homemade green salsa that was made before our eyes.truly spectacular..awesome..little place, lots of flavor.i recommend the chicken soup and al pastor tacos and burritos.can&#39;t wait to go back!.the chorizo with egg taco was a really pleasant surprise, try it with the beans on top its awesome.it reminds me so much of mexico.it&#39;s an interesting experience to eat here as you walk in and there are just a few stools and a countertop overlooking the tiny 6 x 6ft kitchen.the tacos were shockingly good, the beans and rice were standard and the price was great.just two doors down from our crib, 5 seats at a bar in front of the kitchen, there may be a restaurant out back but we sat with mama.and to make matters worse i found a 1&#34; jagged piece of tin can in my 5yr old daughters soup.no menu and the owner(i&#39;m guessing) is the chef/server all in one."

pastoral-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastoral-chicago,1,"Food come in small portion but delicious.yum.foodies unite!! love this place, a must visit when in the area!you will not be disappointed!.it&#39;s more of a cheese bar with wine.kohlrabi soup with grilled cheese was excellent.several friends said it has a better selection of cheeses than the loop location..i find the selection i bring home from here is always loved by him and everyone! they have an amazing selection of cheese, nuts, bread/crackers, olives, honey, etc to make your cheesing experience amazing! their gift baskets are a perfect gift for any cheese loving friend or family member.i willabsolutely be returning for dinner.including this past week.pro-tip: check out the odds and ends that they have by the register.duck and sweet potato parfait was fabulous! and the mussels with bacon and sausage! and don&#39;t forget the cheese!  what a great addition to the neighborhood..maybe i will live a little and try a different sandwich next time.usually ask the server to help choose 3 varied cheeses and they are always great and come with some sort of tapenade or roasted garlic or something on the side, delicious!i was there last night and tried something new for the first time...it&#39;s a very cute spot and great for a date or girls night.loved it.all the ingredients are treated very lovingly..the sandwiches are always good, but the logistics are totally hit or miss...i am so glad we did! i decided on the blta, which is made with house-made prosciutto bacon, mixed greens, tomato, avocado, and mayo on a baguette..understaffing your market, however, shows lack of planning..which is great cause i got to try whatever, and i did, want! i ended up with a goat cheese that was really good, and then she put this amazing new olive oil  they got in that day and it completely changed the cheese to where i wanted it all! and of course they having amazing spreads, wine, and breads to go along with it.we got the spaghetti squash which was good.the staff is very knowledgeable and will help you find exactly what you may be looking for on that day.amazing, went there with my mom and she loved it.but they never told me how to go about getting it..the goat cheese made the flavor devine! really the cheese made this salad, very creamy and mild flavor, excellent tossed with the balsamic vinaigrette.the wifey stares at me harder, knowing that i can&#39;t hide behind the fortress of cheese i sculpted while she was in the bathroom..i love the fact that you can order a half-glass of any wine, which encourages you to try new wines.but, we learned that that is only during the cold season.we came in for some wine and cheese and loved everything....other than cheese the only other thing i&#39;ve off their food menu is the pizza nuts which i wasn&#39;t a big fan of but my friend seemed to like.i will definitely be back to try their meat selection.there is no better (or easier) way to upscale a party than to get a catering tray from pastoral.nada.if you&#39;re a goat cheese fiend, the cali chevre features fresh goat cheese, avocado, shaved celery, red onions and house-made almond butter - a textured spread with a hint of spice.i guess the idea of sparking on tap is a little cooler than it turned out.don&#39;t worry too much about whether a wine matches what you order, just get what you like.the sandwiches just didn&#39;t taste good, i think it was lack of care while making the sandwiches.they arrived on time and gave complete details on what was what and also help set up the food to look amazing.a good dish, but the buttercream frosting could&#39;ve been smoother on the cake and less rigid, and the plums could&#39;ve been bite-sized, because i don&#39;t know anyone who keeps dessert to their own.had the caprese on a baguette.a classier joint for the stretch of mediocre places on broadway.i love the sandwiches they have.their dinner options are a bit more expensive, but good.only 1 of the 3 were edible.i ordered the gnocchi, which was delicious, but had a major case of order envy when i tasted my partner&#39;s macaroni and cheese.there are good ways to handle situations, and there are bad ways, and some of the overly cocky sandwich makers just don&#39;t seem to have figured out exactly how to deliver decent customer service.i&#39;d go back because i love cheese and it&#39;s a cool area with a lot of place to check out around there.we ended up getting a cheese plate for an appetizer.the person behind the counter had to ask someone else, then they offered us some cheese to try.we added on a 5 cheese plate that was spectacular.very cute and quaint.they offered us samples of the cheeses and i got a recommendation on a cheese similar to brie that i would enjoy..helpful staff, yum cheese and wines, n a delicious assortment of sandwiches!the pastoral on broadway is a tiny shop and its surprising how efficient you can be despite the lack of space.i would suggest going during off-hours, but i would definitely recommend if you are a fan of italian meats and cheeses!."
tango-sur-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tango-sur-chicago,1,"And who knew that i could like spinach mashed potatoes.our table also had the filet and another beef dish which were also super tasty.one bite of the vacio makes it all seem like a small price to pay for authentic argentinian steaks of the highest quality.i then entered a cave where i saw a man, and with dream logic recognized him to be the proto-man.it may be extremely noisy, and it is not so fancy, and sometimes can be very annoying (long lines), and everything inside show the signs of prolonged use, however - we love it.el fillet hit the spot and was really well prepared..i&#39;ve been here three times.my friend liked it bc i was pretty similar to what they are used to eat in other stakehouses, but nothing to do with argentinian style.one of my go to places for great food!  absolutely love the empanadas!  i&#39;ve had their para uno as an appetizer as well and it&#39;s a great selection to share among a big group.5-3 hours..service is lacking and food is salty and just not that good.they don&#39;t take reservation for parties of 2 so my boyfriend &amp; i have a ritual of putting our name in and then going to grab wine and then either going to the bar next door or sitting in the back room to start drinking our wine.it&#39;s great sitting outside when the weather is nice..the byob was also a plus..if only we had made it out of there with our leftovers  d:..i love eating out.one of my favorite places to go eat..no spinach flavor whatsoever.definitely would recommend the provoleta (cheese cooked on the grill with olive oil and roasted red peppers).even though each one was cooked to medium..good enough to feed two people seriously.make sure you try the appetizers.it was what i would expect from a $29 steak..)  the el filet is always cooked perfectly at a medium rare and the spinach mashed potatoes is light and buttery.amazing amazing amazingfood and ambiance was superb.i&#39;m sure i&#39;ll be back soon to try more dishes.i was hesitant to check it out at first because they don&#39;t take reservations for parties under 6 but they have this great waiting room in the back where you can open up your wine and get your night started while you wait for your table.you have to accept that this is what you signed up for, and if these things upset you, you should go elsewhere.the steaks were so huge that collectively we ate less than half of them.one huge plus about this place is that it&#39;s byob.good for dates or hang out with a group of friends as it is moderately loud so you don&#39;t need to feel bad for shouting across the tablemake sure you make a reservation, or it&#39;d be an hour waitthe meat portions are huge and quite flavorful, really liked the beef tongue and the argentina ham appetizer, also, try to get the table grill for two, the meat is so tender and the sausages are quite tasty; we also got the fillet mignon, which is very juicy and the mashed potato is awesome too.this was a great deal- $38 for an entree, shared appetizers (empanada and fried cheese), dinner salad and flan for dessert..filet mignons melted in my mouth, cooked to perfection.i wouldn&#39;t go in expecting a gibsons steak, but you can expect double the meat for $30 and a good taste.what? our meals are over $140 and you are going to charge us extra for bread?  seriously you tango sur 2 stars for being cheap and 3 stars because you serve good meat.can&#39;t wait to go back!.it was very good for a strip steak.the portions, along with their byob policy, makes this place an absolute steal.a great neighborhood gem..it took about 2 hours before our party of 3 was finally seated..amazing!the second time i split the lomo relleno with my brother.it was stuffed with chimmichuri and obviously i put even more on.i finished my empanadas and complimentary salad before our platter arrived and that was a horrible idea.tango sur is byob!there is also a sharing fee if you do not order enough entrees for the amount of people dining in.simply amazing food.it was dim, you might squint to read the menu, but your eyes will eventually adjust to the ambiance.my girlfriend found a fly in her first salad and when brought back a replacement, found a second fly.go early as they don&#39;t take reservations unless you are a larger party..sucks waiting for your table during winter.the host (who said his name was shawn) approached them first and moved them to the waiting room while we kept waiting..there were 5 of us at dinner and we had been recommended the empenadas! each order comes with 2..that&#39;s what i really wanted.keep up the good work!.the desserts are made from scratch and there is no fee for bringing your own wine.so kind and thoughtful!.screw it, i&#39;m going to add one more star to my review, and bring it up to 4 stars.absolute crap customer service.i highly, highly recommend this restaurant.the wait it may be a little long but if you around 6pm there is not many people there so you get a table right away if you go later like 8pm you will be waiting for like hour or so.my favorite is el filet but everything we have tried has been cooked perfectly and tasted very good.."
hub-51-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hub-51-chicago-2,2,"I honestly tried to give it another shot before completely calling it quits and ordered the prime rib sandwich (this used to previously only be on the dinner menu).the service was great but the portion sizes were very small considering the price..best,charlie.definitely miss the rice crisp in the poke.good for a special occasion dinner or if you don&#39;t work at a nonprofit.i wanted the chicken nachos but everybody knows nachos usually come in huge portions.we went to happy hour here prior to a monthly work dinner that was near by.it&#39;s a little pricey but the portions are good, it&#39;s delicious and makes up for working late.by the time we left, the place was packed.because we didn&#39;t even order it! the server brought us martha&#39;s special occasion carrot cake on the house as a welcome to the city of chicago.this is mostly restauarant during the day, but mostly bar during the night.the service is impeccable.*side note: i&#39;m totally a frequent diner as in at least once a week, and i have not been back since last month.by 11, 11:30, however, the restaurant was much busier.the tacos were pretty good, and the filet mignon was tender.hub51! wow.i can&#39;t believe i haven&#39;t reviewed this place before now.the brussels sprouts salad with ahi tuna is amazing!!! the 6 of us shared the chicken nachos that were super yummy..at the end, i got the brownie sundae, and it was way too much.their menu interestingly seems to have some form of identity crisis as it ranges from sushi rolls to sandwiches to tacos.the nachos are always a winner as well!.the hub punch was great and we enjoyed the mozzarella cheese ball &amp; pesto.service was excellent, but we were also there scoping out the place as a possible wedding rehearsal venue, so we might have gotten more love than the average customer.for its location, the pricing is on par with everything else in the area, and the food, for the most part, is good portioned, as to prep you for the festivities that likely lie ahead in your night.both were decent, although the fish was somewhat dry.i just wanted to update my review after i have now been here multiple times.burger was delicious.not sure about the price tag ($19..they give you all the ingredients separately and you make your own tacos.i did not order off the restaurant week menu.the bathrooms in this place are very private and clean.everything tasted right, but it wasn&#39;t anything special.i wish i could give them 3.it couldn&#39;t have satisfied my craving for good food anymore relatively late at night after a long exhausting day..sushi, salads, burgers, tacos, other kinds of wraps/sandwiches, too.the dinners were three star quality.great service, everyone was quite friendly.peppers grilled to perfection..my pork tacos were just ok.what a great dish! thin, crisp chips with cheese, scrambled eggs, sauce, some guacamole and a sour cream drizzle, all finished under a broiler.hub 51 is definitely worth checking out.i would highly recommend trying this place out because it isn&#39;t too expensive and the location is centrally located in chicago.the dress code here is upscale.but it was a waste of a night as far as dinner.i prefer other burger places...loved the atmosphere.it had creamy cheesecake frosting and the cake itself was very rich.love the menu, a mix of mexican, american and japanese, all being my favorite.the food was very good.my drink was refreshing at first, but then a bit too sweet.i ordered the spinach and cheese omelet and there was only a smattering of cheddar on the very top and none inside..people seem to be not liking it as much in my office recently but i was there recently and had no complaints.very impressive! great place to take a group of people who can&#39;t decide what type of food they want.recommend!.all in all i wouldn&#39;t have expected such a lovely meal in such a club like environment but there you have it!.overall great evening..the steak frites was only ok and i&#39;d order something different next time.i also tried the el segundo sol burger which was hundred times flavorful than the fish one, it had melted chihuahua cheese and spicy mayo."
giant-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/giant-chicago-2,2,"Sweet corn was a stunner, basically elote cut off the cob with kaffir lime baseline.have already made it to giant three times during their short existence and have worked my way through the entire menu other than a couple of dishes.the food, the service, and even the coursing was right on.wow!! my wife and i had the pleasure of dining at giant last weekend and the entire experience was stellar! we both agreed it was one of the best meals we&#39;ve had in a long time and is definitely on our top restaurants list.food was pretty good.she was thebomb.we got the uni shooters and biscuits with jalapeño butter to start, and then shared the steak and scalloped potatoes.the chefs were a blast and it was awesome watching them assemble complex dishes while making it look so simple.had a great meal here tonight with excellent service and a wonderful atmosphere..sweet &amp; sour eggplant ($14) - my favorite dish of the night! it was spicy and sweet with the cashews giving it a good texture contrast..can&#39;t wait to go back!.everything we ordered did taste wonderful (jonah crab salad, uni shooters, broccoli, swordfish, cannelloni) but i don&#39;t thinkwe will be back.even if you don&#39;t think you like eggplant, order it.we enjoyed the uni shooter.garlic buttermilk potatoes: delicious.need a better craft beer list with higher abv beers.for desserts - had the cajeta ice cream.5 stars: fried uni shooter, corn (fusion taco dip meets mexican street corn),  biscuits w jalapeño butter,  cocktails(campanelli and brown &amp; stirred- both are classic &amp; balance)  4 stars: swordfish (huge dollop of aioli and giardiniera were overwhelming,  tasted like a deconstructed fish sandwich with no bread, which was actually  pretty good)  2 stars: yellow cake crepe (charred about a half inch around the edge and in spots which  made the whole thing taste acrid like burnt griddle scrapings, but the middle was creamy and the cherries were tasty.what a gem and great addition the neighborhood!we went here to celebrate my fiance&#39;s birthday.after hearing that nightwood&#39;s chef was to open a new restaurant, i was very excited.i hope the chef looks into this since he deserves so much better.it was strange in a good way.my only advice is to order a dessert other than their yellow cake crepe; that was probably the only option on the menu that we felt was underwhelming -- definitely good, but just not perfect like everything else...the entire experience was enjoyable, our server patrick was awesome, and i will totally be going back..we got desserts and that was the only real disappointment of the night.perfectly cooked and a real kick from the giardiniera.we loved dining at giant and would definitely recommend it.we shared the broccoli, the onion rings which were possibly the best onion rings i&#39;ve had, the thai chili corn (they removed some dried shrimp to the side), and the sortallini with the guanciale on the side.we will return!!.way too many combinations, spices and flavors that didn&#39;t match.let me tell you, coming in with lowered expectations made my meal at giant just a-ok.i tried the zucchini, eggplant, peppers (maybe these were a bit boring, but the accompanying sourdough bread was amazing) sortallini and finished with the cajeta ice cream for desert.can&#39;t wait to go back and try some of the other items we saw!  ps- use the reserve app to make reservations- get dat did.the candied lemon zest made a second appearance and it made the dessert.they&#39;ve curated a beautiful space and menu, and are executing on all levels."
wasabi-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wasabi-chicago,2,"Heard from my friends that the store is really small so the wait is long on weekends, so we decided to come here on a weekday and there was no line at 6:30, but the restaurant is pretty much fullwe had the ramen, the broth is great, tasty but not salty.i was starving.i like my pork belly more cripsy this was a lil to flabby but still delicous.small plates, fried and grilled skewers are great also.would come back here again!.now for the ramen, i order the tonkotsu ramen and for a small additional charged added the braised pork belly instead of the regular pork belly.came here for lunch on a sunday around 1:30, since i heard the place gets packed during dinner time and this was a ramen place i was very interested in!ordered the oyster shooter, takoyaki, tonkotsu ramen and the shio ramen.we went for a late dinner and brought a bottle of wine.the service on the other hand was really poor.the broth wasn&#39;t too spicy.i found the tonkotsu ramen here disappointing.pretty much everything else i tried there was also delicious (seaweed salad, mushroom skewers, dragon roll, mochi icecream and cheesecake dessert).i get bloated pretty often when eating ramen, usually because there&#39;s too much stuff going on in the broth.noodles are cooked to the perfect texture, and pork briskest and eggs are just amazing.the service is great, the food is great, and the ambience is great.the kid wanted eggs so the waitress brought him some tamago.if this rating was based solely on the ramen, it would be 4 stars.stop looking what to order.i don&#39;t mind having to wait for a table which is the norm here.use to going to other place none as wasabi but more for sushi.&#34; the brussel sprouts were incredibly flavorful and cripsy, gone in minutes, that&#39;s how good they were.the broth is delicious and you will slurp it all up.the service has been good and consistent each time, this place is also byob, but they recently limited to only wine and beer i believe, so no hard liquor.it gets really busy after 6 and table turnover is slow.came by for dinner last week; tight space in terms of the tables we were put at (four adults and two kids in a booth made for tight confines), and the prices on the small plates are exorbitant but correctly priced if you consider them true tapas.spicy roasted garlic miso ramen was amazing.the tonkatsu was amazing as well.every ramen place has been a disappointment since trying wasabi last year.my friend and i both got the spicy garlic miso base for our ramen, and it was everything that i generally love in my ramen - layers of flavors between the miso, garlic, and spice.it&#39;s great for ramenwe definitely coming back!!!.i ended up giving my friend the leftovers.it lacked the sweet soy sauce flavor.it&#39;s like someone plugged in my ipod and played the hits.they did not have to do that, though it was appreciated.they also have yakitori which is pretty tasty as well.your octopus puff are my favorite thing in the world.i love the atmosphere.we&#39;ve tried wasabi twice now.the food knocked it out of the park, and the service was spot on.the ramen here shows a better balance between richness and overpowering flavor than furious spoon.so he appropriately chose to spicy ramen on his humid summer birthday.this is a great restaurant whose food deserves 5 stars, but whose operation deserves 3 stars.the combination was the perfect spicy tonkotsu ramen with a creamy pork broth.the ramen is where it&#39;s at!.makes any trip to chicago worth it.i purposely ordered the hot yogi vegan roll because i wanted to taste the full flavor of their famous fresh wasabi and it is very good.the ramen was pretty good, indeed.there was a pretty long wait, but they said that for a party of 2, we would be seated pretty quickly.the tonkotsu and (spicy) miso versions are both excellent, with a rich, deep-flavored broth, perfectly springy noodles, and amazingly tender pork belly.because people are waiting for their ramen fix.you cannot order a ramen to go.the wait ended up being about 10 or 15 minutes, so it wasn&#39;t bad.the food is amazing but the fact that the &#34;host&#34; asked to wait outside (yes, like outside on the sidewalk) for the rest of our party was ridiculous.they do not take reservations, so show up when you want, most likely there will be a wait as we came around 9:30pm and waited around 30 minutes for a table of 5..will come back to try other ramen bowls..i had to miss two days of work, i had to cancel my spot at a charity event with my boyfriend (tickets cost $150 per person, so it cost $300 total), and i had to cancel on a work event with the head of my office (which was not good).came here last night to try menu items other than ramen.it was so tasty without being overly rich as the tonkatsu ramen was.the broth was rich, flavorful, with lots of goodies inside.for the roll, the kimchi adds the perfect tangy, uniqueness that i&#39;ve never tasted anywhere else before.don&#39;t know what all the hype is over.order list:- tonkatsu ramen- spicy roasted garlic miso ramen- takoyaki- mag mile- pork buns- oyster shooterhands down best ramen in chicago.hidden gem in the logan square neighborhood.it melts in your mouth..i have had their tonkotsu, which is really yummy, but my go-to is their vegan ramen with egg noodles, which i&#39;m glad they have now put on their regular menu (rather than the white slip they give you with your menu)! it doesn&#39;t come with an egg, but you can add one! the broth is really amazing - i even converted my brother who adds an egg and a pork belly to it (which really confuses the waiters haha).if you order nothing else, get the pork belly buns.but then tragedy struck.the broth was very rich and flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly.would definitely go back and recommend to others.a true food memory that i was lucky enough to share with the yelp lou community manager.will post comments on tips and photos.not your average rice paper spring rolls.i would not go back by my own choosing (there are way too many sushi places in chicago to go somewhere mediocre) but i guess i would if someone really wanted to.i am a pureblooded californian, so even in late fall chicago is (insert expletive here) cold for me."
topo-gigio-ristorante-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/topo-gigio-ristorante-chicago,1,"I really enjoyed it.i have been to this restaurant twice now with my husband and the food and service was great both times.besides the great food, the waiters have authentic italian accents and refilled my water glass quickly each time it was empty.excellent service and food during the many times i&#39;ve visited..topo gigio represents.crispy skin and a crunchy crust on the flaky flesh.i might have enjoyed my dinner more if i had been comfortable.it was so good!!i had the conchiglie alla sarda (seashell pasta in a tomato cream sauce with ground sausage, peas, and pecorino cheese) since it was the general recommendation and was not disappointed..which i&#39;d have to say is worth it once you try their food.great on a weekend lunch, service quick and on point, food very tasty and filling, and the price reasonable.we ended up ordering the caprese salad and the carpaccio appetizers.it is definitely a hidden spot for a weekend brunch, and it is close to all the shopping in old town and la founette for tasty croissant.soggy breading.if you want authentic italian, come here.the steak was burnt on the outside.i advise you learn a bit of italian pronunciation before coming if you want to appear well versed.food and service is still excellent.the patio and outdoor seating is a great plus.***update - i was just emailed a copy of the receipt and they did actually refund the one meal.topo doesn&#39;t need use cheap tricks to make flavorful food.our entree was great too ! will definitely  come back again !.)we declined the second surcharge, told the owner to put the original mozzarella substitution on our salads and i would walk to the nearby treasure island and buy a tub of fresh, large buffalo mozzarella balls imported from italy there.for dessert, we ordered the tiramisu and it was just as good as the first time.this place gets packed on weekends, so make sure you go early if you can! the staff here sometimes gets hard to understand (thick accents), the drinks are nothing to brag about, but there&#39;s a feeling of going to grandma&#39;s house for good hearty food that you just can&#39;t quite get anywhere else!the seafood salad, the calamari, and every pasta i&#39;ve ever had here are my favorites! the prices are by no means cheap, but food wise, you truly get a bang for your buck!.it sounds like any troubles people had in that department were self created.this italian restaurant had authentic italian food that was delicious!! it was very home-y feeling and the menu was impressive.it is exactly what i expect when visiting chicago which i try to do as frequently as possible because the city rocks!  and how charming is old town??

mad-social-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mad-social-chicago,1,"Fantastic ambiance and delicious food!.i love this area of chicago because it&#39;s less invaded with tourist and it&#39;s own little community.food was fantastic, and staff was beyond friendly.they were very salty and spicy but not in a good way.our finale was the short rib benedict.the restaurant also features a full bar with a number of imaginative cocktails on the list.tuna poke3.the service and friendly staff was great.seems like lots of others really enjoyed this place.most everything on their brunch menu sounded great.then for entrees i had chicken &amp; waffles w/ milanese chicken on a churro pressed waffle.the service from the staff was top notch, what you would expect from a phil stefani restaurant.a+ brunch.- chicken and waffles - pretty classic, really liked the way the chicken was breaded.i actually used the homemade hot sauce that comes with the chicken and waffle to add a kick.for an appetizer we had bao buns..i don&#39;t think this place really knows what it wants to be.if we didn&#39;t live in the &#39;burbs - we&#39;d make this our weekly brunch visit.everything we got for brunch was very good.sometimes restaraunts miss the mark by making their octopus way too salty, and we are all left underwhelmed with empty water glasses.we were not completely forgotten, but the service made a good food experience, just okay.i liked the vibe but wish it were not as loud because it was challenging to have a conversation and you know girls like to chat! nonetheless, i&#39;d happily return to try other things &amp; drinks on the menu.went back to mad social last thursday and it was awesome! i finally got to try the ceviche and calamari.prices a little high, but golden monkey makes you forget about that.it has a bit of crunch to is and take your regular mac and cheese to the next level.our server was pretty awful- clueless and inattentive.i had a mad-hatten.atmosphere is sort of like a cramped brasserie.we had the1.skip.we also ordered this octopus, tuna tower and corn cakes.the chicken lollipops were tasty and easy to share.my suggestion would be please review your specials with your patrons!.the bao buns, flatbread and chicken lollipops were my favorite.we got the bacon, of course! the steak was cooked well (not too chewy or overcooked) and it was a great complement to our chicken and waffles that we shared.they never rushed us or hurried us along.outstanding.they have a small menu but all of the food was amazing.the good - our server was extremely attentive and friendly.if you are looking for a new brunch spot, visit mad social because they will not disappoint you.it tasted fine, but just a little bit of a let down.the drinks are phenomenal, the cheese tray is divine, and the burger is something i actually dream about.what a great find!!!i took my parents here on saturday night and what a great experience we had!our server was great at suggesting the best items and the food omg!!!!! the brussel sprouts, bao buns, chicken and waffles, tuna crudo and fried carrot cake were my favorites.i could not get enough.drinks:  the bloody mary is good, but i don&#39;t think the mix is home made, or at least it doesn&#39;t really have any outstanding flavors.if they can&#39;t afford to comp water i wonder if they also skip little expenses like dish soap, clean napkins, and having food preparation areas cleaned.great brunch items, stunning dinner menu; you have to check it out.food was a major disappointment despite its reviews.we were greeted by two lovely hostesses, and escorted to one of the booths in this wonderfully designed space.recommend..it was a very classy, laid-back, and comfortable time! and service was great.great spot for a date!..i kind of understand if some important sports ball game is on but otherwise can we just turn them off? :) the music was horrible aerosmith, etc.our service was prompt and friendly.she also said she&#39;s going to make sure to space everything out accordingly so we will have he opportunity to try everything we ordered.she was wrong.not that i really like super meaty oysters, but these literally almost had no meat whatsoever.tapas/shared plates + yummy cocktails + great atmosphere = winning combogreat spot for a small/medium sized group of people.even the $21 burger was just a decent burger.great meal and excellent service.i usually have one absolute favorite dish that i tell people that they have to get, but mad social was different; i&#39;d just tell people to get all of these+try new things..great atmosphere, with good food and good services.i felt like it was an elevated version of street food with the smoked paprika and the fried egg for creamy texture.who knew? this thing will feed me for daaaaays!mad social is a mad experiment in combination french and classic southern fried foods (hilarious and fun to see as a southerner in the north), which, as it turns out, is a match made in heaven.beef tartare: 4 stars.since it&#39;s new i made a reservation and was happy to see the place was packed when we got there."
ancien-cycles-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ancien-cycles-chicago-2,1,"A welcome addition to hyde park.i recommend the avocado toast! delicious!..staff was super friendly too!.skip the starbucks across the street!.i would give it 6, but alas yelp does not give me that option.this place is a hidden gem! i mean it&#39;s so easy to roll on by it since it&#39;s under the train tracks.i just had a latte.these aren&#39;t things i really care about, but feedback that someone probably will complain about in the future -- the milk foam has been sort of weak and not super thick- the hot espresso drinks get cold too fast, for whatever reason.with the exception of the pastries, everything is made fresh to order.i have not tried food yet.definitely not worth the 40+ minutes we waited.i&#39;ve been here a few times and it&#39;s always been a pleasant experience.what probably separates this little cafe from the rest is the quality of the coffee and food.great vibes, lovely place to study/hang out.there was lots of seating when i popped in, perfect for catching up on work.i bought a mocha, which was good and a blueberry muffin which i haven&#39;t eaten yet..the food is super yummy and the coffee is strong and well made.while i waited, i enjoyed a $2 cup of coffee that was perfectly adequate, higher quality than i normally expect for that price."
ruxbin-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ruxbin-chicago,2,"I like the food here.we ordered 2 appetizers.ruxbin is particularly notable for the clever and unconventional pairing of asian ingredients and flavors with more conventional components; grilled octopus served on a smear of chinese salted soybeans (dao see), or jackfruit stewed carnitas-style..she was attentive without being smothering.a+second round: revisited circa may 2016 for their spring menu.this place is a bit overrated in my opinion.the taste is very complex.can&#39;t recommend enough!..i think my 3..reservation worked without much hazzle and i was even contacted beforehand concerning the valentine&#39;s menu.i&#39;m also not a fan of the new &#34;shared menu&#34; concept (you pick five dishes of a dozen or so on the menu and they are served for the table).this place has been on my bucket list for the past couple years..it was veryyy good, except i have one complaint.you&#39;ll find something new and fun every time you go.the place is small and the interior is very nice but not special.a friend took me here for a birthday dinner prepared to spend whatever necessary to make me forget turning 35.had higher hopes for this place- friend recommended it, food and service was slow, nothing to write home about.nice sized portions and beautiful presentation.we also ordered desserts of course and i really enjoyed the dark chocolate custard with raspberries.think about the types of proteins and vegetables you like to eat to make your decision, but don&#39;t go just by the menu because it sounds like a lot of stuff, and when the food comes out it is a lot of things you may have never had before but you&#39;ll be glad you took this food adventure.i attempted most of the menu and i adore the avocado toast, pan seared trout, and my absolute favorite the lychee panna cotta with coconut.you enjoy breathing air.in the case of our seafood dish, 4 scallops and 4 shrimp.i&#39;ve taken away 1 star for the service.they have some really unique decorations and it&#39;s byob to boot.that will provide your table with two small plates, two larger plates and one dessert.amazing dinner! a hidden gem that only has seating for a select few.as yummy as i remember from a few years ago! tried the new menu structure (5 course communal dishes @ $65/pp).we were told that they grew some of vegetables in their own garden.the second was the foie gras.-for the hungry, just know that for dessert, you get individual plates.i don&#39;t mind the sharing, but over the course of 2.alas, between the time that we reserved and we actually ate at ruxbin, they&#39;ve changed the menu pricing and format, and apparently the portions as well.i will never forget it.my server yesterday, charlie, was so passionate about what they were serving and i let  him course out my dinner for me.and the bathroom is a must visit- it&#39;s unique! so glad i got to celebrate my birthday at ruxbin!.the food though for me, while it was good, it didn&#39;t blow me away.i stopped by to let he chef know and he was very gracious.unless someone wants to go there, i probably won&#39;t go back though.definitely as good as it gets.from the moment we walked in the door, we were met with such warmth from the staff.after a long night, it&#39;s easy to get frustrated with your final diners.i&#39;m a vegan, so the first time i went i was a bit worried about finding options that would fit my vegan diet..love the fruity taste..i thoroughly enjoyed the oysters, fries, octopus, steak, chocolate dessert..the grilled octopus was paired with a creative dark sauce of fermented bean curd, which highlighted the protein&#39;s smoky umami flavor..the decor is unique, a bit artsy, and the setting is very cozy, in the sense that you are pretty close to your neighbors&#39; tables, but at the same time it feels intimate.one of my favorite spots in chicago, but have only been there once since they became a prix fixe restaurant.portion sizes are very ample.the restaurant is small with a cool atmosphere.highly recommend!.i love the cozy decor, which is a bit quirky.very delicious.the portions were on the small side so don&#39;t come when you&#39;re starving.they give you free popcorn to start too.the food is excellent and never disappoints.great atmosphere..amazing creative delicious cuisine! highly recommend the chef&#39;s table.i took off a star because i wish it was at a price point that is more affordable for a saturday night dinner and not only special occasions.when my brother in law first introduced me to ruxbin, i was instantly intrigued by the decor and ambiance, and then quickly hooked when we had our first dish.we had the grilled octopus, venison, halibut, pork belly and half chocolate cake and hlaf carrot cake.."

shabowl-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shabowl-chicago,1,"Great vegetarian option.i&#39;ve gone here twice now to grab a bite, and both times it&#39;s been great! the first time i ordered the tofu banh mi, this time i got the chicken banh mi with a taro boba tea for $2 (combo).their bobas and smoothies are the best.this place hasn&#39;t been around long but if word gets out i can see them serving up tastiness for years to come.admittedly the lackluster street sign doesn&#39;t give you much hope for this little gem but there&#39;s a certain virtue in the focus on what matters - the food.came here after i was strolling down  armitage in lincoln park minding my own business when i got a whiff of this place.besides the food being great, the owner(?)/chef was so wonderful! he was short staffed so he seemed a little flustered at first but ended up being so helpful and sweet and friendly.i gave it a bit more time and the one employee did not get off the phone or gesture to me, and the other did not return.they were pretty tasty, although i found the accompanied sauce to be a tad too sweet.i&#39;m definitely coming back again when i&#39;m on armitage.i got spring rolls and chicken pho.good addition to the neighborhood! got the chicken shabowl and it was good, great value for the price.they have very tasty chicken rice bowls and sandwiches.i think that filipino food tends towards the drier side (where the flavor is in the meat marinade instead of a sauce), and i found my dish kind of dry.quick turn over time.i was happy to find this place in the area.."

publican-quality-meats-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/publican-quality-meats-chicago,1,"The only downside was the sandwitch was a little small.their sandwiches (which often rotate) were a staple of my lunch orders when i worked in the loop this past year.this is definitely a must-try in the area.we saw the butcher bring out the entire roast on a large cutting board.it had beef tongue in it which was doubtful at first but melted in your mouth.great selections and they are so helpful for preparing certain offerings.t.the sandwich came with a bag of deep river chips and a pickle spear.wonderful complement to the publican next door.these were not at all creepy.one of my favorite places to eat! went here for a lunch date, he and i both enjoyed the small patio over the summer.the house made sausage was a huge highlight, as were the breakfast potatoes that come with a spicy aoili..the sausage was so flavorful, and the chorizo hash had soft potatoes and crunchy bits with a hint of meat in the taste..fermented and aged soybean mash in re-purposed bourbon barrels.amazing burger night is what we had last weds when we went to dine at this fabulous restaurant.brought the check without ever checking on us, i did want another drink but ok, message received.there&#39;s a little waiting area by the counter where they sell different meats and cheeses, and lots of interesting condiments / sauces line the shelves by the window..the wait is over 2 hours and they put their friends in first.for our main brunch dishes we got the lake street fish platter (an open faced smoked salmon baguette sandwich with greens, onion, soft boiled egg, and a light lemon vinaigrette-so so good!) and the fried chicken and biscuit sandwich which was also great.held a private event here and the food was delish!  an amazing avocado and asparagus salad with pistachios - yum!  followed by super tender chicken (a bit salty) with the most addictive french fries drowning in the chicken juice.and please pay attention to my other reviews and general take on food.it came with some caramelized onions and red peppers, along with some cucumber and cauliflower.great service.they also prepared the meats downstairs.this is the kind of place that will make you wish you had two stomachs.i sampled my friend&#39;s hot apple cider and man was it good.the flavors were uneventful, and the sandwich size represented two smaller sized pieces of bread only a few notches away from being the heel.loved it! absolutely delicious.i&#39;ll really ask what their top item is next time and order that.the menu isn&#39;t too big so picky eaters might be put off a bit.personally, i prefer the publican because they served more hot foods.they also have outdoor patio seating when it&#39;s nice out.their pâté game is on point! wide variety of meat and cheese, specially sodas, beer, and sauces/spices.this ain&#39;t no boar&#39;s head.my sandwich was pretty tasty, the turkey was marinated in a sauce similar to sriracha sauce, topped with guac and red onion.cute little meat and cheese deli with a restaurant in the back.also, they seemingly run out of glass and silverware every time i come here and have to reuse glasses if different beers are ordered or serve them in plastic cups.the feta is a perfect pairing to the sausage.brought my mom to lunch here one day.good bloody mary.he did tell me that they aren&#39;t allowed to take folks down to their processing room but.the chicken was great, the cheese was delicious, the basil didn&#39;t seem super fresh and the marinara sauce was a bit on the bland side.the register clerk was super helpful as well, i ended up getting a chicken parm sandwich, but that was just ok.so delicious and custom..you may have to wait a little for service as a result.it&#39;s good.i&#39;m not sure if it was because they were slicing meats to-order for sandwiches in between our orders, but it might be nicer to have separate areas/ functions for to-go vs.the guys got the pork belly gyros and they must have been amazing because i didn&#39;t even get offered a bite, and i&#39;m usually able to steal one! i was able to taste the slaw that came with the gyro and it was amazing--light and vinegar based and crunchy.i&#39;d want to try the wagu sandwich next.25 - $1.i could definitely taste the difference.the brisket sandwich was completely fine, but definitely overpriced and overhyped.they like princes, but i&#39;m the only one who get to eat like a queen.i love fresh bread, so i decided to try publican&#39;s sourdough - made with rye and wheat flour.in fact it was so good, i have been looking for similar places in the san francisco bay area :) must haves include the charcuterie plate , the big e and the butcher&#39;s breakfast.apple pie ($5) -- the best apple pie in chicago.whatever you get, it will not suck.nice alternative to the publican which is a bit more formal.can&#39;t wait to go back!..surprisingly it wasn&#39;t weird at all to sit next to people you didn&#39;t know.these are the best sandwiches in chicago, and at any given time one of their new temporary menu additions is as good as any sandwich in the world.the chacuterie platter next to us was drool-worthy- but how much can two gals eat?we got the porchetta sammy - served with chips, and the chicken parm - that chicken parm sandwich will haunt my dreams, the roll was the stand out- almost like savory french toast.their lunch is so creative and delicious.well hot dog, get that roast beef sandwich.absolutely worth checking out if you&#39;re in the area.service was fascinating.also tried the kale side and white rabbit salad, which was a very generous plate of greens and curds.i need one a week, at least.the prior is just a restaurant, while the latter functions as a butcher, sandwich and specialty foods shop that also offers brunch on the weekends.with a place that has that much amazing pork, you need to have wine.after you eat, check out the items for sale in the deli."
paramount-room-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/paramount-room-chicago,1,"We started with the belly sticks, which were just ok.it is a dive-y place so the atmosphere was to be expected but the prices are too high for what it is.the drink prices were reasonable only cuz the mixed drinks and whiskey were very generous..the fries were pretty standard.cool spot, great craft beer with bartenders who know their stuff.hole in the wall that my coworkers and i came to during lunch.ontop of slow service, the server failed to tell us what the daily specials were and we didn&#39;t realized that was option till we left the bar.service is also fantastic.it&#39;s never roudy or too bro-like even though they have a tv for some sports games.it&#39;s a small place, not ideal for more than 4 together.service is attentive.the atmosphere/space was cool.stick with the fries and green beans and you&#39;ll be straight.i have this impulsive habit of ordering alcohol whenever i&#39;m in a bar atmosphere.who wants a burger sans fries?!?  it&#39;s so unexpected for a burger to come without fries, i don&#39;t even know if it is explicitly listed on the menu..since my five-star review, this place changed their menu and got rid of all of my favorites.i was kind of surprised how expensive our bill was despite only getting oysters, fries, and one drink each.the service is good, drink options a-plenty, and a nice ambiance.however, it was not cooked medium rare but more medium well.one stand-alone is a wagu beef burger with a pint for $12 before 3pm!stand-outs from the tiny kitchen include french onion soup, belly benedict on tuscan toast and escarole, and duck poutine with manchego.eaten here 20-25 times and the quality is consistent - never had a bad beer or food item.enjoy!.had the burger with bacon and kaleslaw and onion rings on the side..beer selection is better than most.even with the downstairs got busy, service was still great!the food was super.then they brought us our burgers which we all ordered medium/rare (which is how i take nearly all beef).teenage son was the only one who demolished the burger completely.been a pretty consistent customer here for the last 6 years.this is our local go-to &#34;i don&#39;t feel like making dinner&#34; cop-out.it only took a couple of years.3 of those tables are close to the door, so they&#39;re chilly.of course we had drinks too..in addition, the poutine and drinks were great! the service was not obtrusive and we were seated right when we got in despite an odd set up.it came with sriracha to enhance the flavor.but nothing special tiny portioncarrot cake-tasted like lightly flavored bread.menu online said it&#39;s $12 and not extra for cheese on the burger and fries.drinks and beers were tasty.any place that has fresh $1.paramount[par-uh-mount]dictionary..we called 2 weeks in advance, and asked if we could bring 20-25 people through on a saturday at 2pm as part of a bar crawl.went for the food on recommendation, really poorly prepared all around..we both had the pork chop picatta for our entrees..my wife ordered the green beans as an appetizer.-chilled ahi - the deviled egg salad went well with the ahi, but overall the ahi itself was way too salty.the dipping sauce was very tasty."

oh the sake bombs were flowing all night long.there is a bar upstairs with lots of books, which really puzzled me but i enjoyed the interior as a whole.the food was also very tasty and i liked that you can try many things.our server was so attentive and fast! the food was so so good and they had so many great lunch (happy hour) deals..we really enjoyed the dinner specials they offered, had one of them and were totally stuffed by the time our meal was over.that&#39;s fine.ahha.the wait was ridiculous, but we checked out watershed a few blocks away.i love korean bbq.the best grilled meats are toro beef andkalbi short rib, which just melt in my mouth.the rice they give is good but adding the spicy sauce they have makes it so much more flavorful, we actually ordered another bowl for us.great food and excellent experience!.i think for me - i like going out to eat and have someone cook for me.i ordered 2 beef dishes (yaki-shabu and a thinly sliced beef), enoki mushrooms, spinach garlic, steamed shrimp dumplings &amp; rice.yum.hot oil salmon was also very good.i came when they have happy hour, the food is cheap, the meat is very fresh..but for what it&#39;s worth, i really enjoyed it and it was some good satisfaction until i can make my way back to japan again..highly recommend this restaurant as well as their west loop location 100% to anyone seeking quality food.we had the lunch special which is a choice of three meats, salad (i could drink the salad dressing plain, it&#39;s so good), miso soup, and rice.even with a reservation, my team and i has to wait over 30 minutes to be seated.service initially looked rough, but luckily my family of four was treated to a very helpful and informational server.95).fresh ingredients.a delicious diversion off of michigan avenue, gyu-kaku features a wide range of meats for bbq ranging from spicy pork and beef filet, to slightly more exotic fair like lamb and beef tongue.i ordered the samurai meal for two.of course you have to pay extra and buy veggies like broccoli or asparagus individually.however, most meat are marinated so i didn&#39;t have to use the table sauces.they have a top ten list..exceptional food, exceptional service.well, that&#39;s the fun.and try some of the other meats they have.this place is fun, expensive and boozy!come here and drop some greenbacks on tiny portions of meat you cook yourself, but, believe me! the tiny portions are delicious! and good lord - order the garlic fried rice - i have never! it&#39;s outta this damn world.they were soft and flavorful.from great servers, to great managers, to great hosts, to great food, to saki."
the-matchbox-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-matchbox-chicago,2,"The vibe of this bar was completely different from the other 3 we had just come from...i never pass by and don&#39;t stop in for a taste here.smaller than foley&#39;s on irving and also brendan&#39;s on broadway.we moved all the way from lakeview to west town just to be closer to the matchbox.since we can&#39;t 5 will have to cover it.it&#39;s a description of this joint, so be prepared to get cozy with your company and the other 3 people that can fit in this bar.nothing makes me happier than to hear them talk to dumb girls who &#34;like omg want a cosmo like literally&#34;.who designed the layout of this bar.word to the wise:  it is very small, so get here early and snag a seat.best food from sister restaurant, the palm (try: veggie burger, fried, asparagus and ribs)if you don&#39;t agree, please don&#39;t come back - i&#39;ll happily hog your spot!..i recommend the sidecar which is a classic but strong and delicious.best gimlets anywhere.to be fair, however, it made for a funny story and really was consistent with the feel of the place (plus they had soap and warm water, so i can&#39;t complain too much).i have loved this spot for years and i&#39;m so glad that i returned!  i love the premise of the matchbox, as it truly is as small as a matchbox!  and that makes it a perfect spot to meet many new, fun friends!i was very happy with the beer list, the bartenders, and the patrons.despite the cramped quarters, those old fashioneds will bring me back here for sure.good food and drinks.the service is consistent.but, when have a place that is indeed the size of a matchbox, it&#39;s impossible to go during any hours respectable to grab a drink.the resulting impracticalities (the restroom; sometimes getting hit with a door) weed out the folks who would rather be on hubbard or in wrigleyville.cocktails are creative and delicious!.let&#39;s start with first impression.oh, and getting drunk.cozy place, amazing staff with great taste in music and tasty drinks.so i drank half the shaker, and then 3/4 of the way through, i let my margarita expert friend britt c.you know it&#39;s good because it&#39;s featured prominently on the tv show &#34;justified&#34; - a drama where a sherrif&#39;s deputy drinks bourbon and/or moonshine, slays all of the goodlooking babes in this town, and shoots with impugnity (because it&#39;s justified).reasonably priced.they also have other great specialty drinks that they make from scratch..it has been too long since i came here for a cocktail!  ha ha, looking back at my old review in 2007, my cocktail taste has definitely changed...i decided to stop in and have a drink so i didn&#39;t feel guilty about using the loo.wow, what a great bar.silverpalm next door is amazing as well, i believe there owned by the same people.also very strog, i could say maybe even too strog, but you can&#39;t complain about that.he said it had cilantro and lime and balsamic vinegar.the drinks are cheap, sweet and refreshing..it is a tiny bar that serves excellent cocktails...how have i  not written a review of this place until now, i love this place.i&#39;ve never been to the matchbox and even experienced annoying customers.unlike that terrible living situation, the matchbox is well-stocked with house infused liquors (pineapple vodka, anyone?) and bartenders who know how to make a mean cocktail.a hidden gem in chicago.no really, she farts; in my cubicle sometimes, even.the prices are also spot on as a $10 cocktail comes with a shaker which is basically a 2 for 1 deal....they have a tv, but since it&#39;s so small in there you really have to strain your neck to get a view of it.good ambiance, tight squeeze, and fruit flies in your drink..it&#39;s uncomfortable being in there, but i guess they have their regulars, so good for them.it may be small and cramped during peak hours but the bartenders are great and the silver palm next door tends to be less crowded if you want a more cozy atmosphere..i suggest going on a weekday when it is quieter.can barely get to back to use the bathrooms the place is so narrow..the decor is fun and the bartenders are pretty nice..this has been our favorite go to bar for years.btw, there are no &#34;bros&#34; here, thank the lord.88/365.no food.i suppose they have to maximize profit for their small size..there is way more seating outside, if the temp is right.we had a blast spending the afternoon with &#34;tony&#34; he was a friendly bartender that made the best margaritas and we loved the tiny atmosphere and locals that visited daily.."

nothing but fresh flavor!.it&#39;s not often that you order a meal to go and they bring you complimentary chips &amp; salsa and churros (which were amazing by the way).walking in, you are greeted as if youre walking into your friends house- comforting and casual.we ordered the steak, carnitas, baja fish, al pastor tacos and the steak fries.awesome!!

steak torta was  fantastic and will be coming back very soon.al pastor is the manfriend&#39;s go to taco, which you wouldn&#39;t know from the obscene sounds he made as he enjoyed his carnitas taco.the portions were just perfect.the greek torta was also amazing, the combination of flavors in the sandwich was perfect, and the bread was delicious.so yummy!.we ordered the queso and chicken tortas.everything was fresh and full of flavor.i honestly don&#39;t know how this place has such good reviews! i came here after reading the glowing reviews, and that was my first mistake- if you want to try it i highly recommend take out or delivery, the inside was so dirty! we walked in and all the servers were sitting at a table with friends, and their friends were clearly very inebriated..the owner rob and his uncle recently converted this old pizza place into a taqueria.everything was amazing.this place is a nice addition to the neighborhood.we went to torta haus with high expectations that, unfortunately, just weren&#39;t met.i usually don&#39;t do vegan, but trust me on it."

kimski-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kimski-chicago,1,"One of the specials was a pastry with cream and red bean filling but the filo (the flaky part that sandwiched the filling) was hard and the cream didn&#39;t taste like anything.i&#39;d say the food was closer to a 2.the sausage itself is fairly big, a little under jumbo size and enough to put down a medium size appetite itself.though for a dish called &#34;kimchi fried rice,&#34; there is very minimal kimchi flavor.m..the space was really nice - there were 2 bars and a nice dining space, as well as a really cute outdoor area.great atmosphere, great service, great drinks.liked this and went well with the beer!+the daily special which was a something-stradomus..plus , it didnt seem expensive at all.to be clear, kimski is not really a stand-alone restaurant.i think if you go here with the thought of the food just being bar food to snack on while having a drink then you&#39;ll be ok, but if you go wanting to have dinner (like we did) you&#39;ll be a little disappointed (like we were).we shared sausage fried rice, the maria&#39;s standard sausage, and the kopo wangs, which was all more than enough for two people.the omelet had a crapload of tasty veggies along with polish sausage.the maria standard was tasty with all its toppings and the bun seemed to have a buttery toast to it.the latter was my favorite..love the energy and the space.its pretty much a space kitsch version of fast casual dining.i should&#39;ve added an egg or meat to it for $2 more.kimski is a great place to hang out on the patio and have a craft beer or cocktail and have some truly unique combinations of flavors...chicken wings were ok but then again they&#39;re just chicken wings."

good location and food is good so if you live in the area i would go but if you are in a car i would pick another place if you like better italian food.i can&#39;t speak to the pasta any more, but i do know that this place can do better.fab neighborhood restaurant in lincoln park.i really like the pork chop.which is fine, but at least give us a status though.we liked the sausage on the fried polenta and the truffled fries as well.it&#39;s a great family owned eatery.dilly dallying and spending time with other, larger tables, screwing up the drink order from forgetting bread and then serving our salad after the meal.the owner pays attention to details like beautiful fresh cut flowers on the bar.remember those three words and you&#39;ve got a delicious meal guaranteed.we were seated promptly upon our arrival, right on time with our reservation.not necessarily my favorite italian place in chicago but definitely at the top of the list.service is good, portions are generous - sometimes we&#39;ll split an entree.my dad ordered the fusilli which i thought was a stand out..i do not recommend making a reservation through an app, just call the restaurant directly.take your things with you.we sat undisturbed for a couple minutes getting our bearings of the interior of the restaurant.walked next door to dee&#39;s chinese and got a table right away.another special was italian sausage and polenta.great neighborhood italian.great place to bring kids before 7 (rigatoni).cool atmosphere..my friends reintroduced me to the owner who briefly said hi and then went away..this place looked good and had a nice ambiance, but the food was extremely disappointing.you have to try it.i&#39;ve been to tarantino&#39;s many times and have never been disappointed with either the food or service.their approach hides the marinara on the bottom of the dish and dumps olive tapenade over top."

the wines are excellent too! the nice think about taylor street restaurants is that it is just far enough from downtown, so they never get super crowded, and you can get in and get your meal quickly.italian happens to be my favorite cuisine, and i often abhor paying substantial coin for food i believe i can make at home.definitely i&#39;ll be back.what a taste to me tastebuds.we r originally from ny and current from las vegas and we have not experienced friendliness in this town like this.everything was delicious but some options were definitely more cost/benefit friendly.i was walking around taylor streets and stumbled upon this gem.thanks  to chef jeremy branshaw for making our meals so special.the brown butter brownie was very satisfying, served warm with lots of rich sweet and nutty flavors.menu is a bit expensive but the davanti burger was good.we will come again for sure!.lastly, and most importantly, the food and wine were magnifico!.it is definitely one of my favorite italian restaurants in chicago and i&#39;ve never been disappointed.else, nice evening.the ravioli was amazing!!! the ambiance is perfect, the waiter was so helpful and introduced everything to us without even asking.all delicious.the wine list was are above average and reasonably priced (for the city).the restaurant seems to be centered around wine, with wine filling the walls all around you.the sea urchin is subtle with nice chunks of crab.went back and had ron again.i was greeted by the lovely bar that is home to italian and local beers as well as infused vodka and limoncello.we also ordered the grilled octopus- my favorite dish! super tender, juicy, and flavorful.their bread with hummus was delicious but my favorite i would have to say was the focaccia with fresh cow cheese and the local honey.sometimes when i go with friends, we wind up doing a number of small plates but i always insist on the polenta + ragu, ricotta and honey comb.they yell at everyone.the food and staff were great!  ron was amazing and we&#39;ll go back just because he was fun and we had such amazing service.it&#39;s a place that you must visit when in chicago!.we parked on the street.being italian now living in california i miss real italian food and this hit the spot :) the service was also spot on all due to our server ron..so happy with her service and recommendations.environment:cozy, clean, and bright for lunch - 3.ricotta cheese, arugula salad, and white mushroom pizza were all just ok.i couldn&#39;t help but savor every bite.really nice food! it was perfect for what we needed.double yum.i wasn&#39;t too fond of the bread that came with it.they are very different from each other as the linguini was wrapped in a savory seafood fragrance and the spaghetti was creamy and smooth.linguine was good but portions were small with little sea urchin.mini mason jars with tuscan toast - a delightful way to startboards: mascarpone polenta + ragù of the day - was either lamb or boar.rigatoni pomodori - this was good but as a warning, it comes with enormous chunks of onion in it..after sitting and enjoying our meal for 2.this was my favorite pizza, you can really taste the truffle oil and the mushrooms were so savory and umami.my server roberto was incredibly pleasant and helped me with my dinner choice.total disappointment.it&#39;s taylor street, people.italian style pizza: there are so many better in chicago.an excellent experience.service.during our recent visit, we tried the biondo torta del burro bruno which is the brown butter blondie with maple gelato, caramel sauce, and almonds and the torta bacio, which is the chocolate mousse, chocolate hazelnut crunch, and cocoa nibs.my wife made a reservation here for our 1st wedding anniversary.the only reason i gave it 4 is because i thought there could have been more dessert options including chocolate.definitely will be coming back for this.all of it.their tables weren&#39;t turning, even though several paid the bill..the toast and jam was reported by our kid as being excellent, and, as it was a rustic italian loaf dusted with potato flower, it was very good.had drinks, don&#39;t know the names, were also good.this might have been our favorite.this is the original davanti and the only 2 drawbacks i found on this visit is no outdoor seating, and both the weather and location was begging for that on a gorgeous summer day.there are two locations one in little italy and one in river north.very good food good menu selections and nice cozy place.4..that&#39;s a bit much in my mind.food: good! service: horrible!we have been here before and liked the food, so we decided to host our family there for a post-wedding get together.this was our last stop for the chicago trip.since we are gluttons, we definitely ordered way too much but my family prefers to have leftovers than be hungry!  we tried the truffle egg toast, d.he said they have a 2 hour limit on tables.if you like italian food, wine and hanging out with friends and family this is the place for you.i like the octopus which i know isn&#39;t for everyone.we had the ricotta and honey comb spread for an appetizer, which was really tasty; crushing the honeycomb into the cheese added a delicious sweet kick."

the sauces where wonderful and the complexity and creativity of every dish was refreshing and very interesting!i am not  easily or often impressed with many places i try and i must take my hat off to big and littles! from the fun relaxed atmosphere to the friendly staff to the interesting, refreshing and delicious food.we drove the 35 mins into town and went to their new location on milwaukee ave.the poboy was big, almost too big..for the bigger items, the al pastor burger is a new favorite of mine.it wasn&#39;t a welcoming environment.the food was hearty, filling and delicious.i ordered the soft shell crab poboy which i felt needed another whole crab in it to balance the bread to crab ratio but i understand they&#39;re trying to keep the cost reasonable.sandwich was a mess to eat (not a big deal) and generally a lot of flavorless bites.i love this place, the food is good and great for the price.it came out overlooked but i was starving and ate the whole thing.i&#39;ll be back!.i came here once with a groupon and loved it, now i look for any excuse to come to wicker park just so i can stop by big and little&#39;s!po&#39;boys are delicious (ask for a side of the special sauce!)fish tacos have never disappointed!the establishment is very welcoming and clean, the same can be said about the staff! you are treated with kindness!plenty of seating, tables are always clean and fully stocked with paper towels, and condiments.omar, i am pretty sure that was his name, was extremely helpful especially when he found out i was first timer.the one on belmont overcooks everything including the fries.lots of takeout/delivery orders being processed in front of my order, but it only took 12 minutes to get my food.i also really like the soft shell crab sandwich..the delay from order to food is hipster slow and kind of insulting.hadn&#39;t been, wanted to go, now i want to go back!.there was also some sort of slimey gooey light orange cream sauce that thoroughly soaked all the contents and the tortilla.i&#39;m not even a shrimp fan, but i love this sandwich.the manager felt my pain and ended up reimbursing me the cost of the meal, which was very nice.i rarely leave reviews and this place deserves a good one!.definitely try the raw ahi tuna taco.my only problem was that they didn&#39;t give enough fries.the zeus with gyros and egg was excellent.i was in greasy food heaven.we touched god that night.just delicious pork and fish made with fresh and flavorful toppings..amazing food! better then places that cost 2x as much and take 2x as long.but i love ahi tuna and i love when it&#39;s done right.but this was the best service i&#39;ve ever had in my life!we were a group of 4 checking in with our groupons ($10 for $20 worth of food) &amp; they were patient &amp; kind.they have plenty of tables and a clean potty.the pork/crab po boy was consistent (great!) but my fish was burnt and super salty (yikes).great customer service! this was my family&#39;s first time being there so they recommended the soft-shell crab sandwich..i don&#39;t see what the big deal is.the tacos here are smaller than the original location.served with a healthy portion of grilled onions on top and smothered in what i believe was sweet baby ray bbq sauce, i savored every bit of that thing.next time is burgers and bahn mi&#39;s.best part is they are open early for breakfast and serve the whole menu at that time, plus byob! mimosas and tacos anyone???.it is definitely a place for a quick meal and also an alternative if you don&#39;t want to fight for seats in antique tacos down the street!.secondly, the food is totally affordable.i have no idea what the hype is about.truffle fries tasted like regular.she said the al pastor, so that&#39;s what i got (beef patty, fried pork belly, pineapple, jalapenos, special sauce) and the truffle fries..i truly do love the raw ahi tuna taco! it&#39;s amazing!!!! place is little hard to order from the first time by there is so many choices.food was good.i honestly feel like even if the food was mediocre (which it&#39;s not) we&#39;d still like it..must have: blue crab taco.bleh i have tried so hard to like this place since i live next door.this food is very rich.simply put, you come on a chill hang out or date night ready to eat and you&#39;ll leave satisfied.biters beware,featured on triple d with guy fieri, he described the pork belly po boy as &#34;chicharrones meets pulled pork.my brother, on the other hand, loved his zeus burger and was stuffed when he finished that.favorites were the samurai taco, rising sun taco, and spicy beef short rib taco.that&#39;s what we came for after all...everything is a pretty small portion, but it was fine for us as we were really going for the taste.here.i think they lost some quality once the restaurant got more popular and they opened the second location in lakeview."

aloha-eats-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/aloha-eats-chicago,2,", this place is amazing! over a pound of food for 10 bucks, can&#39;t beat that! i recommend the double chicken all white meat with two scoops of mac and one scoop of rice..85), fried shrimp plate ($10.i got the chicken katsu salad.being born and raised in hawai&#39;i myself, i definitely know good plate lunches when i see one.the chicken katzu, bbq chicken, shrimp, and the pork katzu are my faves.tried the chicken katsu plate and the kahlua pork plate.they only include it if you order some kind of katsu, and will charge you $1 for more (esp those that want the sauce but didn&#39;t order anything fried).p.haha i&#39;m very picky with fooddefinitely get that combo plate! i&#39;m actually thinking of getting one today after work.even after pouring over the katsu sauce, there was still an audible crunch with every bite, bringing together panko crumbs with juicy chicken and sweet katsu sauce.the servings are heaping so come hungry.don&#39;t forget to get the liliko hawaiian drink!!.double chicken special is always a guarantee for me and the wife.coming to chicago i was excited for deep dish pizza, italian beef, and chicago dogs.say aloha to my stomach, you delicious eats.boy, please...the macaroni salad that mine came with was also very good.it was just ok, nothing outstanding.have had the katsu, but really dream about the chicken bbq..i&#39;d give them a 5, but they forgot one of my orders.i don&#39;t know what authentic hawaiian food is supposed to taste like, but i feel like aloha eats does a great job with delicious comfort food.this was my first time eating hawaiian in a chicago a few years ago, and i&#39;ll be honest, i wasn&#39;t entirely sold.there&#39;s only one person who works the cash register as well as the ever busy to go order calls.finally got the chance to eat here, very hard to find parking around this area.friendly service, yummy food -- what&#39;s not to like? we had the loco moco, and it was reasonably priced and had a generous serving size.the chicken teriyaki was decent, and the shrimp plain ol&#39; fried.staff is always friendly and will explain what you don&#39;t understand.lo and behold!  aloha eats satisfied all of my cravings!  the food is fantastic and the menu is vast and plentiful.head to aloha eats and feel like your in hawaii.every review covers everything maybe one would want to know.if i get a combination plate, it&#39;s definitely enough for two meals.i order from here nearly every week since i work nearby, and it&#39;s definitely one of my favorite fried food staples to get me through a workday.not a fan..people you don&#39;t know what your missing out on!.portions are huge and flavors are to dieee for.the seating area is casual, with a few cafeteria style tables and a bar height counter by the window.happy to no that i can still eat my loco moco  mahalo for aloha restaurant to be establish here in chicago..just how it should be.you get two pieces for $4..and plenty of it.the portions here are huge, so i would suggest a mini plate for 1 person.if this was closer to me, id be eating here daily.i always come here everytime i get homesick!.awesome small family owned treasure in the city!very generous portions and always good..unfortunately, it being winter time, i couldn&#39;t wear my &#34;locals&#34; in today.maybe i&#39;m just indecisive and need menus like this.the bbq beef was also overly salted that it left me drinking lots of water when i got home.for some reason, i thought hawaiian food was popular in chicago, but looking through yelp for other hawaiian restaurants, i&#39;m not seeing any.a fan of their spam musibi.that was good by itself.though the macaroni salad reminded me of store bought.my favorite thing about aloha eats is how you can get a regular plate or a mini.this time i had apple ice tea.or it comes along with the plate lunch.i had a loco moco, with a guava.i haven&#39;t had a plate lunch in quite some time so this was everything i needed to help with some homesickness! i&#39;ll definitely find my way back here!.i ordered the chicken katsu to go.this place was right down the street from my friendsw house.we&#39;ve had aloha eats via delivery a few times and twice in the restaurant.the bbq chicken was good but it tasted like teriyaki chicken and did not compare with other bbq chicken that has been smoked or grilled.i had never had many of these dishes before, but they&#39;re great for hawaiians and mainlanders alike.they were on the smaller side but were filling.nevertheless, i&#39;m pretty excited for the food i had tonight.they definitely give you enough food to share.hang loose!.excellent food we had the katsu chicken with white rice and macaroni salad it was delicious, no say for the rice and chicken came with awesome dipping sauce.i love every bite of it."
bar-takito-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-takito-chicago,2,"What was surprising was how huge the portions actually were.there is also an outside patio area where you can listen to the &#34;el&#34; rumble by overhead as this place sits in the shadow of the morgan/lake &#34;el&#34; stop in the w.this place is dying in part due to screaming success of federales..probably not authentic, but not bad food.the small plates are great to share and all delicious!the atmosphere and decor is great, and i will definitely be back soon!.all the food was good as well.the drinks were tasty, and probably my favorite part of the meal.also, if you live in the west loop, i&#39;m sure this won&#39;t be pricy for you.it&#39;s especially great when the weather is nice to sit outside and enjoy their perfection of a paloma.otherwise would have been 5 star.solid 3.the drinks were a decent value as they were a good size and strong..i saw what i thought was this place on groupon.i set up a staff get together here and the staff was amazing.i understand the star head chef doesn&#39;t want to make the same basic dishes all the time, but some of the twists on dishes were just bizarre.the papas were great, but what can go wrong with fried potatoes? the &#34;guac&#34; was on the sour side, but the chips were so good that it was a nice accompaniment..i don&#39;t see any reason to return here.the el train is right there, but i didn&#39;t find it as annoying as other people did..however, our server went above and beyond to make it up to us by offering us the other dessert on the menu, but chose not to since we had tried that one the first time we went and we didn&#39;t like it either.i will definitely be going back!.still you are paying a little bit steep of a price.anyway, we went with the fish tacos.i don&#39;t quite understand the typewriters on the wall, but it was kind of cool to look at, i guess? what stuck out to me most was how friendly the staff was with me, introducing themselves, told me a little about the place, even gave me margarita suggestions.yes, we had a girl crush.flavorful.didn&#39;t think the quotations would make a difference, but there was.awesome spot! very chill trendy vibe.needless to say, i was pleasantly surprised when i entered the restaurant.had two types of drinks which were delicious and strong.the second course was coffee braised beef tacos.however, the braised beef taco is done right! it is packed with a punch and a burst of flavor.first time here and it was pretty good, the cocktails are definitely worth coming for!what we loved loved loved:- fish tacos - really really good fish and even better when eaten with the pickled chiles- ceviche - ceviche with plantains were fresh and tasty, coconut and lemongrass in them were good- cocktails, faves were the &#34;that&#39;s what they called me in hs&#34; and &#34;sandy coconuts&#34;- pickled chiles - got a really big kick- water- if we had to rank, octopus was dead last, shockingly.ugh.it&#39;s a very welcoming and bright restaurant and you feel like you are in a different country.it was pretty empty so we were seated right away.we then ordered the grilled bread with the seasonal salsa.best fish tacos i ever had!!! sincerely, emily.the tacos were not great.if you come hungry, order early as the service declined throughout my time there.yup, i would say it&#39;s mostly bar.5 stars..love the mezcal selection.i ordered the &#34;violet, you&#39;re turning violet, violet&#34; and it was delicious! my husband ordered &#34;mouth full of diamonds&#34; and our friends ordered an assortment of margaritas.i love the environment/vibe of this place and the quality of the food/drinks here!!! i had fish tacos and cucumber margarita..great crowd!.this place is amazing!! the hostess was promt, courteous and accommodating even though it was happy hour on a friday.we had to eventually say we had to rush for a flight to get some service quickly because it was taking entirely too long to order for brunch..the arepa was good and had a crazy amount of veggies on top, for $19.fun, unique and casual..but when i poured the last drop into my friend&#39;s glass..will definitely come back and tell my friends!.great mexican spot in the west loop.menu is not to expansive but the service is nice.while we had to wait (as always in these hip neighborhoods) kim worked with me so we could be texted when our table was opening up...good combination of flavors and textures.no pitchers of margaritas of any drink."
the-artisan-cellar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-artisan-cellar-chicago,1,"You don&#39;t really have anywhere to said either so it&#39;s not like a chill spot or anything like that.for an honest price, this place has excellent paninis, coffee, espresso etc.the wine lover in me said &#34;ooh, ooh, ooh&#34; a wine shop i haven&#39;t been in yet! and the frozen to the core part of me said &#34;ooh, ooh, ooh&#34; they have cappuccino on the menu board!so i decided to tour the cute little wine shop first.it is basically a wine shop that sells espresso drinks and superb made-to -order sandwiches lovingly constructed from quality imported ingredients.will come back to buy wine (or craft beer) soon.they are all $7.perfect lunch!recently tried a soup and a sandwich from this place and loved it! the creamy mushroom primavera soup which had a hint of basil, was smooth and rich..great lunch spot at the mart that&#39;s not trying to impress just serve good food, cheese, wine, beer, coffee and other delicatessens.illy coffee for considerably less than starbucks around the corner, delicious paninis with european meats and cheeses for lunch, and a fantastic, reasonably priced wine selection..there isn&#39;t much place to sit but i sat on the tall stools near a little bar table.i look forward to trying the others.they do take a bit longer than any other option in the merch mart, but it&#39;s only cause they&#39;re made from scratch and in my book it&#39;s totally worth it.great bottles of wine in any price range you&#39;re looking for.they always have special salads and sandwiches.the panini are excellent (and cheap!), and it&#39;s connected to the cutest wine store..the only inconvenience is wait time: plan for about 20 minutes to order and get your panini.this is one of the best placed for a panini.towards the end of the week they can run out of the ingredients for certain sandwiches, but i guess that is a testament to how fresh they keep all of their ingredients.....during lunchtime hours, 11am to about 3:30pm, hot and tasty paninis are served.everything is homemade and absolutely delicious!.sweetest staff..i also got a cappuccino in a very nifty glass with prettily crafted swirls.the artisan cellar is a hidden gem.i mean for $6, you aren&#39;t paying that much more for a gourmet sandwhich!...they workers are always super nice and laid back and don&#39;t make me feel awkward coming into a &#34;gourmet&#34; type store.like grilled sandwiches.a panini is $7.a co-worker took me here and it was love at first sight when i walked in.while i haven&#39;t had the panini, the fact that they cost $6 makes me long for one.my wife feels the same.after waiting, waiting and waiting some more i expected this to be one of the tastiest sandwiches ever.i went with the caprese and it was legit and delicious: fresh tomato, flavorful pesto and gooey mozzarella stuffed and melted betwixt two pieces of hearty bread.i was recently there for a wine tasting and the staff was not friendly and the tastings were on the very small side.there&#39;s never a long line, but it does take a long time for the sandwiches to be made.when you walk by for the first time the space seems very cluttered but once you taste the food here you know you&#39;ve been missing pure goodness.you know, not so huge that you have to throw some away or feel guilty after eatting all of it (not that i&#39;d know).3.i heard they have fantastic sandwiches, so i will have to check that out sometime.had a hard time deciding but went with the parma panini.the food is very tasty with quality ingredients.i am a tough sell on coffee, and i am floored with my cup.best salads in chicago.it is very small, so get 2 or 3.i ordered the buffalo but was given the beefeater.very tasty and worth the wait.quick, tasty, and doesn&#39;t put me in an afternoon food coma? i&#39;m in...the cheese and wine selections look outstanding, but i haven&#39;t had a chance to try any yet!  that would require going in after work when i&#39;m not rushing.my favorite panini is the portobello which includes a balsamic marinated portabella mushroom and blue cheese on a grilled roll.yes the sandwich was good (just good) but i didnt appreciate at least 10 people being served before me when they ordered after me..i really do like this place.why are these people only nice to some patrons??  is there some underground code?  did i need to &#34;exchange an egg&#34; bev hills style?they do have a sweet wine collection (hence the two stars) that i browsed for 20 minutes the other day (with the true intention of making a purchase) and no one helped me.also kinda fun to look at everything in the store.it&#39;s across from au bon pain.if you are anywhere near the mart, you should be going daily (like so many people do).this place serves some great, tasty sandwiches! the wait definitely can be long - especially during the lunch rush, but it&#39;s well worth the $7 and a few extra minutes.i used to come here for the fresh sandwiches when i worked in merchandise mart and really need to get back more often than i do now.the bread is perfect, grilled so that it&#39;s a little bit crunchy.[this is my first official yelp and it is quite bittersweet."

 yikes.a friend and i split the egg rolls and the red chili chicken singapore noodles, which were both phenomenal.i tried my friends&#39; dishes, and those were good too.they are also really accommodating if you don&#39;t like the protein they have selected for the night or you want more vegetarian options.insanely delicious.my favorites are mussels and egg rolls..there were much more take-out orders that wednesday night, and i do think that the place (being so small) might be better suited for that.we also had an order of the pork eggrolls, which are 2 for $7 and they&#39;re delicious as well.byob, and very friendly staff.we went here with a group of friends and had the family style chef&#39;s choice.they had a buttery garlic with coconut milk sauce at the bottom.this place is worth the drive from wherever you are from! wisconsin, indiana or far suburbs.every menu item has been above and beyond my expectations.they&#39;re also super accommodating if you&#39;re gluten free - just give them 24 hours notice and they&#39;ll make gluten free! such an awesome place.i had the vindaloo (curry)..i have tried to order delivery twice via grubhub.and the service was wonderful.our 8:30 reservation was the last of the evening and there was not a private party scheduled after, which likely helped..and damn you people for catching on.it&#39;s byob, if you forget, there is a liquor store just down the corner..delicious mussels and curry.the seating in the place all together only seats about 12.yes they do!..such a surprise to have come across this quaint spot, love the byob policy to compliment their ever-changing menu.) then eventually some parties started to trickle in as we were nearing the end of our meal.trust me.love that it&#39;s byob.enjoy!.the thai chicken basil dish is to die for.maybe it was just that night, the chili flavor was very lacking.we ordered pork spring rolls, red chili chicken singapore noodles with thai basil and grilled scottish salmon with tempura mushrooms..it&#39;s the only upscale asian food in chicago i&#39;m willing to pay for.went for another trip, and man, my second trip the service must&#39;ve been off, because this time, it was awesome!we split pork egg rolls, fried oyster banh mi sliders, and pork belly and sweet potato curry.quite possibly the nicest, most delicious food i&#39;ve tasted in this neighbourhood.they switch up the other items a lot but often repeat.i ordered spicy singapore noodles with chicken and it was wonderful - soft but crunchy noodles with a nice and mild spice to them.try the family style stuff when ordering.my first impression was small and empty as only 2 of the 16 seats were occupied.the singapore noodles and the bi bim bap are my favorites, and the hostess and chef are so friendly! the space is small, clean, and comfy.seriously this was the biggest to-go container i&#39;ve ever seen and it was filled with the delicious noodles and beef.ramen?  only created by an actual chef and spiced to perfection..tips:bring cash, its cash onlybyobgo with a group and do the family style so you can try many things (best value)they do to-go food.similar to another reviewer, we live in the neighborhood and have never been.quality is fantastic, dishes are unique, and portions are large (so don&#39;t be scared by higher prices if you want to share).the menu changes every week, so check the web or call for updates.only 16 seats and they fill up fast on a busy night.omg sooo good!  they have super small menu just written up on a chalkboard that they told us can change daily based on what fresh ingredients the chef is able to find.everything is made from scratch, down to the curry sauce (not the packet seasoning that most places use!) and is always fresh and seasonal..amazing! singapore noodle dish was a hit as well as the green lipped mussels appetizer.we had the five course dinner.steamed muscles in thai sauce was great and so was the singapore chicken! get the singapore fried chicken! so yum.the place is very small, probably 6-7 tables with their daily menu in chalk on the wall, so you won&#39;t really know what they&#39;re serving until you show up.in two trips to bento box, i&#39;ve now experienced the best noodle dish i&#39;ve ever had, the best green curry mussels i&#39;ve ever had, the best egg roll i&#39;ve ever had, and the best bahn mi i&#39;ve ever had.probably the best pan-asian i&#39;ve had in chicago.the side of cauliflower was surprisingly delicious.this was pretty average..note i also do not subscribe to the chicago belief that huge portions automatically gets credit for being good food.the singapore noodles are to die for.i also appreciate the fact that the chef is sourcing most of his meats and vegetables from local farms/producers.perfect balance of heat and savory and sweet in the red chili singapore noodle bowl.get it? got it? good food..the menu is displayed on a chalkboard and its byob, yay! we really enjoyed the spicy tuna tempura rolls, tandoori chicken, and red chili chicken singapore noodles.i adore this place!  fabulous food.the pork belly noodles alone are worth going for, but expect long lines and &#34;meh&#34; service on the weekends.they also have carry out if you&#39;re tired of the usual pizza, sushi, or thai showing up at your doorstep."

mista-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mista-chicago,2,"The pizzas are crispy wheat crust goodness, and the salads are amazingly fresh with great flavors.i tried a piece of the cracker crust pizza, it was okay i guess for a cracker crust pizza (seriously, why, and in chicago) i  had a good experience here though and will be adding it to my list of carry-out spots.restaurant is in a great area of town as well-right off clark st.guess i can just call or grubhub than pay cash in person.food was great but what was more impressive was the service by mark.couldn&#39;t really tell a difference.good pizza.a pizza and lasagna will run you less than $20.this place seems to be popular with folks who have gluten allergies, but without such diet restrictions, one can find a better pizza elsewhere, even at renaldi&#39;s down the street.this pizza is exquisite!  if  i could give more than 5 stars i would!! not only that, but every person is so friendly and delightful--from the person taking our order to the person delivering it.love mista!great food, reasonable prices, and byob.but it was good.prosciutto itself was nice, and it was the perfect serving size for me (keeping in mind that i don&#39;t eat very large meals), just too expensive ($15) for how little *stuff* there actually was on the plate.one sunday night in december i ordered the bianca pizza and bread pudding to go.this place has tons of healthy options to satisfy your hunger!.this was the first restaurant i ate at when i moved to the neighborhood 3 years ago and i keep coming back! their wraps are delish- my favorite is the chicken caesar wrap (made the mistake of getting the gluten free wrap once, don&#39;t do it!).a &#39;go up and order&#39; type of place.we ordered a mike&#39;s special.we ordered a few and shared family style.will return asap.in the summer they open up a patio!.the bruschetta is pretty good too.the manager was extremely welcoming and accommodating.so the person being rude was you.definitely will come back again!.cost is reasonable..it&#39;s byob but they do not have wine glasses, only plastic cups so keep that in mind if that&#39;s something that bothers you.my daughter found mista on yelp and we were staying nearby so we were happy to try it.it is spectacular! brought my wife here several times and she loves loves loves this place!.this place is incredible..i would recommend dining in as opposed to take-out since the cracker crust can get soggy quickly! definitely worth a visit!.mista is perfect.they have lots of healthy/gluten free/vegetarian options if you lean that way - i have to go back for their eggplant lasagna.totally enjoy this place..mmmmm..this unassuming little cafe used to be in andersonville, and i miss it terribly!the meatball sandwich wrap here has always been the bomb.first time i came here i ordered the prosciutto pizza which i saw recommended multiple times here on yelp and it&#39;s everything i want in a prosciutto pizza.which is a huge +.now with the food.besides, it&#39;s so tasty, why wouldn&#39;t you eat it as fast as you could?.pepperoni pizza is tasty but the pizzas are a little too thin and a teeny bit soggy.with a polite staff and a great outside patio too.delicious! and the service is great, the decor, well, pizza joint.how dare they call this piazza.my girlfriends are always raving about the wraps which i am yet to try.awesome patio space as well when it&#39;s nice out.we will go back for pizza but won&#39;t be doing the lasagna.mista is a great spot for a casual dinner with a friend or two.great neighborhood spot..perhaps it&#39;s my fault for thinking the chocolate cake would be enjoyable, but it most definitely was not.i  tried to explain that i wasn&#39;t dining in; that i was just there to pick up an order, but was still sent away.can&#39;t beat the food, ambiance, service and location for this price!  and it is byob.regarding the pizza, i think this is probably the worst crust i&#39;ve ever had.if you like cracker crust pizza with delicious toppings, this place is for you!  my friend went with the pepperoni, adding mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes.the food was not amazing, but great for the price point and atmosphere.it was a little cold once we go home, but i believe they cook the pizza just a smidge under so then you can put it in the oven to reheat (which they give you reheat instructions).there is a reason why there used to be 3 mista locations and this is only one left!..good pizza, better meatball wraps.the place is nice and you order your food up front at the register.the food is always fresh and the service very timely.love the bianca pizza, the mista salad and the meatballs! staff is always very friendly and take-out is ready within 15 minutes.still friendly service, and they gave me a new punch card since i&#39;d lost the old one i used.it&#39;s byob and a liquor store is across the street.been here twice in the last week - yes that&#39;s how good it is.my roommate loves pepperoni and so we always get that and a magherita pizza with a side of caesar salad that is huge and delicious, enough for 2 people to split.their dressing is homemade and out of this world.superb pizza with a keep it simple approach."
butcher-and-the-burger-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/butcher-and-the-burger-chicago,2,"It was the best $16 burger i&#39;ve ever had.this place is hopefully on your list of must tries if you are in the city, especially if you&#39;re in this lincoln park area.it&#39;s small inside so beware if you come during busy times.let&#39;s start with this, for two people, one beef one turkey, a small fry and 1 beignet (both of us had water) it was $40.the portions are perfect and the &#39;rubs&#39; they offer are great.this review is for take-out only..still amazing but i have another favorite.and next time, i&#39;ll make sure to rob a bank (or something) before placing my order..i tried the american medium.burgers are grilled to order.ladies, it&#39;s not a first date type place; you can&#39;t eat like a princess here ;).t and ending up in &#34;butcher &amp; the burger&#34; in lincoln park, less than one (1)-block west from cta armitage brown/purple line station.the burger was amazing, i could honestly say i haven&#39;t had many burgers better.it&#39;s a bit congested in terms of parking, but if you go at the right time you&#39;re fine.he did not disappoint.i certainly acknowledge that they use expensive ingredients, but i spent $20 on a burger and fries.came in expecting a more sit down brunch experience but it&#39;s counter and then limited seating.we tried the fries and beignets too.i decided that it was time to give b&amp;b a try a few months ago, and have been back almost 20 times! this place is off the hook amazing..they are a tasty brunch snack, but the beignets don&#39;t have the light and freshly made quality that the beignets at the actual cafe du monde in new orleans does (high standards!).what i absolutely love is they place a heavy emphasis on the freshness of their meat and its easy to tell you are getting quality meat by the taste of their burgers.but, it was indeed good tasting!! i will be back.it was a touch overdone.great place to grab a quick burger as you go up to the counter and order.awesome burger and fries!  great service-even though they are sox fans.i went with the most popular chicago steakhouse, on pretzel with the usual fixings.service - great service! though we went during peak hours, we had to wait in line and fight for seats as the place is packed.and the size was perfect for me.perfect date spot and even more perfect spot to come and eat and not get drunk : )creamy coleslaw is exactly what coleslaw should be..it&#39;s cute though.my fellow vegetarians - this is the way a veggie burger should taste.bison burger was fantastic.hers had cheddar, mine goat cheese.you can build your own burger and add seasonings.i finished the meal off with a beignet and, unfortunately, the dough was thick and chewy.this is one of the best burgers that i have ever had.i enjoyed the fries as they are fried with partial skins.i absolutely love that you can pick everything about your burger! i ended up getting mushrooms, bacon, a fried egg, possibly one other topping, fries and a shake and i believe my total was $21 or $25.lucky for me it appeared he was trying to grow dreads, so now i am assured his hair was dirty.i can imagine it filling up quickly around lunch time.so crispy!!!!!- great cole slawthings i didn&#39;t love so much - seating.overall, a fantastic vibe with solid food, but prices were a little too steep for me to see myself coming again and again.it was all worth it.it&#39;s no biggie because my boyfriend and i now go during the afternoon when it&#39;s not too busy..no one asked if my order was ok or if i needed anything.i&#39;m always shocked the line isn&#39;t out the door because everything i&#39;ve ever ordered has been so amazing..so i was super happy that osi v made the decision that we go to butcher &amp; the burger for lunch and since it was byob, decided that we should walk to binny&#39;s to get some adult beverages to have with our meal.overall, i think everyone there had the same mentality as me which was to hit up a burger place instead of the burger fest, so it was bad timing for me to check out this place..ahhh, the eternal question for me is &#34;do i make a 15 min walk to butcher or stick to vending machine food at depaul..95 each) with a girlfriend.with the experience i had i can only say that the people at butcher &amp; burger truly have a heart for their customers and want to give them the best experience possible.she knew the menu and was able to kinda walk us through their menu board.this will be our go-to spot for pre or post game grub when checking out the cubs.there was a line for seats, but it moved fast enough.workers here don&#39;t have the friendliest aura.i think that speaks wonders about how tasty this food is.for those of you who love a good turkey burger, this is the place to be.i personally love the ghost pepper blend, pretty spicy but also full of flavor.the line was a decent length when i went but it actually worked out in my favor while i was concocting my burger..she got a turkey burger that was prebuilt, i had a bite and was very impressed at how well seasoned it was.it is byob if you want a pop or two with your burger.."

they give you a blank stare.the kamikaze wings have more kick!.good job..the masala, jamaican jerk, and lemon pepper ranch were good as well.the  pineapple jerk and  sesame teriyaki were incredible..he&#39;s good people.phineas fogg went around the world in 80 days.unfortunately, it is rare that i can go into a black owned and operated place of business and receive great food and customer service, however, i did here! i was absolutely satisfied! the chicken was fresh and flavorful, the ladies behind the counter were pleasant and the owner was very charismatic and professional.so don&#39;t let the appearance fool you, the food is worth the &#34;experience&#34; if it isn&#39;t something you&#39;re used to.i just tried the shrimp last night for the first time and you should too because they are huge and delicious..i really wanted to give this place five stars because i love them so much! i&#39;ve been a fan since they first opened on 35th st in bronzeville..my husband and i had the cheesy buffalo, parmesan garlic, and honey lemon pepper.this is great! it tastes just as good if not better than it did when it was located on 35th street.i have yet to try all of them but my favorite thus far is spicy plum.wtf? i would of threw in that one extra star had i got my 4 flavors..i&#39;m not sure if i just got over-excited by the crazy-good reviews or what.twenty minutes later, we arrived to pick up our order:  pineapple jerk, garlic parmesan, curry, honey teriyaki, and standard buffalo wings.buffalo joes has fallen from grace, and everything else is a distant second..probably my favorite wings in the entire city.it is an average amount of time to cook fresh-made-to-order wings.cool.my roommate and i made the trek out here yesterday evening - definitely worth the trip!  we ordered 50 wings between the 2 of us - we noticed that each order of wings comes with a different number of flavor choices;  a 50 wing order, you can choose 5 flavors.they have like 40 sauces from all over the place.as chicken joints go, it&#39;s probably the cheeriest, friendliest place i&#39;ve ever been to (it even seemed clean!), and the person taking your order will offer to explain how they do things right off the bat.wow, this place that has more sauces for wings than you can ever imagine..great, great chicken! also the customer service is great, everyone is nice.we had the sweet and spicy plum (asia), the garlic parmesan (italy), and the curry (india)....if you get 20 they let you choose four different sauces, so i picked teriyaki and bourbon and my boyfriend chose cheesy buffalo and honey jerk.i think i could have done a better job at home--was not blown away.i really wish they would remodel, but if they food is good, i won&#39;t complain too much.so hard.but here are some of their wing flavors (taken from menu pages):jamaica: fire jerk, rum bbq, honey jerk, jerk bbq, jerk honey bbqchina: sweet &amp; sour, szechuan, sweet ginger bbq, sweet &amp; spicy plumindia: curry, masala, cosmic currycanada: maple, maple twist, montreal madnessjapan: teriyaki, kamikaze (hot!!!), honey teriyaki, sesame, ginger sesamemexico: jalapeno, chipotleitaly: parmesan, garlic, tomato basil pesto, parmesan garlic.dude.simply amazing as always!!! great wings, great sauces &amp; great service.delicious!!!  wings and cooked properly and the sauce is wonderful.this place is definitely a diamond in the rough.great owner: he&#39;s won a chicago area wing cook-off competition, and believe me its well deserved, his wings are the best i have ever tasted.walking in we were immediately greeted by their uber-friendly cashier.so my hat off to you guys at wings around the world.wtf.the place itself is very unassuming and if you were trying to find it for the very first time, you&#39;d probably miss it on your first try."

best italian food i&#39;ve had.all the food is made to order so they will really make anything you want.the gnocchi was delicious and i would definitely recommend.we had bruschetta, mussels marina, fried calamari, spaghetti with meatballs, a side of spinach and eggplant parm.thank you so much for the great meal!.i really wanted to love this place.unfortunately this last time we visited i find that the service needs go back the beginning and prioritize the guests experience.the roasted garlic that accompanies the bread is a nice touch.their vodka rigatoni is the best i&#39;ve ever had! their wait staff and bartenders are always so nice too..so is anything on their menu..my husband had the stuffed gnocchi in vodka sauce and i had the eggplant parmigiana and a side of meatballs.;).awesome food and nice owner..we orderedcalamari - really crispy and chewy at the same timegnocchi - pillowy and nicely stuffedveal - ok really saltythe gnocchi really saved the day!

ran into pick up, and was dreamily wishing i was not decked out in yoga pants and a stocking cap.it&#39;s certainly an authentic mom and pop spot but it wasn&#39;t the best i&#39;ve had but it was good so i do recommend supporting this local business!.seems odd they didn&#39;t have it on record.the service has depreciated tremendously.more like steak a la gristle.thank you so much roger and all your amazing employees for making this special event a day to remember!.for quality authentic italian food, this is our go-to..fried calamari, seafood pasta special had tons of clams, mussels, calamari, shrimp, scallops, olives and capers yum, and the stuffed gnocchi in vodka sauce was so creamy and wonderful.while we waited for our entrees, we had a couple of appetizers, the bruschetta and the mussels in marinara sauce..our party of 7 had a great time..a good date night restaurant!  intimate (translate small) restaurant, comfortable setting, delicious food, great portions and above-average customer service.me and my boyfriend went here for our 2nd year anniversary and the owner came and gave us shots on the house to celebrate, he also took our picture.the owner and staff were so kind and wonderful.our server lisa knew all of beers they carried, the nightly specials, answered menu questions, made sure i knew the wine i ordered was a 1/2 bottle and not by the glass, and generally brought her a-game start to finish without being intrusive in any way.kabooooom.i don&#39;t give many places 5 stars.i don&#39;t care who&#39;s fault it is.we all loved the warm breads (with olive oil and grated parm for dipping) and a roasted head of garlic!  we shared the light, tender, and crispy fried calamari.i don&#39;t think street parking is all that difficult though.it&#39;s more than worth it.love this place! the bread and garlic that they give you at your taxable is great!! not a very big place but they treat you very well there..their sauce was quite spicy; more spicy than i liked, but it was correctly made; just not to my taste..no ill intentions here..when they say us the owner carried my dates drink to our table and pulled out her chair then pushed her in..for those of you who aren&#39;t informed on chicago history, welcome to the real little italy in the heart of chicago.the servers were friendly and we were brought the roasted garlic and bread.this place is a solid go to for quality italian fare.after a long day of work and a small lunch i thought how about italian food for dinner since it is always rich and filling - in my mind enters ignotz..the restaurant is in a smaller, compact building in which space is limited.walked in, wasn&#39;t acknowledged sat myselfthen found out the groupon i bought (for this restaurant and expires 2015)they said &#34;they never seen it before and they didn&#39;t even know they were on groupon still.how did we not know?we drove to the place, which is in the heart of italy neighborhood.the food is amazing as always and the atmosphere screams family owned.ignotz feels like lost chicago, a place that existed years ago and was protected from the outside world.roasted garlic - amazing.will definitely be back! :d.from the roasted garlic and bread to the pistachio cannoli.the food is outstanding and the portions generous.had a daily special (walleye vesuvius) that was fantastic.value was excellent.i thought this place was wonderful.i absolutely positively mucho love this place.the combination proved to be a delicious appetizer and was instantly devoured."
pittsfield-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pittsfield-cafe-chicago,1,"Plus in a beautiful setting inside the pittsfield  building.food was ok, average things you can find pancakes omelets eggs fresh orange juice and cafe but was is different is the so unpolite and bad waitress..the food didn&#39;t wow me for the price..great cafe with staple food.the drinks are the only saving grace.the latte was very good.regardless i&#39;d give this place 3 stars due to the reasonable price, awesome french toast, crispy bacon and the unique location.i had coffee and ahe had ice water..it tasted like bad oil and was difficult to eat.the bacon was so crisp.nice sauce, hash browns could have been better.after walking to a couple other breakfast shops we found this lille off the beat place.after finishing that, still nobody came to talk to us.i ordered eggs florentine one biscuit was very hard and egg a little under cooked the other egg was well-done and biscuit was perfect.we came here because we were too hungry to wait 90 minutes to be seated at wildberry.i had the greek skillet which had onions, mushrooms, feta and hash browns with three eggs on top, cooked however you&#39;d like.the santa fe burrito was delicious and reasonably price (thank god).on the way out the door i expressed my concern to the owner and he asked me what the problem was with that!???!  really if that&#39;s the way you run your kitchen you are asking for illness!!!!stay away!!!.i would not rush to visit again but it served its purpose since we also refused to wait the 2h to eat at wildberry.great, friendly service.i got one corned beef skillet with scrambled eggs and another with eggs over-easy.the people are quite nice, though!.we had a good breakfast - service was quick and food was fresh and not greasy.expect about a 15 minute wait but man do they move fast! prices are fair and the building it&#39;s in is beautiful.food was mediocre..very nice classic american diner inside an old chicago  building.do yourself a favor and just go!!! *this is a hole-in-the-wall type of place so if you like posh places this is not it.highly recommend this place.absolutely spectacular..this place is in an interesting location, but something is wrong in general.delicious food ! party of five had our food within just a couple minutes of ordering.also the orange juice here is a must try although it was a little pricy ( just for the juice ).recommend this place.seating can use improvement, but at the end of the day, it&#39;s so worth going or ordering their food!.the steak and egg breakfast was spot on! was with a friend with a gluten allergy and they had good knowledge of the menu and were able to advise.$17 dollars later including a $3 tip this review follows..my son and i try different breakfast places when we travel.i know it&#39;s smack dab in the middle of downtown, but i could have taken the bus a few minutes outside the city and found the same thing for less.we came here based off of the reviews we read and we were not disappointed.the coffee was decent, and the food was pretty standard diner food, maybe slightly better than your neighborhood diner might be..i had the greek skillet, which was delicious! we definitely plan on returning.there is indoor and outdoor seating.friendly, casual dining atmosphere.the omlette was pretty good.long waits and short menus meant finding another option.avocado eggs benedict was surprisingly good and the le croissant came in a close second.both were great and honestly half of it would have been filling enough..i ordered the le croissant sandwich with bacon and american cheese (pick what cheese you want) and caramelized onion jam and a side of hash browns.okay food and good service.the fluffiest scrambled eggs i&#39;ve ever had anywhere.i don&#39;t think the eggs were poached but the yolk was perfect.and yummy! it is a hidden cafe in the pittsfield building.gravy was piled high on several biscuits - and i added two eggs for only a dollar extra each..the pittsfield building this diner resides in is way cool.my go-to when brunch places around the area are too crowded because there is never a wait time for this place.pretty good little hidden treasure! classic dinner food in a beautiful historic building and no wait because it&#39;s tucked away...my coke was always filled without asking."
the-bongo-room-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bongo-room-chicago-3,2,"Overall we really like this place and the surrounding neighborhood is fun!.however in comparison to the other amazing breakfast spots chicago has to offer, there is some opportunity for improvement in order to obtain an above expectations review..service is good.to this day, this is still one of my favorite breakfast/brunch places of all time.as a note, they insist that all members of the party order at the same time and are very inflexible with this.i really enjoyed breakfast at the bongo room.i loved my experience here and will happily come back on my next trip to chicago.i really dug my hearty and delicious omelet with the house potatoes on the side.i wasn&#39;t judging this book, by its cover.and it&#39;s super hard to find no outside signs..2 words.service was smooth and staff were pleasant and attentive.no seasonings just the good ole american way of throwing a piece of cheese on it and tasteless oil.we got the white chocolate and caramel pretzel pancakes which was perfect.the lobster roll eggs benedict was just as good as it sounds, but the real mvp were the roasted potatoes on the side.amazing breakfast and lattes, friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere.the stack came with three pancakes, drenched in a white chocolate sauce and drizzled with caramel.the breakfast was ok nothing to write home about honestly..i got the chorizo potato avocado omelette.it was more than enough to share between the 3 of us and still have plenty leftover.food was great, i&#39;ve had the lobster benedict-a-some! my wife had the tenderloin burrito , was good as well, but the highlight of our visit was the potatoes!  it was so good with the hollandaise sauce! ambience was great as well as so as the servers! will definitely go back to this place for breakfast!.it definitely wasn&#39;t as good as the lobster benedict i got last time (see my previous review).i had the vanilla french toast which was to absolutely die for.i didn&#39;t end up finishing it because i had a lot of things to eat in general in chicago.they were so fruity.it&#39;s small in case you&#39;re claustrophobicthe décor is something magical.the potatoes were seasoned well.yet, despite this, it came with a good sized serving of potatoes on the side.rounding up because service has always been good, and portions are generous.i&#39;ve heard from several people that the bongo room is a must-try for brunch, so my boyfriend and i opted to try it out while we were in the city.so instead, i got the croissant sandwich, which was pretty tasty, but i would recommend going on weekends for the brunch menu and maybe heading up to wicker park for a nice mimosa :) i&#39;d say it&#39;s totally worth the wait!.even if you have to wait for your table, there&#39;s a beverage bar.excellent service and good food! our party had different variations of the blt benedict - all of which were recommended by our server.decent spot to have brunch at in the south loop.the ingredients inside were segmented in a way that made the front end of the omelet exclusively goat cheese, the middle stewing spinach, etc.no wait, zero, none!the place was packed, but staff was super friendly and attentive..the chorizo was far too salty, and the omelette simply lacked balance between chorizo and egg.the service was also on point..next time i&#39;d have to split with a friend.we would likely return again in the future.service was great and pleasant despite being very busy.after we ordered our lobster roll benedict, it came to our table within two minutes which was really fast.hallie belt, 312.a wicker park favorite, this place is a must if you&#39;re in the area for brunch.the place isn&#39;t that big but i promise you it&#39;s worth a try...mom visiting? take her here.but there is no obvious sign out, so people can easily miss it.are her taste buds in working order? or perhaps we came on the day the chef called in sick and the bus boy filled in?the menu sounded amazing..my second foodie adventure in chicago and another must-have recommendation made by my friend.we called the restaurant from links at exactly 12:45 and they said our table was ready and they would hold it for 5 minutes for us which was very nice of them, as there was a huge crowd.they are to live for!!!!..i was a little disappointed when i saw that the online menu was different from the in house menu, as far as the pancakes go, so at the last minute i had to switch things up.it&#39;s too bad i don&#39;t live in chicago  because i would come back tomorrow morning.our server was okay.the place was clean and quaint and the waiters provided good service.i am a big breakfast person, and i loved this."
the-bristol-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bristol-chicago,1,"I am generally surprised by the other reviews not giving more stars.definitely not worth it.my partner got the chicken &#39;n a biscuit and she thought it was pretty bland.great ambience.a personal thing i guess, ha), shrimp cakes and kale salad.perhaps brunch is the way to go.it was a-ok.i thought the gravy kind of took a backseat in terms of flavor, when it usually dominates in a traditional biscuits and gravy dish.the food, the wine, the venue and the service.the menu is small but every dish is great.the house was busy!  we started with the cinnamon roll and doughnuts and these were amazing.high quality neighborhood spot.he got us our food &amp; out the door in time.i watch how the bartenders make their drinks, how the servers walk around and where and when they place food down.we always go for the monkey bread, their duck fat fries, and some of their cocktails.it was similar to that of a paczki (the polish doughnuts pronounced &#34;pon-chki&#34;).ps - this was my 2nd brunch visit and i&#39;ve also been there for dinner, all consistent and good as this visit.cons: out of the 6 courses we had, nothing was great and for a $174.we got the smoked whitefish first off the small plates.overall, i was a little underwhelmed--perhaps i had too high of expectations, but i found the food decent but not amazing enough to warrant the hype it gets.i could have had many more of them.and, no bread either.the menu was rather limited and didn&#39;t have much that spoke to me.i wish i could have tried brunch here and the burger looks impressive.by 12:00pm the table was still not ready, so we gave up and went elsewhere.i&#39;ve been looking forward to coming here for so long and was expecting a great meal.super fun layout and really nice staff.they charged $29 per person to get the exact same entrees they have every sunday that are normally $12-$15.bristol was a good spot for a nicer dinner in the bucktown area.the smoked ham benedict and the apple salad is highly recommended and this is one of the few places that serves a good cappucino.capellini: 5/5this was so delicious.next we had the escolar with red quinoa..great food and great atmosphere! the bristol is one of my favorite restaurants in chicago by far.i went here for brunch and decided to get a burger.atmosphere is great - go to the bar only.i can&#39;t remember everything we ate but all the food was very good.just great overall, well be back.always delicious.overall: very pleased with our dinner experience.i did not like how the servers and bartender spoke in regular tones and the bus boys and assistant only whispered questions for direction.really loved the strawberry cream that it came with.decided against our original choice of restaurant and were left trying to figure out where to go.loved it!!!service was impeccable! our server (didn&#39;t catch his name) was very knowledgeable of both food and drinks and knew exactly when to come check on us..bristol fried rice - really outstanding.the cappuccino was beautiful (picture included) and i ended up enjoying one at the end of the meal - so smooth with the perfect amount of froth.i asked the waitress about it once and she seemed upset and short with me.if you asked me about bristol a year ago, i would&#39;ve given 5 stars without hesitating (well - maybe 4.amaaaaazing.the food was amazing.this would absolutely be a five-star review if we hadn&#39;t had to wait about fifteen minutes for a table despite arriving on time for our reservation..it&#39;s friday night and you&#39;re just gonna go out to a nice little bar with your friends, get some drinks and then head home for a good night&#39;s rest because it&#39;s been a long week.we finished with the lemon tart and a cobbler.parisian gnooci - this is really a fried gnocci, which i never had before..the chilequiles? also amazing.our server was friendly and really knowledgeable about the menu.love love love..i went today for father days brunch and everyone&#39;s meal was good but mine was not great..we started off trying a shrimp cake and some duck fat fries.wine program is terrific- both by the glass or bottle.monkey bread, apple salad, salmon and raviolo were all top-notch.the sweetness was mostly in the frosting, which wasn&#39;t overly heavy."
the-bad-apple-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bad-apple-chicago,1,"I&#39;ve tried beers here that i could not get anywhere else and that&#39;s one of the reasons i keep coming back, well that and the cheese curds.i had mushrooms/truffle/shallot but nearly all of the combinations look promising.the patio is small, but nice.i gave the quinoa salad a shot, and it was so delicious! their beer list is ridiccccc, server was so so friendly, and the prices are amazing.the burger list has such a wonderful varity of moth-watering burger designs that you could come back a second night and have a completely different experience.my partner had the grizzly adams cooked well done..the restaurant was cute but not overdone.so good! and my husband ordered a beer.my grizzly adams burger was topped with braised short rib and dressed with an ale, stone ground mustard, onion jalapeño white cheddar cheese sauce and more.balance is key with a burger.count how many seconds your discarded paper napkin ring stays on the table.so good it&#39;s not even funny.they try really hard on their burgers, and they are award winning, but i was not blow away for whatever reason..get them with old bay!we did not get the cheese curds but regretted that decision after we saw them coming out to table after table.my gut feeling said i should go with the name, so i ordered the bad apple burger.staff was friendly...the bad apple is with an uber ride to as they have an excellent beer selection and the food will absolutely curl your toes.impressive beer selection list (2-300 beers).maybe cut them if you want to share :-).went there tonight and not only was the food delicious (i ordered the feta wap, and their cheese curds are an absolute must!!) but the staff there was awesome! they were very welcoming and helpful, and my waitress (i believe her name was melissa) always made sure we had everything we needed.i had the  chicago caprese burger and cold slaw.the brussels sprouts with pecorino?! wowzers.on the other hand, service was phenomenol and most of food was amazing! we tried the poutine special(if your crazy about fries is the way to go!), large southwestern cobb salad(healthy tasty option!), cowboy killer medium rare with side of minced garlic fries(burger good but well done fries!), el chupacabra medium rare with side of spicy chipotle fries(again burger good but fries well done!), and tenderoni well done with side of regular fries(burger ok even without marina sauce but fries well done!)..really good, divey spot in lincoln square! i would give the bad apple 5 stars except for 1 thing on the menu.i will go back.always a wait for dinner.i had the burger with bleu cheese and bacon and it was exactly the perfectly unctious fat bomb that i needed.i get the burn and request blue cheese instead of the standard option and think it&#39;s the best burger money can buy.while i prefer my burgers to be more simple and earthy, they do what they do well.i didn&#39;t have any expectation of this place, just the casual &#34;oh, its a good place&#34;.the perfect dessert!there were many other things i wanted to try, but those are all just a great excuse to come backother options that looked delicious, which are on my list for next time:- poutine- fried cheese curds- the cowboy killer burger.there were only a few people inside and it wasn&#39;t crowded, only a couple hours from closing time.my girlfriend and i have been looking for a local burger joint for the longest time and they have won are vote..they also even had ciders.you can choose the spices for your fries too, and were great! highly recommend this place.nice bathrooms with changing table for our baby..she told me, in painstaking detail.the beer selection is always top-notch.this is hands down one of the best burgers in chicago! all the burgers on the menu are so intriguing and it killed me to have to choose only one, but i settled with the slow burn! it was so good! the burger was great quality meat and the best part was the perfect blend of chiles and onions..the service at the bad apple was great - the host sat us near the back of the restaurant where our waitress came over to us right away.the pretzel bun was great, it&#39;s really tough to find a better type of bun than the pretzel bun in my opinion.one of the greatest burgers in the city! lots of different options on the menu too so you can&#39;t just go once! i love their beer menu - tons of varieties between the draft and bottle list..they also have a great selection of chicago craft beers, from the big guys (revolution, half acre) to the smaller ones (begyle, spiteful).the prices are reasonable, the beer selection is great, and the service is second to none.finally settled on the andouille noted burger with chipotle fries ($12.i got truffle fries on the side which were also very delicious.fries are good too.the fries are top notch, and you can add seasoning for a little extra (hello, truffle fries).i came here with a friend who had heard about the great beer selections and the burgers -- we were not disappointed! the ambiance was casual and lively on a friday night, and our server was friendly and attentive.for food, i went with the slow burn with the veggie patty and the truffle fries.when we came there were 3-4 different pumpkin beers on the menu.very good bloody mary.the drinks.thanks bad apple for making love possible.i like how they have sample portions available if you don&#39;t want to commit to a full glass.it&#39;s always really busy..great cheese curds and ranch (this is coming from a wisconsinite).yeppers.there are so many things to recommend this place.i love this place, since the day it opened! beer list and cocktails for days! cheese curds are to die for, burgers that resemble or if not better than kuma&#39;s and house made ketchup is freakin&#39; ridiculous!! edmond fig gerald is my fave! nice, helpful staff and kid friendly..the burgers are what you come here for, so we all ordered different ones.the burger portions are pretty huge, and super juicy for my medium-rare cowboy burger.not a place to go watch games, even though the games are on.phenomenal.go here.50)- a mix of crabbie&#39;s alcoholic ginger beer and butterscotch liqueurverdict: delicious! a great concept that you can easily make at home too..i had a burger with bacon, fig, and goat cheese.great selection of beers and ciders, friendly service and amazing huge and delicious burgers! also cool eclectic artwork.started with the &#34;just encased&#34; appetizer - three different 1/2 sausages laden with giardiniere and stone ground mustard - great start.my girlfriend on the other hand well she loves her chinese and korean food but we decided to take a trip to the bad apple and have a burger.the food was also incredible.update - tried their veggie burger and i&#39;m typically a meat eater - it was basically life changing! highly recommend!.i had a chocolate peanut butter stout and a belgian sour, both of which were amazing."
don-fresco-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/don-fresco-chicago,2,"They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner.i tried out this spot with my friday lunch crew, and it has earned is place in the rotation.i had thoroughly enjoyed the food from here.i&#39;m also excited they have breakfast and am looking forward to trying that.never ever going again.don fresco - &#34;well, funny story..the price is great, the only drawback might be the location for some since its off the beaten path.i placed an order online and it told me my order would be ready for pickup at 12:23pm.the rice was cold with stale peas and corn.the quesadilla and tamale were my favourites.we were able to snag a table but there is limited seating.their steak tacos were really good.i&#39;ve been to latinicity, el patron, and pretty much every taco place in the city and have to say this place is legit.that avocado cream salsa is on point!.i will give them another chance considering they are only a couple blocks from my workplace.after eating my $14 meal i&#39;m still hungry.they got bolis de rompope and arroz con leche.huh??? the old bait and switch.taco salad was ok to good, nothing stellar.not only were they extremely over-priced, but their workers had attitude problems.three times don fresco has had a pop-up in my office building, and three times i have enjoyed every bite.the food is ok, the place is well decorated and the prices are a little expensive for a taco place.i felt like i was eating mexican prepared by someone using a cookbook, not by someone who grew-up eating and cooking this their whole life.sad crying sad.i had tacos and elote.server behind the counter aisha was so friendly."
grace-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/grace-chicago-3,2,"And yet.this focus extends to the wine pairings served with the meal, some of which didn&#39;t seem a great match, although the friendly and articulate sommelier explained the reasoning behind each match in such a captivating manner i was glad we had selected the pairing, even if next time i will strike out on my own.here, although there were some inexpensive wines, they were excellent values and i felt everything paired exceptionally well together.if you aren&#39;t secretly hoping no one is watching you so that you can lick this dish clean then you&#39;re crazy, because this dish was so good.watch for grace to appreciate chef duffy&#39;s culinary journey.i could have had those two items again and again and been very happy with dinner!most others were very good.probably the most memorable dining experience i&#39;ve had in awhile..i was pregnant during our visit and they were very accomodating on menu items.ambiance was comfortable with a tinge of excitement.i had a blast and hope to visit again.i think i only had 4 small pieces of steak on my plate and not much more on the lamb dish.my girlfriend and i both went with the fauna tasting menu with the wine pairing flight.flawless! fine dining at its absolute best.service was impeccable.we learned afterwards that the person mandated to watch when folks are done keeps the pace up if he sees that you are eating quickly.we both opted for the same fauna menu with 1 change to mine (i had a dietary restriction) - i wouldn&#39;t recommend doing this though, because it markedly disrupted the flow of the menu and my palate protested when the changed (flora menu) dish was served: i suppose this also evinces how thoroughly and thoughtfully each menu is planned.the food is bonkers - i had the fauna menu.i can&#39;t really say grace would be one of the restaurants i would rush back to like eleven madison park, per se or chef&#39;s table at brooklyn fare.a twinkle in the eye of our head server.from the moment we walked in we were enveloped in a magnificent service experience.on another non food note, the dining room was elegant and understated.when in real life it was layered with a perfect skill to give it that gave that look.i had tasting menu and the wine paring as well.i probably will never voluntarily or knowingly eat another mushroom.i would go to alinea again before i went here but i&#39;d like to return one day and see what&#39;s new.i still look at them in my phone and wonder why they don&#39;t taste like what their look.amongst robouchon - vegas, august -  nola, le bernadin and jean george - nyc.but i am perfectly fine eating two jumbo portillo dog&#39;s next time i am in town.as an aside, they have some of the coolest riedel decanters i&#39;ve ever encountered.there were couple of dishes that i could not finish them due to the saltiness.there were several dishes that were great and some that were really bad.lives up to the hype.the wine pairing after the whites completely missed the mark.i would definitely go back again.(for comparison per se in nyc costs $350 and customers get a lot of food.cheers to grace.i loved the fact that every dish was a work of art in appearance and in taste..every course that was presented to our table was done so in a highly coordinated manner.it was a dragonfruit filled with rice pudding and flavored with lemongrass.they almost knew what you wanted before you did.the food was creative, eye catching, and most importantly, tasted wonderful.duffy&#39;s solved the bathroom problem.it&#39;s art on a plate.first time trying 3star michelin...though not at the same global champion level as its cross-town rival alinea, this restaurant makes for a very special night.:).each is meant to evolve both on the palate and with each successive bite.3) execution and taste - generous amounts of truffle slices and wagyu medallions.who wouldn&#39;t?!?  the fava bean and puree on the cracker needed more flavor and more texture..then you get two desserts.attentive, but not overbearing nor pretentious.curtis duffy is creative, but not to the point where food is unrecognizable.chocolate: not nearly enough chocolate.and experience worth trying!.i felt thankful as well as honored to have been included in this succulent feast.the room is lovely,the service impeccable, it was a memorable dinner.the grey undertones and warm lighting complemented the subtle spy music.i do appreciate that, and i was so glad we tried a place with such innovative flavor and texture pairings with gorgeous plating...their wine pairing was one of the best.i took my sister there as a graduation gift.when we first stepped into the restaurant (which was very understated and modern), everyone congratulated me on my graduation.i cannot believe this is what i remember from grace...i liked all of them, especially because they had a butter pairing, too."
rickshaw-republic-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rickshaw-republic-chicago,1,"Make sure to byob, or make a quick pit-stop to the cvs at lincoln and fullerton if you didn&#39;t plan ahead.everything was so flavorful, i just could not get enough of that coconut rice! definitely worth a trip and really reasonably priced, don&#39;t forget a bottle of wine!also great for vegetarians and gluten-free folks (clearly marked on menu)..the restaurant was cold too.we shared a few starters and mains, most of which were really, really good.not s lot of flavor and the sauce was like a malt vinegar.members of our party enjoyed their meals all around--lots of clean plates.presented well with yummy rice chips :)p.i like the food, atmosphere and the service.the drinks (es vendor &amp; alpukat) were also small and too sweet.it helped that we ordered the rice table.i am admittedly no expert on indonesian food.i am glad the quality of food and service remained as good as it was, if not better.ok i&#39;m no expert on indonesian food.rice portions are shaped in a pyramid, which is fun.delicious food..not so rickshaw republic! the food here was flavorful and fantastic.my current favorite is the cornish hen.if you like sweet and spicy dancing across your tongue, give this place a try.both were delicious; i really enjoyed the crispiness of the lumpia and the accompanying sweet/spicy chili sauce.u.finally, the mee goreng was asked to be extra hot, and boy, they delivered! so hot to the point of being inedible -- but that&#39;s what i like! addictingly painful and numbing..they all fixed our cravings very well.phenomenal beer make the experience just about as good as it could get.the rice table isn&#39;t an actual table like i originally thought.mix like oil and water, but i&#39;m sold!!saw this place on timeout chicago in comparison to crisp in the double fried wings category, gasp..i think the only dishes that came out pipping hot was the fried food.ps byob without a corkage fee.super delicious indonesian food! very cute restaurant, family operating..highly recommended..i will definitely be back!.the beef randang had big chunks of beef and no sauce ratio.sadly the small plate offerings have a sameness that blurs the experience.they won&#39;t disappoint u:).the ikan pepes was also decent, bordering average..my boyfriend ordered the beef rendang with coconut rice.even though its sort of an entree, i often get it as a starter too.super fast delivery and comes pipping hot.serious?it was over priced and not that tasty, but i get that this is the only indonesian restaurant in the city so they can mark up the price if they want.the fried egg noodle (mie goreng) is another excellent dish and can be ordered by spiciness preference.kinda strolled in on a weeknight.which is such a fantastic value.i still give this restaurant a 4, maybe 4.there were plenty of leftovers because we couldn&#39;t stomach any more of the sugar and stale garlic chips.we ordered many dishes and there were only three of us, so we had left overs, but i love to variation of flavors and it&#39;s well priced, and super fresh.went to rickshaw republic on a fri evening for dinner.the pastels, satay, and rendang with coconut rice is one of my favorite meals.we didn&#39;t try the rice table menu, but did sample a satay, a side and the rending.do not! i repeat do not order the chicken wings which the server tries to sell to everyone.i believe &#34;meh&#34; thoroughly fits to describe rickshaw republic.i had the amazing caramelized beef curry/stew and that paired so so well with the coconut rice.their smash chicken is jaw dropping.if he was a staff of the restaurant,  it would surely be in the interest of the owner to fix this man&#39;s attitude or simply get rid of him..my boyfriend roasted beef was amazing perfect seasoned and the coconut rice so good! i wish i had ordered that instead of the hen, and by the way it&#39;s very spicy, so beware.overall it&#39;s very reasonably price and they have exceptional service.this place is awesome!!!! first of all- we tried one of the specialty drinks on the menu (had some green gel ingredient, sugar, and coconut milk).it was a disappointment for us as we expected yummy pork belly goodness!great and efficient service, pleasant staff, and an awesome atmosphere.it took about an hour and twenty minutes to get the food, which was ice cold..it makes the atmosphere really perfect.we opted to just go for the regular menu, which meant a pretty considerable wait for a party of five.fantastic place!  haven&#39;t been to to many indonesian restaurants, and this is my first one here in the states.the crunch of the chicken is amazing though! the whole order of 4 pieces is $9 but you can definitely get a half order.we had walked in, but then walked out because it wasn&#39;t what we were looking for at the time..the decor is fantastic."
bombobar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bombobar-chicago,2,"The one scoop portion is very generous and i actually shared it (and still felt like i got enough).chicago is the city of donuts, in all shapes and sizes.both amazing.sky was clear, stomach was empty, on my way to work, so i make my mind up and quickly hang right at green street! alas! a parking spot! parking isn&#39;t all that easy or great.$3 each from the walk-up window.it wasn&#39;t too sweet and had the right texture.this thing came hot and fresh, the bread was crisp, came with sausage, eggs, cheese, and bacon.worth the hype.the donut and filling were good by themselves but didnt really jive together.this small counter outside bar siena is highly overlooked.location is perfect.they have other flavors to try, but we were too hooked on this one for now.adorable artisan doughnut shop in chicago! it&#39;s a part of bar siena, so if you end up at the restaurant, and feel lost, do not despair - walk back out of the restaurant, look to the side street and you&#39;ll see the covered window opening for bombobar, which allows you to order the delicious bombolonis, coffee, and gelato.i literally felt oil on my tongue.they had heaters beside the tables outside but they weren&#39;t turned on and the tables were kind of dirty..that was a great $18 lesson..i did my research.size is about the area of your palm.i had gotten the salted caramel based on the recommendation from the barista.the bombolonies are great, but i had a pretty disappointing experience..vanilla custard.it&#39;s basically just a walk up shop attached to a restaurant but the quality of the desserts were great.the donut plain reminds me of a soft and pillowy fried dough (the kind from the east coast that you get at the fair).amazing! everything they offer is great! you can&#39;t go wrong here.."
aloha-poke-co-chicago-6,https://www.yelp.com/biz/aloha-poke-co-chicago-6,2,"Deeeeelicious.i did tell some of my friends later about what happened and they shared the were very sick later that night and into the next day (taking the 12 hours to develop as real food poisoning does)the business owner has personally messaged me and i felt honestly hurt and attacked by his response.service was fast and food was out quickly.i&#39;ve definitely had it fresher from the other location.i&#39;ve been dying to go to aloha poke co but the fulton market location wasn&#39;t exactly convenient and the hours weren&#39;t great.my only real complaint is when they put the sauce on themselves they put a little too much on.but it&#39;s close to the belmont el.the seafood, tofu, and ingredients are fresh and when mixed with their choice of sauces, the bowl is absolutely scrumptious!they are located in the hip and vibrant lakeview shopping district.yum.that with the jalapeño and fresh ginger was heaven! they just made a new fan!.amazing! so happy this location opened up.my favorite part about this location is that they are open until 10pm so i can come for dinner now!my bowl:bigwhite ricesalmon and tuna marinatedmaui onionjalapeñosamurai saucetobikogingercucumber.most likely tomorrow.everything was so fresh and tasty! i really wanted to finish my bowl but i got full right away....the marinated salmon tasted better in this mix, but i definitely want to try the fish naked next time.friendly service and great food at a reasonable price.the poke bowls are to die for - and i am a little embarrassed about how often i go here.this time, i got the big.amazing!!!!! they ran out of mixed greens and gave me seaweed..i&#39;ve been looking for poké for the longest time since i gotten back from california.awesome! soooo thrilled this has made its way to lakeview.the tuna and salmon fish is fresh and the topping selection is diverse.also staff are super cool!! have a feeling we&#39;ll see many more aloha poke&#39;s in our future!.my only issue is that they put so much stuff in the bowl you can&#39;t really mix it up to eat it(1st world problems) but regardless i will be back!.i will attach pictures but i cannot recall what i put on it.enjoy!.the ahi just didn&#39;t taste right - maybe because i got the marinated kind and that&#39;s not as fresh as the naked - but it just wasn&#39;t good fish.the rice was way undercooked.and if you don&#39;t know what a haole is, you&#39;ve proved my point ;).big bowl was plenty to feed a good appetite.when i went by today, they were out of tuna at 11:50 am..crazy good value too,  with the small size coming in under $9 for a very satisfying early lunch.had my first poke bowl today - absolutely delicious.i&#39;ll definitely be back, and hopefully i&#39;ll be able to try the location at revival as well!.great to have a healthy take out option with so much flavor in the neighborhood..you can add extras wo an extra cost which i appreciate.i get the 24oz all the time and for $16 bucks? too expensive..i ate here back to back the next day! can&#39;t wait to come back.place could be tidier though.this one has stool seating, though the space is quite limited.i had been to the aloha poke in the french market and was always prepared to wait 35-45 minutes to order.serving sizes are good, but the bowels are a bit tricky to eat out of in the beginning.it was more like sashimi on rice with extra ingredients as opposed to heavily flavored/seasoned fish in a bed of a variety of seaweeds.the first time i went they forgot some ingredients but it was still delicious.my photos wouldnt do this place justice.fish is sooo fresh and they have so many options to add to the poke bowl.the service is amazing and the food speaks for itself.food is vibrant, filling, and flavorful."
the-franklin-room-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-franklin-room-chicago,2,"Wow.for one thing, i like the name.we started the evening with cocktails.a smoked fish board sounded promising but failed to deliver.note: they take reservations for lunch as well.highly recommend.ripoffs:meat &amp; cheese board - huge rip off and the brie smelled like armpitspulled pork sandwich - not that goodcauliflower parmesan tots - decent, but nothing to write home aboutcrab dip - not enough crabbrussels sprouts - sub-parold fashioned - pretty good, but i&#39;ve had similar quality, if not better old fashions for about half the price.i had the mushroom soup and he had the burrata and we both enjoyed them.and my bartender was super attentive, even with a packed bar the entire time i was there.i love the franklin room! it&#39;s a few blocks away and i find myself here quite frequently..., i guarantee you, it will be fun.kind of hard to hear conversation, but maybe that&#39;s a sign to just keep eating.can&#39;t wait to see how the madison does in the west loop when it opens in the near future!.we tried the cauliflower tots (super tasty &amp; not cauliflower-like), the albacore tuna melt (not your average tuna melt), and the duck sausage (very rich but flavorful) with waffle fries.it wasnt like a pot pie at all :(  whhhhaaaaaatuna melt went with the same general theme.&#34; so lightly and expertly battered but again, theme rich.it was a little pricy for what it was, but the beers helped even that out.finished with the lost &#39;n paradise for dessert.the mussels were flavorful.this drink was truly a multi sensory experience.great meal..formal in that proper service etiquette is noticed and appreciated, yet also casual enough to have a fun conversation with your bartender.you must try the fried cauliflower and drumsticks.the whiskey flights are interesting, and there is an extensive list of well-made cocktails.cool vibe.there food is always amazing, service top-notch, and it&#39;s so reasonably priced for the area which we really appreciate.this is one of my favorite restaurants and hangouts in the country.a bustling little spot on a tuesday night.fortunately, we were able to secure a table for 4 since dinner service was over.i also had a glass of both the red and white wines that were on special ($1 each for glasses that are normally $11-$12 a piece).it is a &#34;basement bar&#34; but it doesn&#39;t feel like it at all.also, while the food was great, my table ordered mainly a bunch of small plates to share and drank (a lot, admittedly), and four of us ran up an almost $500 tab, with tip.no worries we walked over to (cafe iberico) my favorite and as you would know one drink led to another at (the boarding house).i recommend reservations as it is a small place and all the seafood was perfect..great food and drink menu - excellent service.the food was good, and i think that was probably the highlight.the mixed drinks were the best options on the menu, so if you want to stop in for a quick drink, i recommend it.lamb shank - creamy grits, house pesto, whiskey-balsamic (5/5):the grits were surprisingly smooth-it resembled the texture of a thick porridge (with rice removed).great atmosphere.i love restaurants like the franklin room.i would say it was a little on the slow side, but since we were out with friends, it wasn&#39;t very noticeable.overall, perhaps worth checking out but we just didn&#39;t see anything that would cause us to return given the million other restaurant choices in the area..food was great and prices reasonable.i had the fish and chips and my friend had the venison chops medium rare.the drink specials were fantastic.so we went back about 6pm and the place was bumpin (shocking for a basement bar literally under the tracks)..she told us they had a lot of reservations coming in so we could sit at the bar.downstairs and slightly hidden, the franklin room is an unexpected &#34;great find.i went on valentine&#39;s day and it was busy but we were able to find a spot at the bar.we started off with the oysters which were presented with a spicy pepper sauce..good addition to the grown up bar scene in chicago.though the bartender was catering to a full bar, he still took our drink orders and even brought our drinks over to us by the side of the bar.peter and ugna poured us into a state of euphoria upon stopping in for happy hour and lingering until our dinner reservation.came here for dinner with my girlfriend with the intention of having a good meal in a friendly, casual atmosphere (river north is filled with stuffier atmospheres and crowds).i should have requested to be moved because the location seemed to be a bit in the way of traffic, but i obliged.great service at the bar.it&#39;s a cool underground vibe in the basement level.pastrami sandwich was one of the best i&#39;ve had in.definitely a welcoming place.don&#39;t know what kind of fish out was besides being white, but it was flaky and cooked well, not overdone.bartenders are awesome here.it could be a good restaurant but it needs some improvements!..lol.my husband and i came here for date night a few weeks back..love the bar but it&#39;s tough getting a seat.also, they make a pretty good burger; not touching au cheval but will fill you up! i&#39;ll definitely go back when i&#39;m in that area.the whiskey menu is just impressive and on sundays you have a great selection of them for just $1 an ounce!! a little dangerous i must say.good-looking people, fairly tight confines, a great bar to sit at without the large space of some of the other bars at nice restaurants in river north, with great service at the bar and at my table.not only was the food spectacular, the ambience of the franklin room was classy and cozy."
miss-rickys-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/miss-rickys-chicago,1,"Let me tell you, it&#39;s rare for me not to finish a plate because i&#39;m full, but that was truly the case here.the service on my first visit was decent, but fell short of expectations, especially late in the meal.it just wasn&#39;t good, we ordered the breakfast.will never come back.attached to the virgin hotel! very hip, happenin, cool, vibe! dining alfresco with my good friend for lunch..sad to say it, but i can&#39;t stand behind this place anymore.it comes with 2 eggs and gravy all for about $18? personally, that feels a little overpriced for 2 biscuits and 2 eggs.i had a voucher for a loaded shake so i went with the amaretto german chocolate cake shake.i debated over and finally caved into the suggestion of our server.and the chicken and waffles ;-).yep, that pretty much sums it up and branson created it.there was a good selection of both healthy and more indulgent items to choose from.service was good.great food (chicken/waffles and rubenedict), offset by inattentive service.check!  he made it happen!!.i work downtown and i decided to try this place out.i loved the garnish (chicken skin, perhaps) and the sweet and spicy syrup perfectly complemented the breaded chicken tenders and waffle.the food was excellent, and the staff were really friendly.but food is food and interior is nice so i would come back!.fries and onion rings were heavy on the oil.consistent and fantastic food and service.food was good.right in the middle of the pie is a bone marrow which brings it up a notch.ha.there was also a chocolate cake with a chocolate knife stuck in it.i have been here six times and this place never disappoints.you can tell they hate working there.not too crowded.unfortunately not a dog friendly patio.food is great, good music and great service.mediocre service.service was okay but they did use tablets to take orders.the waffles and chicken is one of the best things on the menu here, make sure you order the extra syrup (2$) which is a little hot.very cool, funky, clean, diner-meets-subway decor with open kitchen, and.hostess.it was nice experience, but i will not return since there wasn&#39;t anything special about the place.the food and service were so good that we came back two more times! one of the days we went, the chef sent us two dishes on the house! we weren&#39;t sure why, but the dishes were both delicious.i stopped in for lunch while visiting.sunday i had a small bowl of 7 grain stuff, a fried egg, a side a bacon, and a soda for $20.i just went for coffee and dessert and left very dissapointed.everything i&#39;ve tried at miss ricky&#39;s i have really enjoyed, and i&#39;ve tried almost everything by now.while the chips were good, the fish was outstanding.i particularly liked the green beans.in a very tourist location inside the virgin hotel.the menus were used as place mats and they had all types of varsity in terms of food the best being gluten free onion rings and fish and chips..we also had a burger that was supposed to be medium and it was definitely well done.i ended up getting avocado toast with an over easy egg, which was good but very different from the typical avocado paste (guacamole?) spread on a piece toast.it was fantastic!! very crisp and the cheese mix was great will comeback.breakfast all day, and open until 2 am, too.the cow cream dispenser is a nice touch.outdoor seating gave us plenty of people watching.the waffle was slightly crusted with sugar which helped it from being flattened under half of a small chicken.had a great monday am breakfast here.overall was a good experience and would comeback/recommend to others.happy hour menu was a bit limited.in addition, the mimosa was great! they used freshly squeezed juices with their own unique flair.the dish came with a maple syrup and a honey sriracha syrup that i&#39;m still dreaming of! i would get this dish again hands down!.i got the grilled cheese and tomato soup.sit outside !   in the loop, great menu - something for everyone.it&#39;s located at the virgin hotel ( also heard great things ) and has a very funky and hip vibe.we&#39;ll be back for more.so as we said thank you, she didn&#39;t smile or respond at all.hubby was a fan of it."
yolk-river-north-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yolk-river-north-chicago-2,2,"All together the bill came to just under $50.checked in and quoted 5 minutes.overall though, no big issues on service.i have a hard time playing $25 for and simple breakfast.bright and friendly - absolutely loved the pancakes and syrup.a chicago winner.well, it might have been one of the best breakfast items i&#39;ve ever looked at, or wrecked.it&#39;s so good, but about 3/4 way through the meal i start to feel insanely nauseous and can&#39;t finish everything.the eggs benedict itself was delicious, and the corned beef hash on top dealt the salty and savory flavor i was craving.i&#39;m sorry but it&#39;s just so dang good and perfect for me..service was great too - very helpful and pleasant and in a genuine way.after reading beaming reviews for the south of the border benny, i decided to give it a shot..server was so so.scrambled eggs seem to be the common denominator, but what a way to ruin our family vacation!absolutely avoid!.the waitress definitely lacked in friendliness which makes things not as good.what an amazing experience..the cheesy egg sandwich was lack luster.their corned beef hash is bomb! smoky and well-seasoned!  service is great for a very busy place.overall, i&#39;m not happy.we got food poisoning...i always feel bad about not leaving a tip, because i understand that sometimes you have a bad day, you have a lot of customers, you are missing limbs but with her, i didn&#39;t feel bad at all.i hate, hate, hate waiting for food (probably because i always wait until i&#39;m already hungry to start thinking about it).if you visit yolk, bring your appetite! the plates are big and the flavors magnificent.my girlfriend and i took one of our close friends here for a bday brunch on halloween, it was surprisingly packed at noon during the downpour, however our group of four was seated immediately.some of the best coffee i&#39;ve had and their fresh squeezed strawberry oj was delicious.i would recommend yolk and look forward to visiting again.the portion size was big so i only ate half, but i could have easily finished it if i was hungrier.generic breakfast spot, but very clean with lots of options.the appearance inside was also very clean and upscale!.immediate reaction after eating: been here a few times with small and large groups and they are always outstanding, i recommend any benedict (tip get the hollandaise sauce on the side)monster size ham steak, yacht club sandwich plus bottomless coffee and i always want to order crepes at breakfast places but i need protein in the morning so this place lets you get a dessert size one (which means only one crepe which is awesome!!!!).i came in early on a thursday morning.i&#39;ve been at this location (which mind you gets super packed) twice, and this isn&#39;t a bad breakfast spot in chi-town for the price.so so so good! i look forward to coming again.we ordered the chicken and waffles and the yolk combo..the potatoes were not so crunchy and could have been cooked slightly longer.i&#39;ve been here about a dozen times and never had a bad meal.the food was delicious and a great value for the price.breakfast and lunch are served in the morning, so i opted for the buffalo chicken salad with coffee.i needn&#39;t have worried, as they had a table for us right away, and we actually had to wait for enough of our party to get there to be seated!our waitress was awesome; she saw our byob bottles of champagne and immediately recommended the strawberry orange juice (which was delicious!).usually don&#39;t eat that much but i finished the whole thing!!.we were in at 9 on a saturday and sat down immediately.i went for the south beach which was a 1/2 pineapple filled w/ goodies: strawberries, yogurt, granola, and walnuts.it was one of the few breakfast places near my hotel..yum.they have booths for one person in the back that you can request.i have an unhealthy obsession with yolk&#39;s tour de france - it&#39;s the first thing i ever ordered there and it&#39;s the only thing i&#39;ve ever ordered to this day (it routinely wins the unspoken &#39;who ordered the best thing&#39; contest).saw a crowd &amp; thought, ouch, is this going to be a long wait?! but no, a quick 15-20 mins.no wait.one of the best places for a hangover breakfast!all their omelettes are amazing and there is enough sitting space on a busy day as well.it was very good..sooo good.love it!.the server was prompt.some of the best things to get here are eggs, get it yolk?!  the restaurant itself is even shaped like an egg, really.the oj is fresh, and i like the way they use small rounded ice in their drinks..all.seems like a good place to eat, except for when the place is extremely busy so you and your friend sit at the bar (to wait to be called to your table) and the waitress (rocheal/racheal) tells you that you can&#39;t sit there because no one sat you, and that you would have to go somewhere else to wait because the spot was for customers that have been sat (suggestions on where to wait? &#34;outside or something, i think we have some seating there&#34;), just to later be sat in the same exact spot, where, later a party of 3 white people sit directly next to your party to take selfies and wait to be seated..the works omelette was another hit with us, great flavor even with egg whites and a lot of food for the price!the food at yolk is always worth the wait for us!.place was clean and casual.usually a wait but well worth it.really not good.recommend the bacon waffles.i was really disappointed with the coffee, bitter, the kind of quality you might find in a lower scale diner, and most heinous of all they didn&#39;t have cream!  they had those little flavored &#34;non-dairy&#34; coffee creamer cups.to me the portions are very big so i usually eat half and save the rest for later!."
mindys-hot-chocolate-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mindys-hot-chocolate-chicago-2,1,"This time i ordered cold press coffee and the cookie platter.we were seated right away for a table of 2, but the place was totally packed for 9 pm..the pepper and egg sandwich includes a homemade bread bun and roasted poblanos with a flavorful cheese and garlic aoili combo.i&#39;ve ordered several kinds of hot chocolate beverages from mindy&#39;s, but my favorite is the mexican hot chocolate.accompanied by the cutest pair of ketchup/mustard bottles i have ever seen.every time i visit chicago i go out of my way to get a drink here!.the regular cups were huge! and i came for an afternoon snack so we thought it&#39;d be the perfect portion if we shared..it also came with roasted potatoes that were on the crispy side and so delicious!  i ended up eating the entire thing and didn&#39;t feel overly full afterwards.comfort food central.all of these groups stood in the same area.4 stars since the desserts were good, not spectacular, and for value.stopped for lunch on the way out of chicago and was not disappointed!  the kids each got a hot chocolate that had a thick layer of hot fudge on the bottom.the melon sorbet tasted exactly like cantaloupe but it was sweeter than i would like and it eventually overpowered the taste.i joined in the general atmosphere by ordering a decadent lunch and following ti up with a large mug of hot chocolate.stopped by for a late night cocktail and dessert.i only visited to eat dessert and shared the strawberry rhubarb cake with the wife.shrimp was fresh and went so good with veggies and dressing! i absolutely recommend it :-)medium hot chocolate with marshmallows was too sweet for me at the end, but dark hot chocolate with marshmallows was perfect match!!.*this rating is purely for the hot chocolate.we also split the carrot icebox cake which was super unique.it&#39;s incredibly smooth and chocolatey and spicy.the hot chocolate had a strange after taste which i couldn&#39;t really put my finger on and the half&amp;half was just completely a miss.this is not your usual powdered hot chocolate.picture chicharrones thats how crispy n tasty the duck was.come for the hot chocolate but stay for the unique menu selections.the burger was juicy, flavored packed and came stacked with bacon, cheddar cheese, and house made pickles.the person on the phone was rude, and when i called again about a cake, another woman answered who was even ruder than the last.food:  everything we ordered was delicious, perfectly prepared and well presented.when i&#39;ve ordered food with the hot chocolate, i usually find it&#39;s best to share a cup with someone else as it&#39;s so rich and filling.don&#39;t judge..save this for a really special occasion if you&#39;re trying to treat someone who&#39;s a real chocolaholic.after being seated, i ordered an old fashioned.only without the whole fucking your life up part.warm and comfy interior.amazing pumpernickel bread, umami blast from the bacon, and great (vegan) tomato soup for dipping and enjoying.i highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion!!.i came here with a friend for lunch, right when it opened, so there weren&#39;t too many people dining just yet.the hot chocolate though--wowza.the chips that came with it were very salty.don&#39;t get me wrong, mindy&#39;s hot chocolate is good and the desserts are good, but not orgasmic or something i would write home about..the ambiance is dark and romantic, perfect for a date.but when i do it feel so so good! but really, does this mean there is nothing wrong with this place? maybe yelp ratings should go to 11, turn this review up to 11! enough of the banter and on to the substance.my boyfriend and i each ordered a hot chocolate and split the brioche bread pudding.we had a party of 5 and split three desserts which was too many after lunch.the bartender was wonderful.the wait was over an hour and a half (expected for a cold saturday night).i got the medium hot chocolate which was amazing! the medium has some milk chocolate and some dark chocolate and it was perfectly sweet.the whiskey taste wasn&#39;t too prevalent as i could barely taste it, but the textures of the dessert were nicely balanced and wasn&#39;t overly sweet.what could be better than hot chocolate.it has a strong chocolate flavor.we got seated towards the back of the restaurant, cute corner booth.the food made up for it otherwise i would have given 4 stars for that..my friend ordered the donuts and they were nice a fluffy, but wasn&#39;t a big fan of the passion fruit cream that came on the side, but that&#39;s a personal preference..the hostess was smiley and delightful upon our arrival and as we left, so that made it better.totally unnecessary as the entrees and hot chocolates were so filling, but good nonetheless.however they did provide a nice heavy amount of salmon.the food is so-so, i had a fish special that i didn&#39;t care for that much..great service too..after a heavy dinner i still was craving some milk and cookies- this place definitely hit the spot! so many hot chocolate choices, i went with mexican hot chocolate.there are different varieties of hot chocolate too, and i am sad i did not make room for the white hot chocolate.don&#39;t remember the name of mine, but our waiter recommended it over another that i chose..i didn&#39;t realize that the waitress split the beverage for us, which is a $1 upgrade.we tried the siren, all inclusive, vieux carre, and the fall martini."
bricks-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bricks-chicago,2,"I&#39;m pretty sure if you&#39;re 6 foot you&#39;d have to duck.legit pizza place.there is awesome art and decor that really adds to this place&#39; personality.big turn off is that simple kitchen staples should be available with so few options on a menu.and the painful was good as well.love this place, great atmosphere and delicious pizza.came in around 9pm on a tuesday for some drinks and dinner.we can&#39;t wait to come back, highly recommend this place as i&#39;ve been disappointed with other pizza joints here in the city.it&#39;s standard pizza.beer was awesome.the girl working there was extremely rude.it is pretty small and they do not take reservations however the hour wait they promised us really was only half an hour on a busy saturday night.we had half the sweet heat and half regular pepperoni..i wasn&#39;t expecting that at all and came away impressed at their customer service.there wasn&#39;t much seating available so we were smooshed up against other tables.we also ordered an alcoholic root beer &#34;not your fathers root beer&#34; which is not my new favorite thing! can&#39;t wait to go back!.semi-private and could get away with saying it&#39;s a cozy joint to hang with friends at.i love that you can get a white pizza (olive oil and garlic instead of sauce).if you have to wait for a table grab a drink at the bar and savor the delicious smell of pizza.that&#39;s why i deducted a star.red sauce is delicious (had it on the meat balls and goat cheese dish) and pizzas are good for the price point (10 inch for 12 bucks)..great place in the basementa little creepy as we went into the basement.i highly recommend a house or caesar salad to compliment the pizza.food tastes amazing when you have the beer munchies but not this cardboard.it&#39;s so cute - sort of underground, down some dark steps and into pizza heaven.yum yum!  half and half, two delicious types of pizza and my fav thin crust..the sweet heat was a good balance of sweet &amp; spicy while the painful was slightly spicy.loved it! walking in, it felt like stepping into a dungeon.....spicy pizza is delicious.hey just wanted to let you guys know that i was really craving the sweat heat pizza today and called three times to order it! your phone number provided is what i used and no one answered! :-(  i&#39;m sad to say i ordered elsewhere.great pizza and service.my boyfriend and i shared a medium &#34;painful pizza&#34; and it was the perfect size and had amazing toppings- pepperoni, onion, and fresh jalapeno.a wide beer selection, great service even when busy, and options to sit in the restaurant or watch the game on the tvs at the bar make this one of my favorite classic pizza joints..to keep it short, prompt delivery (30 minutes when grubhub said an hour), delicious thin crust pizza (red planet was good, but i&#39;m not in love with goat cheese so i&#39;ll probably try the bbq chicken next time), and the slutty ravioli was awesome (warning: you must really like cheese in order to enjoy this).i resisted the place for the longest time as its in basement and i am not a fan of that.i love supporting local businesses.we had two kids and two adults.1) i told her it would be more complicated because we all got different things- she told me &#34;just split the bill 11 ways because the drinks (alcohol) are only $37&#34;2) i said &#34;no, i don&#39;t want to pay for anyone&#39;s alcohol and our pizza prices were different&#34;- &#34;well you can tell me how much to put on each card and i&#39;ll do it that way&#34;3) &#34;that&#39;s so much more work then you just printing out separate receipts for each seat because then we&#39;d have to calculate it all&#34;- &#34;well we put the $37 on the back so it should be less complicated&#34;then i went back to our table and we spent the next 20 minutes calculating it and we had to add the tax/tip as well.i also like that they have beer specials everyday.if you are a deep-dish or even regular crust lover - this is not the place to change your opinion on thin-crust pizza..once inside and downstairs, you&#39;re in a classy and clean restaurant.the atmosphere is already pretty cool..it was relatively late saturday night (10pm-ish) and their hours listed them as open.service here is good...the food still arrived hot and the pizza crust was still crispy (very hard to do).a competitor brought me (an admittedly lower quality, but half as expensive) a pizza in 40 minutes.waitress was attentive and helpful at making menu recommendations.it was a tuesday night and pretty dead so we were seated immediately.they are apparently known for their thin crust pizza, i&#39;m not sure if they have deep dish or regular pan pizza, but i&#39;m sure they do offer that as well.if you want to step it up and get away from your &#34;routine&#39; style of pizza this is where to go.ordered delivery from here on a sunday evening..overall, the painful is my fave and i crave it.great place and i am a fan indeed.if you hate barnaby&#39;s you probably won&#39;t like this place either.this is the second time i&#39;ve ordered from here and it&#39;s the same guy that delivers the pizza-a complete asshole.they are my favorite basic cheese pizza in the city, bbq chicken pizza is also really good.in any case, now i realize bricks is not family friendly, as indicated on google local and yelp.i really hope it wasn&#39;t because they weren&#39;t all caucasian but unfortunately there is no other reason i can think of.pizza was ok, crust a little bit too hard and overall experience really not that great."
saint-lous-assembly-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/saint-lous-assembly-chicago,2,"I loved my first visit here.first off, the meatloaf was awesome.save your money.the place has this super retro working class look, but its really not very inviting, and way too dark.the chicken was so good-better than tikka masala i&#39;ve had at indian restaurants.other drinks can be ordered just before you pay at the end of the line.was taken aback when i grabbed a glass much smaller than i&#39;d expected.aside from food and drinks, the best part about this place is the &#34;backyard&#34; with free bocce!.as of late i ordered solely from my server.it was huge, i mean i barely put a dent into it and i ate a good amount.i used to have a condo 2 blocks away and remember this place as just a closed diner.came for brunch.for that reason alone, i don&#39;t know that i can go back.the ambiance is pretty cool.)..legit biscuits, good no frills service..a chill, almost low-brow throwback atmosphere with great food and the same kind of disturbingly friendly service that is oddly offered by the dmv express (seriously, check that out).o..we had the porchetta confit and meatloaf wellington with kale, bokchoy and potato pave.you should also get on the pork slider with a fried pickle..as soon as you walk in a large menu stares at you from the wall, then you glance to your left, there&#39;s a counter with tray rails with a glass buffet, but no it is not a cafeteria or a buffet; it&#39;s a regular sit down restaurant.back patio is awesome too.overall i will have to give this another try and hope it was a bad day!.&#34;yelp.i definitely will be back and thank my lucky stars this place is where it is.kids were throwing cups and staff was encouraging it.only rule is you must have a beer in your hand while playing, and the staff even sent over a waitress to the bocce ball court to ensure we weren&#39;t rule breakers! i&#39;ve heard great things about the sunday brunches/crawfish boils/etc and i could see how the backyard could become a very popular spot this summer.we came just for the bocce and bourbon root beer float.i also had the lavender lemonade with gin and wow.i am a big fan of these &#34;meat and three&#34; places, having tried a bunch of them while road tripping through the south and southeast.i thought about this place several times since my first visit.one thing i will say is that they have outstanding beverages, floats, and desserts! like, one of their adult floats will have your equilibrium playing tricks on you.the food was decent but a little overpriced for me.i like the casual vibes with quality food at a reasonable price for the location.the staff were really friendly and personable, giving recommendations and making sure we had everything we needed.staff super friendly.midwestern transplants, perk up your ears:the old school signs at the entrance, the cafeteria trays, the self pour water into red plastic glasses that make any 80s kid think pizza hut!, the no-nonsense-quietly-approving line cook."
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,1,"The service was super friendly, prompt, and just lovely - clearly, this is a canadian chain.i would totally recommend to all my friends and family.they have a very eclectic menu, but everything i tried was well executed..this is like no other sports bar...my dining partner ordered a house made raspberry soda.this on top of my father being charged incorrectly for drinks months before and the waitstaff not really caring that they messed up.maybe we&#39;ll have better luck next time.5 stars!.at a phenomenal new restaurant from canadia here in chicago, called earl&#39;s!i live in streeterville &amp; found this old familiar restaurant, that i frequented regularly in bellevue, wa  (seattle area), as i headed to arclight theatres to watch superman vs batman (which i also recommend to go to!).very nice ambiance..ordered burgers- bread was soggy, meat was good quality, topping-pickles, mushrooms, cheese were very tasty..very lemony and cute presentation..i had a stellar frozen cosmo and the bf had a double mojito classic..yummy dessert and if you go monday through friday they have a happy hour with food and drink specials from 3 to 6..our waiter zach was very attentive..i had 4/6 abs it was still not that spicy but with good flavor.i couldn&#39;t even finish half of either of my courses.the menu had american and asian inspired meals, but my sister and i ordered the bacon cheeseburgers (i guess not super adventurous) but the burgers were so good! really fresh and cooked just the way i ordered it.the girls are dressed in club attire, although, this is an ultra-laxed setup and environment..being japanese i was not into it, and the wasabi was the size of a pea..besides kelly we had a few others making sure our dinner was top notch- most of them were straight outta canada (ey!) and in for the first few weeks of their opening.plentiful of outlets especially at the bar area.fair warning.i personally would like to know more about canadian foods like montreal&#39;s smoked meats.we substituted the fries (for a side salad)and saw they charged $2 more on the bill.this trip to earls was a real treat!  having been to the restaurant in alberta and ontario, i knew what to expect and to my pleasant surprise, everything was identical to the home country!  the cajun chicken sandwich was done perfectly, about the best one i&#39;ve ever had..we were seated in a large booth meant for four clients; ample space.i had the steak and eggs and the spicy sausage and eggs.we stopped for a snack i had the tuna tostadas and he had a cheese burger.in addition to the food and drinks, every person on their staff that we encountered- hostesses, bartenders, our server (marcus)- were all awesome!!! i&#39;ll definitely be back!..my daughter now works at one of my favorite places as a hostess so heck yea i&#39;m biased!but seriously, the food is still great.it seems like a restaurant in search of an identity.the hostess even gave our little one a bowl of water and treat to keep her busy :)we had the truffle fries ($5hh), chardonnay ($4hh) to start, which were both generously portioned considering it was happy hour.we got the bbq chicken and rib combo and the salmon and it was all gross - i&#39;m not a picky eater.our server was quiet attentive.first, i was really surprised to hear that earl&#39;s is a chain, based in canada, where it is apparently very popular.the cajun chicken had so much seasoning it was had a paste feel.i asked the bartender if they could put the sound on.we ordered raspberry mojitos, cabin fever and another drink, and they were all great.:).i will be going next week to try the happy hour specials, i will be a regular there for sure.it&#39;s a beautiful new place, food was delish, and the service is impeccable.the caesar salad was also very good.drinks are on point and the service is phenomenol!.moscow mile perfectly made.i went there first for the private test run and was pleasantly surprised that everything was gonna be free, and i was going try many of the items on the menu..however, i appreciate their effort of plating and presentation.if you drive- park in the garage nearby and don&#39;t forget to get your parking ticket validated.the staff was super friendly and offered nothing but what is phenomenal service and food..i had the skirt steak, truffle fries, and toffee cake dessert.my husband and i went there recently for lunch.i can&#39;t say service needs work because the hostess and manager were courteous to me.everything else i&#39;ve eaten there is amazing! the dynamite roll, salmon entree and chicken, brie &amp; fig sandwich are my top favs.the tinga chicken taco stuck out more than anything else.a couple of us ordered chicken sandwiches with brie and fig, and nobody left a bite on their plates.the price of the food is a little high but the food we had was very good and it&#39;s definitely a great place to hang out with friends.it was not quiet.try them all!..the deserts are great! best pumpkin pie!the drinks are top notch."

(how did i never know about the signature room at the hancock??) she was the sweetest, always made sure we had everything we need and our drinks filled, totally made our friend&#39;s experience!! i never ask for servers by name when i go places, but if they&#39;ll let me, i&#39;m going to try and get her as my waitress every time!also, be sure to try the roasted chicken with chimmichurry sauce - my fave!!!.check out doc next door for date night or sit outside on the patio at dunlays if the weather is good.with chicago weather fluctuating from snow to 40s to finally 60s.initially, the spinach artichoke dip was kinda funky and soupy, but as soon as it cooled down a bit, the texture became much more normal and it tasted pretty good.yes.you really can&#39;t go wrong.my girlfriend and i recently moved from seattle to chicago and went looking for an apartment in the lincoln park neighborhood..the wait staff are all fantastic and we&#39;ve had a chance to meet the owner who is also a great guy.one of the best in the city between the egg, thick cut bacon, the bread.the waitress recommended the veggie burger.i&#39;d be back for the chili!.i didn&#39;t eat anything off of the menu, but their martinis were spectacular.thank you george! you&#39;ve been great!.we loved their breakfast potatoes so much that we were really sad when it came time to move to lincoln park."

 i have been coming here regulry since october but the staff looks stressed and not welcoming! hire more people.the falafels are very crispy on the outside and soft inside with a beautiful green color and tiny bits of carrots.the baklava was really good too!.reasonable prices.i often order the chicken shwarma sandwich and always say &#34;chicken shwarma sandwich with no tomato&#34; and the server always says &#34;you want everything else?&#34; and i say &#34;chicken shwarma with no tomato&#34; and this goes on for about 3 rounds before they figure out the only thing i don&#39;t want on it is tomato then we are good to go.after so many excellent reviews, i may have came in with too high of expectations..i&#39;m updating with an extra star to mention that the &#34;couscous&#34; is now back on the menu.fast food take on mediterranean food but very good! i had the plate with chicken kabob, hummus, rice and tabouleh..i wish the team gave more pita with each order, and am not crazy for their falafel, which was a little dry.the steak shawarma is great! perfectly cooked and seasoned.thanks.i have been to the omg in the loop, and i actually think this location serves better quality food..walking in, i found very few customers there (around 2pm, which is i guess kinda late for lunch).second time had the omg plate: med salad, humus, rice and steak again.this location is relatively small, but the workers greeted me right away and i was glad the menu was simple and straight forward.you can get a plate or a sandwich.awesome cucumber salad and the soup with a twist is good, too!  their food is healthy.i don&#39;t know how you can&#39;t love this place.this is the chipotle of mediterranean food! it&#39;s obvious this joint lives on the 3 f&#39;s: fast, fresh, flavorful! i just made that up, but i wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that was really their motto.the falafel is top notch! stop in if your looking for a quick tasty bite..all the food tastes like it was doused in salt.like, they seem genuinely happy..finally someone understands what i want.i with the portion of the plate was greater though.i typically wouldn&#39;t go to a strip mall restaurant.so good.you walk up and order your food and then pay.i ordered the beef plate, but he let me sample everything and it was all delicious.the couscous had tomato sauce and taste more like a pasta, i don&#39;t know if it is more authentic, but i was used the &#34;salad&#34; couscous style.the portion is a little smaller than the other places, but the prices and service is pretty comparable.terrible customer service.the food was just ok and for the price i only got 1 half of a pita cut in half...think chipotle or qdoba, but for mediterranean fare.the falafel was super fluffy and light, which i enjoyed.before i left i ordered the same dish &amp; took it home for tomorrow - that&#39;s how much i liked it!!steak shawarma was very flavorful and you get a good amount for the price.their hummus was very creamy..my bf had the falafel pita and i had the chicken pita.i have a craving several times a week!.the chipotle of mediterranean food!  so that means good, not great!  everything is in a food warming tray behind a sneeze guard, you pick what you want from the selections..chicken didn&#39;t seem cooked and was stringy and rubbery, staff was so rude and i watched one staff member ,  on a break, throw her food on a chair and floor.my favourite item on their menu steak shawarma or gyro.the hummus with a zesty lime hint was delicious and chopped med salad was very fresh.for under 8 bucks you get your choice of salad, some hummus or baba ghanouj, pita bread, and choice of meat all on some basmati rice.i want to try other things on the menu but always go back last minute once i order haha!  extremely clean restaurant and nice friendly staff too!.the food was alright.pretty healthy, pretty fast, pretty reasonably priced.you can get sandwiches, a variety of small plates, or build your own large plate, which is what i went for.i generally don&#39;t write reviews for fast food/take out type places, but this one deserves to be written about!i always walk by it on my way home from the gym in the mornings, and today i happened to be on my way home from work when i decided i would hop in and see what they&#39;ve got for dinner.the average customer here seems to be incredibly impatient and rude which sucks for the employees but they&#39;re still nice to everybody..for starters they didn&#39;t have the cous cous she always orders and i was told that i would have to order what they had left over.oh, and whether you&#39;re getting their food for catering or not get the garlic sauce.henry ford never intended his process to be used for falafeling!

ara-on-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ara-on-chicago-2,2,"As i devoured my delicious bbq rice amuse bouche i decided on the salmon bento box even though i was a bit turned off by the price ($20).overall: ara on offers swanky, elevated asian foods in a swanky environment.exactly as i have it in dordogne valley of france.i just couldn&#39;t stop---- it was so freaking good.the service was a bit slow at first, but the food came out fast.while surfing yelp for great chicago eats i noticed ara on and thought we should give it a try! i have to say i was absolutely shocked to walk into a nearly empty restaurant.food was great and don&#39;t forget dessert - not to be missed.the thai slaw was meh.the fries which came with it are blunt.great atmosphere with creative plating!our table ordered the edamame to start, which was only $5 and a big portion for the table with just the perfect amount of salt.and the chicken tasted like it had been microwaved.a lot to choose from and recommend asking the server for recommendations or sharing with your guests to be able to try different dishes.nevertheless, i would definitely recommend coming here.wow has this place changed..amazing! i ordered a moscow mule to drink and it was a generous pour.it was a worthy last meal.there is a small stand in the hotel lobby right outside the restaurant too.very bizzare! on the other hand, another coworker ordered the strip steak which looked delicious and she enjoyed it.this place likely caters to tourists and business people and not locals.not your typical asian cuisine..came very fast.the tuna bites were a complementary &#34;bite&#34; but we also had the scallops with.yummmmm!!!.recently,  i decided to take my kids over their on a saturday because they always heard about araon from me and wanted to try it for themselves.i&#39;m looking at the menu and see all the wonderful choice of foods.4: price is higher than its qualityhope improvement.we just got the duck dumplings off the hot appetizers menu last and they were lukewarm at best with filling that had hardened into a solid lump.great service, very attentive.they also have a nice happy hour from 4-6 with food and drink specials.the sushi here is excellent.not a typical wrap but a little pile of deliciousness on a crispy seaweed wrap..i also highly recommend the araon sushi tower--very fresh and satisfying! we will be back!.my friend ordered the amish chicken with artichoke.it was not tasty at all especially for $20! the rice was cold and sashimi tasted fishy.perfect choice for foie gras.do you serve nigiri.the combination of fruity maple pumpkin and cranberry compote with the fattiness of the foie gras reminds me of fruit jam on baked brie.and by &#34;we&#34; and &#34;shareable&#34; i mean had it to myself.we expected to have to sit in the lounge or at the bar since we didn&#39;t have reservations, but the hostess was able to find us a great cozy table where we sat for a while, shared several dishes and caught up on the past 20 years.outstanding sushi! in town by myself for work and went and sat at the sushi bar.nice service and atmosphere, but i suggest kill the terrible muzac.gotta try this place for lunch.the sesame crusted salmon bi bim bap was huge.the sushi was great too.i&#39;m an experienced diner and i told her that this was a very little bit of wine.some highlights include the octopus and red velvet desert.i know the nfl used him and his sushi for the many parties they had for super bowl weekend.sushis and rolls are what you would expect from a solid japanese establishment, the rest of menu is on the fusion side of things.well, i would&#39;ve been happy of they&#39;d gotten the rest right.one of my favorite restaurants in the city..we got ginger beer (kiuchi brewery, hitachino nest ginger brew), but it tasted like regular beer, and there&#39;s really no need to drop $8 for that.such a friendly executive chef.my god this place is terrible.same with the rolls.wow is all i can say.not memorable.it&#39;s decently priced for sushi downtown.the downside to this place- it&#39;s actually pretty pricey for things that i don&#39;t think should be.the service was equally impressive; servers were attentive but not intrusive; chef trevor accompanied many of the dishes to describe them himself.the waitress was accommodating that one person in our party was late, which was nice.i love their edamame&#39;s and their sushi was pretty darn good.the owner and the employees there are both so warm and kind.made it an outstanding experience.the restaurant in general look nice too and i guess i&#39;m paying the premium for that experience too."
wood-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wood-chicago,2,"It was nice watching the dreadful chicago weather from inside a warm restaurant.our waiter kevin was amazing, and made our dinner experience all the better.great apps.i had high expectations and they were met..but had to ask the waiter for ketchup..i definitely don&#39;t return to places with awful service.it felt neighborhood-y enough.i would difinitely return, but, if given the option of someplease else to brunch, i would likely go elsewhere.the sunny side egg complimented very well..service was also excellent.the cheese curds were pretty standard and served with a side of ranch, however the cinnamon roll was outstanding - i couldn&#39;t get enough!! first of all it&#39;s a giant ass cinnamon roll that was moist throughout with small pockets of cinnamon sugar.i&#39;m dying to sit on the patio and have brunch one weekend.a group of us stopped in for brunch on sunday and it was a nice atmosphere with friendly waitstaff! ultimately the food was good, but we had 3 vegetarians in our group and the menu had very few options for us.not to mention i loved pairing it with their moscow mule.but the server informed us that there was a large party that needed the table.i will be back!.both the bar staff and the patrons were lively and social..the beers and cocktails are excellent too.we both got the strip steak for $29 and was served with a total of 2 small carrots and 2 small potatoes.i come from the south of italy and the pizza was not even close to be a good neapolitan pizza.before we were even done eating our meal the server dropped the check.perfection! lighting, music and kickass cocktail menu didn&#39;t hurt.i only left a tip because the bus staff deserved it but our waiter was rude and unprofessional.on a lark, my wife and i stopped into wood because they seem to have a few open tables.my partner pretty much ate whatever he could in between my bites..but it wasn&#39;t.really wasn&#39;t impressedthe wine descriptions sounded like flavored coffees at dinkin donutsthe wall eye wasn&#39;t very tasty or specialthe wild mushroom dish only had 2 pieces of stuffed pasta and was a glorified salad.i liked the way the clientele was mixed, and people were hanging out at the long bar with friends without causing a riot.the scallops only included 2 for $15.rode the red line from the loop and walked about 4-5 blocks.food - eggs benedict: impressive, delicious, very large shareable portion.&#34; my partner comes back to the table, in disbelief, and tells me.the cocktails were great, the small plates were amazing, and dinners were tasty though the cassoulet was dry.the only complaint i have is that we waited a while to get service initially, but after that everything was great.the dessert was a lump of tasteless something.we shared--cherry filled french toast bites a+--a cinnamon roll (another a+).service was a little weird/slow but it&#39;s whatever.to all you who think: this girl is really specific, i am fully aware, but i also arrived about 20 minutes early just so that i could explain it before the restaurant got the dinner rush.holy richness what is this trickery in a glass?! we were both glad we ended up ordering this (sarah&#39;s always right) as it was robust in chocolate &amp; caramel flavors.the cheese came with warm, delicious bread and was more mild in taste.cute little place, low lights, nice for catching up with friends or a nightcap.had dinner for two there for the second time last night and they have not disappointed.i also tried the steak on special.again, kevin..the food 5 stars.on to the best steak tartare i have ever tasted..had a great time with a party of nine for dinner.the design is great, amazing bar scene especially for lonely travelers like me.still wasn&#39;t blown away...what a wonderfully fun and delicious evening we had....the food was absolutely awful and service mediocre."

the chicken was very dry without it.it&#39;s still impossible to get a drink at the bar.solid choice, a chicago institution.if the service would have been halfway decent, i would have given the pump room 4 or 5 stars.the care taken when my old fashioned (with bulleit rye, of course) was made was matched by the tito&#39;s vodka-based concoction made for gal pal.salmon with crispy rice4.this one&#39;s a winner.both campaigns had fundraisers here.the personnel here were all very nice.note that the pump room also does a good job at accommodating larger groups (i&#39;ve been here with up to 15 or so people).not a good place for young kids, definitely adults only.definitely a spot worth trying though!.the staff is very friendly and helpful and guided me in the right direction..this is definitely a historic chicago venue that people should try to visit if possible.it doesn&#39;t feel like a hotel restaurant by any means.you don&#39;t have many items to choose from in each section.bar tender was patient and checked in with us on whether or not we enjoyed our choices (we very much did!).we started out with signature cocktails and an appetizer with ricotta &amp; rhubarb compote with sourdough.none of those options were going to help because obviously i was celebrating that special occassion that night, not any other night.i went once for brunch and i really enjoyed the challah french toast and the sunny side up frittata.the service was eh.i wish it never ended.wow!!!!

if i ever go back i&#39;d get a bunch of onion rings and a spiked shake ;)burger was delicious but i didn&#39;t like the fact that they charged me for bbq and it only had a drop of it.you could be a jabroni and go with one of the pre-selected burgers, but that would be the same as using the assisted rack in the gym.we came in forty-five minutes before closing and we were treated awesome by the staff.awesome hahawill be back again!.definitely more of a rowdy place with flat screen tvs everywhere, multiple round booths, and a bar in the middle.my friends had the sonoran hot dog and the grilled cheese with the tomato soup combo.impressively enough i could distinctively taste all of those flavor profiles, a very well crafted beverage.e.about an hour after leaving i started to get feverish and my stomach started hurting.somewhat hidden on the corner, 25 degrees knows how to cook a good burger.chilaquiles, breakfast quesadilla, and bottomless mimosas were excellent.great spot for a casual date or group dinner with friends.i was really pleasantly surprised at the delightful presentation of the colorful raw spring salad, which consisted of red and gold beets, parsnips, pears, radish, fennel, arugula, candied pecans, blue cheese crumbles, and champagne viniagrette.for dessert we got a spiked salted caramel shake (with a candle!).i&#39;d steer clear from the roasted brussels sprouts and cauliflower but the number one burger was tasty.will come back for brunch and also a milkshake!.however, i felt like the place isn&#39;t really sure of its identity.totally not wowed by our turkey burgers, they were a little dry and we had ordered with sauce and had to check 2x to see that there was actually some on them.unfortunately when we arrived the day of, we had to make shift and combine 4-5 oddly shaped tables by the window to make a giant table.this is a very fun place to grab a burger or specialty milk-shake and chill.plenty of tvs, good food and there was a $10 sparkling wine special when we got there.the cinnashake as the other yelp reviews said was amazingi came here after looking at the reviews.this place gets a 5!!!!  milk shakes are out of this world and the burgers are too.i will always be coming back!.it&#39;s chic pubby with excellent food (we tried some apps) and drink selection.try the bloody mary and the onion rings.we have about 15 people show up, and we took up all of the available space, tightly.this milkshake was sooo good, and i can&#39;t wait to come back and try another flavor of one of their milkshakes.we also got the sauteed cauliflower, which was pretty tasty and completely different from the nachos if you&#39;re looking to switch it up.great burger!  asked for medium rare and actually got medium rare.quite large portions so it&#39;s easy to share.my burger was pretty good.the champagne, however, is consistent and keeps us coming back lol..unfortunately, the same can not be said of their burgers..i would def come back and recommend this place for brunch, it is a mix of locals and tourists.probably one of the best burgers i ever had in my life.i tell the full story not to criticize them but to thank them for their good customer service and so others will know they are good to do business with.great atmosphere, amazing food and really good drink selection! i&#39;m really picky when it comes to burgers and i loved their burger (number 6) it was like a big mac but high quality..they were the perfect combo to have with the burger, especially after a stressful week.i went here on sunday evening with my wife and her friend based on the friend&#39;s rave about the spiked shakes.5 stars, but i&#39;ll bump them up since i&#39;ve been back a few times and i&#39;m sure i&#39;ll go back again.both burgers were delicious and cooked perfectly.will continue to go back for the drink special :).including drinks.we live nearby so came here numerous times already, they have great happy hour deal, burger taste good too( gage still the best burger so far) as well as their french fries.i opted for a number six, because it is essentially my standard loaded burger.it had been a while since i have been here but returning made me recall how much i dig this place.)--the fries were just ok; if they were on par with the burger this place would&#39;ve gotten 5 stars.the irish car bomb on the other hand, way too much alcohol, hard to drink.i&#39;d probably come back again for the lunch special, but the standard prices are a little steep especially considering the burgers don&#39;t come with fries.the kitchen cooked up a chorizo burger inside a quesadilla, it was that thick.nice location.i went with the number 2 and happy to learn the lunch special was any of the name burgers + fries + side for the menu price of the burger! that&#39;s a steal :)good burger but could have used a bit more melting on the cheesy but all around i&#39;d be back :)oh.kids enjoyed and so did we.i also got sweet potato fries, which had garlic-parmesan-salty taste to them.ever the fierce advocate for our culinary experience, our served named thaise brought a fried egg after realizing the omission.the music was all hip-hop tunes, the vibe was relaxed and lets just say the food was amazing..it&#39;s like you&#39;re just trying to pad your own wallet by increasing our bill, which is in my opinion, not super cool.thanks to yelp, we found this place.it might be nice for dinner or drinks at night but i came looking for a fun saturday brunch spot and i got cheap booze so i can&#39;t complain.pretty disappointed in this place mainly for their very very short brunch menu with limited options.3.really good, really alcoholic.the food is good but the service is slow.in short, we had an absolute blast! we rank it as one of the best burgers in the city (and we are both burger fans and have tried many).next time we&#39;re in the windy city, it doesn&#39;t matter where we are staying, we&#39;ll dine at 25 degrees."

their sweet potato fries were pretty tasty as well.the nashville chicken was a buttermilk boneless fried chicken patty with pickles and to sauce.i dropped in for a late lunch.the price point is shocking (it&#39;s worth so much more), food is sublime and the story of the people beyond compare..there aren&#39;t a huge variety of vegetarian options for lunch but the options they do have are creative and superb.even if they did nothing else, i&#39;d consider them a charity, but they run food-service job-training programs for people in poverty to get them jobs.the frog legs we&#39;re burnt and the gumbo broth had a clear , chicken stock consistency and was extremely bland.sort of as a rule.all in all, it is acceptable spot to eat before visiting the plants around the corner.the food was magnificent.so much flavor with savory, cheesy goodness.we work in a heavy industrial workplace and our language can be quite colorful at times.the staff also very friendly and helpful, and they did a great job accommodating us during speeches and with our byob drinks.uninspired.btw everything is honestly delicious.for the first course, i had a spiced arugula salad.considering when we went, they only had a few tables, but the buffet was fresh.the pretzel roll was.this place serves up gourmet food at a fraction of the price you would pay anywhere else.the flavors and texture of the chicken and waffles made for a delicious combo.i have been back 3 times already.tried the pot stickers they where making for a outing and they where great..much to my southern mother&#39;s dismay, my sister said that the shrimp and grits was the best she&#39;d ever had.i thought the service was great and more friendly than any restaurant i&#39;ve been to lately.this place and their mission deserve it.everything was very tastey - the salad had yummy peaches (ripe and flavorful), the quinoa patties were nicely seasoned, the mac and cheese was not too heavy, and the salmon was nicely cooked.and again.i will be back, i love this neighborhood and the conservatory.chicken and waffles are my favorite.i don&#39;t want to write a super long review, so if you are curious about how the restaurant and the food looks like, read my blog post:vietnamesefoodie.the gravy and eggs were layered through the biscuit, resulting in a soggy, albeit yummy, biscuit.)i could seriously have made an entire meal out of those three items, they were fantastic (especially the brussels sprouts!)wow, the spellcheck just made me realize for the first time that brussels has an &#39;s&#39; at the end.summary: go here for amazing food, staff, and to support a great cause!details:i organized a 9 person private dinner here and had an incredible experience..service is great.very affordable catering experience for a good cause.it doesn&#39;t get any better than that! my friend enjoyed her crawfish omelette.ended up asking for more bread and totally wiped the dish clean!the shrimp and grits is polenta style grits which was the first time i&#39;ve had it.there is nothing bad about this place at all.my group and i came here because we doing community assessments for a class and heard about the great community work inspiration kitchens are doing in east garfield park.this is our favorite breakfast spot in chicago.deeeelicious!! i can&#39;t wait to go back!  the crispy brussels sprouts are the best i&#39;ve ever had, but i&#39;d order everything we had again; goat cheese brulee, friend chicken sandwich, pickles, and red velvet brulee.we walked over-it was about 2:00 on a saturday afternoon and we just wanted something nice.it was very obvious they were not prepared to serve us at 8:45.opened my eyes into giving them another chance and i&#39;m glad i did!  they are just what the community needs and should be a shining example for all of us who hope to inspire others.i expected a casual cafe, which it is.shame on inspiration kitchen for allowing this person to be the face of the business and treat their customers this way.if you happen to be at the garfield conservatory, this place is worth checking out!  you&#39;ll get great food and will be helping the community.our second visit, the first was a fundraising brunch which was an extravaganza of delights.order the shrimp and grits and u will be a happy camper.i have had the carmel pancakes and today i did the lemon zest with a chantilly cream  and i think i blacked out at the table from pure joy.it&#39;s been a while since i was here but i still think about their fried green tomatoes.ann and ayesha provided phenomenal service and are doing fantastic work for the community with every meal they serve.i couldn&#39;t get over how much i loved the experience and the food here..although i am a lolcat, and therefore questionably adherent to religion which may not offer heaven for cats, i expect to return with ritualistic frequency.can&#39;t wait to come back.portions were hearty and everything tasted delicious!  i had the crab benedict on homemade english muffins- crab cake was very good with very little fillers and the homemade english muffin was something of a crunchy biscuit (so good!!).the apple crisp with sourgam ice cream was small but substantial to be shared by 3 people.everything was ah-mazing.truly one of the best lunches i have ever had for the price! everything was incredibly flavorful, very very fresh, and i loved a everything that i tasted.we had the daily pancake.we had macaroni and cheese as an appetizer, and it was really cheesy and soft.the concept is wonderful as well as the food.this restaurant is not just a place to eat it&#39;s an organization that trains people that are or near homelessness.it.great food.peach pancakes were told to be nothing less than &#34;really good&#34; by everyone that tried (sadly, i missed out).what i remember most is the cucumber lemonade my boyfriend drank also that the proceeds help the people in the neighborhood is an excellent way to spend your money! we went for breakfast and were overwhelmed by the quality of the ingredients,  the level of freshness, as well as the customer service! we will be back again and tell our friends about it as well!.omg.looking for place to host an event (bridal shower, birthday party, etc)? this is it..great well prepared, creative food served by cheerful waitresses."
smack-shack-chicago-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/smack-shack-chicago-chicago,2,"It was runny and not flavorful, very bland in general.oysters were fresh and delicious, well cleaned and shucked.all the food and cocktails are amazing.the only negative would be the beignets - kinda the consistency of a day old bagel with  powered sugar...our server was so friendly and nice.really liked the key lime pie, you can tell it had real limes in it.what i am appalled at is their byob practice.we came here for father&#39;s day and we loved it! the food is absolutely delicious.they are on to something here.very open, second floor seating up top, and elongated bar.left with a full belly and a desire to come back again soon.wonderful staff w trendy industrial look we were invited right in.i saw recent review of seafood restaurants that rates this place at or near top, clearly inside resting, this place is not special and way overpriced for food and atmosphere..the bartender, bj, was a wonderful host!  can&#39;t wait to go back and try brunch..i wasn&#39;t sure what to think considering my boyfriend doesn&#39;t eat seafood, and we didn&#39;t look at the menu prior to see if they offered any other land meat.we had an excellent experience this evening at smack shack!  it was our 2nd time here and this time we brought our son.lobster rolls were packed full of lobster and i&#39;m not talking little pieces! we also had the lobster boil which is very difficult to find in chicago.this place is cute &amp; huge, like seriously huge not sure how they will keep it full.so, the food and service were all good.huge chunks of lobster claw, perfectly buttered roll.the four start rating is based on price and limited menu.the cucumber and tarragon really make it different.i&#39;m very impressed with this concept.the service for a slow empty sunday was moving like molassase so i wonder how good they are during the rush of the week and prime weekend time.later on, when i tried to get her attention for water or clean utensils, she ignored me and was acting busy helping other table..i look forward to going again.last few times it was a game of &#39;find the lobster&#39;.our last dish was the juicy lucy.i would recommend everything we had.go for brunch! you won&#39;t regret it!..- oysters had tons of shells in it.lobster bisque was good and had multiple prices of lobster in it.the shrimp boil wasn&#39;t worth it..i always grade on ambiance, food, and most important the service.will definitely be back!.i think this is a unique addition to the chicago food scene - nothing else like it.had the king crab dip (the bread it comes with is absolutely amazing) and the deviled eggs which i liked because there wasn&#39;t too much mayo.cool view into the kitchen and the tub of lobsters.sea bass ceviche was okay, a tad salty.they kept bringing more and more crab non stop.impressed by the customer service, decor &amp; design, great atmosphere and cocktails !!!.overall we enjoy our experience here and would recommend others to try this place..that is what i was told.i went with my family of 7 on mother&#39;s day, spent over $300 and it was not worth it.enjoy.share a lobster as an appetizer and then dive into one of the po&#39; boys.on the original style lobster roll, low quality lobster dregs are chopped to shreds and mixed with a too-salty reddish(?) mayo that is overpowered by tarragon.our server was attentive and did a great job.cocktails were delicious!! east coast oysters were great, the lobster bisque had huge chunks of lobster and they do not short change you on lobster on the rolls! the only reason they don&#39;t get 5 stars is because i wasn&#39;t able to try the desserts.compared to other places where i always get the mussels, the flesh is plump and juicy.we live in the west loop and decided to try smack shack out.pretty solid deal and we probably saved money versus swift that night.food good.kept in a tank on site and cooked in a huge old bay spiced vat along with potatos, corn and sausage.there is a competing restaurant just blocks away with similar style food but many times better and for half the price..the staff was friendly and knowledgable about the menu, the restaurant, and drink specials.checked this place out on a sunday afternoon and it was pretty slow.one month later i stopped in for a cocktail.towards the back there was and omelet bar and eggs benedict bar.we started with drinks at the bar.m."

au-cheval-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/au-cheval-chicago,1,"So just do it: skip ahead and look at the pic of my foie gras &amp; scrambled eggs.the cobb salad comes with bacon and was satisfying but it was probably the least healthy salad i&#39;ve had in awhile.maybe it was the ambiance.we also got the fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli, &amp; fried farm egg on top ($10) which were ok, nothing too special about them.although, i&#39;ve said this the last three visits.two large thick cuts of glorious bacon.they worked well together for sure.it comes out open face.there is plenty of other stuff on the menu here that is worth trying.super rich.swivel your eyes away from the other menu items (i considered breaking with tradition for the chilaquiles, but they are available only after midnight, or the chicken wings, but i came to my senses) and order the single cheeseburger with bacon and over easy egg.this is by far the best.also, while the restaurant is open and you can be seated and order drinks, the kitchen is closed from 3-5 to prep for dinner.man, i was wrong..according to an article from chicago eater, the type of cheese au cheval uses on their burgers are luxurious slices of.we had a tremendously hungry family date last friday and put in our names at 5-ish pm.it&#39;s basically glorified nachos, but glorified to the absolute highest level.we waited 45 minutes solid for 2 first come first served bar spots.the burger was the best thing i ate while in chicago - and maybe even one of the best things i&#39;ve ever eaten.the burger was good but the bacon was to thick.amazing! great setting and the cheeseburger/bacon combo is unforgettable.like others who have reviewed on here and said they&#39;re not a burger person but loves the burgers here.the wait was about an hour and a half, but it was soooo worth it !.the music plays on the louder side so you might not be able to have the most engaging conversation.foods good would def recommend the english breakfast.that being said, i don&#39;t think i&#39;d wait 2 hours for this - we came right around 10:55am on a monday so we got in right away and luckily didn&#39;t need to wait, which was also pretty sweet.and if you&#39;re lucky enough to snag a booth (instead of sitting at the bar) you&#39;ll enjoy the seating and atmosphere..not au cheval.there&#39;s a reason why this place has long lines and why it&#39;s on multiple best burger lists.if you have made your way here then you know..that&#39;s what it tasted like.the fries with a side of garlic aioli sauce came out first and wow.split the fried bologna sandwich with people and it was so good.now i&#39;m not saying that this was a bad burger.and the side of bacon was out of this world!the thing i didn&#39;t like was the 1..the meat was juicy and flavorful.visited last thursday for the first time after all the hype about the burgers..burger was perfectly made, perfectly paired with everything inside, the amount of juice, fried egg, thick bacon, and nicely grilled buns makes a perfect combination.the burger was ordered medium and was nice and juicy.expensive? yes def..but on a more positive note the host did a fantastic job keeping people away from our table while they waited for their own.atmosphere 5/5service 6/5value - didn&#39;t care/ don&#39;t rmb but i don&#39;t think my wallet cried that day.we were there at 10:15 for sunday brunch, and were seated immediately..definitely coming back when i&#39;m back in chicago!.it was some sort of marmalade based sauce ( some sweetness).it&#39;s my favorite restaurant in the city.there is nothing in the world that could compare to this burger.go super early because the wait can get crazy.roasted bone marrow (+ beef cheek marmalade) - 5/5burger (+ bacon + egg) - 5/5fries (+ aioli) - 4/5overall, &#34;as good as it gets.some people think they have the best burger in town but i think the gage is still the no.if you go on a friday or the weekends, then show up even earlier as the wait can go up to 2-2.the burger was the best.but it is surely one of the best and i am looking forward to sinking my teeth into another one of their burger&#39;s very soon.the first day we went, we had just missed the brunch cutoff time and therefore did not get to dine there - our fault for showing up at an awkward time in the early afternoon.whatever.i was seated at the bar right next to the serving area, giving me a great view of the cooking area.i was in heaven..double is actually 3 4oz.my friends and i came here on a friday night around 11:30 pm thinking that the max we would have to wait is 10 min..once we got the notification to seat us, we walked right over and then were seated within 5 minutes.now that i knew the reasoning why i had to get out of bed, i was more than alright with it.i will be back next year because i can&#39;t stand waiting that long.au cheval is worth the wait! try a house cocktail or two while you do.we waited for 45 mins for a party of 5 on friday lunch.best burgers in town! delicious drinks and a cool atmosphere.it&#39;s pretty amazing..this was one of my few destination eateries.the wait was 1.now, the burger.i hate waiting, but just be patient, because this place is worth the wait.food network really focuses on the burger, and in my opinion it isn&#39;t really about the burger, it&#39;s the bacon! thick cut, smoky and juicy."
jupiter-outpost-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jupiter-outpost-cafe-chicago,1,"They do need some spice but great sandwiches! i also recommend the black cherry italian soda!.the staff was incredibly nice.great tunes..but sandwiches are awful! probably because of the new people working there (they used to be delicious before!) it takes too long and paying 7$ for panini you don&#39;t expect getting mostly a huge bread, and a small piece of pickle and meat.hate the chains.perfect coffee + incredible pie.free wi fi, friendly staff, great coffee drinks and food, comfortable place.i wish i knew her name! she wears glasses and a bandana, and she is beyond nice!the one negative is the smell..the staff is super friendly and there is free wifi! what else could you want in a coffee shop?!.as for a place to study, it&#39;s one of my favorites.they offer vietnamese coffee in addition to the usual lattes &amp; coffees, plus a small selection of baked goods [at least they aren&#39;t the boxed starbucks variety].umbria for expresso drinks.also, the sides of potato salad and pasta salad are really small.i&#39;ve been here a handful of times, and each has been very good.coffee (didn&#39;t knock my socks off, but it wasn&#39;t bad.i usually zone out to my ipod and read, but the music selection at this cafe is quite enjoyable as well.adorable hidden coffeehouse in the west loop..i was there for several hours on a saturday, and it was not at all crowded.it&#39;s a tiny little unassuming place, but it has great coffee and snappy service.jupiter outpost, why did i have to park 5 blocks away and walk over train tracks to get to you?! if you weren&#39;t such a pain in the butt to get to, i think i would spend an inappropriate amount of time sitting on your benches sipping on coffee.the market burrito was a delicious recommendation by the staff after they ran out of beets go on sandwich.i wouldn&#39;t normally care about such things, but when you&#39;re using your laptop for multiple hours at a time, you develop some cramps because of the height-awkwardness.oh but the caffeinating experience is not so good, the brewed coffee is mediocre to sub-par.we left smelling like a grill, it gets too stuffy in there.it&#39;s also slightly pricey for what it is, a sandwich shack with two lunch ladies in the back.not here...i&#39;ve gotten better food and coffee in nicer areas, at a cheaper price.nice change from starbucks.free wifi and great espresso (they recently got a manual machine).it was served in a plastic cup with a straw.nothing amazing but solid coffee! the space is a hybrid deli/coffeeshop serving as a nice alternative to the otherwise impressive restaurant row on fulton market and randolph street.i might need to re-think this jupiter outpost thing.the coffee is good, the sandwich was surprisingly high quality deli-style, not your usual coffee shop wilted lettuce sandwich...we just tried this cafe for lunch and we&#39;re pleased that it&#39;s in the area.i&#39;d love to try some of the menu, like the venus reprise, panani [mozz, tomato, and basil on flat bread..next time i&#39;ll get it on a bagel.sometimes not even close.the full front opens out to admit a nice summer breeze, and the high ceilings give the room the optimism of a reason to look up and around.be sure to wave at bebe on your way out--she deserves it.this is one of my factories coffee shops in the city.this is not the case.i say that in the best, most exciting way..this place would definately qualify for the movie empire records.i&#39;ve been coming here for a few years now and it is one of my favorite coffee shops.at first i liked jupiter because it&#39;s simply the only coffee shop in a somewhat desolate part of the meat packing district near my work..but twice i&#39;ve been disappointed by the lack of flavor in my sandwiches - so much so i had to trek home, defrost one of the uptown banh mis in my fridge and eat it right away to make up for things..overall, it&#39;s a great local neighborhood coffee shop!.i love this place.i mean, it&#39;s downstairs from an art gallery - the coolness factor is there.wish they made some changes to make it cosier.the staff are polite and the ambiance is really enjoyable.the inside is as chicago as it gets with hardwood floors and exposed brick.i am almost afraid to post this on yelp because it will become my go to spot for studying.love this place! great atmosphere, great menu and incredible coffee.and the thimble full of the side they give you is irritating."

labriola-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/labriola-chicago,1,"My hubby got the spaghetti and meat balls which was amazing.their gelato will leave you wanting more.for a dish so prominently featured on the menu, i wouldn&#39;t expect something so outdated and unpalatable..just off michigan ave , this place is a great stop for a quick drink or bite to eat.italian is a tough racket in chicago, and the food is good but not amazing.you cannot go wrong eating at this establishment.the food was so bad! the scramble was like food for a mouse and the english muffin was from costco and not even toasted..the service was pleasant and very helpful about drink choices, etc.the cafe is a great spot for lunch or groups because you order at the register, pay and they bring the food to your table.omg i loved it here!the little time that we were here we ordered a simple pepperoni pizza and a glass of cabernet wine and it was just perfect.overall, great restaurant with awesome food!.&#34;well, if you want these experiences, this is where you want to go..it is a white sauce consisting of papperdelle pasta, sausage, broccoli and oil and garlic.the usual pasta dishes are on offer, but we concentrated on appetizers, and loved everything we tried, particularly the zucchini blossoms, which were very lightly fried and stuffed with a creamy smoked mozzarella that was delicious.the food was great but i&#39;m only giving 3 stars due to poor service.for $18 for a sandwich and coffee is it wrong to expect better ?.i love eating at labriola on a warm/hot day! they have two separate seating sections - one for the cafe, and one for the restaurant.great italian food and wine.i personally liked the plain glaze best.i also loved the wine selections- the pinot noir was great.from the moment we walked into the restaurant we experienced nothing, but great service..we ordered the pepperoni pizza..very inviting, good food and good service! i had the cinnamon pretzel donut from the bakery, yum! and a great mimosa too.but if it&#39;s labriola bread, i&#39;m totally interested!time will tell if these delivery services actually deliver.have gotten some salads, pastas, and sandwiches from the café and generally have enjoyed all the food, though nothing has blown me away.ferrari carano chardoney.absolutely delicious - handmade pasta, everything we had was fantastic.the cafe is warm and welcoming and the staff is very friendly.avoid this restaurant.visited labriola for a pre-opening dinner as well as lunch the next day.also, food took forever.when it arrived, i told the woman who delivered it that is was very late.however the sauce is what knocked this down yo just three stars.the lasagna was delicious, but i do wish it had more tomato sauce.had the minestrone soup, pucatino and the garganelli.i didn&#39;t get to order the next course, couldn&#39;t find my server.would definitely go back! staff is friendly and attentive.sunday mornings in the cafe are my favorite! it was so relaxing and cozy..chicken could have been more moist and the sauce butteryoverall a great dining experience near the hectic touristy area.came here with my boyfriend to try out some deep dish pizza while in town for the weekend..the host and hostess were wonderful and moved our table when we expressed the area was a little too warm.i will say that it appeared from the way people polished off thier plates that they did a better job with pasta dishes than pizza, but appearances can be deceiving.i really appreciated the two ramekins of sauce so i had my own for dipping."

next time i come to chicago i&#39;m definitely coming back!.went to u.on our recent visit to chicago we had to try a chicago dog and we went with u.my bread was broken, in other words: split on the bottom.very nice staff and a solid chicago dog namesake.service was fast and very friendly.there&#39;s a 2 dog special here, where you can upgrade your hot dogs to any of the hot dogs on the menu if you pay the difference.we walked here because we were out of town and didn&#39;t know where to go.the owners so friendly..love love love this place.and the food is fantastic!

the staff is super friendly and hardworking.so yeah in my ongoing search for a decently satisfying meal for under $5, the double chicago dog here is pretty solid and filling..definitely have to try this place out if you are in chicago!!!!.the dipping sauce was a little salty but i loved the slight zing it had to it!..the only shortcomings i felt were the small seating area and rather abrupt service.my go to spot for burgers in the loop.since i don&#39;t like traditional hot dogs, i got the maxwell polish and the boyfriend got the two dog special -- one joey and one chicago dog.it is not often you can have a solid meal in the loop for less than $10, but here you can.ltimate b..by far, the best hot dog i&#39;ve had.coworkers mentioned going here in the past so it was time for a walk.nothing close compares :(.if you like spice, get a joey dog it&#39;s killer!

takito-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/takito-kitchen-chicago,1,"The pork belly was cooked perfectly and served on a homemade sesame tortilla.you may be full and have to pass dessert- i understand.they come in a clay pot.when we reminded them of our reservation they thought we were walk ins and seated us shoulder to shoulder at a communal table.everything i&#39;ve tried.they certainly don&#39;t skimp on filling, or flavor.everything was timely and prompt about our service..a minute later comes back to ask me which type of tacos i ordered.this model would be so much betteroverall the food is good and i will return.your standard guac and chips..my only beef was that we had made a reservation and we still had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, with no real apology or explanation.so we got seated rather quickly.to me, puree&#39;ing avocados makes it taste very similar to packaged guac which is usually homogenized with maybe a hint of cilantro.i really liked the coconut custard that was on the fish tacos, and the lamb chorizo tacos were better than i was expecting, since i normally don&#39;t go for chorizo.i&#39;ve eaten for this price point many times and been thoroughly disappointed, but not this time.our server was super friendly and attentive making sure things were filled/removed when needed and checked in with us a number of times.some of the best tacos ever and the salsas are delicious.i&#39;ve been to takito twice now, once for dinner and once for lunch.a little dab will do you.also had the seasonal salsa which was excellent.(i hope this doesn&#39;t encourage people to give false bad reviews though -- that would be super uncool.on drinks- on thursdays they have a tequila night, which is like an entree + two shots of tequila deal.salad was a little bit over dressed, but at least they had lots of pieces of hearts of palm--i appreciated that! the salsas were good too, unique flavors.no employee at the door and no visible bar seating left me awkwardly standing around the host stand.awesome.would def consider coming here often in the summertime!.i did not enjoy this place and actually got sick afterwards.service was great at the beginning, but declined as the meal went on.but the food--the food was amazing! chicken and fish tacos both had appealing flavors and heat including coconut and crunchy-cool cabbage and hibiscus corn tortillas..i think the lamb and the crispy fish tacos are two standouts.we ordered the fried chicken and grilled goat cheese tacos to share.the pork tacos were ok, but i didn&#39;t like the cheese tacos (and i am someone who loves any type of cheese)..&#34; she sneered and in a patronizing voice said &#34;sorryyyyy! maybe you should talk with your friends!&#34; uh, what!?girl, you can hate people being on their phones as much as you want, but being in the customer service industry, you can&#39;t give people judgmental feedback about how they behave with their friends.the shrimp was served whole, so it made it slightly difficult to apportion the shrimp to chip ratio appropriately.better than big star&#39;s fish taco..i got the brunkow cheese tacos, and my boyfriend got pork belly tacos.our waitress was pretty friendly and was urging us to try it so we did and were not disappointed.when we ordered, she asked if we would like &#34;big&#34; ones, which were listed as $20 on the menu.it&#39;s got a fun, colorful atmosphere, but also comfortable and a bit upscale.we came on a tuesday night where there&#39;s not a lot of people, the restaurant is not too busy and the restaurant has a tuesday special for tacosthe service is good, the waiter would check back on us to make sure we are enjoying everythingthe food is presented nicely, the flavour is good but not memorable.the kitchen is visible from most areas of the dining room, which is how i learned that they make their tortillas fresh from dough right before your eyes! and you can definitely taste that freshness in each bite!i tried the combo of three salsa, which were all tasty with my favorite being the delicious ghost pepper salsa.fish and lamb tacos were amazing!.outdoor seating area also.this restaurant is fighting a tough uphill battle, as a mexican food joint we have been preconditioned to expect lesser quality ingredients at cheap prices.the salsas were flavorful though definitely not chunky.really enjoyed this place.loved the ambiance and loved the open bar area and kitchen concept..we are this before heading to a festival and then didn&#39;t even end up eating anything at the festival.the hibiscus agua fresca was really refreshing and not florally at all.a unique twist on them was the peas.2) food is delicious as well.we order the chicken and lamb tacos to split.everyone i was with agreed it was better than big star.we tried crispy fish and lamb chorizo.it was so good.additionally our waiter was a fixture at our table and never left us wanting for anything.the pork belly was delicious but pretty fatty so couldn&#39;t do more than one.great staff, service and atmosphere for happy hour or dinner!.we couldn&#39;t be more satisfied! it is not that they are better than bigstar, but the fusion style makes the tacos so exotic and tasty.wonderful drinks and tacos.i definitely plan to come back and will add a side dish!.i went here for the first time tonight with a big party for my cousin&#39;s birthday.the three sister polenta was very tasty."

they have some other exciting menu options that i would love to try if i have the chance to come here again.strong cocktails.the reason this is not a 5 star review is some of the new staff, the guy behind the bar didn&#39;t seem to know our order and just poured beers and it was clear he didn&#39;t care very much when hearing him yell at a another waitress that his job here was to &#34;get people drunk&#34; not process the correct order.the menu is fairly straightfoward and easy to navigate.please use your normal, delicious, hand cut fries, dmk gods!the prices are super reasonable for river north, and the atmosphere is low key and relaxed.the gin fizz was very delicious, and had a nice creamy texture and the milk was a great twist.some folks were just hanging out at tables or standing around tables like you would at a club.it&#39;s kind of hipster, or at least as close to it as you can get in river north.we even had a group a five and the waitress proactively split the check and memorized our multiple orders throughout the night; going above and beyond!.being owned by dmk i expected their sliders to be better.the finger food is excellent and the drinks are awesome.really cool bar! i love the secret room they have downstairs with the games and a dance floor that is really cool!! the upstairs is good for watching sports.although the sizes are small (burgers are little more than typical sliders size), what you get are little gourmet delights.we ended up sitting at the bar and couldn&#39;t stop laughing because they had some 70s porno playing on the tvs.drinks are affordable, food is great.left a great impression of the city and all it has to offer.decent, nothing special.there is a photo booth.this is the most amazing jalapeño infused tequila and watermelon drink! yes, watermelon and jalapeño sounds like a strange combination, but go there and try it and then tell me it doesn&#39;t work! damn, it&#39;s good!the music can be loud so make sure you&#39;re sitting close to those you plan to talk to..everything was great!burger- patty was big for a slider and cooked well.yvonne also tried a phosphene dream and i had another candy says.also the cute bartender working down stairs :-dthe food was great i orded like three different sliders and some drinks and they were made with such perfection omg.henry&#39;s swing club is an incredibly special place in river north.holy shit,  this place is fun!first of all.really friendly staff and our server lauren was incredible! she even sent a complimentary make your own s&#39;mores to our table.i remember my friends talking to me about this mysterious alcohol called malört, but i had no idea what it was.music was great.happy hour menu price for the beverages are very reasonable.perfect for a girls night out to dance, date night, casual cocktails, group of friends.again i don&#39;t get it with the loud music.we were the only people there promptly at 3:30 but whatever.the pool table is awkwardly placed....not sure why they&#39;d allow intoxicated people an open flame beats me, but it worked and was fun!for a saturday night, it was slower, being it was slower, service should have been prompter.good aftertaste hit of spice.i was trying to get some carbs into my buddy! we ended up with the chicken tamale of the day, tuna melt slider, and the big pretzel..place is great, good prices, all their sliders were super tastythey didn&#39;t have balls (booo), but they did have gizzards which were tasty enough.i will be back to visit the basement area next time.the pool table in the main area adds for a non-typical river north atmosphere.music was extremely loud but i guess nobody goes there to chat.the bar was doing a 90&#39;s themed night, i believe, so that was fun.we ordered one of the burgers and one of the chicken sliders and they were large and delicious.good music, wasn&#39;t too loud.the oyster slider with arugula was good and the pulled pork was okay too.our waitress was really sweet and made the best out of the situation.the prices are unbeatable.and as it turns out, tall lanky drunk glasses guy stumbled all over them too..someone called me from the place the day of to make sure we were coming.sliders, music, craft cocktails, and a pool table.we had much fun and look forward to found back soon!.if you&#39;re feeling crazy you can also make s&#39;mores at your table or get paid to eat some duck balls (better than you think, but you could probably fry and bread anything and make it taste acceptable)..the cheese is so velvety.."
ninis-deli-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ninis-deli-chicago,1,"On top of that, the food was delicious.great food, great service..don&#39;t remember the guy&#39;s name but never met someone so excited about cuban sandwiches and his family owned deli.lastly, juan(and family) are genuine people who care about the customers.they&#39;re the best!.couldn&#39;t have asked for a better spot to grab lunch.elvis would be shaking his hips all day long if he ate here.juan is a pleasure to speak with and the food is on point!.i looked around me for a decently priced food place and saw this place and oh man, this cuban steak sandwich is so good.after reading some of the other comments, i now realize why everyone not only loves juan!!!.i love this place.small little place a bit off the beatin path but it did not take away from the experience! fairly priced for what you get out, and super friendly people working.love the atmosphere, the quality of the food, and the warmth of the family that runs this establishment.the food here is like a congenial and fantabulous urbanized type of cuban/caribbean food and i highly recommend everything on the menu!in no particular order i love just about everything on the menu from the hibiscus lemonade: tastes like a 1/2 &amp; 1/2 lemonade/teato the chicken stuffed empanadas: similar to jamaican beef patties except they&#39;re stuffed with tasty pulled chicken inside (and ask for the green sauce on the side to dip your empanadas in)to the cuban sandwiches: i highly recommend the media noche it comes with grilled turkey, pickles, mustard, swiss cheese and fried plantainsand for a great desert try the churros: they&#39;re tossed in cinnamon and powered sugar and made just right.the minute you walk in juan greets you like an old friend.5/5.looking forward to going back to try the cafe con leche and churros.it&#39;s well worth the trip :).everything is made to order and you can taste the freshness in every bite.the flavors in this one blended quite well.i cant wait to go back and take all my friends there!.well done!..i had the chicken empanada which was freshly made and delicious, especially accompanied with the hot sauce that it came out with.he even gave me a free dish of churros!el cubanito | no words can describe this delicate but savory sandwich, i can only try.the dining area was a little drafty.great guy at the register/taking orders! i got the chicken empanada and cafe con leche and tried a bite of the media noche, hibiscus lemonade, and churros...i could cry right now just thinking of how nice this man is.unfortunately, a little too popular, since by 2 o clock, they ran out of all their sandwiches.churro was fresh delish and cooked to order!  two thumbs up ;).so since my last review, i have unfortunately moved out of the neighborhood and they have downsized their menu, so my kitchen sink sandwich recommendation is no longer valid..its seductively sweet, but will leave you with an upset stomach.we told them we hadn&#39;t, and my hubby mentioned he&#39;s a vegetarian..also, everyone that works there (especially the guy who took our order and is the son of the owners) is soooo nice and friendly! we will definitely be back.if you&#39;re in chicago i would highly recommend taking an uber and checking this place out..if you aren&#39;t in the neighborhood get to noble square immediately.definitely hit the spot!.we also ordered the habiscus lemonade($3) just so we could remain true to the hipster mandate of drinking using mason jars.and rightfully so, it&#39;s fantastic.great neighborhood sandwich shop!.there was a long line and the guy at the register still took the time to tell me a little bit about the place and how it is family owned.i tried the veggie (spinach &amp; cheese) and the chicken ( pulled chicken seasoned well ).it&#39;s very affordable and definitely a bang for your buck.truly love their job.nini&#39;s deli is a pokéstop.find your eden.the dining room has several tables, booths and a counter along the front window.i only wish that they had more locations!.from the colorful, vibrant design of the interior to the food and drinks that they serve to the wonderful and friendly service that they have, nini&#39;s definitely knows how to make you feel right at home and welcomed along with giving you the best food possible.i definitely recommend and will be back for more!!.i loved the mix of the plantain and the avocado and the rest of the flavors in the sandwhich.i had the media noche and hibiscus lemonade..we also got the hibiscus lemonade, and juan was kind enough to hook me up with a free lemonade because it was my first time!the food and drinks were amazing.on my visit, i had a sandwich: pulled beef sliders using plantains as buns, churros with scratch made guava syrup, mixed hibiscus lemonade, and coffee! they are all awesome.they also offers it in a wrap for us bread intake conscious people! of course, you cannot leave without trying their signature hibiscus lemonade.which brings me to my next point: nini&#39;s has such a welcoming atmosphere!i can&#39;t wait to come back and try everything on the menu (insider tip- it&#39;s halal) with my friends!...from the very friendly owner taking orders to the very tasty food, it was a great experience.their version of the cubanito (add turkey and avocado) is amazing.of their creations, i was able to have their empanadas, their cubanito sandwich, and their churros.my personal favorite is the media noche sandwich! if you haven&#39;t stopped here, you should.my boyfriend eats meat, and he often gets the steak sandwich and i hear it&#39;s bomb and the best thing on the menu..juan behind the counter is really cool..let me tell you those chicken empanadas are another level!!! i have also tried all their desserts and they are all awesome! plus everything is super affordable and that&#39;s always nice.writing this review is making me crave some more! do yourself a favor, go to nini&#39;s deli!!!!.delicious.i can&#39;t wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.great coffee, which is always really important..i really enjoy nini&#39;s because the ambience was really casual but cozy, the food is unique, and the customer service is the best i&#39;ve received.the sandwich was pretty good, nothing striking for me in the flavor department.it did.seriously just being around such a positive attitude and the neighborhood feels is worth the trip!i&#39;ll definitely be back nini&#39;s! your amazing food is calling my name!.to top off your meal, you have got to order the besitos de cuba! homemade tortilla chips, homemade guava sauce, and powdered sugar! i&#39;ll leave it right there - amaaazzinnggggg!i know this sounds like a ton of food, but when you&#39;re surrounded by great people and and a welcoming atmosphere, you&#39;re not going to want to stop :)you should definitely check out nini&#39;s whenever you have a chance.also had churro&#39;s and this fried pastry dough with sugar n it was very good...."
farmhouse-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/farmhouse-chicago-3,1,"This is important to note because i think when the kitchen takes a long time, sometimes things sit under heat lamps, which does horrible things to eggs.great farm-to-table tavern feel with a seasonally changing menu..yumm! also, the cookie sandwich had a cookies n&#39; cream themed ice cream and the sandwich had a outter coating of melted chocolate which elevated the sandwich to the next level.cheese curds..great place for small groups of 3-4 based on the area downstairs.we ordered an appetizer of cheese curds which were absolutely delicious, but my main meal of grilled cheese had too much bread..this is not a good date place (unless you&#39;re attracted to tight spaces and high decibel levels in a downbeat stylized farmhouse setting), but it is a great place to untie the tie and loosen the shoe buckles (or straps) with friends and/or colleagues.great place to experience farm to table, i was there for restaurant week and tried the sausages, pork loin and apple dessert.oh how you tease.the fish was served whole, but de-boned for easy eating, stuffed with lemon and fresh herbs.it&#39;s a fun comfortable environment and i will surely return!.it&#39;s sweet and creamy with a touch of salt and roasted black walnut pieces.i came to farmhouse on a friday night at about 7 pm without a reservation.very soon..i ate my meal half-heartedly.my boyfriend and i checked this place out after it had been recommended by a family member of mine, one who has lived in the downtown area for years and has exceptional taste when it comes to dining out..i ordered the whole trout, and it was so good! the citrus flavors really boosted it.not 10 minutes later, a party of 5 with two small screaming children were sat down two tables down from us..not many options for vegetarians but two times i found (veg mushroom burger and grilled cheese) are amazing.vegetables were good.the cream soda was really nice.the service, spot on,  the decor,  amazing..curds and beer.our waitress was quite rude &amp; not very attentive, especially for the small size of the restaurant.tucked away on chicago, this is in a bit of a restaurant wasteland, but the fact that they take brunch reservations is a novelty in a city of long brunch lines.not much flavor in any of the other dishes as a few other yelpers noted.there were bf delays in getting drink orders filled and we often felt ignored.congrats to farmhouse on their 5-year anniversary!  i went to brunch today with my wife and 2 kids, and they clearly haven&#39;t lost a step..overall good/great but nothing stuck out to me other than the cheese curds.dinner: we split the amish friend chicken, it was very good and more than enough to share.really can&#39;t figure out why 800+ people gave this place a four-star rating on average, because the four of us at brunch today could not figure out what this place does well..the server was friendly and most of the food was pretty good.here they put in dill, because that&#39;s all i tasted..this is not an overstatement.i am writing this just after leaving and my stomach is already not feeling the greatest.we will be back for sure.i ordered the farmhouse burger and my dates ordered the fish and chips, amish chicken and the trout.i also returned for brunch (ok i confess, i just wanted to eat the cheese curds again) which i thought was also about a 3.my sandwich was pretty good, but it literally came with three whole potatoes, which i found excessive.but the fries and ketchup.good service!.i should also note the beer list is solid.his lamb chop was so good and juicy i wish i ordered it.got the burger for lunch.overall, i don&#39;t go out of my way to eat here, but am always happy if we stop in for a drink.i has the double thick pork chop..the curds are really fantastic, if you get what i&#39;m putting down.the staff is very friendly and services was fast.we started with a variety of appetizers..the smokes pork tenderloin is okay.i then ordered a grass fed burger which would turn out to be great but guess what? they lost our ticket for dinner.most of their liquors are local as well.expectations fell short here.it had a tasty sweet bite from the reduction..i stopped by for lunch mid-week, mainly because the name of this place caught my eye.prices were very reasonable! another side note: parking was in abundance, which was an added bonus.."
sinha-elegant-cuisine-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sinha-elegant-cuisine-chicago,1,"There is a spread of food in between the kitchen and the dining room.sinha is the classic example of where yelp is a great tool; without it, i would have driven up to the house on adams where sinha is based and taken one look and bugged out.then you are led downstairs for about 5 tables, where you may be sitting next to a potential new friend.but after the initial meeting, and after e-mailing and calling a couple times, we never heard back from her.although i was a little skeptical of outdoor presence/neighborhood, i was blown away by the service, food and warm feeling of eating at your grandma&#39;s house    the food was amazing, and the music playing in the background made me feel like i was on vacation in brazil..awesome!  great food, great atmosphere and ambiance.there was another yuca dish which had golden raisins and was crispy.as a born and raised brazilian, i am a huge sweet lover.i love this place and its my new addition :).we&#39;ll i understand that&#39;s it&#39;s not easy to operate a restauran but you restaurant is suck.the whole &#34;restaurant&#34; is actually located in a apartment building, and you sit at tables set up in the living room area and outside in the yard, so at first this seemed really sketchy, but then the food came out and it was totally worth it.visited for the first time and was so pleased! wonderful food with amazing and friendly service.brazilian fish stew, cod flavored with coriander.i was surprised to find the yelp reviews that were negative and only dealt, with brunch.still, eating here somehow feels like this is how being a guest in a brazilian home would feel like.never a fan of flan until today.yet another remote eating experience from fooda because they made arrangements with sinha to setup in the lobby of our apt building to serve people as they came home from work one evening.the steak is average - cooked properly but something you can find anywhere.her food was just excellent.the bf and i came here for sunday brunch and stuffed ourselves full of great brazillian food.the steak was served with delicious yukon potatoes.plus the groupon deal makes it a steal!..we could not stop eating and looking back i wish i ate more..it feels as if you&#39;re visiting a relative for a meal.guess what the prize was? lunch for two at sinha..just went here yesterday with my bff and had to write a review cuz it was sooooooooo delicious! im still thinkin about the food today and wanna go back asap! there was a lot of foods to choose from and it was all so flavorfull!! i especially liked the steak, bacalao, lamb, chicken &amp; shrimp dish &amp; brazilian french toast.the sunday brunch began and we were asked to the lower level of the house where there is a professional-style kitchen and tables.period...the sunday 2pm brunch starts with you entering into a home with comfortable sofas where the host offers you tea.ok, so the food..this is a good restaurant for you if you like mingling with strangers and want to get to know people.i move here 4 months ago and this is the place that i go when i miss home, mom&#39;s food lol whatever..restaurant was communal and interesting.the food was amazing!!! i loved everything about this place from the owner, people who work their and most definitely the decor.we grabbed a few varieties of side dishes from the salad bar.the food was so good! there were so many dishes at the sunday brunch, i didn&#39;t even get to try them all.can&#39;t wait to go back!.the owner/chef walked me into the spacious backyard with more seatings.i love this restaurant it has a homey atmosphere but it&#39;s also very classy..i am not sure i would go back for seconds.i love sinha!!! i go for the sunday morning brunch with a groupon..world cup 2014.so much fun i didn&#39;t even protest ellen taking photos of me shaking my booty.each came with a fried plantain and perfectly sliced mango (to see what the plates look like, check out the pictures i&#39;ve uploaded!).we arrived at 2:20 and went to the front entrance and were confused to go up or down.lunch is just $12- unlimited salad, rice, and black beans (best black beans i&#39;ve had) along with a fantastic entree.if you haven&#39;t been here yet and want some authentic delicious food, hit up her brunch on the weekends for all you can eat!!.this was one of the most interesting and delicious brunch buffets i&#39;ve ever experienced.we sat the large dinner table, but since were basically only there we just had the entire table to ourselves.first, the locstion:  it takes a little trust to believe this small 2-flat houses a restaurant.had the chicken senapoli, which was excellent! you have to go here for lunch!.it can be nothing short of the elusive best of...i was amazed as i drove down adams street that this place actually existed as there is no signage or anything to indicate a place of business..i sat next to the kitchen.just prepare to walk it off.it is not high end in terms of presentation but it was exceptional in terms of taste and charm.then there was the black beans cooked brazilian style with shreds of pork.great and super tasty brazilian buffet lunch! best farofa and bobó de camarão i have had in months (if not years)! not to mention that having a real lunch on a weekday - and not quickly eat on your desk - is what everyone should try to do at least once a week..the shrimp was very flavorful and my bf liked his steak too..you are literally in the owners/chefs house, where you sit side-by-side with strangers at the same table."
ceres-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ceres-cafe-chicago,2,"A bit loud but with the amount of liquor  served that&#39;s not surprising.and frank is a great bartender! he let me try glenlivet vs johnny walker black and i ultimately changed my order to glenlivet at his suggestion.i&#39;ve been here quote a few times because our office is next door.the venue was packed on a friday as expected but we found a table rather quickly.apparently they close pretty early, probably to discourage blacking out on their clean tables &amp; chairs.you will automatically be the most popular guy in the office.no matter how long it is in between visits, he always recalls me.we stopped here for our last day of our chicago trip for breakfast.the staff was fast and friendly..the place to get drinks in the loop after work.even though you know the drinks are cheaper and stronger than everywhere else you will still get more buzzed than you expect.they are definitely well priced.drinks are very strong but that&#39;s what sets them apart.also, consider breakfast here the next morning after you have come for drinks the prior afternoon/evening, as the cuisine will fortify your stomach wall with a substantial layer of eggs and potatoes to stave off any potential nausea for the day ahead.and the one thing that brings people back time and again is the famous fish sandwich..just be prepared when ordering! they have a minimal food menu, so i wouldn&#39;t suggest coming on a completely empty stomach, but the food they do have available is good.one &#34;drink&#34; later and i was one happy lass..side.servers are usually great and very talkative.too many other options.best kept secret in chicago.this is definitely the place to go for cheap, strong drinks.there&#39;s always some interesting people to talk to as well.you got a new haircut? let&#39;s go to ceres!funny story: my then bf and i got whiskey wasted one fri night here and when i came home drunk-craving cupcakes, he busted out molly&#39;s cupcakes and an engagement ring! the rest is history.a two-hour yelp search of all the breakfast joints in the area pointed to ceres so we came here for breakfast.and thats with every drink there.i asked for a second and never got it..it was $9.cafes generally appeal to all audiences and diets, and this is where the place disappointed.great service and drinks.very good place for lunch as well as a drink after work..got some hot sauce and had a little food party with myself..the combination of the freshness of the fish and the silky smooth sauce from the butter was absolutely delicious! the tilapia was cooked so well and will literally melt in your mouth.we were not disappointed.came here a few times already always enjoy the drinks they have.here are some highlights:- cheap drinks ($8 for a full glass of jameo - ginger back separate)- delish eggrolls that save your life after drinking said jameo- drinking outside during the summer- falling off chairs- assessing your friend&#39;s poor life decisions- having your friends assess your poor life decisions (66th + gc!)i thank ceres for many years of entertainment.she said we could sit at a table under that tv..the cheese curds are great and so are the buffalo chicken rolls.this is the best happy hour spot in the city of chicago hand down.(as one diner noted, &#34;when you&#39;re not sure what to get, go for mexican dishes, because that&#39;s who&#39;s in the kitchen&#34;).for the cost of an egg mcmuffin, hashbrown disc, and dark brown water (they tell me it is coffee) at some other place, i can sit down at ceres and get sausage, eggs, hashbrowns, and toast to be made after i order it.ceres is a loop happy hour staple, conveniently located in the board of trade building.the happy hour is great also! the waiter and waitresses are great as well.it was soggy from all the au jus, or whatever it&#39;s soaked in, which i didn&#39;t really mind.they only stay open until 8 but with how strong the drinks are, that&#39;s plenty of time.there&#39;s no place like home..well that&#39;s because they give you a full glass of alcohol and ask if you want a mixer...if you take a look at the glass next to the cranberry juice, that is all alcohol.i&#39;m convinced there is no place more perfect for a happy hour in loop.and free popcorn.anything over four you would though in order to be seated right away.."

tryzub-ukrainian-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tryzub-ukrainian-kitchen-chicago,1,"I will be back for the ukrainian chardonnay and the eggplant.food, staff, atmosphere are great.amazing.they even have putin toilet paper !!!definitely worth a visit from anywhere in the city.can&#39;t wait to try it for brunch this summer.made good recommendations and i got pierogi (hope spelled correctly) with potato and cheese and lardons on top and it was delicious.i will preface my review by saying that i am not super familiar with ukrainian food, so i will judge the food on flavor.thumbs up.they&#39;ve only been open for 4 months, and the place is never packed, but i really hope business picks up for these guys.unfortunately not everything was amazing.5 - everything was nicely presented, though not everything tasted as good as it looked.they advertised it as ukrainian polenta, i polenta has more body and flavor.the drinks were classics but with a ukrainian twist.try their ukrainian flag shot! i will be back!.overall i would definitely come back!.the decor was very nice and it might be good for dinner, like i said, but $30 for six crepes of which only 2 were edible was just not worth it.thank you tryzub for coming to the neighborhood!.beautiful presentation yet lacking in taste.for dinner there was cool summer borscht followed by chicken paprikash.the service was great and our waitress olya was very polite and helpful.the breakfast stuff was good and their pierogis were really great.the food was awesome! i have never tried such a mix of ukrainian cuisine and high class serving and food design.it&#39;s a great addition to the neighborhood and i look forward to coming back.i would like to try this place for dinner, where it seems they have wider choice and serve soups and main courses."
the-chicago-diner-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-chicago-diner-chicago-2,2,"The price is still too high ($6 is too high; freakin&#39; soy milk!!) but the thing is pretty tasty.delicious vegan comfort food..they finally won me over, i&#39;ll be back.that means plan ahead or be prepared to sit at the bar till a seat opens up.it won&#39;t stop me from constantly recommending this place! eat on veggies!.cute inside.i did however find the lentil meatloaf quite bland and dry.i&#39;m pleased to see that they&#39;ve expanded a craft cocktail menu, and the food is clever enough for what it is, but it&#39;s kinda unfair for me to go too into it because it&#39;s just not what i&#39;m looking for..$8 for a drink that was only about 4oz? not the best value! my friend from chicago said it wasn&#39;t worth it to get a drink.if you&#39;re going to have an (almost) entirely vegan menu, i think the &#34;meat substitutes&#34; need to be spot on, and here they&#39;re just not.i was sick the majority day and resulted in throwing up :/ as for the taste! its loaded up, but not sure if quality-quality.great place for vegetarian food!  drinks were really good too!  can&#39;t wait to return.i also had the chocolate peanut butter shake..i crave it all the time, just wish they delivered and that we had more places like this!.one of the best reuben&#39;s in chicago, too.ruben is to go! i wish they had more healthier options there not just everything fried, please add to your side like baked sweet potatoes or other items.their bloody marys are killer, beer selection is great.the vegan ranch was delicious along with the buffalo wings.when i returned, now a jaded meat eater, i wasn&#39;t sure if i would still like it as much, but i found it just as delicious as the first time.i can&#39;t wait to go back to chicago just so i can spend my entire trip in the diner again #healthvegan.sat at the bar and our server was great with recommendations..not to mention the veggies that came with it were very mediocre, just frozen veggies that had been half heartedly heated up.then i had some of my shake.but i know i will 100% go back here when i return to chicago.because i&#39;m lactose sensitive, i tend to avoid ice cream/shakes so was thrilled to get a nice, incredibly creamy vegan vanilla chai shake with whipped cream here.unhealthy flavorful fun vegetarian food..we were able to walk most of it off.all people are welcome here.my wife being a vegetarian, had hard time finding a place to dine out.one of my mom&#39;s must go places when she visits me in chicago.i highly recommend the biscuit and gravy and my friend i took to lunch highly recommends the chicken sandwich!i will go on but honestly, zak feels i have said enough.i want packages this diner up and bring it back to saint paul, mn.lolvery very casual attire.i&#39;m usually not real keen on fake meat; but the seitan added to the sandwich was excellent.beer selection is quite good.the shakes were delicious (especially the peanut butter mix one and the mint chocolate one!.you can&#39;t go wrong with any of the milkshakes..zero complaints.best part of the meal was the portabella truffle melt - the ciabatta was toasted just right, and all other ingredients and flavors were balanced and proportioned perfectly..also had the buddha karma burger with mac and cheese and it was pretty tasty.excellent service.***plus: it open until 10pm, a bit later than other vegan places.also, this location looks a lot less &#39;diner-y&#39; (and more trendy) than the halsted location.great vegan comfort food in a good location, with kind, and helpful servers.i would order his again.we came after dinner so we shared the poutine, and i got the carrot cake shake.amazing veggie thai ribs.you&#39;ll find something worth celebrating.i could easily go vegan if i could eat at the chicago diner every day.everything tasted so good and i&#39;ve been craving it ever since.this is a vegan restaurant since 1983..been here more than 10x times.i was skeptical when hearing about how good they are.the first time i went there was -- hmmm, let&#39;s say, majorly underwhelming-- and so i boycotted it for a while.but god, that reuben! it&#39;s one of the best sandwiches i&#39;ve had in the 3 years i&#39;ve been a veg..so i&#39;ve now been to both of the chicago diners and they&#39;re equally amazing.great options/choices to satisfy your taste buds.i like real cheese and, if you haven&#39;t read my other reviews yet then you don&#39;t know that the mac is one of my favorite sides.our server was attentive and quick, and the food came out quickly too..i was entirely crazy about the daiya mozzarella, but the sweet potato fries and ciabatta bread made up for it.i was tempted to get the cookie dough peanut butter shake, but i didn&#39;t want to overdo it.to hell with your 72 virgins, give me that vegan poutine!.i sat at the bar with a friend when it wasn&#39;t as busy- it was 5 pm on a saturday- but by the time we left, the place quickly filled up, so definitely get there early.i was pretty skeptical at first since it was a vegan/vegetarian restaurant and i gotta admit,  i do love meat.i added avocado for $1 and had a large helping of mac &amp; teese they offer as a side!! anyone hip to the dairy free scene knows that mac &amp; teese is the rolls royce of vegan mac.anyways  surprisingly tasty as well.i mean, i liked both of these more than most meat versions i&#39;ve had."

try the puesto arepa and elote (cup of corn with cheese basically)..wanted to stop in for a quick bite to eat.this place is amazing.such an adorable little place!!! delicious sandwiches and arepas, quirky movies, and ah-mazing mexican ice cream make this place a hidden gem in an area that needed some serious re-energizing.i&#39;m confining my review to my arepa which was 5 stars; otherwise i might have to rate this establishment 4.this place is amazing and authentic.and the guac! and the coconut ice cream with cinnamon sprinkled on top.i couldn&#39;t go there again when there are better options in area that aren&#39;t so pricey.solid joint.well done sir!..this place is my new fav sandwich spot!  i know a good sandwich when i eat one, and vivian know what she&#39;s doing!  such a flavorful fusion of cuban, venezuelan, mexican influences.very friendly and cool design when you walk in, part modern part latin.note: prep time does take longer than you&#39;d expect.the food is delicious and the service is very friendly.the people working were great and super nice.pretty much cant go wrong with anything you choose.i literally just picked up and subsequently devoured the most amazing cuban sandwich i&#39;ve ever had...after you are greeted by the delightful armando, sit yourself down and prepare to have a killer experience for your mouth.i can definitely picture picking up some during the winter."

chengdu-impression-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chengdu-impression-chicago,1,"We ordered suan la fen, sichuan wontons, dry chili chicken, boiled beef, mapo tofu with ground beef, cumin lamb, boiled fish fillet, sichuan string beans, stir-fried pea leaves, yushiang eggplant, and a few other dishes that i lost track of.i came here on the recommendation of a friend who enjoys participating in spicy challenges after lamenting the inadequate hotness of lao sze chuan.my friends come here every week and have tried everything on the menu.only downside is that they don&#39;t have that many tables suited for more than 4 people so if you&#39;re planning to come in a larger group (5 or more) during peak hours, be prepared to wait.every sunday my boyfriend and i order take out from here to pick up and it is quick and pleasant and we usually can save some food for lunch the next day.as long time lao anything fans, i found this place on yelp and we tried it last night.service is nice and attentive..i love the special spicy favor here.suburb quality.yay! i&#39;am a fan.this is how i feel about ordering common chinese dishes at a place like this:gapersblock.i went here with my chinese class and it great having a huge table with a lot of chinese food.we&#39;re definitely regulars here..we ordered a bottle of wine, terrible!.spicier than what i&#39;ve always had at home.my bf did like his dish and felt his food was a 3-4.this is on our &#34;must go&#34; list every time we visit chicago.the most authentic chinese restaurant in chicago without doubt.thank you for a great dinner last night via delivery!  everything was fresh and right on that we ordered.they also serve beer, wine and a few cocktails.perfect over some rice.the spices tasted exactly like what you have back in homeland.overall, highly recommended for people who want to indulge their taste buds for some spicy, authentic chinese food! big plus for me, since it&#39;s also on the northside.there was no crisp to the chicken at all, the sauce was loose and bland, and i ended up throwing it into a skillet and spicing it up on my own to salvage the 16$ total i had to pay for this.worst experience with online order.but that&#39;s probably what you would expect for sichuan food.i&#39;ll be back often!..all are great choices!.excellent food.definitely try this place for takeout if you&#39;re in the lincoln park/old town area!..the service is great, they do get a little overwhelmed when it&#39;s super busy, but just ask! get the warm sake, it complements the food so well!so glad i live right nearby, i will continue to frequent chengdu for as long as i live by halsted..one from our group was sick this morning with stomach issues.this restaurant is really good and foods flavor is as good as what i ate in my hometown.the only downside is it could be too spicy for some.this isn&#39;t for lao wais..ouch.flavor is spot on with lao sze chuan in chinatown.highly recommend this place!!.the food here is done to perfection.can do a wreck on your body if you aren&#39;t careful haha.not to mention they forgot my soup and, despite being told it, never brought it.amazing chinese food, really! i visiting there on a weekday as i was craving for some good asian food on my way back from work..good thing the food was goodeverything we ordered was exceptional, well prepared tasted amazing.all three dishes were above average.the spicy wontons are top notch as well! the entrees are gigantic and easy to split if you get a couple of appetizers.simple and good.amazing authentic chinese food! i go here almost once a month because it&#39;s very delicious and i have been getting a very good service every time i come here! it&#39;s also very cheap! we had 8 people last time! and the whole bill was only $155+.you don&#39;t need to go to china town to experience chinese food.i found it by accident and could not resist to stop by.similar level of effort to eating boiled crawfish except without the splendiferous payoff..i was born in the city that this restaurant is named after, and i can say that this restaurant has the most authentic, delicious sichuan cuisine that i have experienced.s.heard this place is good, can&#39;t wait to try!..the noodles were fresh, the meat pieces were flavorful and even the bits of leafy greens were tender.won&#39;t go anywhere else!.waitresses aren&#39;t particularly friendly- no smiles, and they ignored us as we thanked them when we left.to note, majority of sichuan food is spicy, as seen on their menu with all the chili peppers, so beware.excellent food and very authentic sichuan for lincoln park.free parking after 5:30 is always a plus.the chicken and vegetables and kung pao chicken was good..summary of items i can speak to directly:- bonbon chicken - awesome, always part of the order..while this is what drew me in, it wasn&#39;t what kept me there..this alone makes chengdu better than the countless other places that seem to only serve bland frozen nuggets of protein swimming in gross sauce."

i was skeptical trying them but they&#39;re nothing like the overly processed one we&#39;re used to.this will be my study spot this summer.bonus: cute little homemade goods for sale too - fun to support local merchants!..the best cup of coffee in my life - accompanied by toast and orange marmalade (fantastic).i ordered the lumberjack latte with almond milk, while it was a little too sweet for me, there are still some other things i would like to try on the menu both food and drink wise...delicious coffee &amp; amazing fresh brewed tea at cheap prices..i never really liked iced coffee before until i tried this place and now i love it!  it&#39;s a little small but there&#39;s enough room to sit and work without feeling cramped.i always love to check out a new spot for coffee and a pastry.the coffee is exceptional, the food is good (from what i&#39;ve had), and most importantly to me, the atmosphere and people are friendly and inviting.awesome!....i saw there were a lot of regulars getting their take outs so that&#39;s always a good sign.great (unique) espresso drinks, delicious sandwiches, and a nice setting to work in.always a unique mix of people from the neighborhood, rotating art on the walls w/great coffee &amp; they even have a vegan pastry on hand!!

pequods-pizzeria-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pequods-pizzeria-chicago,1,"They&#39;re making pizza the right way here.it was not deep dish more like bread with marinara, cheese and meatball slices.overall the only thing not disappointing about this place was the sausage and the whale shaped mozzarella cheese they&#39;d grated on the salad.i just cruised right in this piece with a friend of mine, and sat down.not a deal breaker.basic, but so solid.she was very unfriendly and acted like we were a bother.we got a pretty standard sausage, mushroom, peppers and basil, they really piled on the toppings and the sausage chunks were huge and looked home made....if you know anything about the chicago pizza scene, you&#39;ll know that there are many different camps that pizzas fall in.the sauce tastes similar to homemade red sauce.the lunch special comes with a fountain drink for $4.for two lunch specials (w/ toppings), the bill came out to be around $12.i still dont know whether i like the pepperoni or the sausage more.i honestly don&#39;t know if we went on an off night, because people were waiting outside to be seated.we got a large with sausage, mushrooms, and fresh basil.came in a bit after midnight right after the cubbies took game 1 of the nlcs - surprised that we did not have a wait.it&#39;s a fairly small restaurant in a residential neighborhood across the street from a movie theater.yes, i got there late in the evening, but still - consistency is key!the salad my sister ordered had an expired, smelly salad dressing.i&#39;m not a big fan of deep dish, but i liked this spot! you can get individual sized pizza and they have lots of different toppings.this is quite arguably one of my top 2 best pizza places i&#39;ve ever had in my life and i love new york pizza.pizza was marginal and service was average at best.should you go if it&#39;s your first deep dish experience in chicago? definitely..i know, that would probably cut into profits for ordering other things like appetizers and drinks; however, during busy times, would that really be a problem?  it seems like there is always someone waiting anyway.we were not disappointed, the pizza was delicious and they have a great selection of beer as well.ignoring my stomach and the inevitable onset of lactose intolerance, i went to meet a friend from iceland at pequod&#39;s because he felt similarly about deep dish pizza as a visitor..this will be my shortest yelp review ever.we started with an order of wings which were nothing special..for my first time having true chicago deep dish pizza it was pretty good.came here with my friend for lunch to try another chicago-style pizza place, since i had tried lou malnati&#39;s during my visit to chicago last year..the only time i would ever get deep-dish was when i had a friend in from out of town.i was quoted a 30 minute wait and it did take 30 minutes.i called at 11am, as soon as they opened, and was told it would take 1 hour 15 minutes.our server told us that it would take around 45 min for the pizza to cook but ours came out in about 30min.please tourist, skip giordanos, come here to get the real deal!..gave our number, name we put it under, address, nothing can be found...my husband pointed out to me how the pizza is made in chicago.seriously, this girl in an uberpool we were with was talking about the usual big dogs of deep dish since we said we were from out of town, but the moment i brought up pequod&#39;s, she yelped (haha) like there were ants down her pants.i would be satisfied eating the crust alone, that&#39;s how delicious it really is.the only thing i will add is that they could be a bit more generous with the toppings.i had to get ready for this mentally as it was not a pizza at all.staff was friendly and was great at helping us customize our perfect pizza!.two large cylindrical slices of bread topped with gooey melted cheese and a strong taste of garlic.even the small is massive.unless it comes to pizza.i had my first chicago deep dish pizza here after my chicago-resident friend had recommended it.best deep dish i&#39;ve had during my visit in chicago! i def prefer it over giordano&#39;s.we only managed to finish half, however, but that might be because we had an early dinner and had purple pig for lunch.we got the cheesy garlic bread and it came out quickly and was very tasty.i&#39;m pretty sure that my pizza was in my hands less than a minute from leaving the oven.it was good, very good.we only had a chance to try two, so i can&#39;t compare pequod&#39;s to all the other deep dishes of chicago..pizza was available late as well which is great after a fun night in chicago.biting into a pizza i usually expect a chewy and yeasty texture to crust, but here the crust was more like.95 price they charged (3."

cochon-volant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cochon-volant-chicago,2,"I got the smoked fish avocado salad, which wasn&#39;t bad per se, but very lackluster.to start, i had the famous-on-yelp croque madame eggrolls, while others ordered the cauliflower and caesar salads.we didn&#39;t have a reservation and when i called to see how long the wait was, they told me they could actually reserve a table for me if i would be there in the next 30 mins.we also tried the potato side.and the soup? cheesy and piping hot, just the way i like it.that is a sign of a place that does not have its act together, and i didn&#39;t have high hopes that the rest of the experience would be much better, even after getting a waiter, so i left.after a long weekend, we were looking to relax over a few glasses of wine and some good food.he is a big guy and practically licked his plate clean.after having it, i wouldn&#39;t be apposed to ordering it again!downsides: my boyfriend ordered a french dip with duck that was really dry and disappointing..the food here was great, but it was surprisingly empty for a friday night.the wine selection is always great but rotates..we had a pastry while we waited, and the croissants were very acidic which was a little disappointing.it -successfully- feels like a french cafe, with a quiet mumble from the guests, attentive service and delicious food.we made a reservation for lunch, and thank goodness we did.the steak tartare came with a fresh tasting salad, ketchup, a creamy aioli type sauce and their delicious bread..however, it&#39;s a perfect treat for a fancier lunch!.the french onion soup was loaded with cheese and pungent to be served with the prime beef dip.crème brulee was decent but i honestly would have preferred another beet salad.as far as the menu, you&#39;ll find all the french classics like escargot, french onion soup, and steak frites.i was greeted promptly, i opted to wait at the bar until my friend showed up.of course, it&#39;s not really french, but it has a bit of the atmosphere and was a busy place when we arrived at 6:30pm.i would take clients here anytime.hello mornings!.i had trouble eating my french onion soup with a teaspoon..the food, however, left much to be desired.when the pasta was gone, the bowl was just full of oil.i don&#39;t even know what burrata is.the entire menu looks delicious, however we ordered the burger and prime rib dip..be prepared to leave cochon volant sated.the decor is classic, bright, and comfortable and there are many tables in front of large windows in its corner location.i don&#39;t think it&#39;s overpriced, but just for anyone who might be on a budget and see the moderate price rating, it&#39;s probably more like $$$-$$$$.the restaurant had a cafe-like feel to it and it was surprisingly not too busy (unlike every other brunch restaurant, especially on the weekends).just grabbed a drink here, but the outdoor patio was really nice -- perfect for those warm, chicago days.i needed something to wash the goodness down so i went with a nice sazerac my server brittany made and it was pretty good.came because we love gilt bar.all in all, this is a good spot, but it sometimes feels a bit generic - nice and accommodating, but it doesn&#39;t have a ton of personality.the dressing as well is not overbearing.we ordered muscles he had to ask for cocktail forks and setups.came here for a quiet breakfast when i was in chicago for business.came for restaurant week on a saturday night- place was cute and unpretentious but not terribly busy.the chicken liver mousse appetizer is out of this world - it&#39;s addictive, do not order this if you are watching your diet because you will gobble up the entire jar and all the fresh bread..prime bone in filet - 12 ounce cut of amazingly goodness.seriously, i said &#34;this drink is so good&#34; after every sip.but you know what they put on french fries in holland instead of ketchup?jules: what?vincent: mayonnaise....worth the walk from our hotel.i doubt you&#39;ll be disappointed with anything you get at any time of day..this isn&#39;t denny&#39;s.she recommended to try the mussels.manager was awkward and seemed to not really care about anything..so even though i enjoyed the meal, i&#39;m confused why they would deviate from the characteristic benedict egg style and wish i tasted the egg in a way i can&#39;t make it at home (now it&#39;s just an egg sandwich/egg toast/etc.we had a reservation, so i am not sure if there is normally a wait, i assume lunch is the busiest time based on the location and proximity to the many office buildings.i ordered half dozen of oyster as appetizer.had one cocktail here after work, and it was fun! love the bistro chairs out front, and the bartender was friendly.location and atmosphere are the real draw here.i had the le duex duex duex - 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 pieces of bacon or sausage and it came with potatoes! tons of food!! but it was fabulous as well! also, their coffee was good! and had real sugar cubes at the table!great location with fabulous food.my only issue with this place is that the bread was super hard and the hot chocolate was something to be forgotten about.the service is lackluster, the hostess and manager are aloof."
the-bongo-room-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bongo-room-chicago,2,"The brunch here is ridiculous.the pancakes though? sweet heavens it was paradise! the hazelnut sauce was very savory, but not completely overpowering.genius!!i was debating between the vegetarian croissant sandwich and the blt benedict.but it&#39;ll be worth it!the white chocolate and caramel pretzel pancakes are crazy good.i can&#39;t complain, i just love bongo room!!.i come back every so often to see if maybe it&#39;s me and i&#39;m just ordering the wrong things, but no, pretty average every time.my boyfriend and i vote this place as the best chicago brunch place ever and we now come here every month.our party also got the dark chocolate french toast and it was pretty much diabetes on a plate (in a good way).it was more chocolatey and wasn&#39;t overly red from food coloring which is always a plus because who likes to eat all that dye!we also had the cinnamon raisin brioche french toast which was my favorite! it was topped with a vanilla creme, sautéed apples, and oatmeal.the bongo room will always be my go-to when i&#39;m out with friends!.seating is pretty cramped.when i come back, i want to sit at one of the window seats--they looked the coziest (and could probably only seat 3 people) and has a nice people-watching view of milwaukee ave.i&#39;m sure we&#39;ll return, but we&#39;ll perhaps go with something on the savory side.personally, when i see the pancake so completely covered in the white chocolate sauce, it makes me want to run the other way.the latest for me was on the specials and was a french toast with brioche, apples, oatmeal, and vanilla creme..it was phenomenal albeit super super sweet.i would&#39;ve given 5 stars if i didn&#39;t have to hunt down my server.it was hard to share.if i ever come back, maybe their other menu items will be better.the bongo room is great- but i actually think it is a bit overhyped.nice atmosphere and was our wait wasn&#39;t long at all for a friday brunch.amazing food as always! this is always on the list  of stops when we&#39;re in chicago.it gets very busy for brunch so be prepared to wait awhile.i never order sweet entrees for breakfast but i have tried their strawberry and banana pancakes and they are great.overall a solid breakfast place but nothing spectacular.be warned that the portions are large here although i have a small stomach - so take it with a grain of salt.a great place for brunch! there was a dish for every  kind of craving you could have.so good!! pancakes are perfect and house potatoes are awesome.took it on the plane with me back to cali and had it the next morning for breakfast! :) i can&#39;t wait to return to chi-town just for the bongo room!.i had the chocolate french toast and even though the portion size was huge, i demolished it easily.eh..we were seated right away, they dont take reservations and only seat if your whole party is there.passed the test.last sunday my wife, brother-in-law, and my sister went to the bongo room for brunch.it was really light too and had chicken, avocado, spinach and egg whites.the mimosas are overpriced and small.the staff tend to be rude and seem to not care about your experience..the lobster roll eggs benedict was great, and i&#39;m not sure who wouldn&#39;t like the potatoes because they were everything a breakfast potato should be.amazing!! i try to avoid carbs, and you can here but why would you? the food was so flavorful and presentation was mouth watering..the pancakes and french toast are really sweet but yummy.judging just based on the food, i would have given the bongo room 5 stars.another great breakfast spot in the city! it&#39;s only open until 2pm.this is still one of my favorite brunch/breakfast spots in the city..would recommend if you&#39;re alone as their portions can be huge!*.their house potatoes were just basic diced potatoes with a ton of pepper on it.they are actually cool and like doing server stuff.a visiting relative insisted on brunching here on a rainy sunday and am i glad she did..turns out, it&#39;s some good stuff that they serve here (and also they are literally only open for brunch).came here on memorial day and avoided the wait by arriving/placing a name down for a table of 5 at 9:40am.anything on the menu is a good choice!.wait is long but take advantage of the area.my favorite are the caramel pretzel pancakes which i usually order as dessert to share.what was amazing though was the white chocolate and caramel pretzel pancake....i think i&#39;ll try something else when i come back.pancakes were $4 each which is decent since they were the size of my face.the serving sizes were quite generous and we had some leftovers to take home.def a must in chicago, the one in wicker park serves alcohol.i actually prefer kanela down the street.*quick service (went during the week for lunch)*excellent food - vegetarian croissant sandwich &amp; house potatoes,  banana pancakes,     breakfast burrito.one of our favorite breakfast places in wicker park! kind of a small restaurant and is crowded on the weekends so expect a little wait.for years, i heard ridiculous things about this place as the place to get brunch in wicker park.we were seated by 11:45.oh well still can&#39;t take away from the fact that it&#39;s always a good meal here.street parking..also, the portion sizes were ginormous! a &#34;side of bacon&#34; consists of seven pieces!the only negative thing i have to say that that i felt rushed.really solid four stars.my first time at the bongo room today and i can&#39;t deny that it was pretty good! my friends and i waited for less than 30 minutes for a table, which wasn&#39;t too bad considering it&#39;s the weekend.within 30 seconds of sitting down we had water :) coming from a waitress of many years, i can truly say the service here was excellent and super fast! the food was delicious and reasonably priced! this will for sure be a staple breakfast spot for us!.fortunately, we went around late brunch and did not have to wait."
yummy-yummy-noodles-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yummy-yummy-noodles-chicago,1,"First off, it&#39;s incredibly quick to order (since there only a few people who dare to venture downstairs).the aptly named yummy yummy noodles (so tasty you have to moniker it twice) makes delicious bowls of soup with delicious noodles.good food2.they provide different kind of noodle with different style grediants.i believe it is a one man operation: he is really straight to the point but friendly, and so efficient! my order of 2 noodle soups, the fish balls, and yuchoy were ready in 8 minutes, and cost me under $20! everything was hot and fresh.ordered spicy beef tenderloin noodles with wide egg noodles to nurse a hangover and this completely hit the spot.fast service.this place is definitely a journey away from where i live but it&#39;s worth the drive.never had such tiny wings in my life!.their noodles is not that impressive.got the beef brisket noodles, and my order was ready in just a couple of minutes.clientele is a mix of locals, students, and tourists who know this hidden gem.a must try place in the food court!.imagine my excitement after reading the past string of 4 and 5 star reviews.the guy&#39;s a super nice guy who doesn&#39;t judge me for my poor mandarin to my face.great noodles at a fair price.it was only $7, so cheap for the amount of food you get! i&#39;ll definitely be coming by this food court for more lunch eats.incredible handmade fish balls in noodles.lol, seriously, it is soooo yummy!!! try their chicken wings (it is tiny and comes 6 wings but good) and their wonton, beef brisket soup, fishball etc so yummy! i will try their other delicious food in the future!  fast delivery too!.initially i came down here to visit another vendor that sells meat skewers.if i didn&#39;t live or work so far away, i would be here weekly!.excellent ramen spot.though, you can choose from a variety of noodles as well.the broth was pretty tasty but it wasn&#39;t spicy enough in my opinion.got the wanton noodles here.5 noodle choices -- thin or wide egg noodle, thin or wide rice noodle, and instant noodles.plenty of seating with free wifi.and the beef itself was chewy.they understand and speak english so it&#39;s no problem understanding the menu.i swear, this place cannot have too many &#34;yummys&#34; in its name.quick friendly service all the time.i guess thats where the name came from."
irazu-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/irazu-chicago-2,1,"Good food.i felt like i needed to go to the dentist after eating the pork just to ensure my teeth weren&#39;t broken.would definitely recommend for a private event space!!.they also offered pitchers of fruit-flavored mixers if you bring in your alcohol of choice, which i think we&#39;ll take advantage of next time.i took part in a large group dinner hosted at irazu.lost of choices for my wife, who does not eat meat.these guys.will definitely be back to try their other menu items! service was also very friendly.byob.i get mine with rice, avocado and without beans.and if the fire from those peppers persists after your entrees come, be sure to order an oatmeal shake.the guy fieri special is a knockout because of the pepito sandwich and oatmeal shake..this is important because their dining area is basically in a tent.the food was delicious and it reminded me a little bit of brazilian food.50 (a literal bargain compared to the likes of chipotle and other restaurants).friends had leftovers of their enormous burritos.for this visit, i went with the shrimp and veggie platter, and was not disappointed at all.just be in the moment and enjoy all the irazu can provide for you!!.rice and beans were a great base, and adding a bit of chicken to it was spot on..i was genuinely impressed by this place!  the ambiance isn&#39;t anything special, and it was a little chilly on the enclosed patio, but that was more than made up for by the excellent food and drinks!  i had the vegetarian sandwich and several empanadas (spinach and cheese, chicken), and everything was delicious!  my friend and i also split two pitchers of the strawberry-lime mix that we complemented with the rum we brought..just drop a couple bucks for the guys in the kitchen.this place was ok.on the menu, irazu&#39;s chifrijo is tasty and delicious, and can somehow be made vegetarian and still taste pretty good.a little taste of the &#39;pura vida&#39; in bucktown..overall amazing restaurant!.unfortunately, we were a bit disappointed with the food we had ordered.straightforward service with home style flavors! i had limited time in chicago but knew irazu had to be one of my stops- so i grabbed a steak pepito sandwich to go en route to the airport and ate it during my flight! the staff were friendly about packing my order carefully and giving me an ample portion of the lizando sauce.*yes, i&#39;ve had their oatmeal shakes and won&#39;t be incorporating them into my review as those are 5 star without question so i don&#39;t see the point in factoring 1 menu item that is obviously ballin&#39; into the overall review.it serves truly authentic, delicious food, from the stereotypical tico breakfast gallo pinto to delicious dessert like plátanos and the empanadas were great too-  everything i tried made me feel like i was back in cr.this restaurant is a perfect fit for the neighborhood serving latin american food including their famous oatmeal shake.oh my lanta! soooo worth the 2 hour drive! this gem was featured on chicago&#39;s best a while back, and i&#39;ve been meaning to get in.i had been wanting to go here for years as i would pass by sometimes on my way to work, and finally i made it.wide variety of dishes.it&#39;s byob though and drinking some beer makes waiting much better! they even give you a cup so you can drink out front.loved their food for years.4.that being said, i am absolutely coming back for a steak burrito because the steak on the pepito was incredible!overall, really enjoyed it and i will be eating here again.we ordered a lot and are thankful to have leftovers.perhaps i&#39;ll find out next time! this will for sure be a regular place to drop by (when i happen to have cash on me) in the future as the weather warms up.the casado wasn&#39;t doing it for us either.what i like:fried plantainsblack beans in the riceoatmeal chocolate shakesbyob (and they are so nice that they will bring you a pail with ice!)what i don&#39;t like:.it&#39;s byob and i get that you don&#39;t want people to linger like it&#39;s their back porch, but i find that rude.only issue is i had no room to enjoy my favorite ice cream shop down the street.great for groups..&#34; usually when i go to a restaurant and try a dish that turns out to be a winner, 95% of the time i stick with the dish and never try anything else for fear of disappointment.justin is on his ball game!.cash only! must try the oatmeal shake, chifrijo and pepito sandwich..the shrimp were crunchy and the slices of avocado were massive.that went well eating it by its self or with the complementary chips..the food is just ok----i was expecting more of &#34;90 miles to cuba&#34; style home cooked flavorful food but this is not..i had the pepito sandwich, it was delicious.we had the guacamole as an appetizer which was nice..i had chifrijo, a mango/pinapple shake and the chile relleno with plantains.love this place! their zucchini and spinach empanadas are my favorite! i came in with a friend and we ordered the potato tacos, the dishes are huge! everything tastes delicious, fresh and it&#39;s a great place for vegetarians or vegans too.my favorites were the mushroom and chorizo.mmmmmm.mad average but it works..tasty as hell..i&#39;m pretty sure the meat was not cooked to order but had been sitting out for hours.their sandwiches are so flavorful, especially if you get extra lazano sauce.the taco were very average and the shrimp was flavored well, but the rest of the platter with rice, beans and veggies was just okay."
el-cubanito-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-cubanito-chicago,1,"Cafe con leche here is the best in the city! the empanadas are amazing.i guess she also has a problem with homosexuals.they had malta india which made me very happy.great music playing from jukebox..wow, the beef sandwich was excellent, had a unique flavor.i preferred the ham.they have the best empanadas ever!!! the place is nice and clean also the staff is ok.omg sooooo delicious.coffee was better then señor pan another local cuban sandwich place.everyone is very nice their breakfast sandwiches are great i like to go their for breakfast before i start work i get a cafe con leche steak empanada and a steak egg with everything on it the put shoestring potatoes on their it give a nice crunch to the sandwich small place good food..only downfall is everytime i&#39;ve been there, there is a funky smell and it&#39;s not the food because that&#39;s  amazing.places like this make chicago,chicago!was actually a hole in the wall for years..i have tried other ones, but they make the best...the sandwich is so meaty and tender, the salsa sauce takes me back to the sauces of palestine! this place also has great cafe con leches come here!.it&#39;s been about a year since i first visited and man was i surprised how this place has changed!  before it was just a tiny counter service kinda joint and now they have expanded next door to an open and airy seat-yourself-after-you-order restaurant.for the female clientele, not as much..new look,  same heart.the front end of the truck as the cash register gives the place real charm!..being a coffee guru i stumbled into this place on a visit to logan square.i love their cuban and i also love their steak sandwich.so glad they are here, and i wish they would be open late for salsa club!..the tv&#39;s look out of place to me didn&#39;t fit the theme of the restaurant.you cannot beat the customer service, you cannot beat the prices.i would definitely come back.another semi-disappointing thing was the fact that they charged more (like.my sister had the cubano and it was wonderful also.i am probably being partial because this place is directly behind my house, but i love this place.if it wasn&#39;t for the guy that took our order with that garbage attitude, i would&#39;ve rated this place higher, at a 4 or even 5.i would recommend finding somewhere else to eat maybe mariano on milwaukee.there is always ample street parking nearby and their new dining space is great.i&#39;ll miss the charm of the no seats location but it&#39;s the best cuban food in the chicago.it comes with lettuce, tomato, shoe string potatoes and a side of hot sauce.they make a great cubanito sandwich full of flavor, try all of the food you won&#39;t regret it.the food is great, the service is fantastic and very friendly, and with the renovated building, el cubanito has gotten a lot more up scale.i tried some of my friend&#39;s cuban sandwich, and it was delicious in all its cheesy wonder.empanadas weren&#39;t fully cooked, raw dough still inside.this new place is awesome! a whole lot more seating area with the same awesome food! i love their cuban steak sandwich and their cafe con leche or &#34;cafe arabe&#34; if you like cinnamon and cardamom in your coffee.otherwise, the steam will kill the texture of the bread.i will for sure be back.stop reading and go.the cuban was excellent and was on par with my favorite cuban sandwich at west tampa sandwich shop in tampa, fl.i love cuban food and typically go to a regular cuban restaurant.not the best, nor the worst.the new location has expanded their coffee menu to include a delicious hawaiino (coffee with coconut milk ) and el arabe (coffee with cinnamon and cardamon ) pair this with any of their delicious breakfast sandwiches or loaded empanadas and your in for a treat !i only wish i had one of these in my neighborhood because it really is a steal at under 3 dollars a cup.also, the empanadas were good.we been going for years ,love the new location.this place is life.they made the place bigger and its a lot more roomful and great enviorment.the empanadas are amazing!!  they just expanded and have seating! much more inviting although i didn&#39;t mind the authenticity of the old place..ohh, did i mention these people are actually a family owned joint?? that&#39;s right! so you know what they have going on here must meet their original standards!!i really could keep going about this place all day and night but rather than giving you my own experience, you&#39;d want to just try it for yourself..first time to cuban food and it was worth the walk.i had the steak sandwich, which actually seemed pretty healthy for a cuban sandwich joint.take note, stop mincing the meat so finely.bowling alley ambiance bur great empanadas.having worked in the area for almost a decade, i&#39;ve had my share of cuban sandwiches, this is really middle of the road.my fiancé loved the fries.found this great cuban sandwhich place by accident and ive been a fan ever since, the sandwhiches are great on flavor and in price.my cubanito was a little less satisfying and while good, it seemed like a standard panini.what an awesome place."

revolution-brewing-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/revolution-brewing-chicago,1,"All spectacular!the service was friendly and quick and the beer is great!  also, they happen to have a delicious bloody mary!one morning, i ordered a biscuit and gravy special with broccoli and asked if they could make sure the broccoli was cooked all the way thru b/c i have a digestive disease that makes it difficult for me to process a veggie that isn&#39;t fully cooked.it helps to drive the vibe (hipster-brewery-ish) of the whole establishment, which is a great vibe! it&#39;s low-key, relaxed, really chill.it&#39;s a cold december night in 2015.the food here is delicious and the beer is refreshing.the wings were very generic, if i wanted wings like this i would go to buffalo wild wings..this review applies specifically to the weekend brunch.my fiancé and i were hosting guests from england, and we wanted to give them a true chicago dining experience.plus, we had the smoked wings and loved.the food was good.all delectable..samples for $3 which is what we ended up doing so we could taste test.the bar was set up like a traditional pub with a ton of seating almost all the way around..pretty much all the appetizers here are good and on par with upscale restaurants in the city (i&#39;d recommend the bacon fat popcorn and calamari for table appetizers) and of course you can&#39;t go wrong with the huge beer selection.with that in mind, it might be easy to grab a spot at the bar, but as for seating in the restaurant itself, it looked pretty slim.i came here with friends and we tried the sampler so i can&#39;t tell you what i tried.a must try, for the casually comfortable environment.the ingredients on this pizza went well together, and i had enough for left overs.go or the burger with the egg on top.i tried the fish and chips and the fish fillets were huge and had a nice light breading.same went for our food..this is my favorite chicago brewery hands-down.there is no food service upstairs..yelp, what should i do?get the logan reviver, bartender assured this drink is making it on the new cocktail list.the cocktails were as good as the beer esp for a place that specializes in beer, i was very pleased.blue cheese potato salad was great.for me, it encompasses everything that a perfect ipa should be.actually, i&#39;ve been disappointed in their offerings lately because their fall and winter menus have appeared almost identical, especially in the entrée offerings.good atmosphere, great food, and even better beer.i feel like the &#34;craft&#34; beer scene is not alive and well at revolution.i had a headache i think.i wanted to pick up the bowl and lick it clean.i&#39;ll go ahead and take off the burger.i like revolution beer but this place isn&#39;t somewhere i feel wad worth going to.you&#39;re guaranteed to find something you&#39;ll love!clearly we&#39;ll keep coming back to revolution brewing!!!.it was so tender and juicy and the rest of the salad was decent.out of the new beers that i tried the anti-hero and a little crazy were my favorites.i noticed that it wasn&#39;t just people in their twenties like i would have assumed walking into a brew-pub.i&#39;d highly recommend this place.thanks, revolution! we&#39;d do it all over again if we could!.i had a delicious cocktail, of which there are some limited cocktail selections.we started with the bacon popcorn since that seems to be all the rage, but honestly, i wasn&#39;t blown away by this.i enjoyed the atmosphere, beers, and really liked the brisket dish we ordered.stopped here for drinks at the suggestion of a friend on the way back from the loop to the suburbs and i&#39;m glad we did.well, okay, i do own a pair of thick rimmed classes, but that&#39;s about it.i had the pulled pork sandwich and it was amazing! also had the bacon fat popcorn which was a good snack for the table.i particularly liked the farmhouse saison which was pretty much a dead ringer for boulevard tank 7.i am not a fan of hoppy beers so this place wasn&#39;t for me.would have given 4 stars for service and drinks.you can go by the glass or make your own beer flight for which i did both..i just, personally, wasn&#39;t a fan.delicious accompaniment to the beers.i got sample sizes of loganberry (fruity ale), rosa (light and floral), and a little crazy (belgian american pale ale).fantastic, as usual.the staff is a well-oiled machine.that&#39;s all i need.so my concern is who works there, the endless blank stares, the wait time to get a beer when the bar isn&#39;t slammed and there isn&#39;t a huge demand of attention.this is a place unique to chicago, easily blue line accessable, and reasonably priced.the food was alright, standard pub / bar food but a little nicer the other brewpubs i&#39;ve been too..the few non-malted menu items i&#39;ve noshed upon have been good, though i&#39;ll always be here first and foremost for the beer.&#34;i personally enjoy cooking,&#34; i say, &#34;and see a distinction between actual food as opposed to processed food, and yeah, even if it&#39;s from the frozen section at trader joe&#39;s or whole foods, it&#39;s processed.always happy to support the chicago craft breweries!.good friends, good beer, good times.i really should worry less about people thinking i&#39;m weird and just order what i want, even if it&#39;s an app that probably won&#39;t fill me up.for my entree, i got the shrimp &amp; grits.cant go wrong with any of the hero ipa series.we had a really cool tour guide who dressed up as alan from the hangover.each got two beers.we visited revolution brewing on a saturday morning before a football game.actually the food is better than the beer and the beer is pretty awesome.the service was really well organized on a extremely busy saturday afternoon.the establishment is very nice and comfortable.um my over 40 year old friend from europe can&#39;t get a beer because he left his passport at the hotel.yes- the beer is great."

 i was surely doing my pee pee dance..but then again there aren&#39;t too many bars set away from the &#39;main drag&#39; like aberdeen tap, so the plus side is that while you may pay a premium on certain specialty beers, the crowd here isn&#39;t your usual weekend drinking crowd or even your standard beer snob.love getting to aberdeen when i can!....in addition to a great selection of beer and spirtis, the food selection is far from average &#34;bar food.super friendly staff, decent enough beer list, individual bathrooms.i heard the food was great as well, and would love to come back to try it.it&#39;s friendly with a huge outdoor patio and delicious food.if you&#39;re looking for a place to drink, they have an impressive whiskey selection and plenty of great beers to boot.and save me a seat at the bar pleaseandthankyou.he explained the menu more savagely than the most verbose slam poet, and by the time he got to the day&#39;s special even i felt social indignation rising in my gullet.was tough to choose because everything looks so good.both meals came with some pretty good steak fries as well.great vibe and great food! never a bad time and the servers are fantastic too.also their kitchen is open up fairly late, for some great grub anytime you want to swing by(sobriety recommended, but not mandatory).5 but whatevsgreat little neighborhood spot..it was a nice day so the group i was with decided to sit outside in the patio area.neighborhood bars should take notes from aberdeen because it delivers on all counts! it has good food, great music and engaging, personable bartenders.yep, if this bar was in my neighborhood, i&#39;d be here often!!!.nice neighborhood place to grab a drink and catch a game.we started with the macaroni bites and their house-made ranch is muy delicioso.probably looks and smells nicer at night when i&#39;ve had a few beers..the people here tend to be early 30 something that live in the west loop/river west.they could be kicked up a bit with hot peppers or giardinara.also loved the music (90s ) while we were eating.great patio - ahhh, summers in chicago.food was outstanding!  we ordered based off of our waitress&#39;s recommendation and she was spot on! fried mac &amp; cheese, gator banger, cubano grinder and duck grinder and sweet potato tots! definitely will return!.i highly recommend!bruce 7:26:3thou shall tip thy bartender.not your ordinary bar food.this is one of my favorite bars..was craving a good burger after working out and a friend recommended aberdeen tap.this is my go to spot if someone wants to just hang out and have a couple beers.i thought--and we asked our server--isn&#39;t there anything you can do to disable that feature? we were here first..the fish was fried perfectly and very well put together, and despite not knowing what a crawfish sausage would taste like, i feel like it was spot on.exposed brick, high-top tables, nice bar area and plenty of tv&#39;s.see you friday at the aberdeen.the beers are expensive to begin with, and i don&#39;t imagine this place does the business to get wholesale prices..i don&#39;t know if the owners read these reviews, but just  know, your guys there are doing it right.that&#39;s pretty great service."

food was so delicious! everything everyone at our table had was delicious but i would especially suggest the pumpkin pancakes (and i don&#39;t even like pancakes or pumpkin).i really should listen to my wife more, it was her idea to come here..maybe we were a little too aggressive on the byob :/.delicious! the portions are very generous; there is no way you&#39;re leaving hungry! i noticed a great kids menu and even saw that they have wings that have won competitions.3 out of 6 of us had the big bite burger: 8 oz burger, smoked gouda, bacon, onion rings and barbeque sauce and it was absolutely delicious, packed with flavor with the patty cooked just right (medium rare).the place is smallish, but is decorated very warmly.with a group of 6 we had a variety of items at our table, and they all looked (and smelled) delicious!it was interesting that the whole place was covered in photos of ron from parks &amp; recreation lol, but kind of a cute touch.i&#39;ve been to a lot of brunch places (refer to all my other posts), but whisk has the real bold flavors one may be seeking from brunch post hangover or pregnant (what? i am always hungry).the service was good otherwise, and it&#39;s not a deal breaker for me so i will definitely return!.that&#39;s why i&#39;ll give them five stars (i don&#39;t usually give five stars).it may be a preference thing, but i like mine covered in sauce and these were on the dry side.i will definitely be back to try their famous brunch and update my review.the only thing i didn&#39;t like is that they weren&#39;t open when we got there at 8am although the posted hours said they would be open at 7am."

 as a regular, i suggest parking where there is a lot of foot traffic.we had the gnochhi, olives, chicken wings, all were great, but the main course dish, which was the prime rib was all fat (which being a person who has cooked prime rib can happen with a bad piece of meat).food was average for the length you have to wait to go there even on a tuesday.our waitress was nice but it sometimes seemed like she wasn&#39;t on top of things.go for monday tacos or wednesday burgers or everyday octopus.we brought our cake, and they sliced it for us.the atmosphere was great and the decor was beautiful.holy crap!  those were awesome..staff was great, and food was good.my only 2 complaints are; the records  (oh i forgot to tell you, they have a wall of records you can chose your favorite and have it played) i believe they play the entire record because we didn&#39;t hear our&#39;s at all and the the drinks were mediocre, not very good at all.food is amazing but the level of noise is just way too high.the steak was the best of the night.tried the following (best to worst):wagyu steak tartare - very tasty!  probably the best thing we had.i had to check my map multiple times to make sure i remembered the address correctly.or get your own because they&#39;re so fab!.last night, i ordered the panna cotta and they were out of it, so the server brought us a complementary dessert.next time i would stay for longer and order food.(previously, that highly coveted title went to spring, but they&#39;ve been gone for a few years now.my husband and i loved ada street! sat at the bar while we waited for our patio table.gnocchi: i loved the flavors of the this dish--the pearl onions brought nice bursts of sweetness to the squash puree, which had just the perfect level of richness; however, i wasn&#39;t a fan of how soft the texture was--it almost felt as if the gnocchi was cooked far past al dente.the best one was probably the pimento cheese and their daily special yellow tuna hamachi.it was topped with fresh strawberries and a light sauce (not indicated on the menu).the seasoning is spot on and the dishes are well-balanced..wine flight was lovely..they said they would get back to me in a day or so, but didn&#39;t.i don&#39;t know what i mean by that, but usually #2 and #3 are hard to reconcile.with the exception of the ribeye, which was truly exceptional, every thing else was just ok.very good food.super knowledgeable bar staff.i worked with them to arrange private dining for my 11-person party on new year&#39;s eve.i also got two cocktails, the fistful of dollars and the only son of a ladies man - the latter of which is one of the best cocktails i&#39;ve had in the city.i was not the biggest fan of the dipping sauce that came on the sidebahn &#39;mietballs&#39; these were very very good! i loved the sauce that came with it and the meatballs were super flavorfulgnocchi! definitely the highlight of our entire meal.the place was so small, it was hard to walk around.once you get past these challenges you&#39;re met with a rather interesting menu that i imagine would appeal to most foodies out there.the old fashioneds were outstanding and made with care..the farro salad ($10) another good dish that was finished quickly and a pretty large portion.every time i come, it&#39;s such a treat!my husband and i sat at the bar this past weekend to enjoy a leisurely casual anniversary dinner.in town for work and a colleague of mine who used to live in chicago, could not stop raving about this place.i went here for restaurant week and loved it!the menu for 2016 was based off famous concert rider requests which i thought was a very unique cool twist.unbelievable.i would say my friends and i are pretty average eaters.i was surprised to find it at a relatively hidden and isolated part of the city.the chef is creative and the food is outstanding.the only proof i had of being there was a $140 statement and a pretty pic of the front of the place.but we wanted to be safe and make resos anyways.this part will hopefully avoid a very unfortunate situation for future patrons..the sauces are all so on point here.out of everything we had, the gnocchi and the octopus were definitely the crowd favorite.great, funky, little restaurant on a hard to find street in lincoln park.all in all.the chef zoe - was very hands on with the kitchen and delivered a few of our courses to the tablei will note the table next to us got the steak and eggs, which looked awesome and the doughnut,2 minor complaints - the glasses for water were two small.and they have the waiting bit down to a science."
dos-urban-cantina-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dos-urban-cantina-chicago,2,"But it&#39;s the food -- the buttered chayote, the corn tamal, the street style corn, the beef pibil -- (which is so far all i&#39;ve been able to try) that makes you wish you had just a little bit more room.buffets usually have bland, cold food, but this one was different.we started with the chips and dips (my fav was the spicy salsa) and the chicharons served with a nontraditional hummus like dip..we started with snack, olives w/ chimichurri (unpitted) &amp; chicharon w/ french onion yogurt dip.i&#39;m a sucker for street style corn.can&#39;t believe the restaurant was packed.all the flavors on the menu popped and well balanced.buying a place is difficult but i know one thing.the menu says &#34;raw scallops&#34; the dish comes with one scallop cut into 5 pieces.they did an awesome job of making me feel special all night; normally i hate any extra attention but it was subtle and laid back which i greatly appreciated.fresh lime juice, not bogged down by unnecessary sweetness, and still a solid tequila after-kick.the items we had and cannot stop talking about are the following:street style corn, raw scallops, trout, beef bavette, shrimp taquitos, tostada and  chayote.i went into dinner with a little higher expectations than most restaurants given all the rave reviews on yelp and by the critics for this place.i would go back!.:)i tried their margarita, raw scallops and chocolate cake, i be back soon and try other option.definitely coming back here for a date sometime.the mushrooms were loved by everyone - even those who normally turn up their noses at mushrooms.bonus because it&#39;s just a few steps from my house.food was good, not great.however, the sea urchin was phenomenal !.the first time we dined here we were blown away just by our server alone.we were 4 people and ordered 10 dishes.i can&#39;t say enough about the service and overall experience at dos urban cantina.we went for the brunch buffet on a sunday and it was great! they had plenty of food to choose from and all of it tasted very fresh.the kitchen is open in the back and there seems to be a chef&#39;s table style of bar seating there in the back.don&#39;t order the avocado and beet.the good was extremely good!  definitely took me out of my comfort zone but i must say, i was quite impressed!if you are looking for a food adventure, this place should not be missed.bar tender gave a solid recommendation!  we had a great meal, and the service was excellent.overall, pretty average place.the management staff is warming and eager to providing a positive experience.for drinks, we had the charred canary and bodega.intentionally distressed backdrops and perfectly dim lighting.fantastic.pretty much everything is easy to share so i&#39;d recommend going with a group and ordering a bunch of different things.i was very impressed by their use of fresh vegetables, and they kept the cheese to a minimum, so it didn&#39;t feel greasy at all.however, i really liked my michelada and the sticky date pudding.new neighborhood favorite for sure!.wonderful service, friendly staff, amazing stiff drinks!  we started with the chips and dips - awesome.hey, did we not or did we not get off our sad couches and try the new place, hah?! amirite here or what?&#34;  i grew up on 26th street &amp; east side mexican food but i can&#39;t rate it 2 stars.the master minds behind this operation are all true experts of their craft coming together out of pure genius and passion and you can feel every bit of it.the ambiance was great - trendy yet comfortable.my friend and i came for dinner on a tuesday night.service was very friendly all around.we tried a few palomas, a margarita, and their after dinner horchata.i am normally skeptical to go to mexican restaurants, because they are always serving very similar food..never thought i&#39;d fall in love with a corn and poblano pepper salad at a fucking buffet!i wouldn&#39;t expect things to stay at this level(with any place, really) so you should probably check it out asap.the beets were somewhat unpleasant.the pumpkin seed humus is unreal.although i think everything is supposed to be shared, we went with two large dishes (which they put in bold so you know they&#39;re larger) as our separate entrees (since my gf is vegetarian).the food was delicious from the chips and dip to the corn to the sea bass and the beef.get dat did!.i practically liked the plate of the sweet corn tamal and the shrimp tacquitos were extremely flavorful.it clearly resembled canned corn, which i&#39;m sure it is since it&#39;s likely on the menu year round and corn is only in season 3 months out of the year.i was slightly disappointed, it was a really straightforward meat and potatoes dish.if you like mexican food, don&#39;t go to this place.my main complaint was the price point relative to portion size (large.and the sugar pie!highly recommend the mussels!can&#39;t wait to go back and try everything else.we cannot wait to come back for dinner.food is a little pricey but has great flavor..the kitchen was accommodating and brought me cucumber slices instead of chips to go with the guacamole..my husband and i decided to split the beef bavette, it was truly amazing and perfectly cooked to a tender medium rare and it is served with a dark, rich salsa and a side of crispy delicious potatoes topped with cojita cheese and a bit of arugula, oh so delicious.best cocktail i&#39;ve ever had for sure - highly recommend!.5 stars:we had a party of 8 and made reservations for saturday night.had a delicious brunch.however the restaurant itself is pretty great.but not here..for me the cocktail list lacked a little luster.last night i had dinner with a friend, we were surprised that the dining room side had been booked for the evening, luckily there were a few open high tops near the bar.there was a pregnant woman and children eating there."

no really, give it a try and be delighted.this place is a new urban/country brewery.we put our name in at round 6:30, and ended up waiting around an hour for a table, not too bad for a friday night.or maybe they were, because they were raw and gross.my favorite dishes are the belgian style mussels and the leek, mushroom, and goat cheese pizza.their affordable beers are brewed in-house and are rotated on regular basis so you may have something new to try each time you come in.i&#39;ve had a number of entrees and appetizers on the menu, and none has disappointed.i think i&#39;ve been here 6 times since it&#39;s opened.it definitely got busier as we were leaving around 5:15 pm so i would suggest getting here early if you want a seat at the bar.i can guarantee you though, i&#39;m going to go back and try it.love it.you&#39;re on a very busy chicago street.beers: 1 hurrahfood: 2 hurrahsservice: 3 hurrahsmy math is not what it used to be, i think this is 6 hurrahs.the menu is on the smaller side and they were out of 4 dishes when we went which was beyond disappointing.the pumpkin beer also was underwhelming.try it out!.my boyfriend got a flight and i had the paloma, bother were tasty.we went opening night and have gone back numerous times since.maybe this place is better for drinks.ambience and service was spectacular.love the selection of beers and the tasting tray &#34;i wish i tried&#34; but the watermelon beer was my favorite.it really can&#39;t be beat for enjoying the weather and a cold beer.for snacks, the pretzel is yummy.will happily go back.bothered we asked for ice in our waters (on a day when it was 82 and we sat outside) not personable, slow and irritated.this is a great deal and our paying ;) out of town guest immediately loved the place.service was great as well!.tonight, while walking home from cubs 1st playoff game and arrived at 11:20, only to be rudely greeted at door by what appeared to be a manager.i guess in light of that anticipation a little bit of disappointment was inevitable.something really cool that i liked about the place was the music..."

 absolutely.food menu; they have an extensive food menu, range from the most exotic to the most chinese american dishes ever.i forget the name of the drink i had on the second visit, but it was pretty strong, which the staff could tell by my nursing of it throughout the meal.they do have a second floor for more seating but it does get extremely busy around 10:30am.not only was the place spacious, but it was very clean and modern.i took the overseas visting inlaws here.the bbq pork was ok.at least they try to get everyone in and out.you&#39;ll quickly notice that this is definitely more of a modernized, &#34;fancy&#34; dim sum place.fortunately we barely beat the crowd when we arrived at 9:45am on sunday and was able to be seated within 5-10 minutes.i&#39;m coming back here i can&#39;t wait.service was very friendly as well.this was close by, but don&#39;t let the look and feel of this fool you.difficult to find much for vegetarian tastes.the food is good and people come back to eat at this place.i&#39;ve had delicious dim sum all over california, especially norcal.been coming here for 15 years since before minghin took over and the location was happy chef.so if you are assessing whether or not to go to this place i highly advise against it.their spice level is pretty mild however food taste good!price is reasonable and portion is big!! this place is clean with a little up scare tough.disappointedly, there was very few shiitake mushrooms in it.this was a very good choice for our vegetable.some of my favorite choices are the chicken feet and the egg yolk cream buns..came for dinner based on good reviews.it&#39;s not traditional in respect to the carts coming around to the tables.wow wow wow!!!my 2nd experience here in chinatown and once again i am reminded why i love asian cuisine as much as i do.5 stars* pan-fried dishes - stuffed pepper 3.the stir fried rice noodle dish did not have much beef in it at all.however, their congee definitely ran on the blander side (thus the one star dock), but as long as you avoid that, you&#39;ll be golden! if you&#39;re a dim sum fan, you have to come here.came in.my particular favorites were the pan-fried vegetable and pork bun, the short ribs with pepper sauce, and the mango pudding..menu is extremely lengthy and features a varied selection of so much good food (ie eel, tenderloins, ribs, fried rice, noodles, etc).it was very easy to call someone over to get the &#34;better&#34; hot chili oil sauce and add on to our order.get there early on weekends to avoid the chaotic lines!.we visited this place twice over the 3-day vacation in chicago.lines can be long on weekends but it is worth the wait.meh, some dishes were okay, but some were bland.it has never failed to impress me.they&#39;re slow.we were given a menu with pictures (similar to cai&#39;s), and some specials, and we checked off what we wanted.didn&#39;t like the green tea though lol.when it&#39;s not busy, the service is better, and when it does get busy, it can often be very rushed and the wait for food is longer.we started off with traditional egg rolls, pot stickers and salt and pepper shrimp especially since the grandchildren were hungry and had their fill.service: polite and quickfood: food was good, not amazing but good..unlike other dim sum spots where you have to basically yell at the lady pushing the carts to get her attention and get any food, you are presented a nice one sheet menu with photos next to every single item.the big fresh veggies were the best part.so i asked a different person that works there and after about 8 minutes she tells me they can&#39;t make that for another 2-3 hours..the food just wasn&#39;t served at the proper temperature! our pan fried vegetable skin had both canned mushrooms, canned water chestnuts, canned straw mushrooms and absolutely no flavor at all.pretty nice dim sum place.he said he would see if they were being prepared and if not he would cancel it.we looked over the dimsum menu that had the typical dimsum such as shuimai and shrimp dumplings, etc and we also ordered a large chicken congee &amp; stir fried udon noodle..i didn&#39;t love everything, but i think that&#39;s to be expected with dim sum.i will definitely be back my next trip to chicago.steer clear.i&#39;ve gone here a couple times for dim sum and am usually happy.i wished the curry flavor could be more pointed, but it was our favorite item due to its creativity and taste.no dim sum carts available.i wouldn&#39;t give this 5 stars as some of my other dishes just didn&#39;t taste as good as the beef chow fun, but overall i was able to leave super satisfied!."
litehouse-whole-food-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/litehouse-whole-food-grill-chicago,2,"Friendly staff, prompt service and great food options.very friendly staff.during cold weather i don&#39;t go here because i have to walk from harper so i tend to eat over there because it&#39;s closer to my office.i&#39;m in love with there dirty mustard dressing.the patience of job required.great music was being played which was a huge plus.i thought about bringing it back and complaining, but didn&#39;t want the hassle.people are so friendly and i never wait long for my food.when you are in a hurry and want a healthier fast food option this is the place to go.cannot wait to go back here! i wanted something healthy yet tasty and this place really hit the spot! i was so happy with the jerk chicken salad that i got, it was delicious and spicy and just what i needed to hit the spot.you say what you want and they&#39;ll put it together for you.the price was very good too!! we will definitely be back!!!.i hadn&#39;t eaten much all day, though, so when i got home, i was intent on ordering a tasty burrito or something for late-night study-hunger.typically restaurants are great at keeping you posted about when your food will arrive.mine was good as well but i only ateabout 3 bites.was riding around hp and decided to stop here to eat.i went out of my way to visit this establishment (based on all the awesome reviews) and they were closed.although there were fries sitting there, they made me a fresh batch.the cranberry chicken salad was delicious, and the lemonade is freshly homemade.i want to love everything about them, but they are not consistent.besides that great food..a welcome thing in hyde park, and the world!..customer service (phone included) is the key to any successful business.great food, i&#39;ve eaten here more times than i can count.i didn&#39;t like that the tacos were on corn tortillas but the filling was good.service is sometimes a little slow.puts chipotle to shame.he insisted to rectify promptly.you will need to call to find out if they are open before planning a trip there, but once there your in for a treat!.the only black business that i wholeheartedly support with no reservations in hyde park.i also made sure to pick up some loni loo&#39;s candies.you have the option to pick directly from the menu or to create your own.perfect place for incredible healthy tasty fast food.the food is good, but the service really stinks!  they mess things up all the time and then act rude when you ask them to fix it.the food is tasty and healthy.the second red flag was when i payed for my food with cash, i did not receive a receipt.to the food! try everything especially the sweet potato fries and the waffle fries and salads !!but who really enjoys salads , so much work chewing and chomping on the lettuce..i also had the sweet tea and it was good.i will not go back.love the atmosphere.the experiences have mostly ranged from mediocre to bad.plenty of things to choose from on the menu..i gave them a chance and man did they fail! i don&#39;t care who the owners are, but they need to get cooks in there that know what they are doing!with that i&#39;m going to find something to fix this stomach ache i have from eating their food.a similar concept to chipotle with way better ingredients, options, and flavor !  i always get jerk salmon or tofu as s protein and it is delicious ! i enjoy having fresh spinach and different cheese like feta.also, the phone is always going to voicemail when i try to order ahead of time, since the wait time is usually upwards 20 minutes or more.but they are never accurate with the time at how long it takes to prepare the free..the girl at the cash register was super sweet though.wishing i would have taken a few of there jerk tofu wraps home with me!it&#39;s by far the best vegetarian food i&#39;ve had!.sweet potato fries are great and i really like the jerked salmon bowl with rice.p.feels like the magical sparkle from my first few visits has faded into a dim and fading light.the restaurant expects customers to order to the right.the staff is also very helpful and friendly as well.this is the first stop on my journey and it didn&#39;t disappoint.i&#39;m pretty sure this isn&#39;t true.i had to try it out because it looked so delicious!!! i came alone the 1st time, the next time i had my mom in tote and then the next couple of times i had both my parents and my sister or brother.i create my own burrito, usually with steak as my meat, and it is always good.i do wish, however, that there was an indian or middle eastern option, as there is an &#34;asian&#34; option, an italian, mediterranean, and mexican.the place reminded me of a chipotle.the food is amazing, we love the jerk salmon bowls, the wraps jerk salmon or jerk chicken, the fresh cut fries, the in-house lemonade, etc.when we asked questions about choices of dressing we were given attitude.the food was good considering the long wait.one of the best places to spend you&#39;re lunch break in hyde park.i ordered the jerk mango salmon salad and omg so good..they also have tacos, nachos and pizza with a gluten free option, sides, and desserts."
mfk-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mfk-chicago-2,1,"We were a group of five and it didn&#39;t take long for us to be seated.our waitress paired it with a orangey liquor based drink called shrub rocks which totally &#34;rocked&#34;.the small plates we enjoyed:the ceviche: so many fresh flavors packed into two bites.between the loud rock music and loud conversations (people had to shout to hear each other), the noise level was to the point of being uncomfortable.basque bread wasn&#39;t amazing, pass on that.recommended to anybody who wants to eat at a somewhat creative spanish inspired seafood place in town.our evening out to mfk was a bit of a last hurrah so i was pleased that it did not disappoint.some of us found those items extremely delicious.that never happens at ruxbin, boho or yusho, and it was enough to make me never want to return again.there are about 8 spots available at the bar and we had to ask a group to move to accommodate the two of us.&#34;  i&#39;m like, um..amazing cocktails and wine recommendations.told me that a lot of yelpers liked their boquerones, i was skeptical.the space is cute, but an open kitchen at a seafood restaurant means you have to schedule a shower after dinner unless you want you want a layer of eau de poisson on you all night.even though it was in the basement, it was bright and airy; it was kind of loud, but we could still hear each other fine.(i m checking if i can get them shipped to me daily via fed ex!!!).the scallop with risotto was rich, creamy and decadent - so good.the food was fantastic - standouts were the ceviche, whole shrimp in chili oil, meatballs and brussels sprouts.i tried the flight of the opera and found it interesting and well mixed.out waitress was really sweet though, maybe she had her hands full elsewhere.the frying preparation and the taste are phenomenal, and the aioli dipping sauce went so well with it.the drinks finally came at the 30 minute mark.i could sit here for hours at lunch (and i have) and try numerous dishes on the menu plus a glass or two or three of wine.my advice here is do not pick the two-people seat in the middle as grass leaves would poke right in your face..service was top notch.aside from the terrific food, the space is bright and airy and a pleasant place to be.the dishes are simple but fresh and very well done.make a reservation before heading here! space is very limited..but the combo of everything.the service was excellent without being overly formal, the space was nice without being ostentatious, and the food was excellent without the possibility of having shredded truffles for a $20 surcharge.mfk is a cute, little spot with only a couple of tables, seats by the bar, and a small tapa style menu.date night with the lady, we sat at the bar and roger clearly knows his menu and took great care of us.shrimp w/chili oil: ok, skip this, nothing special..he shared recipes and favs off the menu.this is like a communal table.heard big star there last night and happy that their specials board had a shout out to bowie....the space is small, minimalist and modern but still intimate, although it did feel a little brightly lit.can&#39;t recommend it enough.&#34;first we eat, then we do everything else.went yesterday with my gf and we were completely blown away by the amazing food, decor, and overall hospitality.everything was good, but highlights were the ceviche and skirt steak - ceviche tasted really fresh and the skirt steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly.good service and ambiance.we ordered over 90$ of food and pretty much went home hungry.an unassuming facade adorned with small foliage and a denuded sign that simply reads &#34;mfk.female bartender was friendly and fun to chat with.i made a booking for the wrong date and although the restaurant was empty, she did not want us to give a table and asked us to sit at the bar.the.it was so lovely and the food was, as always, delicious! i can&#39;t recommend mfk enough!.it&#39;s a very small room, so i strongly reccomend making a reservation!.it was raining, so we did not dare venture to the outdoor seating..found this tiny restaurant during a girls trip to chicago when we were searching for cocktails.in short: a hit or miss menu depending on your specific taste preferences..we chose 4 tapas, and the chef chose the order they were brought out in..don&#39;t go in without a reservation though - the space is tiny!the menu is always changing but be sure to order the ceviche.by the end of the night, there was a total of 6 orders made for croquettes: 2 for starters, 2 during the main course, and 2 for dessert.the female bartending was rather unfriendly, but my husband and i don&#39;t drink, so had limited exposure to her.the only thing that stops me from rating this place 5 stars is the cold and impersonal service at the bar.the waiter with the pink hair is super snobby and contrary to what the site says that reservations are not required.the basement ambiance is clean and colorful stimulating your visual palate as well.and the foods you really want to stick into your mouth hole and go nomnomnomnom..i hear their basque cake is wonderful, but we waited so long for our waiter to come around, we just decided to ask for our check.yes, i ordered 4 breakfasts.we essentially ordered everything that was on the menu."

high-five-ramen-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/high-five-ramen-chicago-4,2,"Super small restaurant with about 15 seats, feels very exclusive-the type of place anthony bourdain would approve of.10/10 loved it and will be back.she usually gets veggie broth of some sort of bond broth creation.service was slow as well.every spoonful was delicious.i highly recommend high five to anyone who is looking for top notch ramen with a hip and welcoming ambience.my dinner mate and i ordered the special ramen (clam instead of pork belly).soft boiled egg is made perfect every time.neither was too spicy to enjoy and i highly recommend both.i actually used to be obsessed with all ramen but after trying high five ramen all other places disappoint.my personal favorite is either the special (they change it and the last one i had was with sea food, the current is vegetarian i believe), or the chicken one.we had to enter through green city smoked meats.the wait to get in this spot can be up to 2 hours because of the limited seating.so i will give it 3.it is an awesome atmosphere, and has great drink options and music.we get to the end and see a small dark place that is kind of crowded since other ppl are there too and a guy greets us and puts down our names to text you when a seat is ready bc it&#39;s an hour wait (it was past 6 pm which is typical), so we walk around.-also the soft boiled egg is cooked to molten perfection.time.we waited for an hour after putting our name in.you will not be disappointed, the broth is godly, the noodles are heavenly and pretty sure when i bit into the pork belly angels sang...first sip of the soup, it was this savory, warmth that filled my body.go here.my favorite is the pork belly，have to try it!!!..i suggest coming early otherwise there might be a long wait as the space can really only accommodate maybe 16 people at a time.not your normal/traditional japanese  ramen, so don&#39;t come here expecting the normal ramen taste and you won&#39;t be disappointed..s.finish it with their japanese beer and call it a good night.loved this place..eating it is a visceral sensation that hurts in the best way possible.i also really like the set up - sure there&#39;s an insanely long wait at times but if you come with a group it becomes an event.overall, i was not that impressed.the ramen was so spicy that i couldn&#39;t feel my taste buds for days.5.it has a dark, intimate atmosphere that&#39;s perfect for enjoying your comfort food..i love my bamboo shoots!!by the way, it can be a little hard to find the first time.the ramen.the egg is consistently soft boiled to perfection.the egg was cooked perfectly, still runny on the inside, and the pork was soft and flavourful.i&#39;ve tried many of the ramen spots in town and this is my favorite.i got the high five ramen, full spice, and asked for an extra seasoned egg (good egg, btw).before coming to this place i read a few other reviews saying to get there by 5:30 a least, which is like half an hour before they even open.ever see those small tea-candle holders?  picture that.i also tried their coconut drink which was pretty good, considering i&#39;m not a fan of coconut.high five ramen has ruined me forever.while the ramen itself was not bad, i missed the rich, hearty flavor that is typical of more traditional ramen shops-- the broth tasted pretty &#34;flat,&#34; and the only flavor i could taste was the spiciness (although the lemon aftertaste in the seafood ramen gave it a nice bright aftertaste)...they should create a priority club to join; and i&#39;d ensure my ramen addiction loyalty would lay here and only here.the tan tan noodle is so good, se vice versa is super friendly and fast.it&#39;s just not your typical ramen.other than that, perfect-o!.i got the regular high five, and my cousin the high five/no spice.were it at any other restaurant, there&#39;d be a warning label on it..the wait can get annoying at times, but it tends to go quickly..chicago..it literally taste like noodles with thick gravy on top.slush drinks: we ordered the coconut painkiller and the corpse reviver #2, besides being the size of a 7-11 sample cup that you get free on july 11, it reminded me of horrible mixed drinks at all-inclusive resorts, that you just drink cause it&#39;s all-inclusive.i don&#39;t believe that i would have known how to find this place without him.i loved that we could monitor how long our wait was via an app, and we ventured upstairs to one of our favorite, green street meats, to have a drink while we waited.the place is very small and the wait can be quite long to be seated.i always judge ramen by the broth and the broth here was very pleasant."

i wasn&#39;t wearing any lipstick.overall i would compare the food to au cheval - the long wait that u get at au cheval lol.i will be back to this chill spot for sure..had the chicken wings, will definitely be coming back!.we especially liked the rock shrimp and scotch egg.they were playing late 90s music that reminded me of high school (don&#39;t you dare do the math!), but it wasn&#39;t so loud that we couldn&#39;t have a conversation.yummmmm just moved to the area and am very happy to live so close to this delicious spot.excited to try more things on my next visit and to sit on the patio!.stopped by here for a quick drink.great little place at the edge of the west loop and on my dog walking path.the bartenders were laid back, not pretentious or &#34;too cool&#34;.when our server brought out the food, she had kindly put both sauces on the side (a+ for service and her thoughtfulness)! the fresh, tanginess of the brussels sprouts went well with each bite of that delicious smoked mac.super friendly, great food, great cocktails, great patio.so delicious!  definitely i will return.what happened to the summer menu! my husband and i craved the mixed salads, skewers, and wings..the egg was poached well, and the crab was bland and not worth the money.between the rootbeer and bourbon cocktail, rye punch with foam, burger with fried egg and deliciously crunchy fries, lemony brussels sprouts with sorel mushroom, and fall off the bone chicken lollipops, we licked our plates clean..i came in with a gaggle and girlfriends for girls&#39; night last saturday and fell in love with this place! the service was attentive without being overbearing, the atmosphere was cozy (the perfect dim lighting - you know, the kind that sets the mood and makes everyone more attractive), and the drinks (obviously the most important factor) were fantastic!i had the doc&#39;s fist (a lightly sweetened, tangy vodka beverage) and it was perfectly balanced, without being stingy on the fun juice.my love for this place grows with every visit.i ordered the scallops (yum!!!) would defiantly come back.great service, really good food.it was a bit dark a little more lightly would have be nice but i was sitting towards the back.just a suggestion (insert that teeth baring grin emoji smiley here.not cheap but the patio&#39;s worth it.we we&#39;re biking around when we stumbled into this joint.he has, for years, been the most attentive and professional server ever.wow! this place is the true definition of a hidden geml my boyfriend and i came in here after wanting to try this place for a long time..we were there with my older father for dinner."

oyster-bah-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/oyster-bah-chicago,1,"Wow, way better than i expected..we had a long wait (75 minutes) which was expected for a group of 4 on a saturday night at a newly opened restaurant in lp.we sat in the back but the bar looked really cool.i loved the &#34;boat feel&#34; of the space and the cozier vibe.pretty cool place.when we mentioned that they were smaller than expected she brought out an enormous oyster for us to taste.everything we had was amazing so i recommend it all! the oysters, crab bites, clam chowder, and poke were the apps worth getting.will definitely visit again.the crab cake was big and delicious, it went well with their mustard/mayo sauce.when we asked her a question about one bottle in particular and she didn&#39;t know, she brought the manager, rose, to our table.we had made reservations earlier in the week without a problem.they know what they are doing, follow the lead!.dina was fabulous! she suggested great items and was wonderful with the oyster selection! we ordered the lobster roll, seafood salad, poke, oysters and ceviche! the seafood salad was unforgettable.shrimp and grits were better than i&#39;ve ever had in new orleans...as i asked for some dessert, the server suggested that i should try their coconut cake i i did order one, it&#39;s pretty delicious, price is  a little high but still i wanted to come back for more yum dishes.what you can expect from lettuce entertain you restaurant.this is the kind of restaurant you hope you can find when you come to a big city like chicago! we walked in at 6pm and we&#39;re seated immediately.for the table we shared an order of the roasted broccoli and the cajun dirty rice.not a deal breaker, i just would have gotten those specific 2 or only half a dozen.the char grilled and broiled oysters were pretty decent, but over salted..my fiancé had the fried and i had the grilled.we dined at naoki the previous week (another leye spot) and they should just steal their rice recipe!fries--because we wanted fries but opted for rice with the snapper, we got them as a side order.it was also very warm inside on a hot day.and if she sends you down the basement to the &#34;crab shack&#34;, know that the space there is even tinier so all the people who didn&#39;t fit upstairs are now downstairs.for appetizers, my boyfriend and i ordered some of the oysters the waiter recommended, and also the fried calamari.glad to see an oyster bar opening up further north!  what a fun and great place.smaller portion, but it was a nice share item.we were sat right next to the open front facing window on a beautiful day.he mad an exception and let us choose the oysters we wanted and it came with tabasco ice and guinness ice.it&#39;s not a huge place but the tables are spaced such that you get a seafood shack feel with quality not all fried food options.i would definitely return for the oysters.we ordered the happy hour oysters, crab leg appetizer, and poke.maybe in the summer months it will be easier, but the door got very backed up and for the 30 minute wait i was bumped into and moved about 20 times.the bread was fresh and the pickles were tasty too.we got the coconut cake for dessert which is a must try! the vibe is very casual and our server, renee, was great.i made a reservation for my husband and two girls on a saturday afternoon around 3pm thinking it wouldn&#39;t be the busiest time which is good since i&#39;m bringing my kids.you can tell fresh seafood and this place definitely had it.that&#39;s probably not going to be my reality anytime soon, but eating at oyster bah sure filled that void.my friends got the shrimp and grits and it looked awesome as well.overall the food was amazing, i only wish the cocktail menu was a little more developed, but i&#39;ll definitely be back!.we had the seafood trio for dinner and it was sad.ask your server to show you how to cut it! the mussels were good but very sandy, i understand how fresh they are so it didn&#39;t bother me but bothered the people i was dining with.unfortunately i didn&#39;t know what &#39;spawning&#39; was until i went home and googled &#34;oyster soft creamy yuck&#39;.- oyster definitely tasted fresh and the menu changes daily.the food is a bit pricey, but fresh and delicious.i think i&#39;d stick with the raw options.chicago is a hard market to be a restaurant in since there are soooo many good options too choose from, but overall the oyster bah is another solid seafood option to add to the list..salad ,lettuce below average.best oysters i&#39;ve ever had, even better than what i&#39;ve had in boston! i had the crispy red snapper which was so delicious and came with an awesome spicy thai sauce.my husband ordered the new england seafood platter, and i had the thai red snapper.meanwhile, dina would check in with me without being intrusive.but it&#39;s the side of thai sauce that really sets this apart! it&#39;s so good they should bottle it!get this and enjoy!.it was juicy, cheesy, and filling (especially with the fries).it&#39;s the only dessert they have and the only dessert i may ever eat again- amazing!.you push out the meat and we had 2 dips for them.overrated.come and sit in the basement in the crab cellar..the fried oysters were okay but it wasn&#39;t anything to wow us with.may come back again for bloodys and mussels but not crab cakes."
osteria-la-madia-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-la-madia-chicago,2,"Got entrees at 9.i  also had a slice of my friends margherita pizza and it was equally tasty.this last visit we ordered the parma classic and the arugula on our pizza was old and full of wilted holes.maybe the food is better dining in.knowing that you are having a party of about 30 people, they should have been better prepared in the kitchen.i went with the pea and parmesan risotto which was warm (not hot) and probably re-heated, extremely soupy and lacked any seasoning whatsoever apart from the cress on top which i didn&#39;t like at all.their spinach tellagio and pizza fondue are what keeps me coming back.for $22 the brunch includes a starter, one entree or pizza (which is 6 slices), and a glass of prosecco or a bellini.step five:  take victory lap around the venue (pants optional) before being asked to leave.this family was loud, and the kids were way too old to behave this way.bravo!.and service was spot on all night.make sure if go in on monday you ask for the buy one get  one free pizza.they do a nice job.had my first meal at osteria la madia this past sunday, and it feels like the beginning of a wonderful relationship.i mean, that&#39;s just stupidity.the chicken, spinach, &amp; ricotta ravioli was okay.their mushroom appetizer was really good as well.he brought us our bill for $40 for 2 drinks and the appetizer which we paid and left.no waiting and perfect prix fixe menu, two courses and a choice of bellini or prosecco.lesson learned.her knowledge of the menu was very excellent, and she was very helpful for us to find the best options as we were all vegetarian.some must tries are:*taleggio &amp; 3 hour roasted grapes pizza -*housemade fennel sausage &amp; sweet onions pizza -*triple pepperoni pizza -*laura chenel goat cheese pizza.caesar salad good, and i would come back for some more pizza.monday lunch special is a bargain! buy 1 pizza get the 2nd pizza free! i had the triple pepperoni and my friend had the sausage and they were very tasting.thanks la madia! you&#39;re the best!to the chef..absolutely love la madia! i brought my girlfriends in for my birthday and we had the best time!we ordered a ton of stuff and everything was amazing.i was very disappointed.i personally had the pappardelle with wild boar bolognese, which was delicious.i would highly recommend this place for a weekday lunch or dinner.we split a mushroom pizza (as good as i remembered) and a salad that wasn&#39;t.artichokes were amazing and pizza was thin crusted, wood fired, and to also get entertainment included with dinner try sitting at the chef&#39;s counter where you watch it all being prepared.pizza was effin amazing..eventually the manager came with the check..yum!artichoke appetizer was amazing too!...came here for a double date night..i think the part that really made this meal hard to enjoy was the fact that it was about 80 degrees out with high humidity and they had the whole front of the restaurant open with no ac on.our server was fantastic and super helpful with recommendations and accommodating.our main was a tasty chicken milano that put two breaded cutlets on a bed of ratatouille and orzo with an emulsified citrus eggplant sauce.i have a new respect for polenta.it was so delicious..still, the bartender rarely visited our table.i would say it&#39;s more sterile, especially in the front room.there are plenty of large tables to seat parties and this place is super dynamic.we&#39;ve been a regular customer since they opened, ordering take-out pizzas probably once a month.good! i had been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally a friend and i made it.all very up to chicago dining standards.this is my second visit here and this gets 4 stars for the pizza.also getting doughnuts automatically as your brunch starter is so amazing.now it&#39;s just another average place with above average decor.highly recommend the spinach white truffle fondue and the brick-oven pizzas.i had the gnudi the first evening (yeah, we came back the next night) and the tagliatelle the second- both were amazing.i got the taleggio pizza with roasted grapes, which was an inventive and tasty pizza combo, but the taste was really based in the quality of the taleggio than any culinary artistry.the carrots were good and the white pork belly with kale pizza was also very good."

kurah-mediterranean-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kurah-mediterranean-chicago-2,2,"The first, and largest drawback, is the price is going to add up quickly.someone somewhere (thrillist, perhaps?) gave major kudos to kurah&#39;s shawerma wraps, but i fail to see the greatness.even though the food was well portioned and seasoned, it wasn&#39;t worth the great reviews posted on yelp.it had a wonderful aroma and tasted great.delicious steak and chicken kabobs.the rib eye kabob with saffron rice also was a decent portion and can even be shared.our guy and another lady.the music was awful negative 1 star.highly recommended.great food, terrific service and  wonderful people.the ambiance was nice.loving this food! falafel is the best i&#39;ve ever had and the spicy hummus is amazing.this place needs to tighten the ship hardcore and can easily ascend to 4 stars..all in all, i would come back here again, but mostly to try to lamb dishes..this is a great place if you are on a date, craving some mediterranean fare, or just looking for a good meal on a weeknight..we shared the lamb and chicken kabobs.genuinely one of my favorite places to eat in the south loop.the wraps are huge, you get your money&#39;s worth there.the shawarma options (chicken, beef, etc.their kabobs are fantastic as is their falafel sandwich.we were looking for a bite after a visit to the field museum.food was just ok.there was an upstairs with more seating.i get that &#34;tapas&#34; means small plates, but these tapas were more like &#34;tapas tapas,&#34; very small plates.friendly and cozy restaurant, we enjoyed the biryani &amp; grilled shrimp entrees which were delicious and fresh.did not taste good.ordered for delivery via door dash...it is not really a tapas place anymore - now it&#39;s just a fairly expensive mediterranean-style restaurant.nuff said.i was just surprised that they had no issue with denying someone food - pre-prepared hummus no less! - who plans on drinking $75 worth of booze.i am wondering how this place has a four star average? there are several other options far less expensive and far more delicious.as for the entre i got the combo grill with chicken and kofta.amazing greek food and great vibe.our appetizers (of bread--yeah, it&#39;s not free, you have to order a basket of bread) came out very late.i could get the same thing with probably better quality for cheaper in other locations.don&#39;t miss it.the food was so good and perfect for sharing (if you are into that type of stuff) or not.quite bizarre to watch over the proceedings of some start up talking about their going&#39;s on while munching away on pita and hummus.the manager also came to check on us at one point! recommended! i need to try menu items.i should mention that i wanted the bacon wrapped dates without bacon and even though they said that they are pre-made they went out of their way to make them how i wanted!.they have a nice alcove for larger parties.the biryani was really interesting with honey roasted almonds, pine nuts and golden raisins complementing the lamb and chicken.started off with the sangria(had lots of fresh fruit) and the complimentary pita bread which was good...another flub was that an umbrella stand in their outdoor seating area was pushed up against the side of the building adjacent to our indoor table, and was banging against the window due to the wind; when we brought this to the server&#39;s attention, we got a shrug, but he didn&#39;t seem to know what to do about it.:)..the only negative is that they don&#39;t have a double door so it&#39;s pretty cold inside in the winter from the door constantly opening.excellent food, great cocktails and yummy desserts.the staff was super duper nice, the decor is so cleverly put together, the bar is the right size not to become obnoxious, the owner is not just very respectable but quite good looking to boot and finally - the food is just right!what we had: appetizers: tabouli (this was fluffy and light), baba ganoush (it had just the perfect amount of lemob in it, other than that i would have loved to get a bit more), bacon wrapped dates (i want more more more - delicious!), wrapped grape leaves (very meaty! and it came with little stuffed peppers, cute), lentil soup (oh my goodness this was so tasty! it was a tiny bit spicy but in the exact proportion that it needed to be).blatantly average falafel for exorbitant prices.this put a damper on the evening.good food and service! love the garlic smash!.i didn&#39;t even need a knife the meat was so tender.i&#39;m kinda of new to lebanese so we tried several dishes."

(you know the kind! where the bread just shatters into powder when you so much as look at it)seriously though.handmade, simple, tasty pork filling and generous dollop of sour cream.this wasn&#39;t a knock on the taste, but just an observation that this isn&#39;t necessarily a dessert item.otherwise solid.some items i find a little over priced.the crepes were incredibly fresh tasting and delicious, and the sweet cheese filling was rich, for a perfect combination.i couldn&#39;t help but think of i love you man and the great chocolat debate when i first saw the name.nice selection of ukrainian food that&#39;s made from scratch.and i had a beef stew that came in a clay pot.i literally live right around the corner from this place.i enjoyed the mushroom pierogi.both reminded me of a grandma&#39;s home cooked meal...can&#39;t go wrong with the savory pierogi or pelmeni.it is one thing to have rancid meat in the kitchen, accidents happen, but to serve it to a customer?!!! horrifying..also, our waitress was super sweet..everything was set up on time and ready to go..she made us feel welcomed and we look forward to our next visit.my pierogies were light, but certainly not the best i have ever had.tried the potato pancakes with mushroom sauce and sorry to say they are infinitely better than those my baba makes.it is my first time tasting ukrainian food and it was amazing! the carrot salad is so good (a little bit garlicky side for me, but still good).my parents got the vareniki, which are like pierogi&#39;s stuffed with different things.you could order in dozen or 1/2 dozen increments.i&#39;ll admit they are a bit newer to us, just the past few years, but these took the cake for numero 1 top perogis in our book.atmosphere: comfortable, well lit, quiet, peaceful, clean.very tempting but i was there to try one thing: pelmeni.my guests loved it and felt at home.maybe i&#39;m not a fan of european desserts - not sweet or rich enough for my palate(4 + 3 + 2)/3 = 3 stars :)..we love this place.there are only 2 waitresses for saturday lunch.."

we went last night and had a great dinner!! my fiancée is hard to impress when it comes to asian food and he loves it!get the tuna tower! it&#39;s amazing now i could eat the entire thing (which is large!) by myself!!the cheese balls are like their take on crab rangoon and they do not disappoint!!!  there is actual crab in them and so fresh and yummy!!!the shasimi platter was good but not outstanding.this place has really good ramen, and thats the main reason i go here.given the number of sushi establishments in the area, to be a standout in the crowd is tough but kameya stands out every time.the bread sticks and the sauce it&#39;s served with is absolutely fantastic~ i always ask for an additional side of the sauce to mix into my ramen.loved the tuna tartar too.i&#39;ve been looking forward to return for more sushi, but the location is busy so parking can be tough.all of his ingredients are of high-quality, and the dishes are always presented with a clean and graceful arrangement.like, 6 tables small.wow! the food and service were both incredible.friendly.the staff is so personable and the chef aims to please! white ocean roll, dynamite roll, beef and veg ramen all five stars!a great intimate setting for any night..i want to try the ramen next, as it sounded very good.the owners are wonderful, kind, and attentive.it is not byob anymore!!.great service &amp; food!.it is a cozy place so it is better for dates instead of group dinners..the serving staff was also friendly.every time.i&#39;m still trying to figure out what it is - they simply call it &#34;french sauce&#34; - but it has notes of that honey citron tea you can get from korean markets..i would definitely call ahead since there are only about 6-7 tables..the beef was incredibly tender and flavorful and once the ramen was gone i played &#34;find the beef&#34; until i&#39;d extracted every single scrap left.p.definitely will come back.kameya ramen - bbq pork and vegetables with japanese style noodles.each roll was unique and we had an amazing date night.food quality doesnt justify the price at all.kinda suffocating.this is a great place with good fish with large portions and the owners are very accommodating..we each got delicious ramen - me pork, her chicken - and split two signature rolls (don&#39;t remember which ones, exactly, i want to say lava and dragon, but they were amazing).there are very few restaurants that create unique dishes that earn a spot on my cravings hitlist--the tuna tower is one of them.i&#39;ve grown accustomed to making a usual order for myself - the kameya ramen and the spicy salmon seaweed salad (and of course, i&#39;m nabbing a few pieces of sushi from my fellow restaurant-goer).excellent little sushi and ramen spot.came here w/ some friends to celebrate a birthday.ate here several times, would recommend the tuna tartar tower.service is pleasant with a neighborhood vibe (especially when noodle bowls are returned from next door).all you need to know is..bottom line, it&#39;s ok if you live closeby and want some sushi or ramne, though ironically everyone who dined at that restaurant during our stay ordered ramen, so i can&#39;t testify to how good their sushi is.so, after getting over that disappointment, i settled in with some sushi.this place is no longer byob, but you can bring your dog for the sidewalk seating.sarah and john run this hidden gem that any sushi fan cannot pass up.i like to start every review at an even 3 stars and work from there.bamboo shoots were surprisingly soft..we had the udon noodles, white ocean roll, and orange roll.that&#39;s the reason for the 3 star rating.i love the food and the service.) but we decided to stay and try since it has 4.it is an adorable, small, charming place.it&#39;s a tiny place so i really enjoy the atmosphere as well.and the ramen came out very standard, no matter the soup base or chashu pork.a different take on sushi than i&#39;ve had but i appreciated the creativity.re-rated: kameya is a stellar neighborhood spot that dishes up amazing food.i&#39;d come back for the bulgogi but probably not the ramen.give this place a shot and it may turn into your favorite place to eat in chicago!.the sushi is so delicious and they have a big selection of sake.first, i&#39;d recommend the tuna tartar tower, jalapeño spicy tuna cheese, and the kameya bbq pork buns (they&#39;re a must!) for appetizers.the restaurant is nearby and i&#39;m likely to go again if i need ramen especially after 10 pm when other ramen restaurants are closed.the expectations need to be set to par at times..the chef is nice and cute as well..it tasted smoky, but really plain..show up at the restaurant just now, and was told they only we&#39;ve ramen over the weekend."

(though i would wish the sandwich sear on the one we received was a little less black on the top--added a burnt taste to parts.delicious.not as big of a menu as kanelas which is close by, but everything they have is perfect.all else was perfect :-).i didn&#39;t eat here and don&#39;t want to tamper good reviews, but when i came here for an espresso based drink i was told they are transitioning to just a bar.the atmosphere is so cozy and the craft that goes into each item shows that there is a passion in every detail.i will be back many times i&#39;m sure, looking forward to trying some of the baked goods, pastries, etc.sit on their adorable back patio.i absolutely love the atmosphere here--there&#39;s a cute patio in the back, and the shop itself is very well decorated.will be back to try the biscuit and cookies.also you order at the counter first and seat yourself and get all your utensils / sugar/ creamer.you should be able to order food sit down then pay after you consume therefore allowing you to tip after.i am a fan of consistency.we ordered what we thought were entrees (due to the price).this place is cozy, hip and the food is both creative and delicious.i liked the creamy buratta with spicy eggplant relish..it was about $15 total.granola dish was excellent, potatoes were excellent, tea was excellent, and staff was friendly and courteous.good food, small portions, over priced.such a cool place..this restaurant cafe makes up for the loss of birchwood."
jinya-ramen-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jinya-ramen-bar-chicago,1,"The broth was flavorful.premium ramen white is our young daughter&#39;s favorite.the brussel sprouts looked interesting as it was deep fried.as far as the wonton chicken ramen, it was just okay and could use more flavor.yum! i&#39;d like to try more of the food here.can&#39;t go wrong here if you are craving ramen.this i am not happy about because with just the crashu chicken, noodles, sprouts and scallions a bowl will cost you $13!i&#39;ll definitely come back if i&#39;m in the area!.spicy chicken broth was very rich and satisfying, but noodles were a little soft for my liking if i were to go back, i would try thick.plus we have to order the egg separately! ambience and location is ok but that&#39;s that..although the jinya tonkotsu ramen is a tad bit more in price, it left me slightly disappointed--the thin noodles were not as appetizing as the thick noodles that came with the tonkotsu assari ramen.great spot to get your ramen fix.the soup was flavorable, thick, and hearty and the chasu was very soft as well.however, despite the wilted salad and smelly veggies, the soup was edible and tasted even better once i dumped a truckload of sriracha in it.add ins different broth options and lots of ingredients are all available.the broth was good, but i didn&#39;t like the way my noodles were cooked.but i should point out our table along with others who were seated near the waiting area, had to deal with some trivial inconvenience.had both thick and thin noodles, and no issues there.i also felt that it lacked a bit of flavor as well.it&#39;s not bad tastes like milk pudding.it was pretty good.anyway，if you r asian as me ，don&#39;t let this place ruins your day.two times experiences in jinya ramen made me to leave 1 star here.what else do you need?.nothing to really call home about.its all dente if you not tell the cook.) wish it came with more broth!.service was friendly and fast; no problem getting in during the lunch ours during the work week.the low lighting and cool music was fun though, the place was clean, and for the price points the ramen was quite good so it still gets 4 stars.i cannot get over that i paid $21 via uber eats for a bowl of broth and less than 2oz of chicken.ordered the cha cha cha &#34;for garlic lovers&#34; and it was good, but i&#39;ve certainly had better.yea! found myself a good ramen noodle shop in the city! the taste and aroma of the tonkatsu broth is just outstanding!  it&#39;s silky, not too salty, and rich all at the same time.against my better judgement i ordered from this place.awesome awesome ramen! great selection of toppings to customize your dish.the service was friendly, but the two waitresses that served us weren&#39;t very knowledgeable about the menu.jinya tonkatsu black- creamy, hearty, garlicky goodness!! omg this is one of the best bowls of ramen i&#39;ve had in my life and i&#39;m from california.but i&#39;m glad i decided to check out jinya--i really enjoyed my meal here.parking can be difficult, but what else can you expect in lincoln park? as pleased as i was that this place opened up, i was equally as hesitant since i knew it was a chain.so they have a deal for free chicken appetizer for a yelp review.i wish they gave you the option of picking thick or thin with the order.none of the &#34;combos&#34; were available yet and nobody picked up the phone that i was waiting on for 10 mins so we didn&#39;t find out that it was byob till they got their license.the ramen itself is good, but for the price/portion size/wait, i&#39;m sure there&#39;s better available.we got our food and had to flag down the server after 10 minutes.i kept thinking they should add some color or something to make the items more appetizing.the one thing that was a bit weird was that the vegetable ramen came with so much lettuce/greens on top- but once they soaked up the broth the flavor was delicious..good ramen with thick noodles i like their tonkatsu ramen.instead the manager could only offer to pay back the cost of the pork.dinner was $15 each, but the helpings were very generous, making it worth the price.serviceable ramen, but small portion size for the price.i ordered the tonkatsu black with chicken katsu and a strawberry sake.i was pleasantly surprised.great to have authentic ramen house in lakeview..it was just ok, nothing really popped out at me.i came here for lunch, so far i have been waiting for my ramen noodle for 55 min but no luck.pleasantly surprised and will be back for sure.the ramen is tasty, but overpriced for what it is."

masa-azul-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/masa-azul-chicago,2,"We started off with ordering guacamole and a couple of salsa..masa azul has one of the greatest selections in the country of tequilas, mezcals, and other spirits made from cousins of the agave plant (sotol, bacanora, raicilla, etc).as for the food.i ordered the carne asada and baja shrimp tacos and they were amazing! it didn&#39;t matter that  they were so small because they were delicious.literally the best tequila cocktails! recommend heart of the dead and from dusk til&#39; dawn.food is average, especially in a city that does really good mexican.only regrets that i didn&#39;t come sooner.but let&#39;s reflect on where the romance began..handmade tortillas, very goodceviche - mild and fresh.the plantains were great as well with the perfect savory yet subtly sweet flavor..other yummy looking dishes on the yelp page are gone.i love masa azul because the staff is welcoming, attentive, and flexible.and i&#39;ve tried &#39;em all, folks!perfect balance of tequila and coconut cream.*tortillas are hand made-small but full of flavor*tinga- aka smoked chicken thigh in chipotle saucey goodness-*baja shrimp is no joke.yum..our server was kelsey b, who was very attentive and welcoming.picking a place that none of us has tried always makes me me a little nervous; my hesitation was quickly put at ease when i saw how packed the place was.s.i&#39;d come back any time and try other cocktails and the wide range of tacos.the dining room is small and intimate and the smells coming out of the kitchen are intoxicating.the food has gone thru several transitions between executive chefs, so the food is a 3.green sauce is good.the owner was really accommodating with our reservation and the food was really good.we have only tried the appetizers and the drinks so far, but they are the best!if you are not sure what drink to pick, get the pablo, you can never go wrong with it!.this is one of those restaurants that showed to me how different chicago &amp; seattle are.the cheese on this sandwich packs a punch, and the avocado spread provides a perfect balance to the spiciness of the shrimp.great drinks &amp; beer list!  the menu is actually kinda small.we started with drinks, i had the explorador which was inventive and delicious and my boyfriend had the velador (sp?) it was essentially a $8+ shot, he said it wasn&#39;t bad but he also opted for a solid modelo negro on the next round.the food was good.the one thing that was lacking was good service.and drinks were tasty and refreshing!the shrimp appetizer is a must!!  the pork belly was delish also, but the fish entrée blew us away!  it was a perfect spot for a catch up session with my bestie!!  i will definitely be coming back!.the cocktail menu has great choices.after starting with that, i flipped to the micheladas.what is nice is so much of the cuisine is made from scratch, i.i don&#39;t know when i last reviewed a resto, but i am now, because i loved masa azul!house made tortillas on fleek, recently confirmed the meaning of fleek, if you don&#39;t know, it&#39;s damn good.(my puebla-born mamacita would approve, in other words.gourmet mexican street food with a tequila selection that is second to none in the chicago-land area.we were told the chef  left recently.my friend and i also split the octopus tostada.i had the pablo cocktail, actually three of them throughout the course of the night.yum, yum and more yum! so far the two times i&#39;ve stepped in to maza azul the service was outstanding.excellent food and service!   really enjoyed this scratch food mexican find..i remembered a friend told me, &#34;trying them all is pricey&#34;.it&#39;s great if you just want a little something to go with your drink or if you like to try a bunch of things.but if i can get through the doors, i&#39;m happy!regardless, the drinks are fantastic - they have an amazing selection of tequila and make creative use of it in their delightful cocktails.really enjoyed the ceviche and arbol chile salsa.it&#39;s a shame because of the first experience we had but i am not willing to take the risk because of how poor the service was the second time around and the food being meh.my friends and i just looked at her and when she left we said that was unnecessary and rude.50 steak burrito.masa azul is the perfect night out - any night.you won&#39;t be sorry!.it was just ok and i think it was overdone with lime but that may just be a personal preference.i am definitely coming back to try the taco version too.service is great and they make you enjoy every minute you spend there..service was awesome!! for a friday night it was crowded but no overwhelming.this is definitely notyour regular mexican restaurant.top notch food and drinks.we went here on a friday night and were lucky enough to get the most cozy table in the back of the place.the esquites are charred on the outside and perfectly seasoned.a guy working there, might be the owner, i don&#39;t know, saw us coming and helped open the door and get us inside.just moaning, eyes rolling back, and food dancing.i&#39;ve been there twice, and plan to keep going back any time i find myself in logan square.the service: 5/5.i also think that drinks here are quite expensive, in this kind of neighborhood there are great places like the whistler and scofflaw where you can get amazing cocktails for even less than they are charging here.at some point in time masa azul switched up to a taco-centric menu, foregoing the duck and other entrees.we started with horse with no name and russell in the tumbleweeds.how have i never been here before? delicious food, great service, and creative drinks!i highly recommend the pablo.the food was just great, through and through.the tacos are tiny--the size of silver dollars.."

definitely a quiet hole in the wall place with amazing vegan food.literally a loving atmosphere..while everything on the menu is vegan, my omnivorous coworker raves about the soy beef and has become a frequent customer!i recommend the paramhansa salad, happy burger, ever young noodle, and the awesome hummus-based nachos!the only downsides, which really aren&#39;t a huge deal: sometimes it takes a bit of time to get your order (but there are typically only two women working, and everything is super fresh and homemade) and the religious propaganda and videos are a tad in-your-face, but that&#39;s totally their prerogative!.i got the happy burger and popped chips and it was very delicious and made me comfortably full.the burger was good too, but average.it&#39;s a small, simple space, maybe easily missed.what&#39;s beautiful about this resto, they have so many great selections of veggie food and desserts and all their food is healthy and served it fresh.friendly people, nice atmosphere.i absolutely adore loving heart! my roommate and i eat here at least once a week.the food is delicious (the eden wrap is the best!) and very friendly service.plus it is out of this world delicious! my wife and i are raw vegans so we were skeptical, but our party of 4 tried just about everything on the menu and didn&#39;t get a plate that one of us wasn&#39;t raving about! they have a room in the back that they use for groups or banquets and there is a large screen in it, so we&#39;re going to keep this place in mind for our next gathering..the wrap was pretty good.great food, fresh and tasty!.stairs are required for entering and leaving through the front door.it was pretty big to begin with, and i ate it all.definitely made with love..open until nine!! i almost didn&#39;t go in because it looks dark, but they&#39;re really nice and the food is delicious! healthy is just a bonus.happy burger was delicious.neither one of us are vegan, but this restaurant was still amazing.definitely will come again.i only ate half so i could leave room for some raw chocolate &#34;cheesecake,&#34; which was more like a pudding but quite yummy nonetheless.it&#39;s food is amazing , vegan food never tasted so good.also very delicious! so glad we found this place so closeto our brother-in-law&#39;s apartment!.the music makes you feel happy, and the food is refreshing and delicious.this is my favorite vegan rest ever and is so close to my place! prices also very affordable.tastiest/healthiest/and most affordable restaurant in the area!.delicious! impressive quality, service, presentation-- this place is truly fantastic.though you can dine in,  everything is served in to-go containers, and while they are &#39;eco-sensitive&#39; materials, the absence of real dishes seems counter intuitive to the broader vegan message in the café.my belly and being are both well-satisfied.awesome food, awesome owner, awesome service..to start, i am not a vegan nor do i ever want to be.i have been looking all over for a place like this.we listened to a soundtrack from some play called the real love over and over for the hour and a half we were there.i&#39;ll be returning to try some other options for sure.big portion.i was a part of their vegan bake sale and it was awesome how many people came, baked, and participated.this is the best best vegan restaurant of my life..however, you can&#39;t go wrong with this place.didn&#39;t see any pictures of the dessert so attaching some.happy to have a healthy option so close by! i&#39;ve have their heaven and eden wrap and both have been delicious! guilt-free, tasty food.the thing i love most about this place is how fresh the produce always is and they claim to use mostly organic ingredients which most restaurants do not do, and the price is super fair.my husband had a veggie burger, which was a bit small, but the curry portion was huge.it also has vegan korean bbq (texturized vegetable protein) and it is not bad at all! i was expecting to hate imitation meat.....added later-  also, since this place has opened up i have definitely seen more positivist in the neighborhood.i loved the coconutty smoothie and its pretty filling.love this place.this place is amazing.for a non-vegan, i found the vegan nachos delicious, and the vegan happy burger also delicious.this place is must go not just for vegans but for anyone who loves healthy food.it&#39;s rare to find a vegan restaurant that isn&#39;t just vegetarian food parading as vegan (seitan tacos, tofu bbq, etc.i wish there was a option for a stronger coffee because i like strong coffeeget &#34; bean wrap &#34;.the owner is extremely nice and she does look to be a one women show.i go here at least once a week because it&#39;s so amazing.these place keeps getting better by the day.i&#39;m not a vegan but i do like to eat healthy.vegan gem! quick &amp; friendly service.i ordered (from the very friendly server) the ever young bowl with noodles instead of brown rice and i also ordered a coffee.i cannot say enough good things about the food.the food here is pretty amazing, everything is seasoned and cooked to perfection.it appears this place is the bomb diggy when it comes to vegan food.yummy!!!

green-tomato-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/green-tomato-cafe-chicago,2,"Our total bill was cheap too.perhaps it was my selection but i felt that my sandwich and apple slaw both lacked flavor.as i mentioned before, the order took around 10 min to come out and the sandwich seemed cold and a bit stale.really nice lounge area and healthy lunch choices.this place is incredible.one of the only places to get healthy delicious food in the neighborhood.great atmosphere for meetings!food quality and prices that cannot be beat!it is my new &#34;go-to&#34; place.the menu isn&#39;t huge, but the items on it pack a punch.don&#39;t get me started on the smoothies, just pure goodness!!!.thirdly, the restaurant is priced really reasonably for generous portions.i live right down the street and was ecstatic to find this cafe.the salad proportions were office (a whole lot of greens, with very little add on&#39;s like chicken, cheese, corn, etc).love the feel of the interior, cozy  feel and decor but very clean.love the po&#39; boy sandwich but the bread is consistently really dry on all the sandwiches (hence 4 instead of 5 stars)..i love the pb&amp;o smoothie and the cermak sandwich.all the furniture is brand new, and the cafe itself has a very modern feel to it.the staff is friendly and fast and the food is good.love the mission/objective for the business, customer service, cleanliness, and work space.sometimes the tables are wobbly but things like that are an easy fix so not real problem there.super delicious smoked chicken sandwich.the cafe is very welcoming and friendly!free wifi..the food is delicious- try the verde chicken chili soup!..best place to eat in the neighborhood.and they offer bottomless coffee! why go to starbucks when you can go to green tomato?.such a great place and i hope it sees much success..the cafe is beautiful, and warm, the staff is friendly, and it&#39;s the kind of place that you want to go and stay all day.the prices are right, &amp; their sammies/soups are tasty.i placed my ordered at the counter and was surprised how extensive the menu was.also has a sweet view with big windows.very nice ambiance, reasonable prices, clean, and healthy eating options.also love the kid area!.everything.healthy.green tomato, where have you been all my life? lol i love their salads and smoothies!!! day 1: i had the little village ensalada with their roasted chicken.some people may be put off by the christian music playing but it didn&#39;t bother me.they changed their menu recently and i think they made terrible choices as they changed all the great things about them.being a resident of little village, i welcome a new coffee destination &amp; cafe that is just minutes away, on the campus of lawndale church and its&#39; health and fitness center.all in all this is a great little spot.when i went to get my refill for the cup of joe, there was a different cashier and he was very amiable.but the customer service is tremendously lacking!!!!! if you&#39;re looking for attentive, helpful, exciting and professional service, please keep driving.fresh, clean atmosphere..what&#39;s not to love about gtc? well, for me, it&#39;s the distance from my home in logan square.all i will say about this place are : small and clean,food are good and the price is unbelievable.i was working in that neighborhood and was looking for something nearby that was affordable and healthy.the space is clean, open, trendy, and bright.the cafe is well kept, beautiful ambiance, excellent customer service and has a clean well kept restroom.this cafe has so much to offer, and is a rare find on this side of town.50 cup of joe, $5 sandwiches.the chopped chicken salad w/cilantro lime dressing, chicken chili soup, and roastin&#39; turkey sandwich were all fresh quality&amp;delicious!  service was quick, friendly, and the little fireplace in the dining area was quite appreciated on a cold day ~."
cafe-53-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-53-chicago,2,"Their tea selection is heaven.i love this place! the coffee is amazing and the veggie panini is delectable.great place to study or meet with friends! delicious food and great coffee.plus there&#39;s gelato! i have many times come in for just a sandwich and found myself unable to resist those sweet and colorful temptations..i will be coming back to taste some of their food and pastries.i&#39;ll definitely go back.i wasn&#39;t a big fan of the decor or the music, but i&#39;s a convenient place to work.but oh my sweet baby jesus is the food here good.i have been to cafe 53 a couple of times and i love it.the garlic chicken sandwich is awesome!  café 53 is a great hideaway for the university of chicago crowd.but dangggg! i asked the owner where they purchase the meat and he told me and he didn&#39;t take it personal.the sandwiches are extremely filling and they use high quality ingredients.only drawback - i order drinks with soy milk because of a lactose intolerance and on several occasions i&#39;ve gotten cow milk.i only wish hyde park had more places like this.i rank 4 stars because of the abundant patio seating and huge sandwiches around me.best sandwiches in hyde park (sumac chicken and kufta are my favorites, so good and giant proportions.a friend and i decided to get some gelato after lunch today and cafe 53 was right there, looking like an adorable northside cafe.i come here for coffee all the time.soon after i closed the door to avoid getting rained on, the woman working came over and propped the door back open even after we explained to her that we were getting wet.like starbucks, you could bring your laptop and copy of plato or the iliad here and chug away at your work for a few hours, if you wanted a change of scenery from the libraries on campus..service is hit or miss, but works for the most part.i like to sit on the back porch and work on all of my stuff; it&#39;s secluded and quiet and you can still run in and get whatever coffee/food you like.café 53 does not have sugar-free syrup and a few other fancy things like that..nice little coffee house that reminds me of france in a lot of ways (but not every way!).great place for tea.food taste great.a few vegan offerings in the pastry case, including delicious gluten-free brownies.i just randomly stopped by, wasn&#39;t expecting awesomeness!!.the baked goods and gelato are okay- not amazing, but not terrible- and the coffee is good..no atmosphere here..haven&#39;t had any pastries or gelato, but the coffee is decent, there is a lot of seating (compared to other cafes in hyde park), and there is free wi-fi.came here for the first time today,  loved it,  definitely coming back to try the vegan food.i like the way this place fills up with people and their laptops by 1pm, but the owner is completely chill with it and lets everyone stay as long as they like.the staff is always friendly, and they let you taste as many flavors of gelato as you&#39;d like before you commit to one (or two).the free wifi makes it a good workspace but they really need to work on the beverage quality and the service.they went up on the prices and nearly $5.delivery is fast.for a while when i moved into my new apartment i had no internet.kufta kufta kufta and more kufta!!! get the kufta sandwich if you ever go to the cafe.so many yummy options - i could hardly decide..the coffee itself is good, but a few cents more expensive than it should be..the hummus:decadent, creamy, sumac and oil sprinkled goodness.the deserts are delicious..it&#39;s part coffee shop, part gelateria, and part restaurant that delivers! they do everything.i wanted something healthy but tasty.great prices too, with a very unassuming atmosphere.the baked goods (esp the scones) looked very tempting as well.sumac chicken sandwich is always amazing.this adds up to many a many-splendored experience right in the heart of hyde park..i&#39;ve only been there once, but the coffee was good.updated review ! the chicken sandwiches are a delight !! i gave this place another chance as per my friends recommendations and it was great ! the chicken sumac has just the right amount of seasoning and it&#39;s so good.the pros: rich gelato in which you can taste (and sometimes detect the texture of) genuine ingredients--i&#39;ve tried the pumpkin, macadamia nut, and ginger, all of which were superb.terrible, terrible customer service! i placed an order that never arrived.this place and z&amp;h are the only 2 places in hyde park that know how to make good sandwiches!! excellent customer service here.smelled a little funky, but the girl working there was so nice, the iced coffee was great and the blueberry muffin was delicious as well.it&#39;s too hard of a task for these guys.all the sandwiches are very generous in size and delicious.this place was a bit run down and the food was extremely ordinary.most underrated cafe in hyde park.their back patio is wonderful and open year round..the food was great and the desserts are even better..good..gelato is always fine and lots of flavors, and there&#39;s a good variety of pastries that are specific to this place (plus vegan options for those interested).my wife and i love places like this."
yolk-chicago-8,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yolk-chicago-8,1,"The whole omelette was made with egg whites and vegetables..only caveat: coffee is just ok.the west coast crepes and accompanying fresh fruit really hit the spot as well as the yolk berry bliss (a nice-sized fresh yogurt parfait that came with a muffin).service was really great.my eyes kept darting back to the red velvet french toast and i went for it, considering i&#39;ve never had it before.i found the west coast crepes a little bland.the food was terrific as well!.helpings are large.very good food.boiled, scrambled, sunnyside up--you name it, i&#39;ve done it (though making eggs benny doesn&#39;t go without a fail).the food is fresh, tasty, and hot.we had a super bright and energetic waiter who recommended a few breakfast options for us.best breakfast spot in downtown chicago.my husband ordered the croque madame and enjoyed his plate too.we went here for breakfast (obviously).just make sure you check in with the hostess and have everyone in your party there.excellent breakfast.parking-for all of you yelpers visiting chicago and are not familiar with the area or the parking around there, i recommend parking on the street and not the parking structure next to yolk.it was totally worth the money.best of all, this place was right down the street from &#34;acme hotel&#34; where we were staying.there ought to be a better way to figure out tables.lots of egg, and non egg choices..fluffy and sweet with cream and syrup, i was definitely satisfied.spent the night at the westin on lakeshore with my husband for a quick little anniversary getaway.recommendations from what i tried: strawberry and orange juice, very berry french toast, and the all star combo.i&#39;ve been here twice and there&#39;s always a wait for brunch.if i go here again, i think i would opt for a different breakfast, with toast of course!.great!!  porter from hotel we were walking by recommended.i can&#39;t wait for the next time i&#39;m in chicago so i can visit yolk again!.a massive bowl arrived and i sat and enjoyed the most delicious salad ever.overall though, we like to visit yolk for breakfast when visiting chicago.one thing to make this review a 5 star - replace with squeeze ketchup bottles!.we brought a bottle of champagne in and they brought us orangejuice for mimosas.well if you like quantity and cheap brunches that&#39;s your place but if you like to eat tasty fruits and have nice quality ingredients it is not the place to go.by far one of my favorite breakfast spots in chicago they have a few locations and the owner really knows how to nurture a business and his patron.chicken and waffles were good! love the bits of bacon in the waffles.we both didn&#39;t finish and ended up taking a to-go box.upon seating,  we had their famous strawberry orange juice,  a bacon and ham with cheddar omelet in which is comes with an english muffin and a side of fruit.the red velvet french toast was phenomenal.it was the perfect balance of yoghurt to fruit, and tasted fresh and amazing and was thoroughly enjoyable.brilliance on a plate- who ever thought to slice up cinnamon rolls and make it into french toast?! genius! just fyi, it&#39;s a bit sweet but i have a huge sweet tooth so to me it was perfection!the countryside skillet was amazing as well! i was a bit skeptical about the &#34;sausage gravy&#34; that came on the side but it was the best gravy i have ever had and went perfectly with the dish!i was especially impressed with the portion sizes and the coffee! both very good.chorizo scramble - big portion and was pretty tasty.from the decor to the servers uniforms i really felt the good vibes and am excited to go back and try new items on the menu!.you go to the front to pay with your receipt, not your server.even upon hearing up her omelette later, she said it was really good.recommend both.so i&#39;m giving it 3 stars because what i had was typical to find in other places.it&#39;s a really cute and tasty breakfast spot.place gets pretty crowded so come early! my friend got the pot roast benedict which was reeeaaalllly good, would definitely give that meal alone four stars.eggs were good, french toast was one of the best, sausage were huge, coffee was good, and the food came out fast.great little place.great breakfast joint.you can bring your own alcohol, i saw a table of guys making their own mimosas so that was cool..the omelet had this amazing texture, lightly done on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and even though i&#39;ve never polished off five eggs in one sitting before, i didn&#39;t feel weighted-down after that last bite - just amazingly satisfied, ready to start a day of sightseeing.very good breakfast! rumors are true though..a friend and i came here for breakfast while touring the city.two bowls did the trick for me filled me up quite well.there was so much pot roast on my english muffin.good place to take the family or a date! fyi, we did have a 10-15 minute wait, but considering how busy / packed they were that sunday morning, that was an amazingly short wait time, especially compared to wildberry&#39;s 1.regardless, yolk is very popular and often there&#39;s a wait which must mean it&#39;s good!my group of 6 came around 1:15pm on a beautiful saturday afternoon and were told it would be a 20 minute wait..pancakes were mediocre.loved the food! lots of great options to keep it healthy.i seriously tried not to pick off his plate as i had my own goodness happening, but, but! holy delicious!the leftovers that we took home made us just as happy the next morning!!.i do not care at all for the &#34;chicken and waffles."
vera-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vera-chicago,2,"They also have an extensive wine list, iberico ham at $20 for 2oz, and a pretty diverse set of food options.holy moly vera!!! this place is amazing.we came to a consensus that this place was good, not great and a bit overpriced.chef&#39;s choice meat and cheese plate was also pretty generous.i have no problem paying for a super meal which is what this was however if i think about the general public its pricier.stop complaining about small portion sizes.we got the cheese appetizer, lamb meatballs, the bread and a few other dishes.exceptional and knowledgable staff make this lovely spot a winner in every way! very attentive but not cloying..it was a quiet night but the food wasn&#39;t!  kelcie did a nice job of helping us select a wine, emilio moro, and talked us through the small plate and larger plate menu.i was really kinda saddened by it.the service was attentive and the restaurant went as far as to print my girlfriend&#39;s name on the menu that evening!  this place is a perfect neighborhood and date spot, while also being large enough to host a large group.i don&#39;t think i&#39;ll be back when i know i can go to lots of places and get similar great food for much less money.spanish focused menu that is not huge, but has plenty of great choices...the atmosphere is charming and cozy, with tiny lights twinkling and soft music playing in the background..we had 8pm reservations and were seated promptly when our friends arrived.the service was outstanding.amazing.would be a great place to weather a snowstorm.go and either sit at the bar and just have kelly bring you her favorites.my more recent visit here a couple of months ago changed my mind a little about the place.lovely place..parking in this area is pretty easy to find too, so that&#39;s always a plus.like the atmosphere.i liked it (if you&#39;re not in a rush) as it gave the four of us time to really focus on and enjoy it.parking was easy to find and free.my grandmother would have called her &#34;such a peach.3.it&#39;s new and innovative and full of pomp and circumstance w/out being over the top.we will definitely go back,  even if it&#39;s just for a quick bite again...the cocido, a multi course boiled meal, is just a shadow of what you typically generously receive in spain and portugal.requested $65 be placed on the card and the remaining balance towards the $20...i love vera!  and then i learned it is a husband-wife venture, which made me love it even more.i was there with my mom, and we shared the cheese plate (which came with bread, nuts, and very yummy jam), the brussel sprouts, and beets/burrata dishes.the mushroom were yummy but took a long time to come out.the wines were equally excellent and we loved all four different glasses our party sampled..every bite made me feel lucky that humans have figured out how to get the most pleasure out of food..lovely hidden gem in the west loop!..go! skip the noise and traffic of randolph and newly washed fulton market spots and head over here.i went there saturday with 3 other people because one member of the group wanted to try it.we heard it was known for their sherry..we ordered a bit of this and a bit of that, some of the items i&#39;d like to mention:mojama - i completely misunderstood this dish and thought i would be getting some sashimi style tuna.no seriously, this had to be the worst tasting, uninspiring mess of a dish.we came here for dinner a couple of weeks ago and loved it..i recommend vera to all my friends based on occasion and interest.if i&#39;d paid myself, i&#39;d give 3 stars..that&#39;s exactly what we wanted for their 40th! thank you liz, mark, and the whole team for an exceptional and delicious night for these two special people!!.this simple story is just one example of the warm and inviting atmosphere that&#39;s been created.try it.when an establishment calls itself a wine bar, they better deliver on the quality and quantity of wine.the potatoes were perfectly cooked, crispy and well seasoned and the sauces were a nice compliment - fire and ice style.they are always there and engaging..the atmosphere is nice enough, with the focus on the food with a heavy local focus, and international wines.tip: check their daily specials before making reservation.the mushrooms were decent.luckily we were among good company so it didn&#39;t notice it too much.i love that we need not be wine experts only lovers of good wine.there were so many options and the hubby and i ordered the grilled octopus (excellent texture and seasoned to perfection), olives (came in all different sizes), beef tongue pincho (my mouth is watering as i reminiscence the taste), patatas bravas (a bit spicy but delicious), and we ended it with the chicken thigh, sofrito and capers (talk about saving the best for last- tender and juicy).my friends both loved everything."

eh? eh? mok bye).both trips here, we were fortunate to find parking right in front of the restaurant.someone recommended nando&#39;s.the sauces also tasted the same as the marinade from the chicken.it was the only non-chinese place my family patronized besides the golden arches.the chicken was good.food was great!  but i have an issue with several sides on the menu not available and then the kids menu says one side and bottomless frozen yogurt..nandos, you are a chain that is totally okay!  totally a worth while meal for a terrific price! solid!the vibe: you order at a counter, get your own drinks (other than booze), and are in charge of our own sauces and silverware.get the natas for dessert.i&#39;m not a big meat eater, but i finished two pieces with no trouble.it was really big, really good, and quite spicy.the chicken was perfect, the rice was amazing..there&#39;s a table of to the side for all sorts for large bottles of sauce and water.nando&#39;s is one of my all time favorite spots these days.we tried a bunch of their sauces they have in the back for you to choose from.the food was on par with what i recall from the d.amazing.this is the third nando&#39;s location i&#39;ve been to, and they have all been amazing.my friends and i came on a saturday night, and the restaurant was bustling with families and friends..very good food.i really enjoyed eating at this restaurant and if you are reading this you should stop by and give it a chance.the peas were delicious as well.there&#39;s just something about the chicken skewers that keeps me coming back.i&#39;d definitely return.we ordered the wing platter to share and hummus with peri-peri drizzle and pitas for appetizers!  phenomenal for both!  for sides i recommend the fries and portuguese rice (spicy yellow rice with fresh peppers and herbs)!the beverage selection is also pretty good.the food, most importantly, was wonderful!   it&#39;s great to have this option in the area!i would highly recommend nandos!  i hope they open more branches in the chicago area!my only recommendation is that they could use more offerings for kids and vegetarians (clearly not the target audience anyways).i didn&#39;t feel like i ate anything heavy or greasy and the sauces are amazing.the fries were so well seasoned and the mayo side was a perfect supplement.locale wise, the restaurant was easy to get to from downtown walking and surrounded by other seemingly good restaurants and coffee shops.for 2 combo meals and 2 fountain drinks, we paid about $30, not bad for the amount, quality, and especially the neighborhood.i understand the cult following - delish chicken, unique spicy flavor profile, several solid sides and most of the staff were great.this was my first time at this location and i have to say i was pretty impressed.loved it! the chicken was tender, juicy and not greasy at all.my chicken was super spicy! but the staff was very accommodating.i ordered it hot with a side cesar salad - my go to flavoring and go to side dish..they really decorated the place to have an upper scale island feel.i can&#39;t wait to try this place again and to introduce it to family and friends!.the chicken was a little dry and could&#39;ve used more seasoning while the rice and fries were too salty.the rice was fine, wouldn&#39;t call it a stand-out item.the staff are on point to help you keep bone piles from tumbling over.the rice is fluffy and flavorful, and the perinaise is probably the best condiment to fries i&#39;ve ever had in my life.the website calls these portuguese tarts.great casual spot for a group lunch or a casual hangout with friends.i was told order at the counter, grab water on the side plus utensils and your food will be brought out to you.i like a good snap on my roasted chicken skin.actually, on second thought, try every sauce that is stored in large bottles near the soda machine.service had improved greatly since my first visit when the restaurant first opened..fries and coleslaw are great sides and so are the brussels sprouts (when they&#39;re in season)...as did many others, i first fell in love with nando&#39;s when studying abroad in the uk.truth be told i could eat nando&#39;s chicken every single day of the week, for every meal.the chicken on the salad was fine, the grilled chicken was amazing.&#34;just a few minutes&#34;? pfft.literally just a piece of chicken in a box.the cachet of this franchise seems to be that the modern city dweller may not know how to apply certain spices or how to roast chicken.walk in and order, take the number five and put your down on your table and they will bring your food.although i&#39;ve seen folks order the breast or sandwiches, their bone-in is the signature and really the only way to grill to properly get those poultry juices flowing.yeah.i can go up and grab whatever i like which is great when i can&#39;t decide what it is i want!  the sauces are also available for purchase, great for the home cook.you also get to pick a side or two that includes green peas, fries, spanish rice to name a few.it&#39;s similar to a chinese egg tart but with cinnamon and vanilla so it&#39;s got more tasty flavors.situated right at the heart of randolph, nando&#39;s serves us some amazing chicken wings with some incredible spices.great place to go with friends!..the portuguese rice was brilliant!biggest awesomeness??? bathrooms were clean and fresh smelling!this is a great place to go for a weeknight dinner when you don&#39;t feel like cooking."

francescas-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/francescas-cafe-chicago,1,"Service is receptive, warm, and friendly.great coffee!.the person who served me was soo nice and attentive.there is usually just 1 person working the counter.we ordered americano, bagel and their coffee.- good coffee- delicious pastries (they&#39;re like crack)- hometown service- quite with plenty seating- fast, free wifimy only complaint is that i wish they had extended hours.i also get their chai lattes which are pretty tasty, nothing crazy.the barista was fantastically friendly and generous, the cafe was nice and quiet, the prices were low, and they had a bakery case that i would have gone bananas on if i hadn&#39;t been there killing time before meeting friends for brunch.the customer service is awesome..the espresso drinks are delicious and better priced than starbucks.the tv was on but kept cutting out (antenna?) which was a tad annoying so i put some headphones in and used the free wifi to listen to music and do my paperwork..the food was amazing: i had a whole wheat bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese (and the aragula, onions, tomato and capers that go with it) for $8 and i felt like ordering a new one though i was full..it was a beautiful sight.seriously, get rid of that stupid tv and put on some music!!! enough said...the coffee is strong and smooth, just the way i like it.prices are reasonable, and there is plenty of seating in the cozy atmosphere.free wifi.prices weren&#39;t too bad either - about $3 for each item.pretty awful coffee..it&#39;s a cute little european coffee shop that feels like home.i love this place.chamomile citrus is my favorite."
l-patron-tacos-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/l-patron-tacos-chicago-2,2,"My girlfriend said her&#39;s pieces of steak were actually burnt..the food is excellent.both times, she still put ice..i had to drown it in hot sauce to make it more palatable.i love they have outside eating as well..at their old location, lines were long regardless of the time so i always called ahead.plus,  somedays the steak is so salty that i feel like i&#39;m eating a salt lick.this place is by far the best taco joint in the city!!! carne asada and shrimp are the best.good ingredients, skirt steak was salty and though so that&#39;s two stars (it&#39;s all about the meat).upon arrival, the place was lively but glad it wasn&#39;t overly busy like how i&#39;ve heard it could be.make sure you eat the tacos with their delicious salsa! they have a red one and a green one.overall, i&#39;d recommend..i went to the diversey location approx 25x&#39;s in the 3-4 yrs preceding relocation.their steak tacos and burritos are guaranteed satisfaction..got the poblano rajas torta sans mayo, very flavorful but messy :).the carne asada here is amazing.went to this new location and waited in line for 20 minutes.i first went to l&#39;patron when they were at their old location.i&#39;m so happy l patron moved the traffic was horrendous at the old location at diversey and california the patrons would use walgreens parking lot leaving us people to shop either walking couple of blocks or walking from your home.had the steak tacos my meat tasted burnt.currently they have no apparent a/c and are cash only with no atm.the service wasfast for it being lunch time.if you know a mexican dad that can cook ask him to make you some tacos.go there.def.i&#39;m i don&#39;t want 1/3 of a tomato slice on my chip, ok?so yeah i was so excited when this place moved to within two blocks of me but the downfall has been long and painful.new location, same great tacos.uses yelp to complain but couldn&#39;t take the time to read on their yelp page where it says cash only..as good as the original."
goddess-and-the-baker-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/goddess-and-the-baker-chicago,2,"I recently discovered this little gem near home, and i love it! the options are great and the atmosphere is lovely.we absolutely loved it here and will be returning from now on when we visit.goddess and the baker is a lovely coffee shop and bakery located in downtown chicago.my girlfriend and i chanced upon this place and was drawn by the &#34;eat now caffeinate&#34; sign.great service even at closing time.after standing around and asking ppl if they had ordered, i figured out which line i am supposed to be in.i also got a free coffee using the yelp check-in offer.even moreso when down-the-street, an even better tasting chocolate chip cookie is $2.the sandwich was probably an inch to an inch and a half thick.holy..love the vibe too and their of treats are hard to resist.in addition, g and b has three types of water (sparkling, chilled, and room temperature) available for self-service.the foam on top was tasteless and the texture wasn&#39;t creamy and smooth.atmosphere: 8/10service: 8/10food: 8/10.i had ordered a nitro coffee but i did not like it that much.things started off on the wrong foot right away.i ordered the avocado toast &amp; an iced matcha latte to go.in a good way.the red velvet cake was moist through and through, despite being baked who knows when and being carried around for 5 1/2 hours.five stars for the slice i worshiped.walking in you can tell that they specialize in their coffee drinks, but don&#39;t look over the food options.the bulletproof latte was like a creamy and smooth all black coffee.i like my coffee a bit stronger but most don&#39;t like their coffee/expresso drinks as strong as i do.very busy for lunch.95): sourdough, herbed ricotta, smashed avocado, lemon, chili flakes.we both ordered the nitro cold brew.the ambiance is welcoming, clean and colorful.i applaud their assortment of fun treats and beverages! the rainbow cake was a smooth balance of vanilla cake and buttercream frosting- it was large enough to split between two people! the atmosphere is also pleasant! i think they need to have less communal tables and more smaller tables though.the rainbow cake had a pretty basic vanilla flavor, but was perfectly moist and beautifully presented.for caffeine: the hazelnut latte.came during happy hour for after-work drinks and dinner with friend.i have asked for a latte with almond milk because i&#39;m sensitive to milk.cookie was super yummy..i live for coffee shops like goddess.tea and chocolate drinks unique quality and taste.and by &#34;snacks&#34; they include all their different flatbreads and my personal favorite: the avocado toast with ricotta spread and salad greens! super creamy deliciousness from the ricotta and avocado on crunchy wheat toast.we were surprised when we discovered this awesome place! great coffee, delicious cupcakes, vegan options, chill environment, and very laid back and comfy.they even offered free latte because it came a bit later than other orders.it is a real pick me up, especially with the cayenne/chocolate combo waking up those taste buds with something a bit different.i also ordered a scone that was just okay..they even have nice other perks such as offering take-away containers by the utensils in case you can&#39;t finish your goodies.good heavens! the s&#39;more frappe is divine! and paired with a red velvet cupcake (a bit much?) makes the rest of my day seem promising!there&#39;s many other great choices here, but i just wanted something sweet.0/5- value = 0.the cake consistency was heavenly, and the frosting unrepellingly sweet.they have wifi, so it&#39;s a pretty good cafe to just sit and hang out if you can get a seat.would go back gladly if someone else was paying.huge coffee selection for both the simple and eclectic palates.the front staff was very friendly and helpful to this amateur coffee guy..i took my truffles to go, but have since eaten them all, oops! i ordered gingerbread, hot buttered rum, candy cane, and hot toddy..it takes months to years to repair.we ended up going back to the counter to order some dessert.there is a huge selection of pastries and cakes too, it wouldn&#39;t be i the name of the coffee shop/restaurant if it wasn&#39;t..i tried to knock on the door since the sign said &#34;sunday 8am-6pm&#34; and the girl at the counter just gave me a &#34;no&#34; gesture.and the place is really cute!..their lunch menu and salads looked so scrumptious; will definitely come back for that.salad- vietnamese chicken salad.i had a club sandwich for $9 ish bucks.i usually refuse to order avocado toasts at cafes/restaurants because i feel like i can make it myself, but seeing how this avocado toast had herbed ricotta and arugula, i became fascinated by its sophistication and decided to give it a try.coffee was bold and strong, tasted freshly brewed.the shop is somewhat small, so i could see it getting crowded during peak hours.it&#39;s definitely a trendy from the atmosphere to the menu.it&#39;s a cute place and has good service but i didn&#39;t care much for the mocha and egg sandwich i got for breakfast..liquid chocolate in a variety of flavorsrice krispies the size of your facealcoholic and non alcoholic beverages from around the worldartisanal chocolate bars (studded with tea!)and about a million more gourmet options to test your decision making skills :)also, happy hour everyday from 5-7 ft.the place is a bit small and seating is limited.this latte climbed up to my top 3 place right away!they are good!! did i say good?! they are so amazing!!! the place is so nice to just relax, hang out, or work..there are three other surrounding communal tables and two tops along the wall."
fork-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fork-chicago-2,2,"I would definitely come back.would have loved to take advantage of the outside seating, but o it was too hot this morning.never had it before and had no idea what to expect, but with the grape jam, white port gelee and the small, perfectly toasted pieces of bread, it was so, so good.the dish was really filling but was a great healthy option.i was beyond disappointed though.the waffle was still pretty good, but the chicken was greasy, not crispy, and had very little taste.hats off to the chef here, honestly some of the best food i&#39;ve had in a very long time..fork loses stars because it&#39;s so damn expensive.the smells were amazing and the food was anthony bourdain review worthy.it was like a total 180 from my last few experiences, when i felt kind of rushed out the door and not welcomed.however, overall it was solid.this giant guy came over from behind the bar to take our order.don&#39;t be overwhelmed by the exhaustive (and exhausting!) menu.service quick and kind.the charcuterie offerings at fork are so impressive.my friend and i came here for an early dinner, and even though we did not make any reservations, we were able to score a table!  we tried the duck breast crostini which was actually pretty tasty, with the crunchy crostini bottom and a juicy, perfectly-seasoned duck on top.i would go again.they were missing some staples - no guinness or tank 7.my friend is a vegetarian and there were good options for him and they said they could make many of the other dishes vegetarian if he was interested.went here on father&#39;s day for brunch.each time i go, i&#39;ve gotten their seasonal/monthly/daily &#39;special.excellent service and atmosphere.it came out nice and hot and is a good size for the price.we called right after it opened on sunday am and the hostess said they had a ton of reservations so there is a 45 minutes wait.i wasn&#39;t satisfied with the fries.i&#39;ll definitely be back here.the duck confit in the poutine was so juicy and tender and the duck gravy and cheddar sauce complemented each other perfectly.we went for brunch but ended up ordering the turkey and pesto panini.but i think our corner had the ultimate trifecta of deliciousness going!  it turned into an oohing and aahing over shared bites of jerry&#39;s spinach and feta omelette, pam&#39;s quiche, and my lox and bagels.each dish was better than the last.small plates selection was nice for dinner..they have a good beer selection on tap, something i really appreciate.i got the side salad with the sandwich and ordered cilantro garlic fries to share.me and my daughter walked our dog by, every morning and we decide to give it a try.they came with four and when i saved one for my brother and he realized how amazing they are, he also realized how much i must love him for having not finished them all off myself and for saving one for him..whether at the bar or seated, getting the staff&#39;s attention is an arduous task.finally gave fork a try after walking past it countless times and glancing at their menu.5 stars..our water cups were constantly empty and finding our waiter just seemed more difficult than it should&#39;ve been.no acknowledgement of us when we sat at our table, long wait for everything - to place our order, for drinks to arrive and for the food.despite that.it is so creamy and yummy.i think fork is decent but i would prefer if the selection is going to be limited for the lunch options to be better.i visited fork this past friday for the first time and it&#39;s safe to say i am a fan..julio is usually our server and he always makes it a great experience for us at fork.sadly, i only had a few bites before i gave up and grabbed a glass of water (and i love salt!)..in regards to the rest of the menu, i will say that if you want your own plate rather than to share one, and you don&#39;t want a burger, you don&#39;t have the largest selection.i also had the chocolate creme brule, and it was outstanding.tl;dr: food not fresh.delicious! went with friends and absolutely stuffed my face :) the service is friendly and professional and the food is great.well, fork you delivered.my boyfriend got the blt and was not happy with it.the only food item i have ever gotten was the garlic fries, which are sinfully delicious.i loved the place, it&#39;s been the first time here had dinner with a friend.their wine selection is probably about 1/2 the reason i come, maybe more.we came without a reservation on a saturday evening, expecting to wait.i&#39;d recommend those to anyone..went here for brunch on new years day.rating: 4/5 starsseating: i would suggest you sit outside and people watch! perfect time of year, and it wasn&#39;t overly crowded on the monday night we went.i&#39;ve never had a bad experience when it comes to service.loved their duck confit and the pork belly hash from their harsh bar.i wish i could say the quality was affected by the food sitting in a box for 10 minutes but it was a mess and didn&#39;t taste good.our waiter was great.we got tipsy immediately because we were trying to cool off."
xoco-bistro-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/xoco-bistro-chicago,1,"When our food came out, he left us to eat, only checking in at necessary times.fresh and tasty.they are also not too sweet which i enjoyed..we were there for brunch and really enjoyed the brunch menu, the guacamole  was especially good..disappointed in this place after having great food at frontera.nothing really out of the ordinary from our usual taco shops/restaurants.the place was empty on a weekday afternoon, we were seated immediately.came here on a whim and this place was on point.food comes out very quick so little waiting around..i yearn for the original downtown frontera days..the staff was understanding, and i got another dish instead.give me zombie dust on tap and i&#39;ll give you five stars.heard from friends that this place is supposed to be good, maybe i just had too high of an explanation.mezcal will always be crap to me.sat there at our table for over 20 minutes without any server coming.chastity is a goddess and you should ask for her when you visit.i love xoco!.the portions are expensive and small, but the carnitas i had were great.it was everything short of it.i would definitely get it again.price points were not bad at all.menu was a total surprise.we were excited because this xoco location offered food the river north location does not.would go again if i lived in the area!the two-paddled fan things here are funny.the arugula and goat cheese were in short supply as well.until next time!.but by then we were knee deep in poke!*edit.the booze are colds.great chicken mole, guacamole, great tortas, churros, hot chocolate and caldos..and my friend enjoyed the sunday special chile rellanos!.this place made our day! massi, our waiter was phenomenal! he was very attentive! the food and the margaritas were fantastic! if you love spicy food, get the cochinita pibil tacos.each sandwich was absolutely perfect.great brunch.ok but not great.i ordered the chicken entree with mashed potatoes, which sounds weird but was actually the servers favorite entree so i stuck with it..something special.you have to get a loaded with everything on it.the milanesa torta was one of the best tortas i have ever had in my life.rick bayless is a cool dude and all, but prices here are way too high for what you get..if you&#39;re a hc lover, like me, then of course you&#39;ll order it here anyway.okay so why 4 stars and not 5? the churros (which we came specifically for) were not good.just get one..i did order that to try it, but i had to send it back as it was not good..the line was no where near as bad as i have heard the original xoco  is, we were seated immediately with a group of four.the chocolate peanut and the hazelnut flavors and both of which were good but seemed to be a little factory made which maybe they aren&#39;t but it was the feeling i got.regardless, you can now safely put this on your list of top-tier places on milwaukee ave.the margaritas were really good, as well as the service...because of it, i got to sample more of what amazes many of the usual rick bayless kind of fans."
sushi-dokku-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-dokku-chicago,2,"We split 4 rolls: dragon, northern california, fire, and smoked salmon.went there on a busy thursday evening without a reservation.atmosphere and staff are awesome and feel neighborly.the atmosphere would be good for a date night or just dinner with a friend..which, truth be told, are more or less the same across any good sushi restaurant.by that point i was fuming and the roll itself didn&#39;t even taste fresh at all.now my go-to for japanese meals..portions were small and expensive, but only came for appetizers.i have been trying to get here since they opened.one of the best places i have eaten at in chicago.neither of us were a fan of that roll.i&#39;m not a big fan of sushi but this place was great and very accommodating.the mini filet with the whipped potatoes and wasabi butter was to die for! it is a sleek atmosphere and the service was efficient.i didn&#39;t expect to get seated at the main restaurant but rather their bar.during my last visit, however, the service was disappointing enough that i may not return.tasty rolls, a bit overpriced, weird atmosphere downstairs.a drink that comes from a 4 inch can should not cost 19 dollars, but hey i was in a good mood and it was friday....all of the rolls were really great, but there was a truffle tuna sashimi that really stood out.were lucky to find two seats available at the sushi bar..&#34;  on the outside, it is an unassuming place on a busy and bustling street.but as i said, overall it was a happy experience!.omg, i really have no words to describe how good they were.they are all amazing so just order whatever sounds the best to you and you will love it.great sushi, horrible service!!! the girl at the downstairs bar is obviously not use to handling multiple tables and is very inattentive.all so good.further, reach into a bubbling vat of grease to pull out whatever tempura was going- crazy men..definitely our future go-to sushi joint around west loop.the pickle garnish on top have a great slightly crunchy texture.cool vibe.fyi, they have oysters happy hour 5-7pm, $1-2.the sushi was a little above average but nothing special..the dragon roll here is awesome, as is the octopus and the crab.they allowed us to order off the menu, make up our own rolls! we love exploring the unknown so the flexibility is much appreciated!must get: truffle tuna nigiri! to die for good!we made up our own roll of spicy salmon with avocado.upstairs seems more casual and bright and downstairs is dim and elegant looking.my friend is gluten free and they were happy to accommodate almost everything on the menu.can&#39;t go wrong! great service too!.by chance, we stumbled on this cute sushi joint one night! luckily for us, girl and the goat was way too packed and this lovely sushi bar was right down the street!we sat at the sushi bar, and watched the sushi chefs make beautiful rolls, sushi and sashimi..prime spot for an awesome sushi experience.major thanks to the other useful reviews that referenced to it.any additional dressing or having the oysters fried is $1 more per oyster.my daughter and i stopped in for a quick bite.i spoke to a very friendly and helpful bartender, and she suggested the perfect cocktail based on my preference.definitely try the hamachi and the hot daisy..fish is great quality, rolls were tight, presentation is beautiful and clean..this was my first time here, and i was so excited because i was a huge fan of sushi wabi, but this was just so disappointing and i honestly felt bad that i&#39;m the one who suggested we go here.the service was a bit slow, not because it was so busy but rather because of what felt like a pretty blasé attitude.in hindsight we should have gotten wine or beer.definitely worth trying, its just cucumber cut up all special but the sauce on there is bomb.creative in presentation and combining ingredients.definitely the best sushi restaurant i&#39;ve been to in chicago.my favorite maki was the crispy maguro, mostly because there were bonito flakes galore (i love bonito flakes!!).we desperately need more sushi options in the area.good not great sushi with a nice decor and solid bar.pleasantly surprised by the food here as i&#39;ve always considered myself as a sushi purist and avoided  trendy sushi joint with crazy cream cheese rolls.which were $6 each! ridiculous.he did not steer us wrong.great spot for an intimate dinner, especially if you want to impress someone with great sushi, my bf definetely impressed me ;-)..in actuality none of us were stumbling, candice was practically running, ericka hobbling on her one workable foot and i&#39;d like to think i was walking a normal human being type of way.it did not even seem too busy in there at the time so it was surprising.my wife, baby daughter and i got caught in the crazy thunder storm this past weekend walking to another diner for dinner (mind you, we are out-of-towners).this was my 2nd favorite roll."

giordanos-chicago-9,https://www.yelp.com/biz/giordanos-chicago-9,1,"The crust is so delicious bursting with a rich, flavor that flakes a bit as you drive your fork through each bite.when we got our pizza, it looked good, and i was surprised i actually liked it.if you are looking for some great chicago style pizza look no further.the one, the only.we were definitely not disappointed!we were a very large group and they worked as fast as they could to accommodate us.the very best pizza in chicago.order ahead your pizza.one negative was there is a 45 minute wait for a small pizza.this place is definitely overrated there are a lot of pizza places in chicago, that offer a bit more than giordano&#39;s.check it out! a great place to eat/or try a deep dish chicago pizza.it was still well worth it.as a chicagoan, i love my pizza, and given the reviews i believe giordanos is over-rated.last time we got the large super veggie and between 3 people, had 4 pieces left.i was seated promptly and was given water without even asking for it.our first night in chicago was dedicated to checking out our neighborhood and finding the best chicago pizza.giordano&#39;s is good stuff, but this location makes me want to go to another.i had an appetite coming into giordano&#39;s, yet walked out feeling as if i was carrying a bowling ball in my stomach based on the serving size of the pizza as well as two tall draft ipas at the bar.the only reason it is not 5 stars is because the waiting space is so small and the bartender has been rude the last several times we have been here.always crowded.ours took around 45 min.tough tough decision.it is hella touristy.would come here again to try their individual deep dish pizzas!.met my nephew and his family here for lunch on our way thru chicago to ann arbor.a tip, you will have to wait for your pizza for more than 20mins so i would suggest you order it while you wait to be seated.just seemed a bit dry.first of all, when they say 45 minute wait for a deep dish, they mean it..the staff was very friendly, the atmosphere was nice and family friendly too, and the food was phenomenal.the sauce was great and it was made perfectly!  recommend to anyone who&#39;s looking to try the quintessential chicago style deep dish.the &#34;toppings&#34; (which in fact, goes in the middle layer of the pie) are negligible, because they use so little of it.came here with a large group of 12 people- this was my first time in chicago and had to try the deep dish.5 pieces filled me up! the only downside is the wait to get in and get your food.it is worth the wait.giodano&#39;s is my pizza bias.tip - they have frozen pizzas you can ship or take home but by the end of the trip, i was so sick of deep dish, i was good with not taking any home..the soup was good and the pizza was hot and fresh.it was worth a try but didn&#39;t blow my mind like i thought.i&#39;d never been a big fan of chicago-style pizza until i ate at giordano&#39;s for the first time.the parmesan fries are a delicious appetizer while you wait!.i&#39;m gonna keep it simple.if you don&#39;t wait at least 5 minutes, it will burn your mouth..once it came out, it was done-zo..first thing i did in chicago was grab a deep dish from here, and omg it was amazing.when i called to complain, they told me the mail order pies are never as good as getting them in the restaurant.my sandwich was fine too.around an hour and half later we were surprised as we still didn&#39;t get a text so we asked them what was going on.chicago deep dish.so here&#39;s the deal with this place.i think it was a matter of this pizza coming out of the oven too soon.placed an order on their website - a breeze.it&#39;s a great place, if you like pizza with nothing, but cheese.giordano&#39;s pizza tastes so deliciously amazing with plenty of cheese, yummy crust, and stuffing..the greek salad was pretty weak..$64 + tip, not a bad deal everything we ordered.we had an excellent experience from the moment we walked in.here&#39;s the trap - once you&#39;ve pre-ordered, you get a ticket to give to your server."

you have posted hours, we didnt post them, but ok.a mix of burgers (which could rival au cheval and kuma&#39;s in my opinion) and modern american cuisine sit right next to mexican (great guac, but also check out the lumpia, which are like mexican eggrolls) and asian staples like bao buns..get the charcuterie board to start it&#39;s amazing!!!.i went with the wolf burger- 3 patties with all the fixens and imo it was indeed better than au cheval..this place is wonderful.shrimp, steak, chicken, all amazing!so that&#39;s it! make this one of your &#34;musts&#34; this year :)..for starters, we ordered a pound of the fried jumbo shrimp, as we were told the 1/2 pound would come with 5-6 pieces of shrimp depending on their size.i probably should have seen if they were on open table before showing up because when i got there at 7, there was a half hour wait.also their tacos and burgers are a hit.good joint.a few people were inside (decor: urban chic?) but there was still seating at tables and the bar..everyone was more than satisfied with their meal.to warn you this place is tiny!!! but can you tell that it didn&#39;t bother me, as i am giving it a 5 star!!!the owner was taking down names for the wait, but he was in no particular spot, he kept walking around and such, so it was hard to even know what was going on.shrimp tacos, pork/steak bao, and side of mac n cheese was delicious!the ambiance and music also added to the chill environment! everyone was friendly! food was great! drinks were great! will definitely come back if i ever do go back to chicago! :).oh, did i forget to mention that there was a hair in my elote? i will never go back to this place.this will definitely be our new choice for date nights!.the burger here is by far the best i&#39;ve had (sorry, au cheval), and the elotes and mac n cheese are unbeatable sides.i got the chopped salad plus chicken..because it&#39;s good.i might be okay drinking this with a straw.we had chicken bao (perfect harmony of sweet and savory flavor &amp; crispy/soft texture), beef tacos (omg so delicious and tender), fish tacos (wow), and potato taco (my least favorite, but only because the other ones with meat were beyond tasty)! tacos were served on slightly crisped up corn tacos and came with a decent serving of meat and condiments.unfortunately, the bartender (who was &#34;taking care&#34; of us) was less than stellar.enjoyed little bad wolf a lot! they were pretty busy on memorial day weekend, but the staff were prompt and friendly.my husband got a burger after hearing of the many fantastic reviews, but he/we found it to be just a little drier than we expected.but waited patiently like really patient cause with such small space and crowded with people i was sure he wanted us out asap but i didn&#39;t feel rush so that was nice of him.good selection at the bar.i&#39;d say 4 people could share this as a side dish easily! fried chicken dinner is outstanding! bacon gravy compliments the meal nicely and the chicken is juicy, has crunchy breading, and is probably better than big jones.japanese bbq pork bao- this was good! the pork was tender and had a crispy layer of skin which gave the boa that extra crunch.when i went to visit a buddy of mine, and she suggested we come here for lunch i was excited.had a great spread of tacos and sides with a friend.the only downside of this place the ambience.lbw&#39;s burgers are the best in chicago; they&#39;re better than au cheval&#39;s, and at much cheaper prices.had zombie killer cider and it was great.consider checking it out vs.a friend recommended little bad wolf and it was the perfect spot for a thursday night drink.guess what! i liked it.cheese melted to perfection.little bad wolf.i saw lots of folks eating tacos and am planning my 2nd visit to try&#39;em.my girlfriend had the chicken taco which was very tasty.will have to come back for a drink and explore the rest of the menu!.the food was wonderful.despite the slower, less friendly service on my second visit, i&#39;m a fan of this place.all pros: excellent quick and friendly service.overall the burger was very good, but it was very greasy, and the meat was also very salty.i am definitely coming back asap!.they also had a nice beer list, this place really surprised me in a good way!crab cake - bsalad - bpork taco - a-shrimp taco - ashrimp bao bun - a.as well, everyone working behind the bar was dropping the &#34;f&#34; bomb every other word while talking to each other which was very rude since customers are just a couple of feet away.simply put: wow bao does not satisfy my cravings, i need something closer to eating a white fluffy cloud wrapped in the perfect melt in your mouth meats.i&#39;ve come to really appreciate troy and his gang.we sat outside and didn&#39;t get our water refilled as often as we would have liked.we hunker down, pull out our laptops, and commence to ordering some great food and drink while completing paperwork and enjoying the atmosphere.lbw exceeded my expectations.i had the steak boa and mac and cheese..elotes win me over!!!!  so delicious.i actually enjoy sitting at the bar.also for appetizer we tried the corn-amazeballs.we then got to the food menu, and everything sounded so good.fyi- the portion size was huge so beware :)bartenders are super cool and friendly (shoutout to troy!).this place gets busy on a monday night.the drinks had such depth of flavor.very nice hostess and waitress."
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,1,"Wife had the salad we where both happy with our meal will definitely  come back next time we are in the area...they did give a refund, but of course we had to go pick it up since we ordered on door dash.mac and cheese was highlight.if you understand the good and bad of that place then you get what i&#39;m saying.such a cool little place, awesome staff that are really friendly and helpful, and the food is so good!i got the chicken salad the first time i went, the dressing is hot but it&#39;s so good!love it, will be coming back!..not worth it in my opinion.the staff was engaging.they should be a part of the &#34;kitchen menu&#34;..however i didn&#39;t think the food was as great as i imagined it to be..i have enjoyed must better jerk in the city.i had to use my own seasoning and some sweet baby rays to give it some flavor.i need a bit of butter or toasting to it so it was a throw away to me.i enjoyed my chicken with mild sauce.the staff is always nice.however, the chicken itself was kind of lackluster, a little dry, and pretty boring.daily happy hour specials and dj thurs,fri,sat.i would definitely go back.i can&#39;t wait to give it a second chance now.i hope this doesn&#39;t become a detractor for those who want some of jerk modern jamaican grill&#39;s offerings.check it out, you have nothing to lose!.it was a pleasant blend of a dark almost smoky spice with a small hint of sweet..but for spice lovers.i really recommend this place! try the beef brisket!jerk has definitely improved since my first visit!i appreciate that the portion sizes of the sides has almost doubled since my first visit.good food, great chicken, laid back atmosphere with jamaican music.the ambience is odd but we went in the daytime and the place looks like a mix between a club, sports bar, and deli.the plate comes with a side of sour dough bread, hard dough roll, and coleslaw too.jerk is well worth finding, well worth standing in line for and well worth experiencing the pain.was in neighborhood and needed a quick lunch, so i poked my head in and grabbed a salad.give it a shot, you won&#39;t regret it..everything was still hot! good job #ubereats!!! i will order again.i still have all the amazing flavors in my mouth from my meal and i probably won&#39;t brush my teeth until 12 midnight.service and operations are a little confusing and chaotic.it was cool, generally when i go to most jamaican spots i expect to have oxtail, or just a big stupid plate of food, that&#39;s not the deal there though, nonetheless the food wasn&#39;t bad the place aesthetically was dope.loved the festival.but the jerk chicken is fantastic.nice ambience.however the night we were there they only had chicken as a meat option (pork and beef are other normal options).top notch wonderful people! they definitely bring the experience to a whole new level, the bartenders, owner, cooks, line staff..the atmosphere is great seems like a cold spot to eat and drink on a friday night and have fun but the food needs a little tweaking by tweaking i means less jerk seasoning on everything!!..so much so that i always ask for extra! i will admit, it is a bit pricey if you are looking to go with kids, only because the a la carte items are $7+, not including the drink...for $8 i got a single layer of fairly fatty chicken strips on, what was listed as a jamaican hardroll, but was actually a cross between wonderbread and texas toast."

goosefoot-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/goosefoot-chicago,1,"The place is pretty loud.overall i thought the experience was good.all of the garnishes are from their garden and purposely chosen.5/10wow, a truly amazing restaurant in chicago! goosefoot, a new american restaurant featuring locally sourced foods and french technique from chris nugent, was the highlight of my restaurant tour in chicago.after seeing all these raving reviews and numerous people talking about this place on chowhound, i decided that this place was next on our radar when we visited the chicago area.for the service, the chef chris and his wife nina are the most friendliest people.it took us a few attempts to come up with something to celebrate.goosefoot is second to none of them!  i would go as far as it rivals french laundry (gasp!).my favorite dishes were the caviar/uni/citrus, the foie gras truffle, the scallop, and the angus beef.and i would even say that calling it a restaurant is not a good description - you are going to ingest a big edible show.the dining room is warm and humble.i am literally dreaming of the truffle gnocchi right now.it&#39;s worth it.the staff was warm and made us feel welcome, especially the owner (neena?).they go to great lengths to dazzle, but they never stray from a point of departure deeply rooted in sublime flavors.the food is always awesome!.we purchased (from the goosefoot store next door) a chilled bottle of chablis and a williamette valley pinot for a total of  $58; they were very nice and there are many choices in a moderate price range at the store.adventurous, unexpected combinations but at the same time, there were the familiar base flavors.fantastic and creative food, amazing service, etc.fantastic dining experience! we went here with friends from san francisco and were proud to share chicago&#39;s #1 new restaurant.so slow.i&#39;ve been wanting to try this place for a looong time.friendly, extremely courteous and helpful staff, delicious food (perhaps the best was the squash soup, followed by the beef), and great ambiance.my companion and i agreed that this was among the two top fine dining experiences we&#39;ve had..the second dish, a chestnut soup with smoke, white alba mushrooms and truffle essence was easily the best soup i have tasted.you can really tell that everyone, from the owner/chef&#39;s wife (i believe?) to the wait staff, want you to have a great experience and that they really care about every single element they are putting in front of you.it&#39;s pure, flavorful, perfectly cooked, and melts in your mouth.everything was cooked and presented perfectly, and i was blown away by the flavors.you&#39;ll find my comments aren&#39;t going to be super scientific on each dish, but suffice it to say: it rocked my socks off.dinner here was phenomenal! we truly enjoyed ourselves, and found each course to be more delicious than the last.can&#39;t say enough about this place.it&#39;s wonderful and i&#39;m so glad i went in last night utterly unprepared--let yourself be surprised!.well they failed on both parts, i got sick and my sister got a meal that was all one note.very beautifully prepared dishes and for 9 plates at their price, it is a steal.ambiance was a bit bland.the personal call a couple days before our reservations was really nice touch and chef was able to accommodate a food allergy in our group.i really enjoyed my meal here and was most appreciative of their ability to accommodate a gluten allergy..just another reason to come back &#34;home&#34; and experience it all again!.goosefoot is a special experience.when we went there, the lights flickered the whole time, the meal lasted 3.for the two of us, dinner was over 3 1/2 hrs.we did not enjoy the second half of our experience.you definitely need to book ahead of time.absolutely unbelievable..soon after, chris&#39;s wife, nina came around to greet us.i love everything about this place.the flavor was subtle.goosefoot, you have amazed me by exceeding every expectation in terms of food, service, and atmosphere..such a unique and amazing dining experience! this is truly a form of entertainment than just a dinner..i am sure it was a random cancellation as i have been attempting to dine here for about two years!  however, i wasn&#39;t complaining and i was going to do whatever it took to have my dinner!first of all, they call about a week and a half in advance to confirm.this is a bucket list type place if you enjoy fine dining.sometimes with these types of meals, i find that dessert can be disappointing.in total, we had eleven courses and enjoyed almost all of them.there was too much cream and soup/sauce dishes throughout.i know menus are seasonal , and my review goes way back in time , but i still remember that dinner.pear: so perfect - light, flavorful..need to make reservations well in advance, but definitely worth it.the pace of the meal continued to be an issue the rest of the night.the pacing of our meal sounds better than what many other folks have reported.goosefoot is pretty darn good.i was somewhat shocked by the person that reviewed goosefoot and said that the wait between courses was too long at 25 minutes and that the wait time should be cut in half.then again, nor do i think it&#39;s ok to settle for a heap with no heat and no a/c.in short, food is ok, but definitely can&#39;t compete with any of the fine dining restaurants in chicago yet.the staff was delightful and nina was an incredible host..esp for the price - $90 for 8 courses and it&#39;s byob - this is quite a bargain.interesting food,  incredible flavors,  wonderful staff.was a night to remember."
d-nuez-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/d-nuez-chicago-2,1,"Everything was delicious.it is a hidden gem in chicago.she was very nice, greeted us, checked on us a few times but was not overwhelming.i loved  it!.if your expecting pacos tacos or gallos prices then your in the wrong place.the delivery man called and spoke spanish which i couldn&#39;t understand.i look forward to frequenting this spot!.the menu has everything! and it&#39;s all natural and homemade.try the watermelon.you must go! your welcome.d&#39;nuez is like a hidden gem that not everyone knows about.the chilaqiles de mole where amazing they come with rice and salad.they&#39;re $5-$6!!! they dont have a very big variety of coffee drinks.they&#39;re sweet and not too spicy and the sides weren&#39;t bad either.one of the better mole dishes in the area.ok service.service was niceps, mango water was super weird, don&#39;t get that.."
yuzu-sushi-and-robata-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yuzu-sushi-and-robata-grill-chicago,2,"And that&#39;s all i have to say about that.make a reservation beforehand, because this place does get crowded.after placing the order for the first 4 courses i felt like ben affleck in gone girl when it came to tracking down our waitress to (a) ask where our food was and (b) place the order for our remaining 3 courses because she just disappeared on us.the sauce art was also amazing! the sauces range from colored japanese mayo to eel sauce.after that, we ordered 6 different rolls.it&#39;s like a kicked up ponzu, citrusy, salty, and fantastic!i recall being able to order beef tongue here at their old location, but i haven&#39;t seen it on the menu in recent visits.and of course, your sushi pictures will be quite a gem as well.my date&#39;s ethnic background is not an excuse for poor service..i really enjoyed the dried mushrooms and noodles though.the scene is date-tastic so be prepared to hear a couple first date type stories.the staff is really nice and full with service mind.waited approx 30 mins as advised.thank you yuzu!.this should be a staple of every orderthis ranks as one of my favorite sushi spots in chicago, and unlike some of the others won&#39;t break the bank.we had a lovely time, and i just wanted to personally say thank you to bua and her staff.the fish was very fresh and they gave generous pieces of fish in the sushi.the mussels as an app is a great choice.service is real quick , tons of street parking , and byob=lifetime goer.i visited this place via a friends recommendation.highly recommend this place.a couple noodle dishes.the sushi was very average at best.their restaurant is a bit larger now since they moved down the street, but still make sure to call and get a reservation.the service was amazingly fast.hands down, some of the most beautiful presentation i&#39;ve seen on any food (and i dine out a lot).yuzu is an altogether amazing sushi experience.this place was fun but we thought the sushi was mediocre at best..honestly, i believe that this place is good, but a bit over rated..i had the beet salad.we had the black sea roll ($10) and 100 years roll ($10) which were both fine with fish fresh enough...&#34;this one is rubbery.aside from that it&#39;s a thumbs up for me!.5.that is crazy.the robata was awesome too, it&#39;s just japanese style meats on a stick.i also ordered &#39;my favorite midwest roll&#39; which wasn&#39;t terrible.i would highly recommend!...all their dishes are aesthetically pleasing.went to yuzu last night and it was just perfect.really enjoyed my experience here and hope to come back again and again.the sushi is extremely affordable and the chunks of fish and sushi pieces are huge! we got the tuna poke to start and it was incredible.the place was decorated nicely and very chill.started with the tuna poke.well, yuzu is fun, a little different, and apparently (i am told) authentically japanese! for $ 30, there&#39;s a lot of options, salad, sashimi, rolls and so on.rice to fish ratio was consistent in that there was adequate amount of fish/veggie...the food was fresh and well packed and of a generally high quality.all of the rolls are delicious and they plate them very beautifully.i don&#39;t think any other restaurant has ever told me i need to leave by 9:30pm.1) you go there on a saturday night without reservation and get seated in 5 minutes;2) ambience is super cool!!3) the food is sophisticated, fun and delicious.the green harbor sushi had the most beautiful design on it! however, the sushi itself was massive and hard to eat.we ordered some grilled calamari which was cooked well but nothing to write home about.huge pieces of nigiri.the manga art covering the walls.miso is fantastic.not that it was bad just wasn&#39;t for me.there&#39;s also a few bars nearby if you want to continue drinking after drinking here.the chicago spring sushi roll was one of the best i ever had! we will be back, many times!.we tried two rolls and boy were they tasty, almost too pretty to eat, almost!can&#39;t beat amazing sushi and byob!  will be back.once again, our feedback fell on deaf ears and all we got back in response was defensive excuses..i&#39;m glad i saved a tiny bit of room for dessert because the yuzu white chocolate and matcha hazelnut cakes were delightful!service was very attentive - constantly filling my water cup and clearing dirty plates.i think i had the #thuglife2 roll.but actually today the painting is not that good.like the other reviews mentioned, the presentation is pretty and the sushi board was like a canvas for sauces.seriously disappointed in the food and service."
remingtons-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/remingtons-chicago,1,"=).we planned on going to the purple pig, but wanted to try somewhere new..customer service - our waitress, jessica, was great when i went there for dinner..more specifically it&#39;s light yummy flavor.i&#39;ve been a total of three times now, all for lunch.good sevice.and then after we got the wine there was a point where we didn&#39;t see our servers for a good 30 minutes.just okay.i ordered a monkey bread also which was disturbingly large and soaking in gobs of butter and sugar: be warned if you don&#39;t like such unhealthy options!--we took most of that home.great food, great service, great location.i would highly recommend anyone to try at least once.ask for vipin, he is comfortably attentive and gives great menu advice.in my opinion, the rest of the menu might be a little overprice for this type of restaurant, located in michigan avenue but without many bars around to get a drink after (if you&#39;re going for dinner), but i still liked it for a casual lunch.for the main i had the kale salad the salad was very nice but the dressing was sweet not with a touch of sweet but eating a treat kind of sweet a little too much for me but the peanuts helped a little to balance.had the heirloom and tomato salad and filet oscar.hungry walking to the art institute museum, this place on the way, food was delicious plentiful, probably best shoestring fries i&#39;ve ever had, reasonably priced, service a bit slow but it was lunchtime however don&#39;t that that stop you.the tuna poke is legit.after lunch, our server offered us dessert, which we turned down.danielle was so welcoming.my dad ordered a traditional egg breakfast, and you guys - i cannot even explain in words how mind blowing their hash browns are.guac and chips?  you bet.we will be back, but next time to dine in the amazing wine room.based on my experience of the night, this place seems to be extremely overrated but perhaps it&#39;s bc i didnt get to try the monkey bread that everybody raved about.while walking along michigan ave, i noticed a little spot  named remington&#39;s..everybody else ordered meat, either the ribs, filet mignon, prime rib, or the remington.my fellow diners agreed.it could be that i just don&#39;t really understand what a good restaurant is, but in the end, we walked away thinking more pretentious than nice.good atmosphere.my experience was limited to the crab louis and the guacamole.by far the very best thing was the grilled artichoke starter plate.we both recommended this restaurant to our friends.i got a kale salad, a selection of oysters, crab cakes, and a rhubarb dessert.glad there was a wait at the other place!remington&#39;s brunch was delicious, adult and kid friendly.sauteed and then oven baked to crisp up the skin, it was a hit.awful.now we are fortified for our cloudy day in chicago!!.the staff both times has been extremely attentive...by the end of our meal, we were both completely stuffed.this was more of a marketing scheme than gastronomic feature.enjoyable place to eat with a great view for people watching..she couldn&#39;t stop commenting on how it was cooked perfectly and how good it tasted.i went here for my first time and had real steakhouse expectations, but they definitely fell short.i skipped right to one of the dessert specials, a local strawberry rhubarb (crumble) with vanilla bean ice cream on top.i got the no 8 tuna per others&#39; recommendations and enjoyed it, but did not find it to be anything special.highly recommend remington&#39;s!!!.for appetizers, the east/west coast oysters are excellent.:)i ordered the rotisserie chicken, which was served with a side of mashed potatoes that had been doused in the au jus from the chicken.sea bass perfectly cooked n presented.we were told to go to wildberries but the 1:45 min wait made us search for something else.the shrimp appetizer was kickass as well.we were seated earlier than our reservation time, which we appreciated.the prime rib was just fantastic.first of all, the place is very appealing to the eye with a lounge area when you first walk in, wall of wine, and a large bar in the middle with big tvs.and were disappointed to find out that about 3 things on the menu we were thinking about they were out of.the perfect end to a fun day in the city!.seems like a lot of places serve them at the size of a white castle burger.this special needs to be a part of the regular menu.thank you, remington&#39;s!!!.the other two people in my family both ordered the pork chop, and we were told they had run out, and only one chop was available.my husband ordered the chicken and i had the wrightwood salad..good things happen when you expect the least."
coalfire-pizza-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/coalfire-pizza-chicago,1,"The salami was crispy and salty.we didn&#39;t really explore the beverage menu too much; my dad ordered a beer and other people had the mexican coke, which is just a bottle of coke from mexico with a nice proportion of sugar..my favorite brick over pizza..although on the pricey end for wood fired pizza, i would happily pay whatever price they set to get my hands on more slices.i came with a group of 6 and we were seated immediately.normally i tend to order vegetarian pizzas, but the way to go at coal fire is with the pepperoni and whipped ricotta pizza.stopped in this past saturday night and only had a 5-min wait for a table.i thought we had a bread with red dipping sauce, but maybe not.but over the past year or so i&#39;ve been seeing all these great reviews of coalfire and honestly thinking it&#39;s not that great people.the only thing i didnt like that didnt server mix drinks like maragaritas.i first learned of coalfire on an episode of &#34;check please&#34; and couldn&#39;t wait to try it out.their brick oven neapolitan style pizza is fast, fresh, and among the best pizza in chicago by far.these slices will make your belly quite happy!..the service was good and so was the pizza.great service, everyone i&#39;ve ever talked to is very friendly and attentive.now, i am not saying we wanted to eat that first pizza but here is what i think: (1) they either gave that to someone else or (2) threw it out.heard a crazy story about this place.don&#39;t go here unless you want to waste your money.amazing in their simplicity, these thin crust pizzas have it all: great thin crust pizza, tangy tomato sauce, fresh and perfectly paired toppings.for example, we had asked for some extra sauce as soon as our pizza was brought to our table, and we had to request it two more times before it arrived and our pizza had gotten fairly cold by then.notice there are almost 800 reviews so i can&#39;t add a lot..the service is pleasant and friendly...the cheese added nothing to my experience.and lastly, the same as the second one with pepperoni on it!i am sad that we don&#39;t live here to eat this all the time.the stracciatella &amp; sausage pizza packs in a lot of heat and spice so warning for you faint of the heart..we yelped for pizza and saw the great reviews for here.outstanding new york style pizza! extremely quick turn around from ordering to having food on your table.definitely order more than one pizza, my husband and i killed two no problem!.sure, it&#39;s a pizza place and veggies are not why people go there, but c&#39;mon, take a lesson from malnati&#39;s malnati salad.besides that i liked the thin crust.this place has the best pizza in chicago..since the pizza is thin and cooked at high temperatures, you need to finish the pie quickly before it starts getting cold to enjoy it at its peak..they have parking spots right out front for pick-up customers.forget deep dish, that stuff is too heavy.not quite sure what all the hype was about as i read about this place on an &#34;undiscovered top pizza place in chicago&#34;.we&#39;ve tried some of the other pizzas, not a huge fan of the ones with the ricotta on them but they are still pretty good!my only complaint is they don&#39;t really have that many appetizers, salads, or desserts - so just go for the pizza.the staff was attentive and the food was tasty.everything you&#39;d ever want from a pizza.will come back.the salads were basic nothing too exciting but fine.the whipped ricotta is so excellent - not only is it pretty, but it&#39;s infused with flavor and super mouthwateringly delicious.service was good and this place is great to walk into when it&#39;s cold outside.even though i arrived at the last minute at 9:30, they were very nice about seating me.i almost don&#39;t want to review coalfire as i prefer to be the only one who knows about it..definitely can&#39;t wait to go back soon and try more options.slightly charred, a bit crunchy, yet chewy - and great flavor.i will admit that i came in specifically to try the whipped ricotta pizza, so i went ahead and ordered what i came in for - white pizza please.i was really disappointed in our last visit, and it&#39;s sad for me to say because it the past times we thought you guys were great,the pizza took quite a bit longer then normal, and when we got it it was not hot, and it tasted under done, the service was a 1 star, no i don&#39;t want anything free, not sure what&#39;s going on, and the people that were with us were 1st timers, and they were also disappointed,without going into more detail (which i could)  i/ we will not hurry back, and no you were not even full.i love that the whipped ricotta is always mounded in the middle of each slice, so you can spread it around, or take some of it off.i muscled through one of each.it was hot, cheesy, and good ingredients on the pizza, which had a great pizza oven crispness and flavor.great pie! completely unexpected getting nyc style pizza in the windy city that&#39;s actually solid.we will be able to get at least one extra meal out of it, possibly two,  i&#39;ll be back-plus there is street parking and no pay meters!  i just read how they have a 2nd location in lakeview- no doubt it will be busy.crust was thin, cracker-like in places and a bit chewy (in a good way) in others.awesome, crispy, delicious.my go to place for pizza! the margarita pizza is my fav and def recommend it! i&#39;ve never dined in, only take out but still good..go go go!.ohhh and cup cakes!.i&#39;ve been a server and that doesn&#39;t take much time at all..crispy crust and fresh tasting ingredients.keep in mind that this restaurant gets mad busy on weekends.so i walked in on a saturday afternoon a&#39;s the restaurant was maybe half full."
joong-boo-market-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joong-boo-market-chicago-2,2,"Our plan was to make homemade sushi rolls so we knew joong boo was the perfect place to go for all our main ingredients.this place makes this white boy very happy!.we finished that off for lunch today and then are getting on a plane in a few hours!  mistake?  probably! :-)the tiny snack bar in the back was really busy and we are going to make a point to come back there for lunch someday soon.they are heavenly..so if you ask me, while i appreciate the benefits of the super h mart in the northern &#39;burbs, this place honestly has everything i need and beats driving 30 extra minutes.for two dollars a tennis-ball-big, fabulous steamed dumpling with a huge amount of seasoned pork filling - our favorite, though there are other varieties.conveniently located right off the highway so its easy to get to, although leaving their parking lot can be of a hassle depending on the time of day.the food corner is delicious but the food is even more delicious when the original cook is doing the cooking.did not like the place at all and their selections were limited.this has been my go to market, but there are some additional major korean grocery stores opening up in 2017, so excited to have more options!best,charlie.that is what hmart is for.if this were closer to home, i would probably come here more often.tucked away in the back of the market is a little cafeteria-like spot serving classic craving-satisfying dishes.also if you haven&#39;t tried their kimchi dumplings for $2 you&#39;re definitely missing out..prime place to get your korean cuts of meat, kimchee, and all kinds of sauces.oh how i love hole in the wall places like this.don&#39;t be fazed that they speak to you in korean when they pick up!step 2 - pick up the platterstep 2.i must give a preliminary shout out to the steamed &#34;dumpling&#34; stand out front serving enormous $2 buns of kimchi, pork, and sweet red bean paste with black rice dough.if you like to cook, treat yourself to an exploration of the ingredients at joong boo market..you can taste the authenticity in every bite.back in the day, every korean traveling through chicago, would have to make the obligatory stop at joong boo.i recommend all the three buns that they have.language barrier?  just smile and point to what you&#39;d like.my favorites are to have the ramen with rice cakes (#2) and the bulgogi (#6) together.i hear its actually tasty but i will never find out.that was a first for me! kimchi from leeks? yes! i think i will.compared to stores in many smaller cities, it&#39;s big.$25 sashimi platter.been coming here for years.but oh well, it&#39;s $25! no one really pays attention to you once you are at the fish counter, so make sure you flag someone down and tell them you are there to pick up the sashimi platter.the first thing that hits you when you enter the store is the smell of fish.be careful when adding salt cause it gets salty pretty quick.warning: much bigger on the inside.i don&#39;t know if there exists any other grocery mart located as close to an interstate exit as this one off of the kimball exit on westbound i-90/94 (a few feet off of the exit and entrance and most convenient!).the parking lot is always jam packed and so is the store but amazingly they get you parked and in and out of the store much faster than big name stores.we were at joong boo shopping for banchan necessities and decided to get a bite to eat.(this is a korean place but i&#39;m going for japanese stuff.i noticed they replaced their crappy carts!  yes!  makes my shopping experience with a toddler much easier.the pricing is also very good for what you get, everything is from around $5-$9.their is a restaurant inside with great soups i always get #2.the space is a bit cramped and the staff could be nicer, but i guess that&#39;s anywhere.00 including tax.the court closes about 1 hour before the market closes so if you want to avoid the traffic, you may miss the food!.my girlfriend and i stopped here for some fast korean food, namely the kimbap, dokbeokgi, and some seaweed/glass noodle roll thing i am forgetting the name of.the snack corner is my favorite thing about this place, so cheap and soooooo good.next time i&#39;m in chicago i will definitely stop by again.it won&#39;t make your bun inedible by any stretch.yum!.but shhhh don&#39;t tell anyone else because it&#39;s always sooo crowded.i tried their kimchi dumplings which is okay.a must try if you enjoy korean food.the best korean food for that price! i recommended to every asian food lover :)cheep and tasty.$4 for two huge dumplings that will leave you absolutely stuffed.9.if you want the aesthetic of mariano&#39;s perhaps this place is out of your comfort zone but it&#39;s truly your loss..the dumplings (which are what i think of as baos) are out of this world..firstly, closing hours for the dumpling stand is 7:30 pm and last order for dine in at the snack corner is 7:45 pm.tip: go on wednesdays when there is $10 off on sashimi!.you can find everything from short ribs to eel here.everything we saw looked yummy!.i&#39;m sure i&#39;ll be back to try the food out.it packs a lot of punch for being in such a small place compared to the other grocery stores in the city, and making a trek through the cta blue line from home in the south loop to here is always worth it.they also have a kimchi bar here..especially with the sauce.they freeze well.we bought marinated beef in order to make some at home, and it was excellent! the stand that sells $2 buns is also great, the worker was very sweet and the pork buns are sooo good, not to mention big and a great value for the price..joong boo market is the best asian market i have found in the city.the produce isn&#39;t always great, but it&#39;s super cheap.i ordered the #20 spicy octopus and it comes with a good sized portion of octopus with vegetables, three ban chan (korean pickles, salads, side dishes), a large portion of rice, and a bowl of miso soup and it cost $8.most packages are labeled with english translated stickers but some of our favorite new ingredients were somewhat of a mystery.closest asian mart near me.i will definitely be coming back here often..i love joong boo for their snack corner and also for all the marinated beef they have.i also will never grow fond of the tiny isles with people shelving the product who won&#39;t let you pass, but it&#39;s part of the experience.generous servings.only for those who can tolerate high levels of spicy goodness."

ramen-san-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ramen-san-chicago,1,"Decently tasting ramen.really awesome presentation for take out even with heating instruction.the broth was more like a thick gravy and it wasn&#39;t all that warm upon being served.food: there were definitely some interesting items on the menu i wanted to try, but considering this was my second dinner, i just stuck to the basics and ordered a classic bowl of tonkotsu..loud noises!.there are just too many ingredients in the soup.not a bad option! the flavors were a little too unique for me to try though, black sesame and green tea.we all loved her.see photo.better make a reservation on a friday night.for our ramen, i decided to get the tonkotsu ramen.we did the $15 lunch express where you get a choice of a rice plate could come with chicken, steak or salmon and a choice of a ramen noodle soup bowl too.those seeking that should adjust their expectations.disappointed by the portion size of the hamachi.overall is just okay.even the fried rice was salty.but this margarita will be a constant source of tasty truth..my friend and i were thrilled to discover this place since there seems to be nothing but steakhouses in the area.i liked the venue it self, it was nice with exposed bricks and projector tv.nice location, sat outside on the patio on a lovely august night.it tastes like normal bad green tea ice cream, like the ones you get at gyu kaku.love this place! the food, music, service and overall ambience is amazing.the soundtrack is top notch.the tonkotsu broth was very rich and delicious! the pork slices were also generous and incredibly flavorful, charred to perfection..this makes me a happy foodie.if i could i&#39;d give 3.service was good.it&#39;d not that the environment was off-putting, but it was rather boring.the food is consistently delicious, and the service is always top-notch.we had the sticky thai wings which were sweet and spicy and cooked to crispy perfection.i&#39;ve heard that the sumo bowl, which is both a larger portion and spicier, is the real standout at ramen-san, so if i ever find myself urging to coming back here i&#39;ll order that.and the place was empty, literally only one other group in the place.only 1 block from our hotel=bonus!there were about 2 other couples ahead of us in line, but we were sat right away in a booth (our preference).main problem, the soup came room temperature to almost cool.went here with some friends, left with another restaurant to add to my regular places to eat at.check it out, great for the river north crowds and people working in the area.cool ramen spot in river north with funky musicthe manhattan was ok, nothing to remember, maybe should have tried their signature drinks.we all did the lunch combo.best ramen in the city.the chicken wings are quite spicy, so be careful if you don&#39;t like spicy food and order the other option :).solid 3.it was soft and basically melted in your mouth..communal tables are located in the middle of the restaurant while tables/booths are along the edge.otherwise, hold the onions!recommendation:thai wingschicken gyozasthey do have alfresco dining.on the table they have hot chili flakes, salt and pepper mix to add to this beautiful creation.the place wasn&#39;t busy due to the late hour.for starters, i mistakenly ordered the wrong ramen.yo.then we shared an order of the traditional gyoza with crispy angel wing.it doesn&#39;t fill you up for the main course.the manager made a trip over before we even ordered to welcome up and thank us for our patronage."
ricobenes-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ricobenes-chicago-4,1,"He says yes and do i want to order, or can he assist others..check it out if you are in the south side neighborhood in chicago..seventy years and still going strong.heated it in the oven and tasted just fine.i hit them up after the sox game.the marinara sauce that comes with it is a must - sandwich would be a little to dry without it.the bigger revelation was the pizza at ricobene&#39;s; clearly, the majority of people who ordered while i was here tonight got the pizza, so next time around i may grab a slice of the pie and a soda since that seems like it would be plenty of food for a reasonable person.the crust was odd and flaky-tasted like something you would use for pumpkin pie.wait times should be quicker but customer service should be much better.loved all of it.they are kinda expensive though.at least now i can say i tried it at least.takes 15 minutes to make a chocolate malt while they stand around and look at you.i would rather bring my family and friends from out of town here than deep dish!.additional tip: unbutton your pants before you attempt to eat the sandwich lol.lots of competition out there..we would have been happy enough to find a good, cheap meal and free parking before hitting the baseball field, but ricobene&#39;s has come up with not only a brilliant marketing and business plan, but a valuable customer service in offering free shuttle rides to/from cellular field.they are know for the breaded steak sandwiches and use the same breeding on their chicken parmesan and eggplant parmesan sandwiches.the food is always good, the deep dish pizzas always pack a punch (personal favorite &#34;the works&#34;).first time here a couple of days ago.the cheese blend in the ravioli was excellent and the meatballs were some of the best she and i have ever had.we go in, order at the counter (where the options for what you can get on your sandwich are not listed, which makes it awkward when they ask - we got hot giardinera either way), and walk away later with two monster sized sandwiches - the italian beef and the legendary breaded steak sandwich.ricobene had amazing pork sandwiches, but their chili cheese fries are really what won me over.mind you, i am now a north suburb transplant and this 45+ minute drive was well worth it..when smothered in mozzarella and sweet and spicy peppers, it will definitely make your tummy smile.the arancini was decent, not the best, and i didn&#39;t realize you had to add cheese to the steak sandwich or maybe mine was just missing the cheese.they stuck the pizza in the oven for a quick reheat, and then they were boxed and ready to go.if you&#39;re one of those people who do not care for fresh food and just want to stuff yourselves then this place is good for you.if you&#39;re going to go for something else the deep dish is phenomenal.the staff and service where grate!!the food is but average and less.ricobene&#39;s is definitely a neighborhood spot.we went a couple of weeks ago and they got our order wrong, it was correct on the receipt so the kitchen made the error.but it was up there.it wasn&#39;t amazing but decent.awesomesteak sandwich is huge and freaking awesome.very tender steak on the sandwich and seasoned very well.maybe i need to try something else?diaclaimer.make sure and grab a fat stack of napkins prior to unwrapping this beast cause your going to need them.but this cheesecake factory was drunk food with a nostalgic marketing schema.hands down the best thicker crust pizza in chicago.for $10 for a king size it was a waste.to my surprise, we were offered to have the burger re-heated.eaten when hungry..they come with a side of fries, which is more like a bed which the wings rest on.baby.the pizza hit the spot just perfectly and although i found it to be a little pricy considering the size of pizza i ordered, the delivery driver was very friendly and my pizza was delivered at a very reasonable amount of time.from the pizza to the pastas to the sandwiches.they are fatty, soggy and drenched in bitter hot wing sauce.my experience here was awful starting with the lady at the register who was clearly hard of hearing! the staff was rude.also their homemade lemonade italian ice is very sweet and delicious.fantastic, greasy, chicago street food..yowsa!!! we also ordered a little pizza and yea, pretty much need a whole one (full size) for myself.as for their pizza, i think it&#39;s great.pizza was served luke warm, didn&#39;t taste anything special, and service felt like i was being a bother."

antique-taco-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/antique-taco-chicago,1,"The outdoor seating is nice towards the front, but the further back you go, the closer you get to an alley with some stinky garbage.the menu is posted high up and very visible to see.the taco salad is super flavorful, and the potato &amp; poblano tacos are so good to vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike! the homemade tortillas are the perfect texture.i tried to scrape it off, but it had already soaked into the tortilla and breading.i mean, even a basket of chips.bring a friend and swap ;).the potatoes and pineapples went well with the ribeye.i&#39;ll report back and let you know!..the marg was really strong but a good kind of strong! the chicken tasted like it was bbqed and i liked the shrimp better than the chicken, but they were both fantastic.setting up the service was pretty much hassle-free (tbh, a huge reason we chose them was that the catering prices were clearly stated on the website and there weren&#39;t any surprises when we talked in person).in the case of big star vs antique taco, the jury is still out, but i&#39;m inclined to side with this place.i like the vibe and def recommend the pork taco over anything else on the menu.i love the fish tacos! the chili cheese curds are worth sharing too! they have a few good sweets too like key lime pie or horchata milkshake.much more of a &#39;scene&#39; than a taco joint.i had the pork carnitas with avocado, bacon and cheese and was fabulous, with all ingredients perfectly cooked.its a self serve for water napkins etc i hate that.disclaimer: do not share the fish tacos if you&#39;re dining with others (make everyone order their own) oh and the chips are addictive as well.really nice staff, relaxed, and not too pricey.i went to the antique taco chiquito location at the revival in the loop, which always has a long line so i had to try it.really adore this place - i&#39;ve come here a couple of times and every experience has just been great.mexican coke, kitschy, hip and tasty!

 these were so tasty and delicious!  my friend and i split the daily special ribeye chili nachos ($9) and the garlic shrimp tacos ($8 for 2).you have to order the tacos in two and they are large.excellent quality, clean bathroom and great food.decor is nice, they also have a small patio outside too.i didn&#39;t expect this to be as good as it was.antique is truly a shining star in chicago&#39;s restaurant scene..not much explanation needed, but equally as delicious!i would definitely come back for more! you can never say no to tacos.really cute taco spot -- great place to take visitors because of the ambiance (semi-communal seating, lots of natural light) and fun dishesyou can&#39;t buy individual tacos, only pairs, so there&#39;s no mixing and matching.come hungry, enjoy tacos with a margarita.my standards are high.but then i went back up to order food when my friend arrived, and they acted like i had done something wrong.love this place but not in love with the price tag.shame on you.we got there at around 7 and there wasn&#39;t a long line and we found a seat pretty quickly.well, actually i am fussy wherever i eat (let&#39;s be honest).these were just that good and an absolute must order, in my opinion.everyone raves about the fish but my favorite was the garlic shrimp.i&#39;d happily recommend antique tacos, whether for dinner or for catering.and to drink we had the house rosemary margarita.i was disappointed with the lack of veggie options for tacos and the overall abundance of fish-related tacos."

 um no.my 2nd stop on my chicago donut crawl was do rite.wish i could have tried the michigan apple fritter, but maybe next time!.stopped in for a donut and was not disappointed.it&#39;s epic.during my recent visit i ordered a vanilla bean donut.you can&#39;t come here and just get 1 donut.true the bun is weak and a tad on the soggy side, the chicken itself is tasty.i wish i saved my calories :/ the donuts are just sitting there so it makes sense that it was stale but that&#39;s still $3 i will never get back and it was so stale.the vanilla bean glazed cinnamon crunch (raised, at the suggestion of the workers) was so delicious, i still can&#39;t stop thinking about it..also the cinnamon buttermilk donut was nice and edgy with soft inside.you will find it up the stairs at the streeterville center.i would definitely get it again the next time i&#39;m in chicago.all were good.i tried a cheese danish donut and my only regret is that i don&#39;t have more! yum! try an assortment, you won&#39;t be disappointed!.they were kind enough to give us a free box of a dozen donuts when we left because the shop was closing, and that was a really awesome surprise! if you&#39;re scoping out the chicago donut scene, i&#39;d definitely recommend dropping by.it was not overly sweet, and the lemon taste was not too tart.it&#39;s a small shop that isn&#39;t really labeled well but easy to find.particularly because i&#39;m not sure where else fried chicken and donuts are a together kind of thing..5 stars for their donuts.their classic old fashioned is always warm and fresh no matter when i get it.service is pretty fast.i&#39;m determined to eat my way through chicago for the 2.i came here for a cup of coffee and donut and was surprised to see they also had chicken/hearty breakfast sandwiches!i didn&#39;t really enjoy the coffee, they source from dark matter.us news &amp; world report currently ranks northwestern memorial hospital #7 in diabetes/endocrinology and #9 in cardiology &amp; heart surgery.he devoured his.wow it&#39;s like magic! after eating here i don&#39;t crave donuts anymore!!seriously, not sure why this place has so many 5 star reviews..and the chicken sandwich &amp; fry&#39;s are great!  loves this place!.yum :&#39;) i plan to return and try the other sandwiches as well.this restaurant had a new article framed right in front of the front door about being one of the top 5 chicken sandwich places in chicago so i had expected a thick, juicy chicken sandwich to satisfy the chick fil a craving me and my roommate were having this particular day.visiting the city i thought i&#39;d try out this place based on the reviews.dark matter coffeeoverall, it is a little expensive here, but it makes for a nice meal or snack..nom nom nom.coffee is your standard fare, but got a bit sourish towards the middle, so i didn&#39;t finish; not great.the bun, the slaw and the pickles unite on a sweet soft bun that practically melts in your mouth.i was curious if it was as good as a donut shop i recently visited in san diego that was out of this world..everything here is delicious!! had a bite of each of the donuts we bought (well, because i can!).i got the spicy classic chicken sandwich, the wait wasn&#39;t too bad considering it was 1pm on a friday and they cook each sandwich fresh.meyer lemon pistachio goodness to kick the day off.all were good but we couldn&#39;t discern anything different from a krispy kreme.the breakfast sandwich is really good and original, people would say there is not such thing as too much bacon, but for me this one was.they were all dry and lacking in actual flavor, which is why donut vault has always been and will continue to be my #1 donut spot in america; you order a vanilla chestnut and it tastes exactly like vanilla chestnut.donuts! i love donuts! i was very excited to see the ratings for this place since i haven&#39;t really seen that for any place back home, in ny.only thing i didn&#39;t like was how slow the service was, but the sacrifice of time was well worth it.holy donuts, batman!  my friend convinced me to try do-rite when i mentioned that i was going to stan&#39;s.unlike other hip donut spots from either new york or seattle, these $2-$3 donuts tend to be a bit on dryer side.i was very excited because today was the day i could eat everything i want.i actually stumbled upon this place after the donut place near my hotel sold out of their famous bear claw donut..i follow do-rite on instagram.other celiacs will understand!! i had the cinnamon sugar, lemon and choc crueller.it&#39;s basically a soft, fluffy glazed donut with the cheese danish filling in the center.the adventure experience: the sweet heat and dorite collaborations3.recommend !.i  went there for the second time today and i wasn&#39;t disappointed.pistachio lemon meyer donut is incredible - cake-like and perfect pistachio to glaze ratio.perfect."
opart-thai-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/opart-thai-house-chicago,2,"Everyone who truly loves thai food knows that many thai dishes are meant to be very spicy.i&#39;ve also had the egg rolls which are quite tasty.everything is very authetic, flavorful, and spicy if you order so, unlike many thai places where the spicyness is either nonexistent or bland and hot, opart is always a good blend of tasty spices from regular to extra hot.bad service and bad customer service.the food was made and delivered to my door within 30 minutes of my putting the order in online - and i lived just blocks away from grant park where lollapalooza was still going on mind you.so i&#39;ve came to accept to just stick with the things you like..chicken was overcooked and it&#39;s just noodles and chicken and nothing green..everyone else i was with seemed to love love love what they ordered.opart thai never disappoints!whether you&#39;re looking for classic pad thai or something more adventurous, you won&#39;t be disappointed.this is definitely not a place for authentic thai food.the only upside was the quick delivery, but i won&#39;t be eating from here again..and the egg noodles were quite good.some pretty delicious thai food! my go to place this trip to chicago for asco and 1000x better than mccormick conference food.they&#39;ve also gotten delivery orders wrong before, taken forever to bring a replacement, and not really apologized or offered any discount for their mistake.red curry was better with some veggies and a better flavored sauce but neither one was mind blowing..the thai eggplant that comes with this dish might  feel weird in your mouth if your not a fan of it, but overall everything was a hit.pricing is very reasonable for thai food in the city...i understand that they lack in infrastructure of taking orders but the way they spoke was very rude.the place has a nice vibe--not a casual restaurant but not formal either.thai is my fave so that says a lot.based on the presentation or the lack there of, the cook (not chef) brew the noodles in a  50 servings pot then whomever ordered their desired meat, they just added into the plate before serving.had amazing dinner here and really nice staff as well.everything else they recommended was pretty pedestrian and forgettable.tiger cry!!![stand by for epic rotd or even rotw material].done pick up (i live in west loop and miss the delivery radius by two blocks but the new chicago ave location delivers to us!) and dined in.i have ordered for delivery a couple times now..will come back again.i ordered tofu satay thinking it would be similar to chicken satay, what i got were dry, unseasoned fried bits of tofu.i love their sweet and sour chicken, and they have the best jasmine tea i&#39;ve ever had! staff usually is kind of rushy, but generally pretty nice..the other two thai places i always went to around the sloop closed down (ma &amp; i and sala bua), so we had to resort to this.we were craving some asian food and stumbled across this on yelp, we figured good reviews so why not? fail..25hrs for delivery and was definitely still hot! they also properly packaged the food which i truly appreciate so i wasn&#39;t greeted by a soupy, wet mess that one has been accustomed to when it comes to deliveries.i also had to call about 3 times to revise/add to the order.we also ordered the crab rangoon.food was good.the good was okay, nothing special..i&#39;ve eaten at this location on several occasions (over appx 4 years) and for the most part, been great..i hope their dishes improve because it is a welcoming environment.one of my favorite places for delivery.the tiger cry is yummy as well, other reviewers are correct in that being their top dish.rice was mushy.the sampler was great as well.you must now go and try it also..also food was good.amazing flavors.first i was very excited to find naem sod on the menu as its rare to find and even rarer to find a place that does it well and opart does.i had the tiger cry which was just meat on lettuce but i put it over rice and it was decent, my bf had the pad thai and it was very average and the beef was not that great.the tofu is completely unnecessary.the tigers tear salad was only meat, no lettuce or veggies or dressing.we got the tiger cry but spicy version, i will be back for dat with a bowl of rice.and it is amazing!!.not the best thai food i&#39;ve had and they need to step it up on their customer service."
fig-and-olive-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fig-and-olive-chicago,1,"I would go again, but definitely try different entrees..i selected three items and asked him if he had any suggestions..and i especially liked how you can shop at sandro right after lunch.the one in los angeles has a pretty excellent food, so i thought i give it a try here.the cocktail was one of the highlights of my meal and while i was intrigued by the rest of their cocktails i couldn&#39;t help myself and had to order a second one.she also made excellent suggestions for food which is the real star here.i also tried some of the rosemary potatoes that came with the roasted chicken, and they, like my pasta, were relatively bland and unspectacular.the reason for the 3 stars was the food.5food 2this is a really nice looking place - we sat on the balcony on the 3rd floor which was stunning on a warm evening.superb! went here for my birthday dinner and was blown away! the martinis, olives, cheese plate and atmosphere was amazing and then came the main meal! i highly recommend the truffle risotto! i added shrimp to mine and it was amazing.but overrated, their food is so expensive, portions are so small and very spicy and not that tasteful.he went ahead and told us we could only pick from the &#34;cheap wine&#34; section, constantly brought up our groupon as we were ordering (we know, we came with a &#34;deal&#34; and know what it entails), and never came back to check up on us throughout our meal..he knew the menu inside and out and even asked about diet restrictions.a lot of people commented that it was odd but the bus boy was able to round a few waiters up after a few requests.they were all good.slightly pricier than $$ would indicate, but the food, service, atmosphere were all very enjoyable..i really enjoyed the food at fig &amp; olive.so, i literally jumped out of the car ran down the street.the restaurant transports you with its luxurious bar area.i&#39;m so glad i finally got around to it.just no! if most of your entrees are served with bread, why wouldn&#39;t you make sure at the very least your bread is fresh? i thought i was eating leftover bread!so i may be back for a mimosa (or 4), but will make sure to eat at so many places with delicious food that chicago has to offer..loved the vinaigrette and the figs were wonderful! highly recommend this dish if you want something lighter for lunch.i liked the menu and got a lot of stuff.will definitely try other franchises.seriously, i could curl up on that couch.&#34; after 15 minutes later, they arrived.we loved the crab salad for starters, then we had the linguini, the penne + chicken and the filet.will be back real soon!.mmmm, pretty good..i wish the food matched the ambiance and decor at this place.we also ordered the spinach, kale and brussell sprints.i tried a piece of my friend&#39;s branzino and i definitely taste the freshness of the fish.this our second visit to fig and olive.but i echo what some of the other reviewers have said and say dinner is nothing to write home about.management just shrugged their shoulders when we complained.had a little bit of everything from the lobster bisque (with lobster), various crostinis, seafood tower, &amp; rosemary lambchops (so so good).mario is a gentleman, top class bartender and navigator to guide you through a wonderful lunchtime jaunt.truffle mushroom croquettes taste bland, but the aioli sauce is good.the food, however, is what keeps me coming back.nestled in the gold coast neighborhood amidst high end clothing stores on east oak street, you walk into fig &amp; olive and take an elevator up to the second floor.will be going back for special occasions..if you&#39;re looking to have a more relaxed brunch i would suggest settling into one of the comfy chairs or sofas that look out into oak street.wow! it doesn&#39;t happen that often when i dine at a restaurant and say wow! from the ambiance to the food everything is top notch.since we don&#39;t get together often, we tried to make the most of it.let me start off by saying fig and olive is a gorgeous restaurant with tons of natural light, is spacious, and the décor is modern chic.i had such high expectations for this restaurant and it was so-so!  the food was bland, mediocre and the service was average.we ordered the chateaubriand, tableside for two..i visited during restaurant week and tried their set lunch menu - butternut squash and chestnut soup, chicken run with salad and a dessert crostini.it was beautiful sitting out on the terrace on a warm chicago day, i felt at peace eating there if that makes sense.clientele:  women who lunch, business people, or date night on the weekends.i opted for the shrimp, manchego and prosciutto and i&#39;m sure all the other options are equally as delectable.scallops.i would highly recommend fig and olive really can&#39;t say anything bad about it.service is fantastic and their olive oil tasting is delish! love the location and the ambiance is very booshy."
kizuki-ramen-and-izakaya-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kizuki-ramen-and-izakaya-chicago,1,"I almost finished the broth because it was that good.this location has only been open for less than a year and wasn&#39;t too busy for an early saturday evening.when we were finally seated, food came quickly enough to make up for the seating frustration.however, give us some slack by actually being honest people.it&#39;s large.will come back again, again and again!..but this in no way a negative since i take out the garlic when i go to those places.after doing a direct comparison, there&#39;s such a clear difference between the regular chashu pork and the pork belly.octopus dumpling was really tasty and i would order again.the bathrooms are clean (and the mouthwash is pretty awesome)!also a plus that jeni&#39;s ice cream is right across the street!will come here again!..i ate at this restaurant for the first time.beers: $5-7ish.i&#39;ve tried some of the appetizers: for some reason, both takoyaki and okonomiyaki are deep fried.cha siu was so damn good.place is great and would definitely come back if i&#39;m back in chicago but would not say the food is to die for.had the garlic tonkotsu ramen and the chicken karaage, and both were pretty good!ramen - flavorful and rich broth, really good noodles, perfect egg, and very, very enjoyable char-su! i had a bite of my brother&#39;s pork belly and it was wonderfully fatty.if you want to add spice, just ask for their chili sauce on the side.got the spicy ramen, and to be honest it wasn&#39;t very heavy on the spice.i hope it makes it by the time this review is posted.the octopus dumplings are a bit odd so i&#39;d probably stay away from those again.hopefully next time will be a better experience.would definitely recommend! &#39;til next time, cheers!.with that being said though, the ramen was excellent and i will be back, just won&#39;t get any add ons.we had some kind of cold spinach app, octopus karaage and tonkotsu ramen with extra pork belly.that&#39;s where kizuki comes in, it&#39;s now number 2 on my list.would definitely get it again.good start.i will definitely come back..they were out of the chicken karaage (during a sunday afternoon! probably one of their more high demand times), and didn&#39;t have it posted anywhere that they were out.the waiter was knowledgeable and guide me thru a great bowl.great customer service, seated us very quickly and next to some of their great aesthetic art..vegetarian ramen: 5/5this was my first time trying ramen and it exceeded my expectations..after an unsavory dining experience here, i will not be returning again.tsukemen! serving were quite plenty for one person.highly recommend!.whether that&#39;s true or not.i&#39;m going to say this is the best i&#39;ve had.instead, i opted for the &#34;clear&#34; soup, which made the ramen even blander!tempura don -- it&#39;s basically vegetable and shrimp tempura on rice.the bun was just ok.went for a late lunch and had heard great reviews.these are the reason this place did not get a 5-star review from me..order list:chicken skin (lightly sweet and lemony,  good with spicy oil)seaweed salad (ordinary)chicken karaage (amazing! perfectly seasoned and tender)takoyaki (too bready)spicy miso ramen (good)spicy ramen (very good)garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen (good)we got in 10 minutes before happy hour ended so we were able to get pretty good deal.i ordered the rich chicken ramen and added char shui but the meat was tough and chewy.other toppings can be added for an additional charge of $1.the batter reminded me of chinese fried chicken so i was a definite fan.(they also have a low sodium version too).the best luv this japanese restaurant! food is very flavorful and tasty.will be coming back for sure.it&#39;s cool that all of their ingredients come from japan.i also ordered a takoyaki as appetizer, done very well too.i&#39;ve been to my fair share of ramen places and this one didn&#39;t have a wow factor to me.move over, furious spoon! goodbye oiistar! came here with my partner for the soft opening and will definitely come back for more.this place was yummy!  def a spot you have to check out.both were phenomenal.i got the garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen with low sodium, and it was so good! the egg was on point - texture was perfect, soft but not runny.i&#39;ve  had my fair share of ramen and i was not disappointed by kizuki!my boyfriend and i went in on a friday night around 9pm, and the restaurant was definitely bustling.i had the miso ramen and my boyfriend the tonkatsu ramen.handled a group of 10 pretty well, with only one dish missing, and quickly rectified.honestly, an amazing ramen spot.ramen 4 stars, portion is good/ maybe small for some people.if you like a traditional pork broth ramen, this place will satisfy that need.their sake options are pretty good, and we tried four different ones (all delicious).bottom line: this place is def in the mix and challenger for the best ramen with a great broth with low sodium option, and i will be back again to see if i can update this review to 5 stars.location is right next to umami burger.."
el-habanero-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-habanero-chicago,1,"He was so friendly and proud of the restaurant, that alone makes me want to return over and over and over again.their horchatas are also delicious and decently sized..you won&#39;t be disappointed.this place is great! breakfast all day so for those of us late sleepers, you can still get your eggs at lunch! the chips came with green and red salsa and a lot of it! no skimping here! the horchata was not watered down like a lot of places.i absolutely love the garlicky salsa they serve with their chips.what a find.my only gripe with the place is that it is cash only, other than that it&#39;s perfect..my favorite dish is the pambazo de asada -- a crispy soft saucy creamy meaty chopped steak sandwich.now to the food.excellent food and the service was great.brilliant hidden gem..sandwich, not that great.the very friendly owner is in front of the house and ready to pamper you..the salsa is the best salsa i&#39;ve ever had.great small family restaurant.they had a similar sauce on the enchiladas rojas.the steak burrito was delicious..the tilapia taco is not fried like most places but was nicely grilled and still moist.the el pastor was enhanced with roasted pineapple and it upped my taste experience.showed it to her and she said it was fine but i still went to my car and gave her more.the food is phenomenal, lorena was an excellent host/server, and the music was elegant and complimentary to the dining experience..if you&#39;re ever in chi, stop by for good food &amp; reasonable prices.i am definitely coming back.i wanted to try the pambazo since it&#39;s their signature item, but since i was driving didn&#39;t know if this would work out.do yourself the favor of going here soon.also if you like hot stuff, make sure to ask for hot hot sauce.the best mexican food i&#39;ve had since moving to chicago and the midwest..lettuce was fresh and light, adding a nice crunch, and the crema helped tie all the textures in together.cash only.their pampazo is thebomb.some reviews say this is complementary but we werent even dining in! we were getting takeout.also, the service was fantastic.we both ordered horchata, which was the perfect mix of cinnamon and rich milk flavors.always going out of her way to talk to us!  do yourself a favor and try this place out as it will become your new go too!  great for vegetarians!.the horchata is fantastic and the house made salsa is a thick, rich paste that is almost like a ragu.the food is pretty good.the bread is unbelievably soft and perfect..loved the steak in the torta.i almost feel guilty by not telling them.small space and can feel crowded- could sit a large group in center and three other tables seat 4..it&#39;s worth it to come here just to try one of these - i haven&#39;t seen them in any other mexican restaurant in the city.overall the service was excellent and the food was very good...a few of us went and ordered a variety of food which we shared.fell in the trap again! another highly rated restaurant rated by illinois border state folks (gueritos) who no nothing about mexican cuisine.i&#39;m so excited to go back.what sets this place apart is the service.such a wonderful place, run by very sweet people.it was very very chewy.the delicious different one of a kind salsa and chips was on the table right away.i walked in one day hungry for chilaquelles and asked the girl if they were good.atmosphere-wise, it ain&#39;t much; it looks like someone decided to open a mexican restaurant in their living room with whatever they had on hand..great great great tasting mexican food.the chicken fajita was delicious! full of flavor! i defiantly would come back here.the nachos are huge! could feed 2 people.this place did not disappoint.the owner here is super friendly, and his wife and family are all really friendly and welcoming, i love coming here because i always feel so at home.everything was really underwhelming: the ranchero salsa was very plain and looked like mostly tomato sauce; the egg yolks were mostly cooked through; the rice and beans were pretty basic (with those bits of frozen veggies common in tex-mex rice); and the gordita, while better, was rather greasy and  definitely needed some seasoning.but in a good way! simply put, it is amazing.this is one of my favorite places in the neighborhood.nachos and cuban torta are the best!.yes lawd! clearly this will be my next bowl! i didn&#39;t even think to ask for all of these extras until writing this all out right now..i had pambozo with chicken for the first time and it was so tender and juicy.when you go to a family restaurant, you&#39;re not just another customer.family owned business so i highly support it.i really enjoy the veggie burrito and the horchata.the menu is simple and to the point.the green enchiladas, were the best i&#39;ve ever tasted! the green chili sauce is more like a mole verde sauce."

the food was super delicious and the service was great.i had high hopes for this place.the staff are friendly and never miss a beat, my coffee is refilled at least three times without me noticing and the food comes out as soon as it&#39;s ready.a great option for brunch or dinner - as long as you are able to amply be seated..breakfast and lunch options (available from 9am to 5pm) are lighter and more appealing to us!the morning bread is big enough to share and a quick bread reflecting seasonal flavors! it&#39;s particularly good with the bite cafe blend of dark matter coffee, which is only available in a full octane caffeinated version, which i love! the husband doesn&#39;t like bite&#39;s inability to prepare his eggs in a soft un-browned version.food was good but not worth the wait or the bad service..overall this place is affordable with great food.peep my photo.awesome place..i had the special, which was fried tofu in a curry base - yes, there were parts that were a little bland i admit, but nothing some salt couldn&#39;t spice up.the staff is very attentive, our glasses were always kept full.we also got some biscuits and jam to share, which were equally delicious.get the breakfast poutine if you&#39;re feeling like throwing caution to the wind, or enjoy a hangover salad if you&#39;re a reasonably responsible adult..i also just enjoy the vibe of this play.she loved that as well!it&#39;s a cute little spot on the inside.it&#39;s connected to a large game room and a bar.in addition to her sarcastic stares and pretentious responses to our questions about the menu, one of her major offenses was bringing us the check right away without asking if we would like anything else or wanted to see the dessert menu (i know they have one because she had just offered it to the table next to us).played some oldschool pinball and street fighter while waiting..3 times l&#39;ve been there with 3 different people,its getting hard to convince them to go there.i will definitely be back to try brunch soon!.high end foodie experience balanced perfectly with casual laid back atmosphere and reasonable prices.there&#39;s always good options on the rotating daily specials chalkboard but i am a huge fan as well of the tried-and-true regulars on the menu like the burger, salads, and tacos.people are likely to miss this tiny cafe which happens to be directly adjacent to one of the best bars in ukranian village, but don&#39;t let the size of the place fool you.i&#39;m pretty sure they get blazed and just come up with awesome ideas.delicious, filling food, no frills and a bloody mary that wasn&#39;t terrible.we tried the bi bim bap, the biscuits and spinach, the asparagus omelette and the strawberry bread.the poutine appetizers was delicious.the breakfast set was definitely good enough to have me return in the mornings, for sure.this place is insanely consistent.reminds me of europe.not sure what&#39;s changed- or what needs to change but this spot just bores me now.the entire menu looks amazing, but i went with the veggie burger and my husband the housemade pastrami..listened to a live episode of this american life on my flight home and when ira mentioned the empty bottle the crowd went wild.5.hipster neighborhood bar / brunch spot in ukrainian village - pretty cool, giant space with pool/arcade room, large back bar and cozy brunch room with counter bar.that won&#39;t stop me from going here again, because it&#39;s pretty convenient.the only downside is that this place does not serve alcohol.our waitress, a fabulous girl with blue tipped hair whose name i can&#39;t recall, was awesomely helpful in guiding us toward food we would love.we had a couple appetizers - the charcuterie plate and the poutine..i think this place has really hit its stride and very rarely disappoints.bite is such a great brunch spot! be sure to get here early on the weekends because this little place sure does get busy.would definitely come back to try other items..the ingredients are always fresh and nothing is ever stale.the problem we&#39;ve had here is that the experience goes down each time we go.friend had bacon gravy and biscuits and it looked good.i&#39;m a fan!!! was curious about this place based on the stellar reviews on yelp and it sure didn&#39;t disappoint.it needed either some salt or a kick to it to make it work.i had the salted fudge brownie again, and unlike last time, the salt was too heavy-handed.dark matter coffee is the house coffee..they never seem to disappoint me..ps, get the poutine.we&#39;ve lost so many wonderful byob spots in chicago and thank gawdduhh that bite is still around, firing on all burners.shared the broccoli risotto and the rainbow trout."
the-marq-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-marq-chicago-2,1,"They also have an outdoor seating area and large screen tvs indoors.both visits were outstanding.we will be back!!!.a small quibble-- if you want wi-fi, you could be disappointed.hubs and i ordered different craft beers and some fried pickles.while the food was good, i think it is overpriced for what it is.i ordered the shishito peppers &amp; soup of the day (it was carrot curry).just delicious.the egg was perfectly cooked.the food was (mostly) delicious.food: a+.my friends had tortellini and salmon and there was three people in the clean plate club at the end of dinner.we liked the honey ricotta appetizer, and the pumpkin risotto was amazing, not too heavy and very flavorful.we got there right before they closed, i felt bad but we really wanted to check this place out.had the marq burger with fries.&#34;  the menu choices and drinks were great; the service was also great even though the front and outside seating was packed with the business crowd.this burger is easily the best burger on the block, and even the loop in general, so juicy!the decor is real modern, i&#39;m a huge fan of the wood everywhere and front lobby chill spot (my guest was late).the atmosphere is relaxed with a subtle industrial theme.i tried his side of brussel sprouts and they were a little too over seasoned with salt.manager immediately came to the table apologizing and was extremely focused on making our experience better.nevertheless, the service was friendly and fast.not somthing i would normally order but the manager told me it was a new dish that was really taking off.must try the onion rings.the space is nice, very modern and warm..of course after reading the reviews i knew i had to order the marq burger along with the mac and cheese.great service, large menu selection and decent wine list.the salmon was broken into small pieces reminded me of cat food..we chose to sit at the bar and were able to drink and eat till we almost popped.the only reason it gets 4 stars is because it was a bit pricey for some burgers and fries.was good for what we needed (able to get table, quiet for talk) but a bit spendy.my good friend and i went to the marq because it was so close to the privatebank theater.can&#39;t wait to go back.so if you&#39;re 30-something and good-looking, come here after work to see and be seen; and if you&#39;re like me, not 30-something, you can still come here and have a nice time.this latest visit, i noticed the bone marrow was gone (thank goodness) but so were the cheese curds (which i liked).main dishes were the chicken and the salmon.nice and cheesy topped with panko bread crumbs for a little texture.staff was friendly, will definitely come back to take advantage of the patio area on a day that i am not busy at work!.food was tasty, service was tasty.the waiter was happy to assist us with a popular appetizer dish which he recommended the artichoke dip (which was great suggestion).short review: clean and trendy spot with a good vibe, at a nice price ($15/head)order: the marq burger with fries and a beer..old fashioned has bacon in it!! the burger was top notch and seasoned well!  i will return here again.....when we first got there, i was kind of skeptical but once we got the food.first time here and i will be back.if you&#39;ve been to any new american-style restaurant, you know what to expect from the marq.the salmon was over cooked.i wouldn&#39;t order that in my opinion.i had the salmon succotash and a glass of riesling..the flavors were really unique and kept my tongue on alert! it was really different but excellent! the steak was so tender and good on it too! my guy had the director entree- roasted chicken, grilled zucchini and polenta.clean interior..i went here with colleagues because i really wanted a burger and the reviews sounded so positive.it was pretty quiet for a friday night, but the service was great and so was the food.whipped ricotta app was amazing.i had a specialty cocktail that did not knock my socks off (ok, fine, i wasn&#39;t wearing socks, but you get the idea).we had a big group of girls and the staff was so friendly and accommodating.went here on my last day of the trimester at depaul as a gift to myself.but the seating outside is pretty nice.i always appreciate that....i&#39;m not all too sure about their menu, but they had a special menu for the st.overall awesome place and great prices.the marq appears to be bent on its own style.enjoyed lunch at this place last weekend."
uncle-mikes-place-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/uncle-mikes-place-chicago,2,"It is served with garlic fried rice and eggs how you want them, plus desert of champorado.my dad who is ill was craving filipino food and i came across this spot...came to chicago for a 4 day rendezvous and visited this place twice.the spam was so delicious! came with our 3 year old and 3 week old.it was such a pleasant surprise to discover that not only was it everything we needed but also a unique experience.it has a very homey feel.great staff and great atmosphere!!.the food was absolutely delicious.amazing grits and sweet service!i&#39;m not a big meat eater, but my dining companion is and loved it..this is my 3-4th time here and i&#39;ve always had a great experience.we wouldn&#39;t eat here again.- and to top it all off, the manager (john?) didn&#39;t seem to care at all about these issues when brought to his attention, just muttered a quiet apology as he took my money.it&#39;s so unique and all the food is amazing.plentiful street parking which of course is a major plus.both are good and you get a lot more bang for your buck.food selection is awesome! you get american breakfast and filipino breakfast.while we waited for our food we had a chance to observe the atmosphere and my boyfriend had expressed at how huge the plates are and totally agreed, people obviously come here to fill up on good food and we were just moments from experiencing it for ourselves! everyone in the restaurant looked happy, and those finishing up looked satisfied -- you know the look! ;)the moment our food was brought out i saw a sparkle in my boyfriend&#39;s eyes and his jaw immediately dropped at the sight of this huge plate that he was so ready to dig into.they have american dishes too for those not in the mood for lugaw alongside other traditional fare.consumer service is great here),.service is pretty good.great service.a bowl of lugao comes with each filipino breakfast, served while you wait..this is basically a easy chill breakfast diner that also has filipino breakfast dishes.decent size portion with decent pricing!would come back if i can make time to come this way before their closing time.and great service..you have to try uncle mike&#39;s.we all enjoyed our food..thanks uncle mike!..&#34;&#34;what?  who is he?  what does he do?&#34;uncle mike&#39;s place is at the corner of paulina and grand (accessible via #65 grand bus), in ukrainian village.strangely addicting..the food came out and he asked if we wanted any more free porridge which was great, coffee refills timely, and i tell you, the meal was so yummy, and uncle mike came and talked to us!!! he was super nice and gave me some soup to take home!!! love uncle mikes, i will be back!.this is a must try! if you&#39;re looking for something new for breakfast this is a great place.everyone was just bustin their asses on this busy day.that was different - but good different.the food itself was pretty good and definitely authentic but whether it was the large group or what, my bangus/tocino combo was lukewarm, something i wasn&#39;t too happy about.&#34;  i gave it a try.why can&#39;t all filipino places do this?? then we all ordered our silog breakfast.mike uses a simple yet effective marinade, consisting of soy sauce and 7-up and various other spices.filipino breakfast (aka tapsilog) is what they do best! you get free rice porridge (lugao) before your meals and it is ahhmazinggg! tastes like my grandma&#39;s cooking! for breakfast i ordered the longanisa plate which included garlic fried rice, tomato/onion salsa, egg prepared any way, and champorrado.love what we call arroz caldo, which comes before the meal.seating was no problem as it was adequate and a spacious restaurant! yet, having been familiar with filipino food, we came here hoping to indulge ourselves in the full-filipino breakfast experience; however, this is a distorted notion in one too many ways! first of all, from the moment you enter and get seated i swear from the waitress/waiter taking your order to the cook do not expect to see any hint of filipino.one more tip: food is waaaay better when you dine in.the best time to go is near closing time because they might give you free lugaw!.it&#39;s also served with this vinegar dipping sauce (perfect to dip the meat in!) and champorado (this delish chocolate rice porridge)..definitely recommend and will definitely come back.i&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard about the amazing filipino breakfast from here.but the two hispanic people that work there are very rude.i mainly come on sundays and i usually get seated right away.really good filipino breakfast! we went here twice in the short period visiting.i&#39;m a food wimp but my hubs loses his mind here.come hungry!place can be crowded weekends but worth the wait!  free lugaw while you wait for your food! you can also have champorado,longaniza, tocino and bangus! authentic filipino breakfast.a great find on a usually desolate block of w.the price, i felt for the amount of food i got it was fair, if not cheap.sounds interesting.the place is busy, with big families coming in looking for lots of seats.i&#39;ll be more than happy to pay 1 or 1.super friendly staff, we were given souvenir keychains too! super delicious food with super portions and decent prices! our food came with a small portion of yummy champorado for dessert (chocolate rice pudding).went here with a friend for the first time.the service is pretty good, food in general, for breakfast was alright.just add some salt and pepper and it&#39;s good..my tablemates tried more traditional filipino offerings and came away with a look that said &#34;average&#34;, but i want to try that side of the menu for myself before passing judgment.for those of you that can&#39;t decide they do offer side orders or you can go for a combo between some of the options as well.i just can&#39;t get enough of their garlic fried rice and their bangus!."
the-vig-chicago-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-vig-chicago-chicago-2,2,"St.really tasty late night food, music not too loud, and service quick and friendly.awesome new spot! went today for their first official brunch and it was delicious.we went for brunch/lunch.i really enjoyed the turkey burger my friend got.watching the music videos was a plus and they also showed a baseball game.fried chicken is my one big vice.overpriced drinks and mediocre food but service was great and the space is dope!i am always up for trying a new place and was stoked to try out the vig after all the glowing reviews.definitely worth the trip.we stumbled upon the vig while wondering around old town during our visit to chicago.very chill and welcoming environment.i hope they eventually give discounts on a side if you order a sandwich.the fans on the ceiling were huge! great place to relax and enjoy a drink!.honestly this turkey burger was on point-- usually when i order a turkey burger, it turns out a little dry and uninteresting.great service, great food, great location, great ambiance.i had a late dinner there last night at the bar and had a great experience.the restaurant has a super-cool and hip atmosphere and a pretty cool menu.i recommend sunday brunch - the music is so on point.i feel like lavender in cocktails is like really in right now?? yah?.you gotta go!.it didn&#39;t seem like a ton of food to me (he&#39;s a big/tall dude), but he said it was so filling and loved it.he told us that it was originally a joke to put it on the menu as most everything else is pretty high fat/carb, but it has quickly become quite a popular item!overall, we loved this place.overall, everything was just alright, though a better experience wouldn&#39;t be difficult for the vig chicago to provide..update to my previous review.if you love sports and movies, you will really appreciate the detail that went into the design!from the the mozzarella stuffed meatballs to the warm and cold spreads and an amazing selection of craft cocktails, we couldn&#39;t have gotten off to a better start.this place is great! the food was fantastic and the service friendly.the drink menu had a broad range of choices, and the drinks were most definitely not watered down.service was friendly and quick.the feel and ambiance was very lively.the sweetness of the corn, earthiness of the mushrooms and lightly dressed, tangy arugula worked very well together.overall a great experience and we will be back next time we are in town!.it&#39;s a pleasure eating there with such nice staff.overall it was a great place wish i could have truly enjoyed it more.no stars!! what is wrong with the owner (ryan marks) of this place? after placing our brunch orders, my 3 friends and i proceeded to relax and enjoy our sunday outing.i prefer rum, and they do not have any on the menu.i have to say, the rib-eye my fiance and i shared was phenomenal.i even made it tough for her by asking a lot of questions about the menu, but she handled it with great service and grace..our waitress was attentive, but actually didn&#39;t know the menu that well when we asked for suggestions.i got there around 9pm on a friday night and found a seat at the bar..overall it was a great trip though.its a nice casual mix of choices.yet, amazing.it sounds delicious and fruity but in reality it&#39;s really bitter and has no flavors as you can barely taste the peach.if you&#39;re here for brunch, the frozen boozy strawberry lemonade elevates the slurpee to an adult level.went for a late afternoon bite on sunday; the superfood salad with salmon is the perfect lunch dish! there is nice semi-shaded outdoor seating.the setup reminds me of stout, only bigger and definitely cleaner.the thing that was impressive to me here was the service.i want to come back and try the rest of the salads!..the service and food here is amazing.i almost regret writing this review because i don&#39;t want this place to become too crowded, but sometimes i make sacrifices for the greater good, that&#39;s just how gg rolls.don&#39;t worry about the wait for your food early sunday&#39;s because you&#39;ll have the worst dj in chicago playing you&#39;re favorite bottom of the chart&#39;s 10y old hits at full volume.great place!.ummm okay, that left us kind of bewildered.we tried one with bacon and bleu cheese, honey and fig, and a ricotta one as well.definitely my go-to place for drinks and dinner.the owner, ryan, had taken the time to reach out to me after my last review so we stopped on our way out to let him know just how much we enjoyed our evening.definitely stop in for a tasty, affordable brunch :-)..for the record i didn&#39;t eat of the food there last night, but the food coming out looked great and smelled even better.the service was exceptionally prompt.the vig was awesome.talk about like every food you have ever wanted to consume in one sitting and finding it on a menu (pizza fondue, chicken wings, stuffed pretzels, donut holes, sliders) i am simply satisfied and will keep you all up to speed after i eat.we ordered a side of brussel sprouts (their sides were only $5!) and a spread plate to munch on (just okay).food was mediocre and way over priced.i am adding an additional star for the vig due to the owner&#39;s immediate response expressing concern regarding my most recent experience at the restaurant..i&#39;d emailed with the manager earlier to let them know it was my parents anniversary so when we arrived, the staff greeted us with a happy anniversary.our only complaint was the sports selection on the tv..the boy felt like the brisket and the companying polenta didn&#39;t have much flavor but i actually didn&#39;t mind it.hey, i&#39;m not complaining.fun vibe."
blackwood-bbq-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blackwood-bbq-chicago-4,1,"Mac and cheese was great, cornbread was great, pulled pork was awesome!.i work down the street, and find myself drawn in once a week.super clean environment, simple, homemade foods and sauces, make for &#34;clean eating&#34; in the heart of chicago..it goes very fast! i got the pulled pork salad with beans, tomatoes, carrots and corn with the kansas city style sauce (had a nice kick to it)..definitely a meat eaters paradise.salted caramel root beer.i would recommend that if you go during lunch time, try to get there early or the line is super long.surprisingly good bbq in downtown chicago!i got the brisket platter with kansas city sauce, and a side of mac and cheese.due to my crazy diet, i can&#39;t have any sugars so i just had it as is, smoked, plain and it&#39;s amazing.reasonable side servings would greatly improve this place.the side dish was basic mac &amp; cheese but with breadcrumbs on top; dish was still pretty awesome.was craving some bbq over the lunch hour.at chipotle, i believe they do this in the back in a completely separate operation.south carolina mustard sauce..corn muffins and mac and cheese are both good and a deal for a buck extra.the reviewer who compared this to a bbq chipotle is spot on.everything is either a sandwich a platter or whatever.the salad is filling enough!..really went above and beyond - will definitely be going back..everything has a bbq feel to it, with wood tables and metal hardware, and it&#39;s a very relaxing atmoshphere.never heard of this place was in the area for a training walked by and went it..i would come back to try the brisket.yum!if all the food isn&#39;t enough reason to love it, i can get a platter (meat, sauce, side) for $8 in about 5 minutes max.creamy style coleslaw was also good.this is a great addition to the area.too bad it has limited hours, i crave this in the evening! i definitely take the trip downtown for this flavorful meal!.all i can say is.blackwood has a few locations and is set up like a chipotle, but for being a &#34;chain-like&#34; restaurant, they have a reasonably priced and tasty b-fast bowl with eggs, taters and your choice of meat.you won&#39;t regret it!.this is a &#34;bbq&#34;-version of chipotle/roti, but unlike these other establishments, blackwood&#39;s quantity is way-lacking, and the food&#39;s flavor profile is nothing special.delicious pepper and smoke flavor, tender meat and a good pairing with the kc sauce (spicy).i wish they had the sauces available for you to dispense as much as you wanted.pulled pork platter was my choice and couldn&#39;t decide on just 1 side so i ordered three.absolutely amazing.they were running out of brisket, but the pork was fantastic...99.highly recommend it.great overall service and experience.good array of sauces to accompany great meats.i normally don&#39;t like texas style beans, but these wee exceptional with chunks of meat.the price won&#39;t break the bank and the portion size was ideal.not sure what made me do that, but it was pretty good! the mac -n- cheese was really good.had the breakfast.my friend really enjoyed her pulled pork sandwich with the chicago sauce.i can&#39;t wait to go back and try all the sauces!.great bbq place.your sandwich will come with house made pickles (yum), all other sides are additional.the cornbread is good too just avoid getting the slaw as a side.the food is fantastic and the prices are cheap for downtown! my favorite lunch spot.salad are forget it.awesome bbq, i love this place.i don&#39;t like that they don&#39;t have extra sauce for you to dispense.it comes with a side of your choice and pickles, i decided to go with the three cheese macaroni.five stars for that! i still get my usual pulled pork with memphis sauce and the mac and cheese.excellent food.meats had good flavor to them, though i was disappointed on the portion of them.the staff was super helpful in selecting cuts of meat.it felt a little to me like they were measuring similar to that of weight watchers so i didn&#39;t go over my &#34;points&#34;.very disappointed..ill definitely be back.their description was spot on, it is just the right balance of sweet and heat.we will continue to order on a weekly basis."
naansense-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/naansense-chicago-5,2,"The fusion is awesome and they do have good drinks as well.the only (minor) annoying thing about the physical space is that the line forms right in front of the door, making entering/exiting awkward..huge portions too.quality middling.the good: great tasting food for what it is and what it&#39;s worth.it&#39;s not super spicy but definitely flavorful.the pricing is good for a quick lunch and it&#39;s at a good location for those of us that have to take the metra at times.each dish is handcrafted daily in our kitchen from scratch.everyone is raving about it.despite the odd combination, i enjoyed everything in my lunch.check it out if you&#39;re interested in easing into indian food slowly.the staff is as friendly as can be expected when you&#39;re speaking loudly over the glass wall to tell them the ingredients you would like.then this place might not be the best fit for you.grab extra extra napkins if you get one.brown rice chicken tikka sauce with the tangy sauce on top boom thats my order all day long.this place is horrible as i knew it already..the food is a new take on traditional indian food..i&#39;ll be back!.very tasty and spicy.everything tasted great.the concept is cool, but the execution leaves much to be desired.amazing! my experience is thus far limited to a chicken salad bowl with tomato sauce, all the toppings and the garlic cold sauce.verdict:this review is for the clinton location, specifically.yummy! the portions are huge (the employees are so generous with each topping, unlike places like freakin chipotle where i have to ask to put more protein or rice each time) and i&#39;m usually left with leftovers to eat later on in the day (they have lids that closes the bowl).i&#39;d try it again.the only minor complaint: playing rap music didn&#39;t seem to suit to the rest of the experience..it&#39;s not the best indian food that i have ever had, but it wouldn&#39;t be fair to compare chipotle to an authentic mexican joint."
girl-and-the-goat-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/girl-and-the-goat-chicago,1,"Despite the restaurant being packed and showing up roughly 30 minutes late, they checked my girlfriend&#39;s luggage at the front door at sat us immediately.so i tried this place again after several years, as i found myself in chicago this week, and this place is always on the &#34;must eat&#34; list for chicago.the lady told me that they were completely booked but i can still walk in and sit at the bar for dinner.here&#39;s my hit list:cauliflowerbeetspig face (trust me)goat shankduck tongue.with that being said, sorry shawn c.came here for a quick lunch with my dog.the menu was split between six different sections, which our waitress gladly explained upon being seated.it definitely hard a lot of flavors in layers, so i recommend trying it, but don&#39;t expect to be blown away...cauliflower:wow.highly recommend.the sauce was delicious and craftfully served.even when we came at 5 for dinner the bar seating was already full and the wait was an hour.overall, the food quality was excellent, plating beautiful, and surprisingly the meal cost less than i prepared for.there was also raspberry jelly, and i believe apple or pear slices cut pretty thin.the soft shell crab and duck tongues were very good, too, and all dishes were beautifully plated.amazing!-green beans- probably the best you&#39;ll ever have.i saw that they change the dessert menu a lot, so maybe this dessert won&#39;t always be, we tried the balls of pb ice cream with caramelizad salted popcorn.it is a great experience to enjoy a meal with happy food people..so yeah, it&#39;s as good as they say it is.dishes come in waves.such unique combinations that are deliciously paired together.make sure to order the duck tongue - this one dish brings together peruvian and asian flavors unlike anything i have ever eaten.pork shank - this was a peculiar dish.we ended up getting the chefs table near the kitchen which won me over! all the chefs were extermely nice and offered us tasting dishes.this was by far the best food i had in chicago, and the numerous reviews of this place only proves that this is definitely a place to try when in you&#39;re in this city.stopped by for a quick snack before dinner we enjoyed the wood fire oysters partially cooked it came out perfect not shriveled or dried out.girl and goat!  stephanie izard&#39;s joint is always busy.additionally we had the frites, green beans and a chicken entree.they have quite a few menu items that you can get half portions, which is great as a single diner.i think this was my favorite meal from my chicago trip! i had heard of the difficulty in scoring a reservation, and even making it 2-3 months in advance, i could only get a friday 5pm reservation for 3 people.&#34;..the meat is super tender.we put our name down at 7pm, and were told our table would be ready in 2 hours, so we left and came back at 9pm.always innovative and good.food was great.so it depends on what you are looking for and what dishes you order.they were attentive but not too intrusive..what we ate:- olive you bread (cute name!)fresh bread with olives baked inside! came with feta cheese dip and a olive oil dip.ordered a best of three cocktail as i waited and it was so, so good i definitely recommend this drink for those who like a less sweet drink..we were talking and did finish the meal more because it was there and not because the flavor rocked.also, i noticed this restaurants is tons of young professionals which makes it cool because everybody&#39;s age is very similar.if you&#39;re visiting for a short time and aren&#39;t able to get reservations during your stay, check out little goat, instead.after all that, there were 5 different types of desserts.finally and most importantly: the food.it is the highest rated, the best known, and the most recommended restaurant in chicago at the moment!! however, it&#39;s only 4 stars for me (and 2 for my husband)reasons? the food depends too much on salt to make the flavors, so by the end of the night, he felt bloated and i got a sore throat from excessive sodium consumption.i cannot come back soon enough.you gotta get this.been here 4 times now and is one of my favorite restaurants.the sun was out (side and i couldn&#39;t see it, but it was nice that it was out.when you combine it in ice cream it&#39;s pretty much guaranteed to be my pick.heard super positive things about this place from a friend back when my boyfriend and i were planning our chicago trip so we decided to include it in our itinerary! we were told that reservations fill up pretty quickly so we booked ours 2 weeks in advance for a thursday night at around 8.the squash was fried to a crisp yet soft on the inside while it melted in your mouth!+ johnny appleseed bread accompanied with apple sauce and cheese &amp; apple butter was a great starter to our entree.wow! walked in without a reservation, just two of us.my only regret is that i wasn&#39;t able to try more dishes after ordering grilled sepia, goat belly, and a salad.do yourself a favor and go!we also had dessert (all the leches cake, caramel corn and malt balls, berries and cream) and drinks (we all got a cocktail, but i can&#39;t remember which ones :) they were al great!)definitely try this place!.i booked a table for 2, two months in advance, and the only time slot left for my date was at 10pm (i checked 1-2 before/after, same situation)..to make this short and sweet since clearly this is a well known spot.the goat carpaccio was amazing , perfectly balanced flavors in every bite.it was a lot better than poke too.everything we ate was amazing!not to mention, the drinks and service were great, too.fish- octopus- the octopus was very tender and not chewy at all.they require to order everything a.&#34; i&#39;m so glad she did.we ordered a bunch of things to share and our bartender gave us a few recommendations which were exceptional!green beans - the caramel iced onion and cashews sauce was so flavorful, nice twist.we sampled a little bit of everything from the veggies, fish, meat and dessert categories.the cauliflower dish had a bunch of flavors between the parmesean cheese bites and the mint and peppercini bites.i wish i lived in chicago so i could visit all of stephanie izard&#39;s restaurants but the reality is, i live in austin, tx and i&#39;m just going to have to live on tacos and bbq until i can come back to visit.the toast they used perfectly soaked up all the sauces.we had to wait about 30 minutes before the couple before us cleared out.girl &amp; the goat is all about small plates, tapas if you will.to finish the entire portion you might want to order some coffee! overall yes.the empanadas and the bread were amazing though."
little-bucharest-bistro-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-bucharest-bistro-chicago,1,"On weekends they have a pig/lamb roast i&#39;m looking forward to trying.good, but not great, food.my girlfriend has rated this as her new fave restaurant in chicago!!!.lots of prepped bags of to-go orders were stacked up though- good sign of a popular place.they are dog friendly too in the outdoor patio.we will definitely be back!!!.definitely brought back fond memories and it is a must every time i return to chicago.drinks are amazing as well.branko! he is one of a kind.we were also serenaded by the violin player, who was charming and talented.loved it!  lovely neighborhood restaurant with a leafy outdoor area..they&#39;re not even open on tuesdays but they opened for us! the owner is soo accommodating &amp; entertaining-- lighting drinks on fire, lighting cheese on fire.he tells us there is a concert about to begin and may not have room for us...branko and his staff always make us feel right at home and the food is about as tasty and comforting as it gets.everything is awesome about this place.will make the trip over here again! ask for the holy water at the end of the meal..i love that this is open late, the service is great and food is delicious.no thanks.we had 70 invitees and not one had a complain..went here with a large group.had a great time!  the food was very good..during the planning stages, branko helped stef and i plan the menu--with a great and super fun tasting!, the logistics, and creative ideas to make it memorable for the whole party.we&#39;ll be back!.i was like a kid in a candy store, food so delicious i just wished for a bigger stomach to fit it all in, we had 2 leftover containers, i wasn&#39;t going to waste one drop of goodness.it was delicious! i&#39;m so happy i found little bucharest bistro.the owner really works the tables to make sure people are enjoying themselves.the food is always good and so are the drinks! bring some friends and you will have a great time.i just asked for pick up.a sincere thank you to branco for his hospitality.make sure you try the &#34;holy water.at the end of our meal he offered us some &#34;holy water,&#34; which turned out to be a pour of a strong clear spirit (some kind of vodka?) directly into our mouths.great food..great little place to come and eat tasty european food.i can&#39;t wait to go back and try the other dishes that sounded mouth-watering on the menu--aka everything!.we checked in on fb and received a dessert option; we chose a strawberry crepe and it was delicious.we will definitely be back to taste more of the menu and next time i am hoping to receive the famous &#34;blessing&#34; by the owner that i keep reading about!.:)..the place was not busy and yet the service was slow.there was another large party celebrating a baptism when we were there that borrowed the sound system to play folk music.but here&#39;s the kicker that puts little bucharest over the top: when we got our bill just around closing time, the owner asked what our plans for the evening were.started with a couple orders of the village salad and roasted red pepper.the ciorba de burta (beef tripe soup) was rich and buttery, the sarmala (stuffed cabbage but with sauerkraut leaves instead of fresh cabbage) was meaty and fillimg, and the mamaliga (polenta with feta cheese and sour cream) was as authentic as it gets without being in romania.my mom said her schnitzel with horseradish spaetzle was really good, and i genuinely thought my parents were going to brawl over the last of my dad&#39;s cabbage rolls.along my multiple orders and deliveries, i have never been dissapointed by the little bucharest bistro.holds up pretty well for delivery.food is amazing! i have ordered almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed.definitely need to try this romania home feeling restaurant.cheers to the flaming cheese and mystery liquor.great service, delicious food!! 100% recommend place.i&#39;m not romanian but i can tell -  i loved salomon on braised leek and vagrant volcano goulash.the owner always makes us feel welcomed and part of the little bucharest family! next time, we have to go when they are playing music.the service was amazing and the food was even better.we had a cousins reunion there this past week and it was truly a great experience from start to finish.staff is so kind and warm.they start you off with homemade breadwe ordered the &#34;mititei&#34; charbroiled sausages, then shared a &#34;ciorba de borscht&#34; beet soup, all of these were so flavorful and perfectly cooked.also, the palinka makes a perfect drink after the big meal.really good sausage (mititei)! my niece lived in romania and said they have pretty authentic sarmale and mamaliga.the food was good--the owners were nasty, rude and unpleasant to us and to their own staff.i&#39;ve been coming here since i was a little girl for 15 years.branko, the owner, was very welcoming and chatty, but it seems he does a little bit of micromanaging when it comes to the servers.the place was great.i started of with the saganaki: quite well done (it will give the greeks a run for their money).this first experience is definitely all the more reason i shall have to return again very, very soon to see what other menu items they have to convert me into a regular customer.we had both cabbage and feta moldovan pies, eggplant appetizer and polenta (momoliga) and beef goulash as a main.my girlfriend and i shared the short rib goulash and the sausage-stuffed chicken thighs-- both were excellent and really more food than we needed.i had an great time with my family.music made for a nice ambiance.the atmosphere is family and friendly.definitely coming back!.we never skip the desert, the crepes are fantastic, and the perfect end to a great meal."

daleys-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/daleys-restaurant-chicago,1,"Cons:* while good, the fried chicken was a bit bland -- the batter could do with being a bit more seasoned;* the string beans were extremely overcooked; and* service was a little slower and more inattentive than i would like.the people are kind and professional yet personable.thats not good business.i have had probably the entire menu(i used to work across the street-okay)!  i have to say though, i&#39;d do some real traveling for their patty melts-yes they are that good!i remember they had  a take-out daley&#39;s along 63rd  that  made a mean taco salad!  here i am, 10 years later, still trying to lose that weight!.our server was great.i came here with my boyfriend and we both got the chicken and waffles..my breakfast destination whenever i&#39;m in chicago.on this particular visit i had the corned beef and cabbage complete dinner that comes with 2 sides, soup or  salad and a dessert.will come back soon if i&#39;m ever around in the area again!.my grandparents owned a laundrymat at 62nd and kimbark..my over-easy eggs were perfection.if you want cheap, hearty breakfast in hyde park/woodlawn, this is the place to go.the food was also bland...both chicken and waffles were crispy and brown..old school.great soul food! tons of food for your money..just more money to go in the servers pocket because they sure do deserve it.highly recommended for breakfast.i&#39;m going back today for dinner and will write a more substantial later.collared greens and salad was mediocre.i&#39;ve found the service top-notch too, although i hit it up on off hours.my order has been messed up at least four times at ms.oh, the salmon patties! i could eat here every day.my favorite is theburger it&#39;s always cooked the way i like it.so.my dad and i were the only two white boys in the restaurant but that is how i knew it was going to be good.the only reason this place doesn&#39;t receive 5 stars is because of the cleanliness of the establishment..the french toast and all of the breakfast items are delicious.make it past the &#34;street vendors&#34; outside, selling everything from socks to &#39;loose squares&#39;, and you&#39;ll find a neighborhood place that&#39;s been serving up breakfast goodness for more than a century.ordered a salad today delicious julienne ham and turkey the restaurant is cozy and homey with seems like regulars that come in all the time for a great home cooked meal and i mean the meals i seen at tables were home cook smelled  delicious looked delicious but the customer service those waitress and order taker gave was completely horrible attitude and horrible ones almost didnt wanna order just mean and rushing people they need to change their staff there cause they are horrible loud and rude.i asked for a hot chocolate and the waitress took off right away to go get the hot chocolate with out giving a chance to the other person what they wanted to drink.well definitely be back and next time make sure to leave room for dessert!.my friend got an omelet with hash browns and biscuits and i got pancakes.&#34;home-made&#34; peach cobbler was a bright orange soup with canned peaches and some strips of soggy white dough floating in it....and more of the cornbread muffins!! i can&#39;t wait to get back!!.customer service lacks in a lot of black businesses i&#39;m sad to say but this place doesn&#39;t disappoint in any area ! i will not be going back to any other  soul food place but this one.strawberry topped waffle almost strawberry pie..the restaurant has a cool diner feel.the waffles were crispy, golden melt-in-your-moth and the fried chicken wings were oh, so good with the hot sauce.so i gave the cashier a additional $3.the food was good but wasn&#39;t warm enough.even though my order was placed at 9:45 am.just remember if you see an open table you like go sit down they will be with you in a jiffy and if you are caucasian you are neither rare nor special no matter what other posts may suggest.yummy yummy food.well, luckily, i found this little gem on yelp while looking for something tasty for brunch.i love south chicago man.it was a fantastic dinner and the service was great.the best place for chicken and waffles..i gave her the additional 2."

 really?i.that being said, holy crap this place is amazing!! simple and delicious just like a hotdog should be.do yourself a favor and visit this joint, if you are a hot dog enthusiast this is a must.i got the &#34;suicide&#34; soda, just a mix of everything.this is a small trailer set among shady used car dealers..but man, it&#39;s far.someone said they closed, that&#39;s wrong!.haven&#39;t been there in years, yes the neighborhood is sketchy now but don&#39;t let that stop you, western avenue is super busy and there are usually lines there too.so anyway, it&#39;s up there w/ all the other good hotdog joints and definitely a place you should try atleast once.this place is the best..unbeatable prices..it was time for my first chicago dog.it&#39;s worth your time and effort to venture in the southside (and really the neighborhood isn&#39;t all that bad if you go in the daylight hours).the location is a little sketch but don&#39;t let that turn you off.and i would highly recommend going all out for the mighty dog if you go.yummy, yumm, yum.that being said, if you&#39;re driving by at noon,  the dogs here are great.pretty hard to mess up a hot dog.one thing i will say is that if you park on western, be careful the traffic because the lanes are getting re-painted or something so there&#39;s very little room between the driving lane and the parking lane.some more pretentious people may say the place looks like it should be condemned, well damm them and give it a try.i&#39;ve been hearing about fat johnnie&#39;s for quite some time.literally this place is like a shack and there&#39;s a picnic table about 50 feet away i always end up sitting there and eating..probably the biggest surprise i&#39;ve had in the hot dog world..it is worth driving past several other hot dog places to go there.i could hear a heated argument inside as i walked up.25/person, minimum 40 people, for two hours.it adds character.cub fans would shriek in fear here so you meet nice people.fat johnnie&#39;s is the best hot dog in the city.the glowing lights, and the arrow pointing to on of the best hot dogs in america (as just voted on by food and drink).5* red hot with everything3* dog with chili &amp; cheese3..many moons ago i lived in the 7200 block of s.simply the best hot dog you&#39;ll ever have."

they have good mexican food.i had the bbq breakfast brisket with lime cilantro peanut sauce.even though the place appears to be small, it packs a good amount of seats.there&#39;s one small communal table, and that&#39;s it; the rest is bar seating and seating along the walls.dove&#39;s dishes are $12-16 and i realize i&#39;m biased as i didn&#39;t completely enjoy myself, but it seems slightly overpriced.however my daily dinner menu item of squash and pepper quesadilla was forgettable and tasted more like a panini.both dishes needed a little extra salsa and aioli which the waitress grabbed for us no problem.wow! i just love how cozy and convenient this restaurant is! just diagonally across from damen blue line..started out with their pimento cheese sampler for only $5..the waiter apologized and comped our desserts, which was great.think warm, tender pork with rice, golden raisins, roasted potatoes, and - though i don&#39;t care for them - olives.we arrived just a bit after 9 so we snagged a seat immediately but there was a bit of a wait by the time we left around 10ish.it&#39;s a very nice addition to the wicker park dining scene, but treat yourself to some more appealing options first--revolution brewing, for example..we got the burnt ends hash and the burger special, both were amazing.delicious enchiladas, tuna ceviche, and tamale, and a great stop on an early saturday evening, but nothing i would withstand a half-hour wait for.the vinaigrette was lemony and summery.it&#39;s almost too perfect as it pays homeage to a bygone era without feeling old or in need of change.definitely recommend this neighborhood gem.i wonder if it&#39;s because she&#39;s seen my progress, the leanness around my clavicle, but i don&#39;t say anything.i had the stuffed peppers and had to eat them slow because they were so good i didnt meant my meal to end.it went perfectly with the peas and onions.my favorite place for brunch in chicago.and all of that aside, the food was great and well priced.it wasn&#39;t what i expected.obviously that wasn&#39;t part of the concept.their cocktails are also really delicious, considering that a lot of places have fruity cocktails that just end up tasting like cough syrup, i&#39;m all about getting a pitcher of cantarito.we had the taco entree with kimchi and added brisket, the chicken fried chicken with gravy and peas and the sopapillas with fresh fruit.this week was my second visit to dove&#39;s.the chicken was perfectly moist inside, with a tasty crust, and the gravy, peas and pearl onions all were wonderful..no spiel.all of it.no exaggeration.their menu changes now and then and i tend to choose smaller, lighter dishes and my other half usually gets the opposite..the vanilla honey ice cream hit the spot after my brisket taco.the kitch and attention to detail of making this truly feel like an old diner.for example, i loved my beet salad and blood sausage..i&#39;d love to come back and try more items.in my opinion, the brisket was not tender enough.i never went thirsty.it goes from very mexican to contemporary dishes.being tended too sonically and culinarily by the expert taste of dj/ hospitality-virtuoso courtland green is the real clincher here though.fantastic music.might have been one of the best breakfast plates i&#39;ve ever eaten.it was the perfect combination of savory and spicy flavors.the food is so beyond basic here, they really know how to pack a flavor punch.def will come back.i&#39;ve had a good variety of food and drinks here, and they&#39;ve all been great.unfortunately it came out very rare in the center so i notified the server, celia, and before i even had a chance to say it wasn&#39;t medium she noticed it, apologized, took it away, and i had a new (fully cooked) burger in front of me within minutes.we both had their warm and memorable hot chocolate and shared the hush puppies for starters..i would recommend sharing with another person.bring your antacid with you because everything on this menu is highly fattening and greasy spoon done mexican style.everything about it was perfect, including a dash of some vinegar sauce they had on the counter..the beauty of the place is in it&#39;s intimacy, designer diner-elegance and high quality food and drinks.i&#39;m curious to try their other libations! the meat in the tacos was not very apparent as it was mixed with the eggs, but the flavors were delicious! the tacos were very well filled and i enjoyed the tortillas.wow.my oyster omelette was a real crowd favorite.the deco is very unique, like a diner with an exotic feelthe drinks/cocktails are awesome, try the mezcalthe food is awesome too! we especially liked the potato and pepper hash and the chicken fried chicken.seriously the best thing ever.our waitress was really friendly and helpful and attentive, and i liked the look of the inside - a little retro 70&#39;s with some tex mex feelings - as illustrated by the record player.we all looked in complete disbelief that this actually happened."
duseks-board-and-beer-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/duseks-board-and-beer-chicago-2,1,"My favorite dish of the night among 3 other fantastic dishes because it was so different from anything i&#39;ve tried before!beer battered soft shell crab- our waitress told us this dish is seasonal and only for a month long.dusek&#39;s had just opened up and i had heard it was awesome.i&#39;ve been looking forward to going to this place for awhile.the service and atmosphere are great but the food is just - meh.the size of the crab dip is also big enough to share between 2-3 people as an appetizer, but i honestly could eat the whole thing by myself as a meal in the future and be a really happy camper.dustin is the real deal holyfield.it&#39;s a huge place, which makes sense inside thalia hallswe got the donut and i don&#39;t even like cake donut but the donut here was too good to be true.low key such a gem in pilsen! in addition to the adorable decor, they have a fantastic selection of beer and unique dishes to try..the oysters were superlative, especially the beau soleil.serviceawkward staff with a knack for oversight on details.i had a great time at dusek&#39;s on a random weekday night.yes, that&#39;s how good it was: planning our return before we even left.the decor is absolutely beautiful.the collared greens with bacon were deliocus though really complimented the chicken.on the plus side, punch house is in the basement and i love the chalkboard bathrooms!.although i did like the foie gras, the oysters and duck confit dish were not very good.they have bar stools placed around, so guests are allowed to sit and request songs right at the piano.i couldn&#39;t believe it..the juicy lucy was a bit disappointed.we got there about 1:45 (4 people) and were told that they could not accommodate us because they closed at 3.we both tried the english breakfast cocktail and the gin and tonic..great service, they go the extra mile to make you happy!definitely recommend it!.she was knowledgeable, friendly, and she even hooked us up with extra crostini for our pork rillette!  hey, the little things count.but i ate every bit of the toppings..they were able to seat us despite missing our reservation.the actual restaurant is beautiful, but i won&#39;t be going back here again.kudos to the staff as well the building itself.really disappointed.dusek&#39;s really does know desserts!.it&#39;s nice to have good, fresh seafood in chicago!- the beer selection is wonderful..they did great so it was finger licking good.&#34;i didn&#39;t realize we had that kind of relationship but i responded, &#34;well i assumed that but what are you going to do beforehand?&#34;so that&#39;s why i like this place.overall would highly recommend people to come and dine here! or if you just want to grab a nice cold beer, they have an attractive bar set up as well.a little personality would have gone a long way, but i&#39;m sure he was just trying to keep it all together.definitely lived up to the hype.overall, the food was good, but i think my expectations were too high for what we got.what a cool place this is.no matter, he&#39;d (the server!) have it...i loved the pairing of a little miller high life with my eggs and potatoes! so good! oh another good thing i noticed was they have hot sauce in a little cutezie glass dispenser on every table.that, and that they let my commitment-fearing self sample a few before ordering.first time we went to dusek&#39;s couple of years ago for brunch and it was fine.i&#39;ve had a number of great brunches in chicago during weekend visits.serverlovely!  very attentive!  very knowledgable about drink n food menu.but guess what?! my card is still charged for the incorrect amount.in addition when we paid i received 2 free drink tickets when i returned.dined here because we had tickets to thalia hall.the dishes are inspired from different regions in the world.no reservation despite having called several times that day for one and left a message.j had the duck charcuterie board and said the best part was the duck sausage.served with lemon wedges, dill-vinegar, house hot sauce, and oyster crackersthe oysters themselves were improperly shucked and i had to use the baby fork to release the oyster from the shell..i was thinking this might be a good substitute to fill that hole, but it didn&#39;t get all the way there.we were going to order 1 or 2 more small plates after this, but decided to just call it a night after feeling underwhelmed.our server diana was awesome."
the-office-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-office-chicago,1,"Loved the look, too.they ask what flavours tickle your fancy and they conduct the following to make a drink just for you, to make your taste buds go wild.its all very impressive stuff.i came with a larger group to celebrate my birthday and it was perfect.i was so intrigued by the exclusivity of it, and got really lucky when i found a number online to text for a reservation.service was great.we were given seats on a nearby leather couch and our host came by shortly after to discuss our drink preferences with us.do not leave without checking out all the different spirits, tinctures, bitters, liqueurs, aperitifs, and vermouths kept behind the bar.they offer up an extensive selection of whiskeys along with some classic cocktails.the drinks are so good its easy to blow way past your point of self-control.really i&#39;m just playing wanna-be sommelier.this is the ultimate drinking cave.after a series of questions on my likes and dislikes, shortly after i held the perfect drink in my hand based on my answers.i&#39;ve had the pleasure of going to the office four or five times now and i have never once been disappointed.the usher had to use his key to let us inside the office (which could also be called the basement), its usually a locked door so no one can just walk in.every employee i met there was extremely professional including jeremiah (great name, btw) who we chatted with for a bit.overall, a really cool experience but i think i ultimately prefer aviary.how does one finish a trip to chicago after eating at alinea and drinking at the aviary?  why, visit the best speakeasy bar in the us of course!relaxed at the office, which is a chill cozy place with a full bar area and sofa/chair seating area, from 11-2:??time really does fly by when one partakes in the following:osetra caviar with creme fraiche and crispy yummy potato chipshodgepodge - huge smorgasbord of numerous tasty spreads and a big basket of delish bread2 bottles of champagne :)  (i know they&#39;re known for mixed drinks, but i wanted to leave chi-town with a bang.annoying but i&#39;ll roll with it.the lighting is dark, accented by candlelight and there are no windows.the staff was extremely kind and hospitable, total 5 star experience! our server rocked and brought us some very unique, had crafted drinks.in my humblest opinion, best bar in the windy city...i&#39;m not entirely sure it&#39;s all that worth it.gluttony.great service, quaint location.the food menu also includes some delicious small bites, and the breads are worth every calorie, so order as many as you can afford.the more you tell them, the better the drink.it was truly an art to watch.if you can get in, savor every small thing about it: the decor, the bartender´s skills, the appetizers and, of course, the feeling of exclusivity that comes with a visit to the office..that drink i had upstairs must have been stronger than i thought.hands down the best cocktails i have ever had.and the drinks were sublime.at the end of the meal, we were given a beautifully hand written menu of everything we ate, which was such a nice touch.and i&#39;m also a sucker for a cocktail that&#39;s made with painstaking attention given to each ingredient as it is lovingly added and mixed, shaken, or stirred.admittedly, our night at the office came smack in the middle of a month-long victory lap of chicago culinary favorites, so i&#39;m inevitably stacking it against other favorite haunts.thanks for the magical privilege!.ug.i am very picky about my french toast and this is as good as my very favorite french toast in the world (a french cafe in chicago).we opted for off the menu fun- just gave him our flavor profiles for each respective person and he nailed it.intimate setting for a small group so you should definately check it out.we sat at the bar ( highly recommend) and had the pleasure of learning a bit from julia the best bartender alive! i am usually a vodka drinker but julia had me drinking and loving whiskey drinks all night.from the description i gave down to adding their own touches on the view i have.the milk curdles, but they strain the curdles away, and you&#39;re left with a very thick, syrupy liquor -- thicker and sweeter than a moscato, and whatever herbs they infuse it with make it taste like you&#39;re also smoking a cigar..oh well.the tartness grows on you.&#34;too many people spend money they haven&#39;t earned, to buy things they don&#39;t want, to impress people they don&#39;t like.i really am crafting a plan to somehow make that basement my permanent residence, without the staff knowing.insane.with its unique, prohibition style, you will definitely want to go here--the price doesn&#39;t even matter at this point.every drink is beautifully crafted with syrup, oil, and essence all made in-house.superb.then a very nicely dressed good looking man comes and takes you downstairs to where the bathrooms are, whips out a key, and opens this door that takes you inside to the office.i&#39;m pretty sure the bartenders here are clairvoyant..this is an amazing place to relax with friends and it&#39;s definitely worth the price! it&#39;s like an elegant basement in someone&#39;s house complete with the bartenders of your dreams.the food and drinks aren&#39;t presented with the flourish chef grant achatz is known for, but with the quality and flavors you receive, you don&#39;t mind the simple delivery.the ingredients were all fresh.it&#39;s a little intimidating if you don&#39;t have a lot of knowledge about the different components of a drink - but the bartenders are so amazing, they would never make you feel foolish, but will ask you a lot of questions to understand what you enjoy and what you are in the mood for as well.but if you are lucky enough to catch an invite here, cancel all your plans and.i had three cocktails (and was really feeling each of them--especially the third cocktail--the next day).as always, the check is written in immaculate calligraphy and sealed with red wax.this was our second time here.but the tartare was amazing, as with the chanterelles.what a chill spot to relax for a couple of drinks.they actually only let a round 15 to people in at a time, so noise levels are perfect and wait staff is able to spend time getting your drink right..this may be my new favorite place for a cocktail.with that said, this is the place to be if you want the best drinks in the city and a very exclusive atmosphere.food is a bit secondardy, though still plenty of care is taken on it.simply put, if you get a chance to go, go.by the time we left around 8:30 - 9:00pm, the place was packed and the bartenders were in full swing.it is not a place you go to on a weekly basis, however, it is a place you wish you could.thank you to a close friend who recommend this place for us.i waited until my second visit to write this review just to gauge consistency.the drinks are phenomenal and the service is top notch..dined at next and was able to go to the office for drinks following dinner.whereas the aviary is a flashy show of molecular mixology, which is cool in its own right."
taqueria-tayahua-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-tayahua-chicago,2,"Best huaraches, best sopes, best everything! this is definitely a great spot if you&#39;re in the area.this is always my spot for tacos, especially late at night..i&#39;ve been coming to this restaurant since the first day they opened since it&#39;s right around the corner from my house.i literally ate here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner the same day and consumed about 18 tacos total (they&#39;re not very big) and 5 micheladas.go eat here! they have authentic style dishes that you won&#39;t find at your usual mexican restaurant...best taco spot this side of pilsen! their tacos &#34;al carbon&#39; are a must try, full of flavor! the huaraches are the best!! also the papas a la plancha are a perfect side dish!! real authentic mexican food! never a disappointment.all of them are prepared estilo distrito federal.i had expected some vegetables in there, but it was tasty nonetheless.go eat here.not the best place but it is awesome that there&#39;s always a seat open.the tortas there are delicious the bread they use does it for me..the chicken was wonderfully seasoned, a hearty portion (i ended up sharing it with someone i came with), and a fair price ($8-9ish bucks)..taqueria&#39;s are my jam.depends - if the old man is cooking food is delish !!!but it&#39;s overpriced !! can&#39;t believe the burritos are $6 , most places are 4.i&#39;ll be back!.i&#39;ve been back 3 times since!!  the food is outstanding and the staff is great.2...there&#39;s lots of parking on the street.the taco al pastor is perfect."

pokiology-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pokiology-chicago,2,"This place definitely adapted the concept from the west/east coast and finally found its place to the midwest.i&#39;ve been there far too many times already for it only having been open a month or two.add the traditional carbs that are typically served with them ( rice, quinoa, legumes), and garnish it with sauces &amp; herbs.overhyped and overpriced..just a bit over $20 for 2 people.parking - accessible meter parking on the street, there are also 15 minute parking zones if you&#39;re ordering to go.delicious!!i have never had poke but this establishment has gain a new fan.the only reason why i give them a 3 star is because after i ate their spicy tuna with half half (rice/salad) i got sick.i really wanted to give this place 5 stars.sauces: spicy mayo, garlic aioli, wasabi cream, or a sweet chili sauce.i might get the sauce topping on the side next time - i&#39;m a block away so i&#39;m sure i will be a regular pick up and go customer!..super fresh fish, lots of topping/sauce options and very reasonable prices (honestly i wouldn&#39;t want to be paying less for raw fish.the toppings were all very delicious and i recommend everyone getting all the sides.i feel poke bowls work very well with a few sweet components, and the only thing pokiology had that added that sweet note was pickled ginger, even the sauces are all savory.did 3 scoop half &amp; half (rice &amp; salad) with yellow tail, salmon, spicy tuna with sesame oil and creamy wasabi.will come back! spicy tuna was great!.very interesting concept to make sushi in a bowl really your own! my fav protein is tuna and octopus.my poke bowl was delicious!  i&#39;m glad we have a place like this in uptown.there&#39;s room for improvement, though..great poke for a reasonable price.same problem i have with most poke places in chicago.what else does anyone need for lunch? 5 stars!.i was very excited that poke finally came to the north side chicago and the price is way better than aloha poke and the portion is just enough!i would definitely come back!.since even if you eat it there, they use the same type of bowl for every person, that is going to add up to a lot of waste, so hope they reconsider.it was nice being able to pick from a variety of different types of fish and ingredients and mixing them into one bowl.everything was fresh and i was pleased that my &#39;custom&#39; bowl was perfect for what i was looking for.this place is better than the other more well known poke restaurant in chicago.everything was fresh, with a variety of options for many tastes and dietary needs."

you can definitely ask for bigger facility, and that the place takes plastic.i was feeling adventurous and added it to my order.it&#39;s a fried burrito.i got the chimichanga con todo with lengua.steak burrito with everything is slightly tastier than dona natys &amp; el taco veloz but $2.it was pretty crowded, but the line moves fast.don&#39;t worry boys, i&#39;ll get you back next week!.i could write a book on my love for al pastor tacos, but i&#39;d leave this place unmentioned.as for food, i know they have a pretty wide variety on the menu but i&#39;ve only ordered the tacos (al pastor, flank steak, and ground beef), my favorite by far is the al pastor!remember this place is cash only!! if you forget there&#39;s a bank of america across the street.i can&#39;t decide which is better.we met up here because i told her &#34;i&#39;m feeling tacos and margaritas&#34; so she suggested this place..so if your in the area, stop by and give this place a try, granted any more then 12 people in there and not sure if you can even get in the building.i&#39;m allergic to cilantro.some of the other tacos i&#39;ve had have been mediocre.i had a chorizo taco and pastor taco, and my wife the pozole.the urge to broverdose into visceral grunts of happiness, and game winning high fives was overwhelming.i think at least a 1/2 star is based on proximity to my home.in particular, the burritos are big and flavorful..prices were high for these small ass tacos, people that say these are the best need to get out more an taste some real shit....super flavorful great speedy service and undeniable mexican quality..2 words: barbacoa tacos!my friends had the al pastor tacos and were also very good.incredible steak tacos.there&#39;s a ton of taco places near hear along ashland and chicago, but this tiny place has the best tacos i&#39;ve had in the area...stopped in for two steak tacos, which come standard with onion &amp; cilantro (i also added avocado).they do have a dine in option for a few guest..i&#39;ve checked out a decent portion of the menus at the various mexican joints in the area.this is my go-to taco place.my go to is the lomo - ribeye steak and grilled onions.while i almost always got the pastor here, both the chicken and steak are good quality and i&#39;m partial to the costillas en res con papas (sp?) you&#39;ll see a picture of it on the menu, love the grilled jalapeño.cash only and it was just south of $10.i had the taco dinner, brother had the enchiladas, wife had tacos as well.the fajitas and street tacos are also very good.i take them for granted.i&#39;ve also had the carne asada tacos and cecina tacos, those are equally tasty.i was completely disappointed and $60 not well spent.i eat here at least twice a week and almost always seem to get the steak tacos.wow!!!! the tacos are simple with just the meat, onions and cilantro.on the weekends they have goat soup which (perhaps surprisingly to many americans) is delicious and full of tender meat.and bottled coke to top it off! the guys were very patient as we decided on our lunch as they have an expansive menu.below are my reviews on each:barbacoa taco - not impressed.the meat, while textured seemingly perfectly, lacked any type of flavor.lengua, cabeza, tripe, flank steak are the best tacos.service is good.check it out if you&#39;re in the area.so juicy and have a great off the grill and straight from mexico taste.prosauthentic tacosgreat al pastor; has an extra smoky taste to it.best al pastor i&#39;ve come across in the city..they of course had a vegetarian option for my friend which is pretty easy to get with mexican food.this little spot doesn&#39;t look like much (and the surroundings will turn many tourists away), but the food and service can&#39;t be beat...well, since i&#39;m old and these 2am rendezvous don&#39;t happen as much as they should in your mid 20&#39;s, i dragged my hubby out on a thursday night around 8pm just for a casual dinner.i haven&#39;t had a meal i wouldn&#39;t recommend but here are a few of my favorites:tacos - it seems like they have dozens of choices but make mine birria or chorizo or steak or pork.hereso delicious, i remember my friend said how she crave for burrito whenever she recalls taqueria traspasada&#39;s delicious burrto..awesome place, a true authentic mexican joint in the chi-town area.everything we tried here is just amazing, a lot of exotic stuff, tripes, pig brain, etcwe come here every week, it is such a hidden gem, my favourite so far is the tilapia tacomust try their home made horchata, it has a rich rice taste to it, unless some other places which fill it with sugar.toetas ahogadas are spicy but not the best since the bread must be special.and they hook up all the fixings.most underrated part of this restaurant--the sauces.really i can&#39;t decide which tacos are better, i&#39;m stuck between carne asada, barbacoa, or the green pork skin tacos? whatever, you decide you can not go wrong with place.this place has some of the best burritos in chicago.overall it&#39;s about as good as i&#39;ve found in the midwest after experiencing some of the best by the border.love this restaurant!  highly recommend.each order comes with a generous serving of tomatillo salsa, which i absolutely loved--chilled yet wonderfully spicy, the salsa topped off what was already a very solid taco."

prices were also reasonable (especially for us coming from boston).worth checking out.highly recommend this place.i&#39;ve been a couple times and the only dish worth mentioning, surprisingly, is the tuna tartare.even though it was decently crowded, service was very attentive.if you want to grab a table on patio, please note your whole party has to be present.both i would highly recommend..omg the beignets.craving these bad boys now and totally worth every penny..for my favorite meal of the day, brunch.4 stars for the fries that went with the turkey burger..i don&#39;t know the name of the little pink pickles they put on top of each taco, but they were just perfect companies to the duck meat - truly a creative and delicious dish!we also ordered each dessert on the menu to share - all delicious! so it&#39;s truly a risk-free desserts menu.we then ordered the seared tuna po boy and it was disappointing.maybe that is the ingredient, since the glass was rimmed with something like old bay also..i had the fish &amp; chips, with tots instead of fries.understandable given the temps, but not head over heels for it.would recommend this place if you&#39;re in the area and want an easy spot with nice ambiance to plop down after a long day of work of touristy-stuff.just note, the portion size is on the small size.not pretentious.washed it down with hibiscus ale, so so good! the views and the eats at this place are what make me give it an easy 5 stars.again, they are closed for until the 21st of january.loved the saffron sauce, thought about ordering a side of rice to sop it up as the baguette was not enough.if you are going to go on a weekend, make sure to get there early to avoid a long wait.3.highly recommend! a gorgeous presentation of three delectable cheeses with fruits, flatbread toasts and honey.service is good and wait staff is attentive to their guests.sometimes, the classic are the way to go.everyone from the hostess to the servers were super nice.i choose the chicken rolls at the urging of our server but they were fried and overall just did not settle well.while they do have indoor seating as well, i&#39;d only ever come here to sit at their outdoor bar, or at one of their many high tops along the river - they also have some lounge set ups with couches outside if that&#39;s your thing.we started with two orders of the bacon popcorn, which were delicious and large.my husband and i had the spicy chicken avacado rolls and the roasted chicken.and they definitely keep the mimosas coming!.this place has an amazing deck right along the river that makes you feel like you&#39;re eating at an exclusive yacht club.my server interacted with me only when she brought me the menu and asked if i wanted the check.the drinks are solid, the seating is comfy, and you just can&#39;t beat perching on the edge of the river with skyscrapers looming overhead!the service can be a bit slow, and an occasional city rat will dash down the wall that separates the patio from the river (hello, urban nature!), but the overall experience is so amazing that i still give this place five stars.dearborn and n.pros: beautiful patio by the river, ok pricing for the view and amount of food given, nice waitstaff but slow on the water bottle refillcons: sometimes the river smells like sewage, some brunch items were mediocre - like the beignets (although the housemade whipped cream and cinnamon glaze were on point), and the wicked tots were rather salty.we had about 16 people in our group so we rented both cabanas on their patio.i&#39;m doing you a favor.we ate here for breakfast.bloody marys and mimosas weren&#39;t very strong.jawdropping atmosphere and scenery, impeccable service, and delicious food.m.the wicked tots are stellar!.great place to go on a nice day to enjoy beautiful views and watch boats go by! the menu was pretty extensive and has great seafood options.after the walk down the stairs, we were given a buzzer and went to the bar to get a drink..i&#39;ve been here on weekday afternoons at the outdoor area.i ordered the blue mule which was delicious and the scallops with grilled leeks and artichokes.staff at check in could definitely stand to lose the attitude, perhaps smile once in a while so that guests feel welcomed and not afraid to come in..the food and the service was fantastic.menu sounded pretty good for brunch but everything at the table was average or below.food was aright.i had the chicken salad sandwich on a pretzel role and it was fantastic.what a glorious experience! we were in a bit of a rush because we had to catch a river boat tour *lucky us!* the service was so quick.their servers were just as bad as the owner, and acted completely unaffected by an upset customer.it was pretty brisk outside and they had the windows open so we were seated next to a nice fireplace.just a fabulous place.most disappointing part was the bloody mary &#34;toppings&#34;.loved bridgehouse tavern!! it&#39;s located right on the river and the patio itself is beautiful.they were spot on.my arugula salad was healthy and very flavorful, i am glad i added the tuna as protein to complete my meal.ordered spicy chicken advocano rolls, east coast oyster and tuna tartar.*onion rings - while i&#39;m not a fan of onion rings, my colleagues all said they liked them.it would have been a jerk thing to do since there were people waiting (i mean, there&#39;s a whole riverwalk across the river, with plenty of open seating, right?), but it&#39;s nice to not be rushed by the staff even though they would have the right to do so.staple for brunch.instead of people watching you boat watch!.delicious brunch!

pazzos-311-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pazzos-311-chicago,2,"I never knew this place was there - i&#39;ve worked across the street for a few years.i took one bite of the sandwich and couldn&#39;t bite through - the steak was too tough.i tried the chicago style hot dog and is was bad, and they didnt seem to understand what chicago style means.the food was good, most of the table either got penne alla vodka or the special, risotto with chicken.fay herself really puts her heart into the wedding and was there all night to make sure things went smoothly.i absolutely love the tilapia that is served over buttery mashed potatoes and a bed of spinach.while some things, the pesto tortellini, are better than others overall i&#39;m glad i had a large lunch before coming to the event.for dinner we went with the risotto, caesar salad, steak &amp; chicken dinner, with mashed potatoes and vegetables.a little pricey for a lunch place but i do think the quality of the food is worth it.however, the service was not as attentive, the atmosphere was not as nice, and the presentation of the food was not as nice either.would not come here on my own dime.i wish the food and service had been as good as the ambiance.for private events.work in the loop, and this is a close restaurant that has good, quick service, and the food is definitely above average.this is a good place for a good meal.we sat in the atrium as it felt like the streets of rome, with a water sculpture there...what a big relief that what could have been awkward became, because of fay&#39;s calm demeanor and accommodating attitude, a happy development.great menu.she was there to help us organize in every step of the way.whoops.my love for this restaurant took a slow, but definite decline over the first year i was working in the city.resentful employees.the experience will be unforgettable!.it also was nice to have a bar at a reception offer sam adams as one of their beer choices.this was definitely worth it as we have heard people say they felt like they were getting pushed out at other events because they walked away from their tables and came back to no table.are we even remotely shocked that most of the food provided in meetings comes from here?i&#39;ve never actually bought food from pazzo&#39;s directly.we paid for an extra speaker which should have been okay, but there was a problem with the dj so nobody could hear the speeches.drink refills were lightning fast.i had my wedding here on may 22,2015 and i couldnt be more pleased with the amazing service, beautiful venue and fantastic food.a great place to have a party or group gathering.my friends and family loved the open bar! the food&#39;s really good! the bacon and scallops are divine! so is the prime rib! my only regret is i didn&#39;t get to enjoy my wedding food as much as my guests.service was fair, but not stellar.pazzo&#39;s serves a contemporary italian menu that&#39;s a bit upscale.the only issue we had at all is that we had a lot of echoing but that was more our dj than anything else (for future brides and grooms, make sure to reiterate that to your dj, since it is a big space).you book the venue and you get a great wedding planner for free! fay and her team take care of everything!  she gives great suggestions about food choices and her calming manner makes the planning go so smoothly.which is a shame because my photographer took some amazing shots of the venue that they could use when pitching it to future brides.i called up pazzo&#39;s and spoke with carmen who was super helpful.the calamari here is fantastic.she was so flexible and helped us get exactly what we wanted while helping us through some of things she had more experience in.also, the fish didn&#39;t taste very fresh, as i have eaten many a tuna, and i know fresh from, i don&#39;t know, thawed frozen tuna.unfortunately, the salmon was not a fresh filet, but rather some sort of preserved salmon.the staff was very friendly and helpful during the confusion.we got so many compliments on the food and beautiful atrium.was not impressed with the calamari as it was a bit bland..if you come for lunch you have to try the caesar salad, it is wonderful.great atmosphere, great food! stopped in while downtown for the day and was very pleased we found this place.even though i have lived in chicago for 15+ years, i had not heard of it.if you don&#39;t want my business, happy to give it to those who do and who don&#39;t offend their guests.service is usually mediocre though due to the lunch rush.this is in response to kristen&#39;s review.if you read through reviews on pazzo&#39;s almost every review says how unbelievable fay and the pazzo&#39;s team executed their wedding plans.we were impressed from start to finish....we had the filet and chicken.it is worth the short walk and quality and value is worth the effort.what the hell?our waiter was really difficult to understand and visibly nervous..she made sure everything was just perfect the day of, and made the whole planning process so much easier.the venue itself is such a great bargain, as it is one of the only venues in chicago where you do not have to pay a huge venue fee, as long as your meet their very reasonable f&amp;b minimum..we met with their wedding planner and found her abrasive and inflexible to even our most basic requests.all in all, if you are looking for a modern wedding that is not in your typical hotel, then check out pazzo&#39;s."

the-monkeys-paw-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-monkeys-paw-chicago,1,"Beautiful patio, really enjoyed it out there on their quiet little side street, and our waitress was wonderful.in the summer they have outside seating so we brought our dog with us for brunch.i don&#39;t give 5 stars that often..overall a great evening though!!.needless to say, this chap had immediately earned the nickname &#34;poutine,&#34; until one day he made the mistake of ordering a half pint of guinness, after which he answered to &#34;half pint.after being seated and ordering a drink, the waiter then told us that they were out of most of the items on the menu.i sincerely believe that living near monkeys paw should increase our property&#39;s value (because it significantly increases the quality of our low key nights near the crib :).she was super friendly and showed us to a table and double checked the location was okay with us.service took forever to come around.we wanted to try the special flatbread with pulled pork and bbq sauce.my biggest complaint is their braised pork belly which did not taste smokey.good food &amp; i like the wed 1/2 price bottles of wine.considered an entree.monkeys paw has got it down.ha!nice, laid back atmosphere and a good beer list.there was a fish stew ($14) which was tasty, but still a tad expensive for the location.the beets themselves was honestly too salty for me, and i like salt.food was great! very enjoyable!the prices are a bit much..the interior is warm and inviting, seems like it would also be a great place to grab a drink in the winter..that&#39;s the easiest way to say it and it&#39;s just my style.we sat outside, which was nice-- inside looked really cool too..my boyfriend ordered the burger and added the fried egg.alas, i couldn&#39;t help myself and am writing a review.i&#39;m just a weirdo when it comes to ketchup.everyone raves about the biscuits so i had the biscuits and gravy and loved it (they add pimento cheese -- yum).both reasons to return!.highly recommended.very knowledgable and friendly bartenders.i did enjoy the nice yet casual environment.service has been on point both times i went and perhaps because i went to brunch later in the day there was no wait for either outdoor or indoor seating.nice spot in the neighborhood.this place was really cute.whoa i&#39;m a jerk for being a regular here and leaving my previous 4-star review up.also, look out when they offer their scotch tasting, very informative and fun!.i thought there was too much cheese and onions on my sandwich, so much so i couldn&#39;t even taste the chicken.great place.excited to try their brunch, too! will definitely be back!.they also have a decent craft beer selection.we will definitely be back!.food was excellent.the drink selection was impressive and the food was delicious! we ordered the charcuterie to share among 3 of us and i ordered &#34;the lighter side&#34; beer flight and it was a great way to sample a few different beers.the bartender was great - even recommending a few cocktails for us to try.live in the area and this is a great neighborhood place!they typically change their menu out on a seasonal basis, but i&#39;ve had brunch and dinner here and everything has been delicious!the atmosphere is great, especially in the winter.the food is good- atmosphere is neat.try the bloody mary..it featured a beautiful venue, delicious food and wonderful friends.great food! wonderful atmosphere! do not miss this place!everything we are was good.an added note: i&#39;ve never been one to add ketchup to a breakfast meal, but the sweet yet smokey house ketchup at this place was unreal.wine, beer and whiskey menu is great and the staff is very knowledgeable.we had the sandwich of the day which was meatloaf.we had some friends who booked a wristband package ($30 for 3 hours) for their birthdays this past weekend.over cooked burger - medium rare came out well done, the bartender never checked to see how the food was which leads me to the horrible service we received.best tasting ketchup ever! love the outdoor seating..they were all so unique and definitely hit the spot!  we also tried some of their cocktails which were so refreshing on a warm july night..boo ya!take a date here and sit by the fireplace, enjoy one of their signature drinks and share some delicious food.incredible brunch!!! mimosas were best i&#39;ve had and coffee was great too.as for the cuisine, &#34;fresh, seasonal, farm-to-table&#34; sums it up perfectly..i love this place - the food is wonderful, the bartenders are knowledgeable, the staff is very friendly.i ended up ordering the lighter side flight that i believe had an ommengang, and a beer from revolution brewery.my other order was the pickled beet salad without the cheese.they also have an unexpected food menu and great beer list.it was weird because it was open but the kitchen wasn&#39;t so we went in and had to wait to even place an order.came here with some friends on a whim to get a bite to eat.will be back for sure!..the décor and ambiance are great.being such a fan of pork belly i went against my canadian instinct to order poutine and opted for the pig.cocktails and wine choices are always good.waitress was a little grumpy but that was quickly forgotten after a few bites and sips.seems weird to bring a free birthday dessert with nuts since that is a common allergy.something low key and cozy but cool, with a good cocktail and wine selection for me and decent beer for him, small plates with some seafood involved and reasonably priced.no reservations? no problem."
brgrbelly-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brgrbelly-chicago-3,1,"Best burger i&#39;ve ever had in my life and i&#39;m a 36 y...i would definitely come again and recommend it to friends.a super delicious chill place with awesome rock music and we saw the who live in concert on the tv when we visited this joint for the first time.i loved the flavor profiles each burger had to offer..awesome place to enjoy nice music great burgers and fries.food prepared correctly.i remember i had ordered the old time religion, with yummy arugula, goat cheese, tomato and some kind of garlic aioli.the fries are solid but once you get half-way through their cup it&#39;s served in the fries get so small i can&#39;t dip them in my ketchup any more.they were playing music videos from 90s to 70s genre.although the cashier was friendly, i will not be returning.great burgers they make their own burger buns which makes a huge difference the meet is fresh and a frys out of this world.for now, though, i am definitely a fan!!.no complaints here.amazing burgers!! i&#39;ve been to kumas and a few other good burger joints and i have to say, brgrbelly is very good competition.my siblings and i all tried different burgers--the black betty (smoked bacon, bleu cheese, homemade fried onion straws, buffalo bleu sauce), the old time religion (roasted tomato, goat cheese, arugula, truffle aioli), and the gallows pole (caramelized mushrooms and onions, smashed taters, swiss cheese, béarnaise sauce).if it&#39;s winter don&#39;t sit by the door because it gets so cold when people open it.come enjoy this small space.you have to snake your way through to your table and probably still bump into other people.today was my second time visiting this joint, let me tell you i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever been so fully satisfied from a burger in my life.you must order first before you sit down.the prices were not too shabby with the amount they give you, very reasonable.maybe it was a lead burger, it certainly looked and tasted heavy and dry, completely devoid of any flavor!  bun was okay, but not as good as i was expecting, even though it was homemade.milk shakes are awesome.even their shakes are tasty (and i&#39;m not a shake person)!on my most recent visit i had the &#39;house of the rising sun&#39; and although a few years ago i thought an egg on a burger was unheard of, now i feel like it&#39;s a must.great quality i hope it will never change..meh, i was unimpressed.each order of fries is served in a cutesy deep fryer container.and i will bring my peeps with me!and.quality, most burger entrees are within $11-$12.a nice little addition was a butter cookie topped with pecans with both white and dark chocolate drizzled over.its not very often that i can&#39;t find something to complain about in a food place.talk with yelp if you don&#39;t want to do the deal anymore as a business.&#34;my girlfriend got the old time religion - roasted tomato, goat cheese, arugula and truffle aioli.&#34;meat should be cooked to the proper temperature and also kept at a high enough temperature to be safe.love the taste of their meat! :) and the garlic parm fries are too legit to quit.they do have a small patio, and i did like that i saw people of all ages and all races enjoying this place.bravo overall - keep doing what you do!.which was yummy by the way.overall great experience.poly made our experience here worth the trip for us and our guests from austria.one of my favorite stops -- love the fire variety and the boozy shakes.for starters i had the house of the rising sun that comes with a fried egg naturally..come here if you want a delicious burger and perfect fries.this place was great! i had the old time religion and i might have heard some angels sing.we will be back and not take so long this time.a plus+ on the hot sauce selections.the fries are okay and i don&#39;t really care for the sugar cookie but it comes with the meal, so whatever, i&#39;ll eat it.yes.can&#39;t wait to bring our friends &amp; family here!!.homemade buns topped with white and black sesame seeds was a nice touch and definitely held up to all the sauce slop!amazing grace burger with carolina bbq sauce, fried onions and pork belly was our favorite, the sauce was sweet and delicious.i&#39;m not usually a girl that goes to a restaurant and orders a &#34;burger&#34;, but when i do i expect that burger to be delicious.saw the pix.maybe on a &#34;off&#34; time will try again but found sunday at 2pm peak time and slow.but between all the problems with the wait, service, and value ($15 almost for burger and fries).this place has amazing, big, juicy burgers.the burger is the best i&#39;ve ever had! the bun and fries makes all the difference in the world.this place is amazing! burgers aren&#39;t my favorite but at brbr belly they are seriously amazing.i need to branch out and try more of the burgers, but can&#39;t seem to pass up the old time religion.i loved the atmosphere everything was just delicious.the bun was homemade with onion baked in.found that nice!."

oasis-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/oasis-cafe-chicago,2,"Although there&#39;s usually a line it moves very quick and am out the door in under 5 minutes.honestly, everything is good.just look for jewelry mart and keep walking in.you can&#39;t beat this place, nor the experience of traversing through the jewerly exchange to get delicious high quality food, quickly made at a cheap price with courteous people.walking in here, even having read the reviews, i was still struck by the experience of walking into a jewelry store and ending up in a cafe.great food meat a little dry but it is still good a cool little hole in the wall.this is a perfect casual lunch spot.a hidden gem with some of the best middle eastern food in the loop..if we had a bigger appetite, we would have ordered lentil soup.one star off bc it&#39;s really a lunch place for people who work in the city, and never seems to be open when i am downtown on weekends or evenings.my favorite is the chicken shawarma.the pros were the freshness, portion size, friendly and fast service and the flavor for everything was pretty good.reasonable prices and good portion sizes..chicken shwarma seasoned and moist.i lost interest in my sandwich half-way through.bad day? shawarma &amp; arabian coffee fixes that! anyway, check this place out if you haven&#39;t, &amp; buy something for someone on the way out!..i had the shish kebab sandwich and it was wonderfully juicy and flavorful.obvious &#34;gem&#34; or &#34;diamond in the rough&#34; pun here, but aside from that, this little known café puts places like falafel island and sultan&#39;s market to shame..the food is tasty (especially the falafels) but the portions are a little smaller than other mediterranean places (read: filling for one meal, not 1.they also offer a daily special to keep things interesting and my friend has praised their lentil soup.cheap, fast, and good!get the mixed combo chicken and you&#39;ll be full for the rest of the day (maybe even have lunch for the next day)....in fact, if the folding sign isn&#39;t up on the sidewalk, i&#39;m not sure how you&#39;ll find this place.traveling past the jeweler to find a counter service lunch spot is an adventure every time.cheap, quick, fresh and tasty food.tahini should be included with each order of this, it wasn&#39;t.5 stars are rare for me but they earned it.a little unusual that its in the back of a jewerly store.quantity is good.however, it is great food with great prices.a cafeteria sort of setting in the back of a jeweler, the menu is highlighted by daily specials.there&#39;s also additional seating upstairs, so you can get a table throughout lunch which is really nice during the lunch hour rush in the loop.affordable comfort mediterranean food.my favorite pita is across the street at naf-naf, mostly because it&#39;s pillowy and still warm from the oven.this place blew me away both price-wise and taste-wise.waste of time.that was only surprising because i just didn&#39;t realize so many people were aware of this place.always a go-to..bumping this back up to a 4 because you can eat a delicious chicken tabouleh salad and buy a necklace for your mistress in one trip.i like oasis.all things on it too.they had great falafel, babaganouj, lamb, rice, hummus, and pita.i&#39;ve eaten a lot of mediterranean food in my life and this just wasn&#39;t that good.i&#39;ve tried pretty much all the other options in the area (naf naf and rotti), and i find oasis to be the best of the bunch in taste and value.it&#39;s really w 4/5 place because location is hidden but i&#39;ll go ahead n give them 5/5 to help their ratings and business.we ordered a monday&#39;s special.food-wise, i liked my falafel sandwich and the hummus side was also good.best baba ganouj in the loop! seriously i&#39;m in love, it&#39;s perfect with its tender morsels of smoky eggplant chunks interspersed between creaminess.sometimes they&#39;ll even give you free samples of that while you&#39;re walking down the street, so that&#39;s so much the better.the meal as a whole is very filling and an enjoyable eat.the guy taking orders at the register was unfriendly and the falafel sandwich i got today was cold, missing sauce, and the cucumbers were bitter.i ordered the chicken shawarma plate, and it came with yellow rice, hummus, pita bread, slices of tomatoes and cucumber, and chicken shawarma.returning here for lunch, i realized i hadn&#39;t been here since my last gig in the loop in 2001..oasis café is a hole in the jewelry shop.we had the falafel sandwich, which is fresh and large.you have to try there daily specials each day except saturday.i enjoy grabbing a bite ,especially the chicken shwarma or combo platter whenever i am in the neighborhood.the meat was very good but the rice was very bland and their spicy sauce has no flavor at all.if you&#39;re looking for cheap, heavy, flavorful mediterranean food that will be assembled and ready for you before you even have time to sign off on the receipt, oasis is the place for you.he puked it all up like 6 hours later.but what do i know i&#39;m asian haha.the ambiance is a little quirky, but perfect for locals who lunch...couscous should be light and airy.i had the friday couscous special with lamb and it was super good! good for small groups of about four or five each..i got the chicken shawarma and the lentil soup."
arbor-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/arbor-chicago,1,"Suffice it to say that each dish was interesting and delightful, and the meal was as thought-provoking as it was delicious.i was slightly upset because breakfast ends at 11am..i have yet to order something i didn&#39;t love.for dinner, call ahead and make a reservation for the midwest omakase.luckily, the coconut milk, key ume, 7 spice latte saved the day; it was outstanding.highly recommended!.this place is wonderful.highly recommend!.they have free refills on coffee.the quality of food balanced with great prices makes arbor it go to spot for an awesome midday meal.great service, you can tell the staff really wants you to enjoy your experience.going to be a new regular lunch place for us!.wow, i came here yesterday for the first time after my friends came here to do a tasting for wedding catering (see jessica&#39;s review below).somehow, they manage to exceed expectations on all those levels.these two are visionaries; the flavors &amp; stories i experienced tonight really expanded my vision for what food could be.this was incredibly bright (and palate cleansing, as intended) and totally delicious.the creativity and spirituality that they bring to feeding the public is magical!.the place is spacious with adequate seating with a touch of modern kitchen/dining room atmosphere.you come and based on your conversation with the restaurant all your meals are just brought out to you, so come with an open mind and you will not be disappointed.its legit worth every penny and more.ill be back!.super good! highly recommend!!.the espresso/beans, milk/foam.i had the baked grits and egg - lots of roasted veggies in there added a great flavor - and the spring green smoothie.it was a nice gesture especially given the long wait for the drinks.this place rocks! food is great and the interior design is top notch.i almost don&#39;t wanna review it.they have their own urban garden behind the building, and we went on a tour beforehand and tasted everything off the vine.this process not only saves hundreds of dollars, but makes a huge difference in the freshness and quality of the food..just know you&#39;ll be taken care of and that everything you taste here has had much thought, love and care go into it&#39;s making.so, you should bring a friend and split some stuff.sincerely,the not-so-green gal.it was a slow afternoon and i spent it chatting with chad about the restaurant over a tasty new fashioned cocktail and a killer dirty gin martini.i can&#39;t wait to come in for lunch!.this place is one of a kind.definitely a next time place.awesome concept, most delicious breakfast sandwich, fresh juice (made with whatever ingredients they had on hand that day), great environment, delightful music jams.the ones that are will charge you much more.it&#39;s clear that they are going for something that isn&#39;t your average restaurant, it&#39;s much more.john our server went above and beyond to provide us with a unique and fun experience; he let us try super cool wines even outside of our pairings, fully explained each one to us, answered several questions, and was extremely attentive.their website states &#34;our midwestern omakase is unlike any dining experience you have had.even his suggestion of hosting the party across from their restaurant at the ipaintmymind art gallery was awesome!  i would highly suggest arbor for your next event!!.we were both perplexed about our food prep though.had the $30 tasting menu, and it may have been the best meal of my life.the food is sourced from local offerings, and you can taste the freshness.my husband and i ordered the tacos which were a tuesday lunch special and they were pretty good and the space is wonderfully light and airy, but i&#39;m giving three stars for the service or lack thereof..great food and great people, definitely recommend.we had the breakfast special of sun dried tomatoes, kale, egg whites, ham on toast which was excellent.i got the biscuit sandwich which while very tasty, i found to be a bit too biscuit heavy.crazy good! the service is sooo nice and the food is even better.i haven&#39;t quite seen an awesome corn chowder like the one that the kitchen put together, where corn fritters, pickled sweet corn and popcorn grits worked wonders for wonderful complexity of flavor and texture.....i&#39;ll be back later this week..we love everything we have here.the restaurant serves up both organic meat and vegan friendly options with breakfast, mid day and dinner menus..both were delicious.we had breakfast here on a weekday.the midwestern omakase is a tasting menu where the chefs collaborate with you the diner to customize the experience rather than dictate a set menu.the space is uniquely situated inside the green exchange, a leed platinum certified office and retail space in logan square..we did the 7 course with wine pairings.i think we didn&#39;t do the pairings justice because we&#39;ve lowered our tolerance for booze at this point in our lives and they comped us a champagne starter since it was an anniversary date."
pl-zen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pl-zen-chicago,2,"The parmesan fries and wings are great!!!!  the roast chicken large plate is delicious.all of it was a subpar failure.in my opinion, the bun was buttered a little too much and they were a little stingy with the queso fresco.2) secondary server up-sold me on the side to my tuesday night special burger without telling me that there would be an up-charge..i call them mi familia.we were going to order an app as well but the options were very limited and not a huge variety so we stuck with just the drinks.fire!  fries are crispy and very well seasoned.and it was not, hopefully this year they open after the race.our server checked up on us whenever we were out of drinks.they were quite filling...this place has a trendy, sorta tex-mex vibe to it.my personal favorite it the kobe burger.solid burger.love the neighborhood.everything is on point and the service is absolutely top notch.the bar tenders are awesome and friendly.i got the sesame crusted tilapia tacos and o m g they were yum!!  other friends ordered burgers, truffle fries, mac and cheese, chicken dinner.we sat down around 1:30 which seemed like they could have switched to a lunch menu by then.so we decided to go..a definite must for dining in pilsen and chicago in general.their service is great! and their menu is creative and thoughtful.the food features a unique twist on gastropub staples.prices are above average but worthwhile for most dishes..i rarely ask for refills, but just couldn&#39;t resist.i&#39;ll definitely be back to pl-zen when i&#39;m in the area (which, sadly, isn&#39;t frequently.service is always above and beyond, adriana wins the best server award! warm and inviting atmosphere with pleasant decor, we have some moderately shabby restaurants in pilsen so this is a breath of fresh air.the guac special was one the best guacamole dishes i&#39;ve ever had- it had watermelon cubes on top, which sounds weird, but somehow made it bombi had the salmon burger for dinner and my bf had shrimp tacos- both were worth trying..we did go for brunch and i had a breakfast burger with a duck egg that was delicious.our dining experience could not have been better! we enjoyed delicious food, outstanding service, the ambiance was casual yet unique, and the value was not unreasonable..we try to support local businesses and found  pl zen online and liked the menu.great food options that are all tasty.for starters we had fresh guacamole, mussels, and bone marrow.the truffle parmesan fries were great - very crispy, if not particularly truffle-y and they came with a great spicy ketchup.the bbb (burger, beer, and bourbon) deal is awesome.great for getting brunch with large a group of friends.and it still comes with fries! also got the chips and guac which gave you a really big amount of guac, maybe the most i&#39;ve ever seen.another gentleman waiter came over to take our order...the service was excellent, i only had the brussel sprouts (that were awesome!) and the sweet potato fries (also very good).once you bite into this burger, you&#39;ll notice an explosion of different flavors and textures tickling your tongue.i like how this place doesn&#39;t get crowded.the brussels sprouts side was our only disappointment, but a mild one.apparently the owner is a former cook from the famous north side burger joint kuma&#39;s corner.it was an early night, so we proceeded down the ramp to pl-zen!this place had the coziest feel and we were greeted with smiles.but tonight, my mind was blown!xavier, who was our server, made this experience at pl-zen today insanely great..the service, drinks, and food are all incredible..the tomato sauce paired with the mussels gives a very unpleasant aromatic smell and taste.beer selection is great.the eggs benedict were delicious.the shrimp tacos were amazingly flavorful, perfectly crispy shrimp and a delectable chipotle sauce..beer selection was solid.brussel sprouts: a perfect cook.the first time i tried the short rib tostadas, which were mindblowingly excellent, and also had a cocktail, which was very good as well..every single time, the owner eventually comes over to us and also personally greets us and most often stays and chats..there is a lot of interesting artwork in the place--- very pilsen-like.yo if everything on the menu cost three dollars less than this place would be blowing up.definitely worth a try if you&#39;re in the area!...hiwever, you couldn&#39;t taste the whiskey since it was sweet, like a dacquiri."
khaosan-and-taylor-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/khaosan-and-taylor-chicago,1,"I am very unhappy with how the manager dealt with this situation because i am a long time customer.i ordered the noodle soup with beef.i went and it was the best thai food i&#39;ve had in years - and by far the best in chicago.i told my waitress and she said the manager would make me something else but the manager refused to take it off the bill..good dishes: som tum was delicious.love their food..i&#39;m from nyc and am somewhat of a thai food snob, so i was a bit skeptical of the great reviews other yelpers gave this place - and of the tiny restaurant&#39;s fairly dingy interior, but the food is soooooo good.i love this place!! and my friends love this place! everybody i&#39;ve taken here loved this place! lolall the dishes i&#39;ve tried are good, and they&#39;re cheap too! the place is clean and quiet.this place was delicious! my babe and i were trying something new and came across this place, it&#39;s cute and simple.the soups alone are sufficient to have as dinner.i got the pad cashew and i&#39;m very pleased.can&#39;t go wrong with anything you order- best thai on taylor street- by far!.if you have some time, and want a great meal this better than the other thai places in taylor street.although he was a bit disappointed because the menu clearly says that it comes with hainanese rice but instead he only got regular white rice.looking forward to going back!.my first review! i don&#39;t usually write reviews, but i moved here a few years ago from nyc and have been trying to find something comparable to my old favorite thai spots.i&#39;ve eaten at the other thai establishments near uic, being an alumnus, and was surprised to find a new one on the block.the pad thai had pepper seeds on every noodle and was made with silky tofu, not fried and just disintegrated when picking it up.i am sad to give them 2 stars because the customer service is very good but we were very disappointed with the pat see ew.you&#39;ve been warned.it&#39;s a regular stop for us.it was amazing.update: customer service is great.was specific about what that meant.green curry with shrimp, drunken noodles and basil chicken were awesome...i will definitely be returning.sorry but not everyone loves 3 cups of jalepeno seeds when they select 1 on the heat level - especially when they ask to keep those out!.great new thai place on taylor.on arrival, i loved the ambiance and the decorations.i ordered the pad thai.we had the honor of watching them prepare lunch for all of their deceased relatives to share on chinese new year.fresher food than thai bowl, but our food was 20 minutes late, the phone was busy when i tried to called, and the food we asked for not spicy is hot and the spicy food is bland..i&#39;ve only been here once, but it was my birthday and with three other ppl, we kind of went overboard on trying several dishes.pathetic.they made a dish for me that wasn&#39;t on the menu and the waiter/owner (i believe a mother and son own the restaurant) was attentive.best thai food i have had outside of thailand.in regards to the food.this is the one you&#39;re looking for.they refused to listen and then hung up on us.the service was excellent and they have a few outdoor tables too.i did call them to enquire and they apologized for the delay.i&#39;ve tried several thai places on taylor and thus far, this is by far my favorite.."

umami-burger-chicago-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/umami-burger-chicago-chicago,2,"We split a full order of french fries which was perfect for us, accompanied with 4 house made dipping sauces including their homemade ketchup.i mean i heard every word the people next to us were saying.the carrots and beets were my favorite but really everything on there was really unique and flavorful.loved avocado sprouts combination.which they no longer have on the menu.because we were in a hurry we were ready to order right away.they were delicious but definitely not something i would eat often.skip dessert and stick to what umami does really well.for my entree, i went with the manly burger because i love beer-cheddar sauces.they can&#39;t be bothered to lift the chairs and replace them.:)commuting/location - within walking distance from the damen blue line.i actually feel like i&#39;m not in the midwest! as for service, my servers were always great, friendly, and funny too! some even suggested menu items that paired nicely with whatever drink i ordered.for awhile, they had a promotional burger co-created by alton brown, which featured tasty stuff like maple glaze bacon and smashed cheesy tots.- sunnyside up burger - though there is an egg, it seem misleading to call it just this.the flavor of the meat with the couple toppings was perfect.space - had the cali vibe w/ a pretty good bar.the food was all really good.in all, will definitely plan on returning.food arrived cold, granted not directly the restaurant&#39;s fault, but nevertheless disappointing..despite the fact that there were maybe 6 other occupied tables, service was slooow..the umami burger capatilizes on all of those rich earthy flavors and pays hommage to your classic burger condiments but does everything in a new way.they should atleast change it to &#34;mild&#34; because that&#39;s exactly what it is.they serve very good juicy burger, but a bit pricey ( about 12 dollars for a burger alone).our server was great and she knew how to describe the menu items.it was bitter, and our fries wasnt even hot! how can you messed up fries?? service was very slow, it took 7mins for them to get us water, my friend had to get up and ask for water, really? there was only 4 other people in the resturant.amazing.last disappointment was the ahi tuna sandwich with chopped tuna (saw this firs time).the restaurant is located in wicker park and offers at comfortable venue with live music on weekend nights.hope this places leaves wicker park soon as there is no room here for liars and over priced crappy food.they should be included, especially for that high price.yummmmyy.super oily though, so be prepared.i am a huge fun of all the good burgers places in chicago..the environment is casual with a clean design aesthetic.what was super-dope was the artisanal pickle plate! it offset the everything.ambiance is upscale casual.if you are in the area, it is a good spot to grab a bite to eat (provided there wasn&#39;t a huge wait).the food was great, but definitely not worth the price.never again.nice area clean establishment.i got the manly burger with a side of truffle fries to split with a friend.great atmosphere and ok service.i&#39;d like to just get plain fries and go ham on the dipping sauces.no joke-raw.it wasn&#39;t a bad experience.all the burgers were tasty and hit the spot.so this is a review based on hitting up umami burger to try their new vegetarian option: the falafel burger.we have a lot of burger joints here that go a little overboard on toppings.the texture, flavor, and taste were on point for both salad and the burger.i&#39;m surprised they don&#39;t offer any true advice or any sauce pairings which i think would have definitely added to the taste.ordered the umami burger and sunny side burger.the fries were really good though!.5-2 hours before closing on a friday.onion rings never put on order, inquired waitress (jessica) said &#34;ok&#34;.their tamest burger is almost too crazy for me, and they have far crazier ones! if you have an adventurous palette, you must go here.my girlfriend got the &#34;manly&#34; burger and, while it was better, all the flavor was coming from the toppings (onion rings and lardons); the patty and bun were basically flavorless texturizers.just because the service i received was some of the worst customer service i have experienced in this part of town."

i certainly can&#39;t make use of this otherwise good-willed gesture).i will tell you too, there is a chance you are going to wait.i suggest the dungeness crab legs.since i&#39;ve been here before, i kinda knew what to oder and not be surprised on how i&#39;m going to finish my plate.we get seated, the table after us gets their order taken first, the server takes our order about 15 minutes after them.for the first time, we ordered the shrimp empanadas, a half tray of the langostinos and the red snapper.it&#39;s def a dive, but great food.the fried rice was surprisingly delicious.this is a byob which imo more beneficial.can&#39;t wait to go back ! marisco&#39;s  is a seafood establishment across the street that used to be our favorite.byob! bring friends and dine like it this last day of the world.my wife had garlic shrimp with rice it was very excellent.we went on a sat..i love the spicy crab legs &amp; prawns and baked oysters gratinados..sooo good.food is always delicious! i&#39;ve always picked estilo nayarit because it&#39;s their specialty.our split charges were over $800.) langostinos estilo nayarit aka prawns nayarit style.in no way did anyone here take responsibility for the poor service and we were forced to grab dinner elsewhere afterwards.please stay hidden as this restaurant is tucked away but all the locals go here as it is so so good! the food is basically all served on platters and it is all really authentic."

cafe-jumping-bean-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-jumping-bean-chicago,1,"This will be my chill, hang out spot.i&#39;ve tried a few different ones, most of the specials are too sweet for my taste (thai coffee is really sweet).the fast service, friendly staff and chill environment make this an awesome place to hang out any time of the day, but it seems to be busier around lunchtime and weekends.forgot reading material? no worries! as an added bonus, there is now a free community book exchange station right on the corner outside of jumping bean, so feel free to bring one or two books you&#39;re ready to let go of and search the dispenser for your next read! with a relaxed vibe and local feel, i definitely recommend cafe jumping bean for a low-key chill spot on your next trip to the area.go ahead and try them for yourself.while i think that the pastries could use some improvement the service is always wonderful and i truly enjoy just being in this coffee shop.this is one of those places.it&#39;s a friendly colorful place and the employees there seem to enjoy the work they do..cool employees.and the service, not too shabby either.it does not have the same family feeling it used to back in the day.definitely a neighborhood gem.parking is available at lunchtime along 18th to the east of cafe jumping bean, metered, but available :)i highly recommend cafe jumping bean with its good service and relaxed coffee house atmosphere.so finally i was able to review this wonderful artsy establishment.eat here.will make the drive again to try their other options..lots of fresh crunchy veggies and oregano.wifi is off during lunch as others have mentioned; it&#39;s quiet in the morning then very busy at lunch so this is understandable.been here twice.i happened upon this place after tutoring a student in the neighborhood..she&#39;s fretting over what option to go with now that they&#39;ve split the hmo.this is the kind of spot that you find being the location of a independent film where boy meets girl who is the waitress and they fall in love, some tragedy occurs, but in the end it doesnt matter because they still have each other ha!.definitely a nice cafe place to sit and talk and have a nice little meal.the chicken salad was good and the broccoli cheddar soup was even better! i wanted more! then sat around and read for a while before ordering the pizza.pilsen classic.just moved to pilsen so i thought i would give it a shot..i like this place.i wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable lingering with friends or on my computer if jumping bean were packed, however, we&#39;ve stopped by on occassion in the evening to grab a chocolate mexicano and a pastry and have stayed to chit chat if the place is empty.).they have many coffee options i wouldn&#39;t say its a gourmet coffee shop but they do very well.worth to try.great coffee, amazing soup and an inspiring atmosphere make this one of the best coffee shops i&#39;ve ever lived near!  love it!.i love this place because it is part of my neighborhood of over 35 years.i went back &amp; it was still good.i have lived in pilsen and jumping bean has just been a staple of my weekend since i moved here.friendly staff.sandwiches i haven&#39;t tried but they look delicious and will try soon!.cafe jumping bean is a relaxed, artsy coffee shop with good beverages, pastries and sandwiches.tasty focaccia, very nice service, delicious coffee, working wi-fi, it was just great for breakfast.i love love love coming here for my morning coffee.and did i mention it&#39;s located in the heart of pilsen?!.i love, love, love the coffee! i sat with a great view of the guy making the sammiches.i also got the tomato bisque soup and it was unreal.i highly recommended this place.i&#39;m also a fan of their mexican hot chocolate.only thing is that this place is very small so the space is limited.love this place! especially because i can walk here - loving my neighborhood more and more!  they have a great selection of caffeine to get your day started or to pick you up.staff is very very nice and sincere.one of my favorite spot for lunch.didn&#39;t get to try the food so this review is based purely on ambiance and service.and the food is good.on the bright side, the coconut donut was delicious and a great deal at $1.i&#39;ve been here twice, and have yet to actually order.our son liked his hot chocolate and we got another free hot chocolate on the house which was very good.this was very irritating seeing how i had just put a couple of hours in the meter at 11am and there were no signs anywhere indicating the wifi restrictions.as a mexican, i can assure you that this place is as worthy as my abuelita&#39;s cooking.it is just five ingredients (so far as i could tell) - pork, ham, sour pickle, bread and cheese - but this was tasted especially delicious..i love the decor (they change it from time to time), the atmosphere, the coffee, their sandwiches (tuna is my favorite) for lunch and not to mention the friendly and attentive staff.everyone is really friendly, even when they are super busy.i order the thai coffee and it is yummy.this place is tiny, but cosy.it&#39;s been a gradual slide to the bottom.my drink was creamy but smooth, and sweet but not extremely so.my boyfriend brought me here the other day and ordered the iced chai.why not support a local business and prices are average! just remember to tip!.i&#39;m moving away from pilsen after living here for two months.nice place, great atmosphere and lovely service.loved their iced chai.fyi everything is prepared in a toaster!! that threw me off, i was so curious how my black bean patty would turn out and it was totally dried out and disappointing!!!i waved over the guy that took our order -- he never introduced himself so i don&#39;t know his name -- i asked if i could get a little side of extra mayo and he said &#34;no, there is mayo already on it&#34;.i was blown away by how delicious their lattes are!  i&#39;m coming here as often as i can for their iced lattes!  bonus: they accept levelup!.i love it!i love supporting small businesses as opposed to big corporation.waited a few minutes for a table, and they only have a server or two so we waited about 20 minutes for food."
copper-fox-gastropub-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/copper-fox-gastropub-chicago,1,"The bartenders went out of their way for me, seeking out tea (they have a good selection, btw; i&#39;m a tea snob) for me, and making a chocolate dessert that wasn&#39;t on the menu appear after my dinner.the avocado fries i ordered along with the burger were interesting but maybe avocado is one of those things that just shouldn&#39;t be fried.won&#39;t soon be back.after 4.with so many choices in the city this industry did it standout, so it does it make the list.crunchy, not al dente...as good as it gets is right.the food was decent, not great.the calamari fries were very good but i think they would have been better with marinara rather than the tartar sauce they came with.my friend and i sat on the patio, which i am still unsure if i liked or not as there were a lot of people passing by.#16 biscuits are light, slightly sweet, with a little salt and creamy butter-delicious.delicious, flaky biscuits with warmed whipped butter started us off for dinner followed by some of the best roasted brussels sprouts with sweet and tangy pickled jalapeños.over all great experience.the drinks were clearly where they were putting their effort and those, while very good, cost as much as the entrees in the $10-12 range.i am usually not one to order chicken, but ironically both my husband and i ordered chicken dishes.we had an amazing breakfast there!  each plate of food our family ordered was perfect.an awesome place that&#39;s both sophisticated but still pretty casual.we had a few requests ( we are eating clean ) and each was accommodated without hesitation!we had the kale caesar salad and the avocado salad both of which were amazing - fresh and light.upon the servers, return, we were ready to order.our bartender, sawyer was very knowledgeable about the cocktails as well as the food menu.service: 5-starsfriendliest hostess and waitress.scallops with fennel salad were a perfect pair.it was mid afternoon, so not very crowded.such a massive upgrade from viand..nice ambiance, stellar service and a very nice 1 page menu.maybe i&#39;m not doing it justice by this review, however, we stopped on the way up to our room to grab a drink and an appetizer.biscuits were crazy good, and the calamari fries!brand new place, worth a stop!.had the fried chicken sandwich..while the dining area is more formalized and perfect for date nights!all in all i was thoroughly impressed and plan on coming back often!.he told us that the servers actually get tested on the menu so they have to know their stuff.the service we had was next to none.the shrimp and crap roll was mostly crab and the lumps were so big! i am from out of town, but i&#39;ll definitely be back.the prices are a bit high but it&#39;s downtown chicago.everyone left with full stomachs, for a price we all agreed was to our liking, on burgers that were delicious.to eat we had the biscuits (thanks to a yelp coupon) and shrimp &amp; crab rolls..a-mazing!!!!! i had the salmon and the table shared the brussel sprouts (a must have) grits (amazing) and mashed potatoes.we sampled quite a bit of the menu between the group and everything was awesome!i will definitely be returning to this spot whenever i&#39;m in the area!.their selection of local beer is wide but not overwhelming, and the bartender was able to give us recommendations based on our taste, and she nailed it.all in all just wrong.our waitress was friendly, and perhaps we would&#39;ve done better with other choices, but we aren&#39;t planning to return.we gave it a try mostly because we hoped not to have a lengthy wait (friday night, downtown chicago).the food and service went above and beyond to create a great experience! the entire staff made us feel welcome and it really made celebrating our anniversary feel special.i promised myself that i would not finish them.we used to come here often when it was viand and we&#39;re happy to have a new great place in this space!hope they evolve &amp; bring better entrees to their menu!.both good and reasonable portions, but a bit more than i think it was worth..but the crafted cocktails are delicious and are whipped up fast.you must try their biscuit as an appetizer.and we got them for free when we checked in on yelp.#6 gin is a bit much for a martini.highly recommend the pork porterhouse or fish tacos as well as the biscuits and the calamari fries., and after an endorsement from my visiting cousin, decided to stop in.modern.my favorite was the bloody mary which was one of the best i have ever had, flavorful and just the right amount of spice.they discounted our meal after we only ate part of it and gave us drinks on the house.all i can say, is come hungry and wear your best trousers with an elastic band, because you&#39;ll want to try absolutely everything..we took the kids for dinner late they had a great experience.omg!!!! so darn tasty and i eat out regularly and order roasted brussels sprouts whenever i see it on the menu.the avocado fries were a bit of a let down but not because of execution, i just didn&#39;t love the flavor of them.i waited 20 minutes for my first course, another 20 for my second and another 40 minutes for my check.plus there was a sprinkle of cojita cheese which gave a good saltiness..waiter was personable and upbeat.the hotel is the gastropubs hotel.get the biscuits!!.the menu prices were a little steep, but the drinks were great."
aquitaine-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/aquitaine-chicago,2,"On the other hand:- the ambiance.i like that it was not too big, and so had a more intimate feel to it.the atmosphere quaint, but classy.i&#39;m not a huge fan of asparagus, so i swapped my asparagus for my grandfather&#39;s spinach.aquitane is one of those gems.i ordered the rabbit ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the filet migon.donte was a great server and the food was fantastic!  the place is quiet and quaint.now, on to the food!  the appetizers, soups and salads are excellent - my favorites include the tomato basil soup and the pear walnut salad.the music was low key, contemporary french which further contributed to the civilized tranquility..she never brought ice to keep it cold).i got the pork shoulder everyone has raved about, but i just don&#39;t know why they raved.the flavors all came together beautifully.ate here last night with my boyfriend using the groupon and we had a delicious 3 course dinner! it was quiet there so it was easy to talk, and had pretty decor..they made sure we were finished with our entree before bringing out the next.i enjoyed it, though the sauce could have been better- more buttery, perhaps? my dessert selection was creme brulee and again, i finished it, but it says more to my appetite than the quality because i thought it was a bit underdone..problem is they don&#39;t have chefs they have cooks.when we arrived the place was nearly full, it was dimly lit, and perfectly romantic.walked in on a thursday evening without a reservation and was able to get a table for four.first timer on valentine&#39;s day...a perfect ending to our dinner.the staff was very flexible and gave all of us separate checks when asked.00 and the amount of food and quality are well worth the cost.a friend and i tried this restaurant for the first time tonight - and both swore we&#39;d be back soon.i&#39;ll keep my money.2) food was not that good either: braised pork shoulder had no flavor and grilled salmon with kale didn&#39;t have enough flavor either..we ordered their cauliflower soup--creamy and delicious--and i had mussels in a cream sauce.the food is okay.i had a special pork chop that was truly delicious (though rather dry &amp; chewy).we arrived a couple minutes early for our reservation and the place was about half full.i will probably give this place another try based on the service and ambiance but i would avoid this place during restaurant week going forward.i&#39;m just the kind of person that constantly wants to try new food.donte was our server and the only person besides invisible chef holly at aquitaine that weekday evening.)my husband described this as the &#34;perfect dinner.little place, sort of tucked away between cheap-sandwich shops and all of the depaul bars up the street, but it&#39;s also a 2-minute walk to the greenhouse theatre.i&#39;m always ready to go back whenever any of my friends / family want to experience a truly intimate, delicious french experience.while it doesn&#39;t take me much to eat rabbit, to have it in ravioli form and have it be this good is just awesome.there was some mushroom flavor but all in all the soup was a disappointment, but nothing like the entrees.duck pasta dish was just ok.we live in walking distance, so it&#39;s one of our &#34;go to&#34; places for an evening out.stumbled upon this place during restaurant week and so glad we did! small, intimate place with good service and tasty food! one of my dishes was a little over-salted but it was still good..worst dining experience ever! service was soooooooooo slow and it was terrible.upon entering we were the first ones in there.the food, decor, drinks and service were all really impressive, and it would be a shame for all of that to go to waste.this is a review for brunch.wine was good and the fois grais melted in your mouth.five stars for the server!there are complex cocktails on the menu, and when you finally get them, they are delicious.three of us had the special, the flounder.if they updated the dish with spinach i would be ok with that.i have no comments for improvement - we were both so impressed and hope to come back soon.we ended up wandering into the greenhouse theater and buying tickets to a late night show.the amber cake and cinnamon ice cream were better together than they were apart, and the cinnamon ice cream was initially frozen solid, such that we had to use a lot of force to get some ice cream onto our spoons.finished off with a bit of cake that tasted like a more delicious version of a butterfinger.the service was average.great service, delicious food, nice, intimate environment.the salmon was nicely flavored and a bit different.after an awesome dinner and experience, i decided to bring my mother and grandmother nearly a year later."

the side options of rice really does have to go! we didn&#39;t even touch it! they do need to serve it with something else! the mahi mahi was just as good but what made the mahi mahi perfect was the sauce and risotto it came with!lastly.the custard was.i&#39;ve walked past this place numerous time and finally ventured in on short notice.not cheap but totally worth the money.reasonable pricing.i&#39;d definitely go again but maybe for an after work drink or happy hour to try some apps.the standard serving size of both was perfect for a normal man&#39;s appetite with the dinner sour dough bread added.the first time i got the lemongrass mussels, i ordered extra bread and took the remaining sauce home...the tables are a little tight but overall a great experience.great environment, delicious seafood, great staff.for my main course, i opted for the scallops.i&#39;m not hating on you, it just doesn&#39;t sell the dish or feel special whatsoever.great food!

parlor-pizza-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/parlor-pizza-bar-chicago,2,"She said it tasted fine but i would stick to pizza.this place is always packed.the social scene..at the end of the evening i sampled one of the pizzas that appeared to have some kind of pesto topping.so we ordered the nacho bites (pretty good) and then the kale &amp; artichoke dip (very good - we asked for tortilla chips instead of bread).and even with open bar packages you have the right to refuse alcohol if someone is too intoxicated.chill and open spot.that&#39;s par for the course in the west loop, though.worst brussels sprouts ever.i forgot to mention the chicken sandwich when originally posting.try the i feel like bacon love pizza.unfortunately, after we were done eating, we couldn&#39;t really hang out there because it was so packed.3..we order 2 cheese pizza when we actually though we were ordering two cheesus pizzas!!! we asked the gentleman to remake one of the pizzas to be the chesus and he said no!!! this pizza cost them $3.the garlic and lemon really overwhelmed the flavors for me, i asked for a side of marinara to use to dip, and i was delivered a generous dish of marinara on the side.the food is very pricey and overall average.very unique and very delicious! i had read a bunch of reviews of the craziest bread so was super excited to try that but it was only okay..the  whole place is loud, atmosphere is lively.more like a hearty pizza if anything!nacho bites- spicy! but i loved itour pizza selections in order of my favorite to least favorite (but still delicious!): burrata be kidding me, abe foremans fav, margherita, sgt.inside, they could do with a few fewer tables.this place is a gem in the area.she was friendly, not super chatty which was nice.you can have large groups here, but we came in a group of 6 and their was no wait for the inside, but their was for outside.you are not a fine dining establishment.when looking at the menu i thought it would be good but it was blah and caused major heartburn.i went to this place this past thursday since i wanted to try it due to the way it looks, so i said let&#39;s go it&#39;s warm out and let&#39;s seat at the patio..service was a little hands off, except for when the random hands of the busboys would reach in and attempt to grab the plates off the table.the brussel sprout pizza was excellent, with no shortage of greenage.&#34;  everyone there was super cool and trendy looking.the bacon-lovers pizza (i don&#39;t remember the exact name) was tasty, with a clever combination that included sweet potatoes.primo location w/ large patio, far less concentrated w/ bimbos than river north, yet not hipstery by any stretch of the imagination.the atmosphere is vibrant, fun and unique! you will see groups getting champagne bottle service at brunch in the booths on one side of the room and people enjoying the patio in a casual dining experience vibe on the other! always packed on the weekends but worth it!.this place is so loud.i just wasn&#39;t a fan of all the olive oil.sunday funday spot for early dinner is what we did and enjoyed it so much.the fact that they even take reservations is amazing so i would say this is a place you come on a whim.parlor pizza owners: are you listening????.the decision location is pretty awesome too.overall great hangout spot to drink with friends and people watch."

i feel like everything there has got to be incredible and i can&#39;t wait to be back and try more things.it doesn&#39;t get any fresher than that! i will be back to try many more items from their menu.the truffle mushroom was very good, with plenty of mushrooms and truffle oil.the breakfast items came with gigantic sides of potatoes.siena tavern is about as hip and trendy as it gets, without the nausea inducing hipster vibe that makes me want to jab a sharpened moroccan vanilla bean in my eye.if you enjoy something herbal and refreshing, try the #13.i prefer the northern italian style of lasagne which usually has no meat..absolutely.13 was fabulous), and then waited until the hostess brought us to our table..opt for alfresco for incredible people watching.all of the flavors were well balanced.siena tavern can also be loud, often with frequent bachelorette parties or celebratory birthday groups, but it&#39;s always a diverse crowd.but this place came close.i was pleasantly surprised that the portions were huge expect for the 2nd course scallops, which was fine because i was eating off my husband&#39;s plate.it tasted like a monkey bread/bread pudding hybrid.anyway, we went to the joint tonight and the place is sooo beautiful inside.the manager, jennifer, stopped over with the bottle we ordered and was so friendly.uhhh, right up my alley.service was great i would definitely be back!.the gnocchi is served in truffle cream and is very rich, but very good.hey, some people just don&#39;t care about sports, alright?we started with the cocooli, a creamy, fluffy, puff-pastry type of appetizer with prosciutto.top 10 benedicts worldwide or maybe i was just hungry.with the little bottles of scrumptious sauces.tuscan kale salad, truffle mushroom pizza, ahi tuna, hamachi, king crab, squid ink linguini, caramelised brussels sprouts, and sticky parmesan potatoes.just wish they had bread on the side.i added shrimp which was also good.i was pleasantly surprised that my daughter and i had a table outdoors on a saturday night!

creamy, pillowy gnocchi.i assumed there would just be small chopped chunks of lobster but boy was i wrong.we walked up on a thursday evening and waited no more than 15 minutes.the plate served to my toddler was searing hot..this place was a recommendation from our concierge at the wit, and he didn&#39;t steer us wrong.it&#39;s one of the few places that is as great for brunch as it is for dinner..we were a party of 4 for dinner on a friday night.as appetizers, my boyfriend had the wagyu beef meatball, which was a huge 12 oz.their menu is in general impressively broad and of a consistently high quality.this was definitely one of my favorite spots in chicago.it&#39;s a very nice setting/scene as well.after a visit to the art institute, we took a hearty walk over to siena tavern  to check it out.i had been wanting to go to siena tavern for a long time and we finally had the chance during a summer weekend in the city with friends.both of the main dishes i&#39;ve had here have been wonderful!  the first time i had the truffle mushroom pizza, and it met my expectations.i&#39;m a proud supporter of team fabio, and coming here was on my bucket list.service was prompt, and our server wasn&#39;t averse to yelling out a few recommendations.and the patio is very dog friendly!!! they give my friend&#39;s dog a water bowl to drink from:d and jake was really happy there.the booth was relatively comfortable, but i didn&#39;t quite like how close the table was to me...- roasted carrot tortellacci: tender pasta stuffed with sweet puréed carrot filling, with a brown butter sage sauce that will haunt your dreams.i tried the flavor of the day, if i remember correctly was a raspberry with chocolate cheesecake chunks and bacardi infused somehow.but maybe it should have been.the &#34;burnt crust&#34; pepperoni pizza wasn&#39;t quite as charred as i would have liked, but it did have a very thin crust and good flavor.the waitress was extremely friendly and helpful, and all of her suggestions were on point! will definitely be back to try some more!.absolutely delicious!! for my entree i chose the steak and eggs.maybe a food snob in general, but italian especially.i know i&#39;m usually pretty gracious with my &#34;stars&#34; but this sienna tavern deserves all 5.we will definitely be back and hope he is our server!.regular eggs benedict was also good.they have both bar and table top seating with a full gluten free menu...i have to say that we were pleasantly surprised by everything given how ambivalent we were about this restaurant after our dinner here in august.that&#39;s why you need to go now and try it!the coccoli is also yummy!  the honey truffle wasn&#39;t over powering, but that&#39;s what i like.came here for brunch and it was really a bit hit for me! ordered the hamburger and parmesan fries and it was cooked to perfection.it wasn&#39;t anything special and was overall a little bland and underwhelming.only downside is how extremely busy it gets.as a first generation italian i want to say you guys hit it on the money, there isn&#39;t one dish my wife and i haven&#39;t tried and fell in love with!we&#39;ll be back many times! gracie mille!!.one of my favorite restaurant stops during our recent chicago trip.truly fresh and quality - i got the gnocchi which was spot on.i love their drinks and food.spicy pizza is definitely spicy!there are cute comfy couches for romantic dates or casual group gatherings.we were seated 30 minutes late for our reservation and originally put in not the best table, but they made up for it by moving us, bringing us complimentary drinks and dessert, and fabulous food.now i need a nap."

their lattes and black coffees are perfect...their salads are tossed when served, but absolutely drenched with dressing.i do too, and that&#39;s only reason that i tried it twice without knowing much about the food offered there.amazing cafe! so glad i found this place and that it happens to be a block away from where i keep busy.for brekki, i tried a quiche (kale + roasted pepper + gruyere cheese), and its dough had a buttery, flaky texture that melted on my tongue.hipsters.love this place.a great little cafe and only a short walk from the harper center..no wonder this is the only restaurant not full on the 57th street on sunday morning.when i&#39;m back in hyde park i might try this again, if there are no other options in the area.so i warn the readers who are perusing through this review, if you are unfortunate enough to purchase sandwich at this business, be sure to check if the sandwich bends under duress.well, the honeymoon is over.i absolutely love this place! the soy mocha is one of the best i&#39;ve ever had.perfect location next to the robie house and an inviting bookstore.a cute little cafe with great coffee and savory pies! the vanilla latte is especially good - they make the syrup themselves, which has a noticeably fresh and deep taste.the meat was tender and flavorful.charming ambiance.yup, adorable little spot right next to the bookstore with long tables for group dining and a nice outdoor patio space all of which fills up pretty quickly during lunch rush times on campus.you can spend $12 on a small lunch here but you don&#39;t need to- there are good $7 options if cost is a hang-up, and pastries are less expensive than at starbucks.definitely coming back.alternatively, one should just admit that after 10 years in a phd program sipping coffee in a cafe instead of typing away in a computer lab that you were never that serious about art history anyway.we saw some students meeting up working on laptops, and also others just coming in and out.then, they have really good coffees.i&#39;ve heard nothing but great things about other coffee drinks.all in all, this has become on of my neighborhood favorites.solid fan of plein air.wifi is free for non-uchicago students, though took awhile to connect to it.food was good.staff is very friendly too..i would only suggest staying away from ordering anything with baguettes if you are new to this place.the food is a bit on the expensive side, but it&#39;s not overpriced for the quality.lovely food, very bitchy asian cashier who multiple times has asked for my order, turned away while i&#39;m talking, then turned back and asked me to start over, as well as making it obvious she&#39;d rather be anywhere else during the lunch rush.the sandwiches and quiches were outstanding, ingredients fresher and more refined than the med.i want to like the place..then the raspberry beignets &amp; english breakfast tea steeped exactly for 4.food is great, portions are small and it is pretty expensive.she was quick thinking, attentive, and didn&#39;t call unnecessary attention to the situation.ordering was a rather hasty experience, as i immediately looked to the blackboard above the cashier, which only listed coffees and teas..in addition to amazing pastries and baked goods, they have some yummy food options.plein air did not disappoint.the bread was soaked with delicious gravy and still had crunchy exterior.my friend got the prosciutto sandwich and it was pretty delicious besides the fact that the bread was also a little dry..we had sandwiches which were delicious, one was a turkey-brie-mustard combo &amp; the other parma ham-manchego-alioi.so far, plein air cafe maintains top spot for its smoothness yet ability to keep the fragrance of the beans, which are locally roasted.sorry, plein air.i highly recommend stopping by here if you&#39;re near u chicago&#39;s campus, especially if the weather is nice as their outdoor patio is really wonderful.another thing to note is that they have a full menu of food at the counter, which i didn&#39;t realize when i first walked in.the latte also did not disappoint (i believe they use metric beans?).fortunately it was warm and we could go to an outside table.i highly recommend the french toast for breakfast and the mushroom pie for lunch..two stars docked because it&#39;s overpriced ($9 for said tartine..for lunch, try their tartines or grain bowls - they&#39;re flavorful, healthy and loaded with vegetables.they seem so out of place, like they got them along with a few other odd items and decided to use them without really thinking about the appropriateness of taxidermy in a cafe.the tuna is tasty and fresh.like, beyoncé level flawless.overall loved the place.nice outside seating arrangement and community seats inside.yum.just had their mocha today."

da-lobsta-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-lobsta-chicago-3,2,"As i walked in, isaiah assisted me in ordering exactly what i was looking for.wow.i hadn&#39;t ever been here before and my coworker and i went here for lunch..- hush puppies: also really good, a big portion for the pricei enjoyed everything i had here, and not just because i didn&#39;t get to eat all day while traveling to chicago.negatives:-was on the profit- and i guess the owner is not the warmest person and is going through financial struggles.i had the chicago lobster roll and it was pretty delicious.sorry da lobsta, we will most likely not be back.we were also given samples of the lobster bisque and clam chowder which was a nice touch.clam chowder was also great!tons of hot sauce and old by seasoning right at your fingers tiplittle expensive for portion size, but its understandable because seafood is expensive and that would not stop me from going back!.da lobsta sandwiches were great!  a little pricey at retail, but honestly not that bad - you get a hefty and pretty helping of lobster with a few pretty claw pieces to accent everything.i can&#39;t believe i haven&#39;t been here sooner.their clam chowder was good but it would have been nicer if it was a little thicker.when we arrived there was only one other person inside.came here for dinner during one of my visits in chicago, and it was very convenient, just a little over 10 min walk from my hotel.the huge chunks of lobster were so flavorful and nice!! the sandwich itself could&#39;ve been better - i&#39;m used to the style of lobster roll that&#39;s an actual roll, not just a piece of toast folded and stuffed.the bread was perfect, and the heat of the siracha and peppers really added a great flavor to the roll.the lobster roll was amazing!  tons of lobster chunks and a big claw piece served on warn buttery buns topped with mayo.this is a very unique location.ok, so my initial review after being a loyal customer was one of great disappointment, but i did go back maybe a month later, and had a much better experience.the lobster topped over the roll and was so tender! the dip, as well, was very tasty! we will be back.the clam chowder was good!  not too heavy and lots of chunks of potatoes and large pieces of clams...the buttery bread and clam chowder won me over! i will definitely be back! it was a little warm but we drank watermelon and lemonade slushies! great place for a quick lunch.the toasted bun was the perfect texture and had just a hint of sweetness.when i crave a lobster roll from back east i come to da lobsta to get a quick fix.the rolls were buttery yumminess filled with a good chunk of lobster.definitely going back here again and again and again.no signs saying that they closed early.grabbed some food to go.i don&#39;t buy that lobster is expensive excuse as this was next to no meatif you heard about them like i did or somewhere else and want to try i say don&#39;t not worth it.we bought a groupon for this place which included 2 bags of chips, 2 cups for soda, and two lobster rolls for $20.i got an original lobster roll, double meat with the meat heated (typically comes cold, which is no way to enjoy sea spiders).it was nice to see.funny dude who provided &#39;a notch above&#39; service.okay lobster rolls for chicago.now, i&#39;ve had several lobster rolls in my life that probably cost $21 or more, but then the quality of the lobster meat is much higher.i wish they would open on in nyc!.let me put this into perspective.amazingly delicious food! my friend and i were in town for a couple days, while out walking we came across this place.they also have a food truck and second location.you get very minimal for the amount you spend and for less than average food.delivery was really fast and the food was so good i felt a lot better having to work late.i ended up going for the lobster roll ($14) and had it prepared chicago-style, which meant sriracha mayo and topped with spicy giardiniera.great lobster rolls! bread is perfect! slaw is great! kind of pricey- but so is everywhere else in chicago.my next visit to the city.the traditional lobster roll was exactly what i needed.i had high hopes.my wife and i stopped by the french market location.i reluctantly went back in the other day and was greeted by one of the nicest humans i&#39;ve ever met! i will keep coming back based off her service alone - she&#39;s the best!.amazing food and great people.we ended up getting one roll with extra meat and one roll without (both traditional style), 2 chips &amp; 2 drinks.got the lobster salad which is ok, but not enough meat.great vibe and food..when i tried da lobsta truck at a mediocre  outdoor festival  the lobsta mac n cheese didn&#39;t tickle my fancy.lobster roll: seems to be brimming with lobster, and had a delicious crispy bun.our service was amazing.now - it wasn&#39;t that crowded that day, so i can see how he was able to make the rounds.maybe it was an off day.since relocating back to chicago, i&#39;ve been on a hunt to find the best lobster rolls this city has to offer.it&#39;s a nice place for a quick bite and staff is also very courteous!.oh my lobster mac!!! this place is so good, i can&#39;t even put it into words.the bread was perfectly grilled, but the cheese was quite mild and i&#39;m not sure the lobster added that much..i tell all of my friends.the rolls are really good."
frontier-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/frontier-chicago-2,2,"This place is great...the staff was courteous and allowed us to open tabs for each person for all the drinks.great space and awesome patio.i was underwhelmed by this place based on the recommendation i received.and yes, like it or not, you are a cocktail bar- a whole menu of $12 specialty cocktails, $10 &#34;classics&#34;, and a $7 specialty shot? but you&#39;ve got two bartenders for the whole place on a saturday and the one didn&#39;t know how to make a hot toddy (a special on the menu, by the way).she came around our table quite a few times and was very patient while i tried to make sense of the menu.my entire family found something to enjoy on the menu.$1 oysters, the place is packed; i get it that my dozen will not be served in 15 minutes.the whole pig dinner is the reason we came here.overall it was okay but with so many chicago restaurants to try i don&#39;t think i would go back.hosted a large party (65 people) here in october of 2015.i had the duck empandas and mixed drinks, vodka with club soda..i think i&#39;ll have to return with a larger group to better enjoy frontier..add in some leeks and a nice mayo with a some nice kick to it and you have yourself a winning burger.well if your hungry you better eat a snack before you go here as not only did our drinks take like 20 minutes but or food took forever! nice of them to give us 3 deviled eggs(though there were 4 of u) to &#39;tide&#39; us over but it didn&#39;t work! the guys got skillets and literally one went home and had a piece of pizza it was so small, add more potatoes other than a paper slice of hash browns and maybe more than 4 pieces of meat.personally, i&#39;m a foodie.surprisingly, i had a very pleasant experience at frontier..i mentioned it to the bar tender who seemed pretty cool he said he would look into it.i am a repeat visitor and it&#39;s like second home base...the server or manager i can&#39;t tell, was very short with us and spent a lot of time with the other tables.i ordered the beef cheek tacos which i loved but they were soooo small.he catfish dish was pretty good, but a little heavy on the sodium.aside from that, the service really couldn&#39;t be more mediocre if it tried.but for $13 it was definitely not worth it.our server was very attentive and helpful..5 minutes later he comes back and takes down my information.from the whole animal service menu, we got the whole pig and the beef ribs - on point.they were having a great time.i just feel that if they are going to suggest sharing, it should be served for sharing..fried chicken sandwich; stole the show!that said, i&#39;m glad i went.upon being seated, we were then told that both of their  &#34;oyster day&#34; specials were no longer available, but we were welcome to order anything from their regular menu.the flavor was ok.read about this place on eater for their unique and delicious take on meat.the empty seats were dead smack in the sun.lollipop chicken wings arrived to the table hot and crispy, perfectly paired with a savory drizzle of bleu cheese and buffalo sauce.not sure if i will ever go back to this place.we go and order 6 east coast oysters, 3 west coast oysters and 3 east coast oysters."
shake-shack-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shake-shack-chicago-2,2,"I do enjoy their food, but there&#39;s so many other places i could go for a sit down meal for the same or slightly higher price.this is just an overpriced burger and fries.delicious as always! so glad there is one in chicago.restaurant is pretty clean and cool place to socialize.i have been to shake shack probably 6 or 7 times, and every time i&#39;m more impressed than the last.get the shack stack for hot cheesy goodness.i love the original shake shack in madison square park in nyc, especially in the summer on a nice day or night.i came here with a group of friends after a long conference day, expecting to have the usual juicy burgers.we swung by for a quick dinner to try a chicago dog.the shackburger was small and sorta..with decor from the 50s, it&#39;s like a continuation of the art museum experience.$15.i are the remainder of my daughters fries.they have a dog menu, which is random, and they allow dogs on the patio.i know it&#39;s a ny chain, but i wouldn&#39;t have known any better at this chicago location.line out the door, all tables filled.cheese fries are good as well.with ipa! nice bathroom in upstairs.i&#39;ve been to shake shacks out on the east coast and loved them so i was super excited when this one popped up a few blocks away from me!but despite the great location, the food is sub-par.my usual is the shack burger and fries.this was my first time coming here and i&#39;ll tell you now it&#39;s not my last!.so good!! the line was pretty long, but  it managed to move pretty fast.perhaps not quite as good as five guys but not bad, not bad at all.in this case, i just don&#39;t get it.5x more than in n out doubles), i can honestly say it was not worth it.fave!.and please let me know if you figure &#34;it&#34; out, because i&#39;m still scratching my head at the concept.my $6..maybe i went in with too high expectations.the line was very long (20+ people), but we were committed.after hearing about how all of the east coast basically loves shake shack, i was excited to give it a try when my friends and i went to chicago for a day trip/food tour.i guess if you are going to fill your body with the good stuff- buns that are non gmo, potatoes that are artificial flavor free, beef from natural angus meat, and shakes from real cane sugar and not from corn syrup, the price is going to be higher for sure.left a bad taste in my mouth.i tried the portobello mushroom burger, a shake, and the fries.i wanted to get their classic burger as it&#39;s probably the simplest burger on the menu...i didn&#39;t realize that until after two trips and two different shakes.mediocre burgers.thanks for the service!condiments are to the side of the wall.you even get a fun french fry fork to eat your cheese fries with that will keep those fingers focused on cheeseburger nirvana.a travel mate and i decided to eat here after touring the distinguished hotel.i think it was the combination of the soft and chewy bun and the fresh ingredients inside that made it feel like heaven when i bit into it.fries sooo crispy on outside.very delicious! perfect amount of everything.chocolate shake was solid.they&#39;re also open pretty late compared to other loop dining options.didn&#39;t have a burger but tried the millennium perk concrete.everything has been delicious, and i can imagine that their food is just as good as the burgers and fries i have enjoyed at other shake shack locations."

pastoral-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastoral-chicago-2,2,"The san daniele has san daniele prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, oven-roasted tomatoes and housemade pesto.pastoral is a good choice for lunch and has a nice selection of craft beer and wine.fresh breads, quality meats and cheeses, wines, beers, salads and little odds and ends you won&#39;t find elsewhere.of the 3 vegetarian/vegan sandwiches i&#39;ve tried, the nutty gardener (apples, cucumbers, red onions, gingered carrots, piquillo peppers, almond butter) and the  farmhouse veggie deluxe (manchego, avocado, apple, cucumber, vinaigrette, dijon, greens) are good choices, while the cali chevre (goat cheese, almond butter, avocado, celery, red onions) is pretty bland.everything i have has has been delicious, the service is great.great little spot in a touristy part of chicago lacking in local flavor.nutty vege sandwich won my heart.the space is very tiny so don&#39;t expect to eat there during the lunch rush! would recommend grabbing a sandwich to go and taking it to the park.really cute interior, fantastic wine and cheese selection.they offered a lunch special but were out of many of the items on the special menu and could make no substitutions..one nice advantage to my new building is that it&#39;s only a 0.the people who work there are so genuine and help you pick your hard and soft cheeses and answer any questions you may have.an odd combination of celery, onions goat cheese avocado and almond butter.always delicious - in person and delivery.usually i am a huge fan for quality ingredients on a simple sandwich (see my review for z&amp;h), but pastoral took it to the extreme for me.2 sandwiches to go: mediterranean turkey ($7..absolutely not worth waiting on line for this average deli.the pig&#39;n fig is the best!  i get it every time and it never lets me down.the staff there is super friendly, and the gift products are beautiful.nice thick slices of cheese and plenty of meet to satisfy a hungry customer.the staff was friendly and helpful and the selection was fantastic.the blue pig and fig sandwich was seriously tasty and unique!  was disappointed with the tiny &#34;side salad&#34; (pictured) which was not even a step-up from grocery store deli section fare.definitely not your ordinary turkey sandwich.plus they are open until 8 pm, making for a reasonably healthy dinner option.this sandwich had a good amount of protein, delicious soft cheese and a fruit spread that completed the entire thing.the good:-the sandwiches are amazingly good-the staff is super nice and they know a ton about the cheeses and meats-the location is great for offices nearby-they take orders over the phone - call ahead at lunch!!!-if you do call ahead, skip the line by walking to the left when you come inside-they have the best bacon ever - get the blta :)-punch card, after 10 lunches you get one freethe bad:-the line gets insane at lunch so avoid it by calling ahead-there&#39;s hardly anywhere to sit insidei highly recommend you try this place at least once.(i&#39;m actually still kinda hungry.5 stars - i would go out of my way to dine here.so good.i love my blue cheese and that was missing!.however, it can be excruciatingly slooooowwwww.ps: there are other sandwiches that are priced less..this was just a very aggravating experience.pastoral is everything you would want in a deli.been here a few times and always fantastic food.picked up 4 mango white tea drinks.)nice little sandwich menu with some very innovative combos.the sandwiches are definitely worth going for, but the service can be a bit slow.pastoral is the greatest sandwich place on earth.they let you try whatever you want and will recommend items with little or no input from you if you don&#39;t know what you are looking for.i might maybe maybe go back and try something else for a second chance/to change the rating but definitely not in a hurry!  my sandwich was just some thin sliced turkey on plain tasteless wheat bread.my boyfriend got the mediterranean turkey and that was delicious as well! tasted very fresh and healthy.pastoral is a great deli to grab a sandwich on the go...ordered a drink and the sales person didn&#39;t even tell me where to retrieve it from (wasn&#39;t exactly obvious either).i ordered 3 sandwiches - the simple pig, bocadillo de la mancha and the blta with turkey - and then the kids made the mistake of falling asleep on the walk back.be still my inner fat kid heart.it was $43 and while it may have been decent quality it felt a lot more like it should have cost half as much..25..if i were to order again, i&#39;d probably ask to remove the pesto..i also hand a gingersnap type of cookie and it was one of the hardest cookies i have seen in quite some time.i had the blue pig and fig, also tried the san danielle.so good! the meat and cheese were so high quality! you can also buy wine, cheese and meat there.we came here for lunch since it was the closest thing to us.if you can afford the nice cheeses then this is more the place for you!.sandwiches here are quite good.it have a wonderful blend of flavors.since the bread was so tough, everything was falling out of the sandwich.the staff was polite enough but otherwise seemed not terribly interested in the customer service aspect.please note the have only two tables.the only thing i wish is the option for hot sandwiches because sometimes i just want a hot lunch in cold chicago but pastoral may be too classy for that!.fantastic sandwich! i had the spanish tuna and the bacon potato salad.(you might save a few pennies by going to the subway down the block, but your conscience will never forgive you.will be going back for sure!..the taste of this cheese is like a combination of an aged romano and parmesan cheese.one girl stood in line for about 20 minutes to buy a bottle of wine, when she could have just gone to the checker on the side.every bites had dimensions of tastes: first sweet, second sour and then spicy! they also provide artisan drinks with reasonable prices.they have a deli, fresh made sandwiches and cheese boards, and a wonderful selection of wines! i frequent this place often since it&#39;s steps out of my route home when i decide to take the pink line - sadly, i lose every frequent sandwich card i get, but if you&#39;re not prone to misplacing things like me, be sure to get stamps every time you buy a sandwich to work up to a free one!i&#39;ve tried the caprese (once) and the farmhouse veggie (every.."

crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.too bad i couldn&#39;t get to the marrow in them duck bones!!!!.after ordering a second drink and waiting over 20 minutes without seeing our server, i had to walk inside to the bar to let them know we no longer wanted the drink we had been waiting for and simply wanted our check.celebrated a birthday and compted pumpkin and chocolate malt ice cream.the appetizers were inventive and delicious.roasted mushroom and the risotto excellent.and i would be remiss to point out that on a super hot dog day of summah, chef was there saying hello to guests in the dining room before heading back to work with the team in the kitchen.rice cake appetizer is simple but excellent, as are the other appetizers -- salmon tartare, potted foie gras, burrata, etc..we were all blown away by the roasted mushrooms on the creamiest of polentas, topped with green garlic and porcini-dusted popcorn; we weren&#39;t even embarrassed to scrape the bowl for the last drop.really perfect crispy skin and moist meat.the bartenders were super knowledgeable, helpful and fun.i believed the hype.&#34; and had no intention of visiting.each time we&#39;ve been by, a manager or someone who seems to be in charge stops by and checks on everything.chicken thigh - presented with slice filet of the chicken.my favorite was the uni and prawn risotto, then the braised beef, then the salad of the duck platter.i loved it!friday night reservation for 4 at 6:15.creative, good portions, and rightly priced.this is one of those places you go to when you need to unwind.they call this a &#39;filet&#39; of bacon.thankfully she chimed in that her craving for tonight was duck.this place is a solid 4 stars, as in &#34;yay! i&#39;m a fan.great, stylish bar with friendly bartenders.definitely don&#39;t come here if you want a quiet meal.i guess they don&#39;t update their menu online.they both had a slight spice but nothing crazy.7:30pm came and still no tv on.it was two leg/thigh quarters and two breasts sliced on the bias.excellent all around..duck yeah.i would say the boldest things about the duck inn is its playlist of (neo)soul and motown and the cocktail list.it was clear the chefs were extremely busy and we would&#39;ve been happy to just eat and watch, but they were friendly, and it was clear they and every member of the staff wanted to make sure we enjoyed the food and had a good experience.one sauce i believe was like a spicy mayo based sauce and the other tasted like hoisin sauce to be honest.they did redo it speedily and comped us both my main and the wine, but this didn&#39;t save the experience unfortunately.the waitstaff all have tatts &amp; a slight goth look.i came for saturday lunch and the menu wasn&#39;t very interesting...the food left much to be desired.we hadn&#39;t realized you have to order the duck ahead of time, but they were having a slow day and had a few extra on hand.the portions are just enough to fill you up, but don&#39;t expect to take leftovers home.this brought me to heaven.we were in the dining area but the entire menu is merged so you can order whatever.)if you check-in on yelp, you&#39;ll get a free order of chili cheese fries, so that was definitely one of the first orders on our list.cocktails were inventive and tasted well balanced.lumpia, is filipino style eggrolls, but these to me are much more vietnamese style, but that&#39;s just semantics.i would definitely go back to this place in a heartbeat and try other dishes on the menu and i would definitely recommend it to others.complete five-star experience.- spring rolls - nothing special here but tasty nonetheless.not a single inadequate aspect of our meal.what a huge disappointment.i will try again and next time i hope they do better with the service.i mean, most people don&#39;t have duck everyday so the food stands out and they&#34;ve done a good job.(it was a quiet night so i&#39;m not sure if they have someone do that normally or not)our evening ended with that same gentleman coming over to our table to ask how our meal was and to make sure we were satisfied.the manager greeted us with a warm handshake and introduced himself to us- very personable!duck entrée for two: 5 stars.luckily, we were all in a festive mood and didn&#39;t mind it.this was confusing to us at first, since the same menu is served in both locations--the restaurant seems to have a warmer decor though, for those of you interested in that type of thing.i enjoyed my draft porter but for $8, it was not even 8 ounces with the large head.the combination of the rye bread with the grilled onions and cheese makes this one a well balanced earthy winner."

(which were perfect!- )thank you again for a great night!satya.the staff was warm and friendly and made the whole experience very homey..the lamb was good, but the chicken didnt have the heat i was expecting, but it was well prepared (grilled) and tasted really goodthe ambience is what people come for, though i personally dont really care for the views, too many buildings around all the windows.excellent food and service, what more can you ask for!.for starters, it&#39;s so chic.they were season so well that my best friend and i almost got some to take on the bus home.came here for my birthday and although we were expecting a stuffy staff due to it location in the langham, the servers were fun and funny!  dinner was incredible and portions surprisingly generous.we sat in the lounge area which is spacious, swanky, good music, great views and good crowd.the prawns were cooked perfectly, served with a flavorful broth as well as toasted ciabatta with aioli.we were originally planning to go here during restaurant week but we had to cancel last minute, so when my parents told us they were staying at the langham for their anniversary, we knew we had to come check it out.located on the second floor it offers a decent view..after enjoying cocktails last evening in the hotel bar here, we were determined to try the restaurant.we sat down to eat a little after 11 am and the place was empty.good wine selection.our waiter was fantastic - he was very attentive, and the food was excellent...good place to chill out and unwind after a long day.excellent.sadly i was too full to really enjoy it all and because i was staying in a hotel room, i couldn&#39;t exactly take it with me.it was truly a culinary delight.favorite breakfast spot in chicago!.we started with drinks and complimentary bread that was amazing.i&#39;ve been here twice for weekend lunches and it&#39;s very relaxed.i like that this place is always riff-raff free as well.for 2 pancakes..i was excited to go to travelle ever since i saw it featured on the television show check please! i studied the menu and made a list of everything i wanted.we came for brunch.he also got himself a well made cocktail and we also ordered a chicken wings.wouldn&#39;t recommend!the staff and service was on par; the food, however, was very off.this review is for the bar bites.ok food and ok menu.great place for 2-4 people to get together.it wasn&#39;t too sweet and quite delicious!to share, we chose:1.i remember the chicken wings being really amazing.now it&#39;s time for my food coma!.the entire evening was a masterpiece.i came for a holiday work dinner in december, and everyone had a great experience.he loved his burger and i&#39;m pretty sure they sprinkled crack on the fries that came with it, because they were ridiculously good..i tried going back for the dyeing of the river, but they decided to charge $50 per person a week before we were to go and so no one wanted to go back.eater...beautiful view of the city.we selected the salmon, and it was an amazing blend of ingredients.i would defiantly recommend this place.of all the deserts, the creme puff was the biggest hit with the chocolate cake (essentially german chocolate cake) was the runner up.the two eggs were poached perfectly.if you&#39;re a fan of mad men then this might be an interesting place for you and your coworkers to stop by during cocktail hour so you can discuss how to build explosives out of canola oil and bow tie pasta just like don draper (i&#39;ve never actually seen the show)."
ciao-cafe-and-wine-lounge-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ciao-cafe-and-wine-lounge-chicago,1,"The food was well priced, it was very reasonable which was nice to see for a change.unbelievable!  small menu but good choices.everything is superb on the select menu.enjoyed an intimate evening.i ended up here with a girflriend after work with a travelzoo voucher since we were already in the neighborhood.the restaurant is a quaint little gem seating around 20....one of the things we love most about our neighborhood is the plethora of amazing restaurants.he responded with an obnoxiously sassy &#34;oh..i finally walked over to the bar and said i was just looking to sit and enjoy some wine.went there at 7:30 pm on a sat night.overall, i&#39;m thrilled the west loop has a place like this.great food, great wine, great ambiance! i can&#39;t believe we waited so long to come to this west loop gem! we tried the aquinas red after reading some reviews as well as the fire road white and both were delicious!all the plates are fairly small, perfect for a date night to share! we ordered the baked white cheddar mac n cheese small plate, which was by far one of the best we&#39;ve had! the top thin layer of breading was light and added a great crunchy texture.street parking couldn&#39;t be easier! the service.i look forward to returning and trying out the rest of the menu.and great place for live music.i would definitely recommend this establishment to a friend, and i would come here again because the food was incredibly tasty, and decently priced.we&#39;re both in the service industry, and would&#39;ve thought the server would have comped at least the first refill when i mentioned it upon receiving the check.it always looked so quaint and cozy that it reminded me of the tiny italian resturants that line the streets of the west village in ny.it is such a small and cozy place.to the people who complain about the service, give me a break.when you eat here, you feel like you have been transported to a european cafe.i went here on a saturday night about 8pm.a wine cafe?!? great place to enjoy our last few days of warm weather.after two hours of wait, it didn&#39;t seem that dreamy any more.then as we finished our wine, he never came back to see if we needed anything else, which i did.if you&#39;re in the area its worth your time to check it out- it won&#39;t even cost you that much to take the risk.for two years (or maybe even more), my company has hosted its holiday party at this location..can&#39;t wait to go back! will become a regular for sure.i will definitely be back! amazing!.the prices are reasonable and the service is awesome.might seat about 30 people.my fiance and i went on a friday evening at 7pm.i went to cafe ciao for dinner last night after finding it via yelp.went to cafe ciao with a travelzoo coupon which was a great deal.both were cooked perfectly and the portions were good size.definitely a plus to see an engaged owner walking the floor and talking to customers.we enjoyed the aquinas red paired with a flat bread, the mac &amp; cheese, and an appetizer that i cant (for the life of me) remember but it was a spicy cheese with a jam-like substance on bread.i&#39;d recommend this place to anybody who wants to dip a toe into the wine scene or the tapas scene or looking for a low-key, nonthreatening place to enjoy a glass with some friends without the server being snobby and snorty about your pairings.i love this intimate dining spot.it&#39;s definitely a break from the busy restaurants on randolph.i got the rigatoni and the bf the angel hair w meatballs.it was tasty, except the bottom was burnt.candle lit dinner, and live music.really liked the cozy atmosphere, and the food was great.if you are in the neighborhood, you should stop in!.it was described as velvety.this is a great neighborhood date spot! very small and low key, in a comforting way.julie and the staff are great..it will take you at least 3 hours to get food.i&#39;ll stick with my ravsdessert, again, was multiple choices.rigatoni is to die for!!! desert is good.we&#39;ve had the bruschetta (bomb), the mixed marinated olives (amazing if you like olives), the salad, empanadas, and flat-bread, all were wonderful..it&#39;s very well-lit, which takes away from the ambiance..good food and personable staff.super cute and romantic! actually very good tasting food (from appetizers to desserts) i have been there twice and both times it&#39;s been amazing! very romantic dates and great food, i have tried multiple dishes and all i&#39;ve been very content.this place is small &amp; intimate and has live music some nights.unlike some of the other reviews, we had no issues with speed of service in fact, our food arrived rather quickly.will go again on the way to a hawks game for sure..my only complaint is that we didn&#39;t hit this place at a better time with more atmosphere.the quality and the portions at cafe ciao are top notch.ciao is cozy little place, owned and run by &#34;chief cook and bottle washer&#34;, julie.this is a sweet little gem tucked into the west side of chicago! it is off the beaten path for tourist, but our driver gave us the tip, and so glad he did! when you first walk in, it is quaint, simple, and eclectic, with the aroma of italian seasonings and garlic wafting through the air to greet you."
the-reservoir-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-reservoir-chicago-2,1,"Good local watering hole with better than average food.chill, neighborhood spot with good drinks, awesome food and fair prices! wife @fabsoopark loves the judgement day with pisco..not a food review (although the menu looked great).great unique appetizers.nick was bartending, and was incredibly personable.if i was ever in the neighborhood i would look to go again.that really bothered me.chicken club sandwich really good.run to resevoir for a flavorful meal and great drink options!!!  i had the lamb burger--delish--along with resevoir fries and a tasty beer.my friend and i ordered a few beers and the cheese board.love it here, live across the street, really convenient.when i moved to buena park last summer i was bummed to lose my old hangout in lakeview, but the res won me over pretty quickly.love to order from here and in the summer months, it&#39;s an awesome place to have a chill patio dinner at.service was okay, we weren&#39;t really checked on too often throughout our visit which is a bit sad considering the place wasn&#39;t busy at all.was a little tough, was expecting something more &#39;soft&#39; if that makes senseentree: i got the lamb sandwich.it has a decent beer selection, great food thpugh the menu is a bit limited, and an  awesome laid back vibe.it seems like a really nice place to take a date, but i&#39;d probably skip it otherwise.they have a great selection of wine and beer and awesome weekly specials.ambiance was dark and cozy but the place was really loud for a conversation.great little gem in an unexpected spot.i think we were taken in about 15? i had tried to make a reservation earlier in the day but they only take them for parties of 6 or moretables are a little cramped but it&#39;s a very nice atmosphere, kind of romantic even.burger was seasoned well and very juice, but what stole the show were the reservoir fries - parmesan white truffle fries.nice bar in the neighborhood.the reservoir&#39;s beer list isn&#39;t the best, but it&#39;s pretty strong..my wife had the chicken club sandwich which was quite tasty and i got a burger with the added braised pork and it was fantastic.an ant wouldn&#39;t have been able to eat well with the dearth of remains on the plates after we finished eating.no type of refund or any other service offered for the wings not being cooked all the way through.a big turn-off..lamb burger delicious and side salad fresh..wow what a delicious surprise !! the calamari was perfect and soooo tasty as was the burratta --yum!!salmon on tomato risotto--the best i have ever had.nick the bartender is super friendly and helpful.this place was a great discovery.something noted in a previous review that i&#39;ve taken for granted is how clean the place is.rinsed down with one of their many selections of beers..this place was the bomb! chill/fancy atmosphere with amazing food and great service.if you are in the area and are hungry/thirsty, there is no other stop for you.that sounds snobby -- but she seriously wasn&#39;t that busy.when confronted, he was abrupt.i live across the street from this place and the lunch/dinner is good! nothing to write home about.we will  become regulars.waitstaff usually seems pretty bored, which they probably are.ordered the pork shoulder flatbread and it was just okay, not too much flavor.i&#39;m very excited that i just moved to the uptown area because i found this place very close to me! i have been there 3 times in the last week.they have a limited rotating menu and recently i&#39;ve seen they have risotto and shrimp.looks like they have a good brunch special so i&#39;d like to come back and enjoy the outdoor patio! the service was good too; our waitress seemed to come at the perfect times and would just leave us to ourselves to chill and talk.i do think we will come back!.without asking, the bartender changes the channel during the last 2:00 of the game.burger was filling as john said it would be and the fries were pretty good with the spicy ketchup dipping sauce.best place around here! food is fantastic and consistently wonderful.have been here many times and will continue to do so even after i move from the area.even though i loved the food, i don&#39;t think i&#39;ll be returning to this place.just saying.i ordered the pulled pork sandwich.i love this place.resivoir fries are to die for and the mac and cheese are among the best in the city.good food (not great, but very good) and a fantastic atmosphere/decor.it&#39;s a bar, pleasant but not fancy.it&#39;s a cross between a margarita (tequilla) and a cosmo (pink).food-twas good..ughh this is an essential condiment they need to figure outthe fish was definitely out  of a  box from a supermarket and cooked from frozen.there are a couple of large screens for sports events.the food selection on the other hand was lacking.a gorgeous pub in uptown..came here on a date for dinner and drinks on a friday night.huge kudos for the &#34;build your own omelette&#34;, lamb burger and pulled pork sandwich!the pesto chicken sandwich was good but could have used a little more pesto.it is out go to place.my fries were so salty they were almost inedible, and the burger patty was bland.yet my burger was fantastic and my gf&#39;s mac n cheese truly decadent."
meli-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/meli-cafe-chicago,1,"But i would highly recommend this dish as one to share, very unique.we were promptly seated as well as promptly waited on by a courteous waiter.in any event, try the caprese wrap!.this is the kind of place to take clients, friends or family.the cafe&#39; benedict (tomato, spinach, farmer&#39;s smoked bacon) and salmon benedict (house cured and perfectly sliced) were notables..the salmon benedict was very tasty.i had the spicy flamenco omelet and my son had pancakes.even the ketchup was from fresh, off the vine tomatoes...big fan of the down on the farm skillet..restaurant looks very well kept.great service, great ambiance, delicious food.definitely coming back!..pleasant breakfast and brunch location with indoor and street seating.the food was full of flavor and spicy.i&#39;m definitely coming back!everything absolutely was delicious!! ! ! ! ! !.great brunch menu!i ordered cafe eggs benedict and it was delicious..the gf and i didn&#39;t finish the one we were sharing.too much oil in their food..stopped in here on a day added to a work trip.the service is amazing and every single thing we ordered was delicious..the crepe was not as expected, we ordered the chocolate infused crepe with strawberry, it wasn&#39;t that good i would give it 5/10.they also have specials that are daily specific..their morning fare and service is lovely.plenty of choices for brunch including a wide selection of juices.i got the breakfast quesadilla which was filling and tasty.customers have options the decor, table cloths and nicely painted walls won&#39;t convince them to spend $20 for a cold omelet and bad service - get smart meli cafe or you will be closed soon!.the whipped butter is a wonderful touch as well.everything was really good, even something as simple as my eggs were just done perfectly.just far too expensive and the service might be the slowest i have ever experienced in my life.he really didn&#39;t like his fresh squeezed apple juice though..then they offered bread as a consolation yet the other tables all had bread from the beginning.chicago weather on this particular saturday was 5°f not including wind chill.very clean and a bit more upscale.i&#39;ve been here a couple of times and have never been disappointed!.the friend who was with me for lunch ordered one of their salads - the village salad - which was literally just a dish of tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions doused in a vinaigrette dressing and sprinkled with feta cheese.at 2:52 waitress forgot to put in our juice order and said the juice machine was cleaned and closed.the food came out quickly and was excellent.they don&#39;t have a wheelchair ramps.i would come back and i recommend this place.my girlfriends and i had a beautiful night out.worst brunch i have ever had.great breakfast!  the menu is a bit pricey, but it is probably because it is affiliated/attached to a hotel.it was slightly deceptive because the presentation gave me the impression that i might not be full, but that was not the case at all.service: so slowwwwww, but the servers are really nicefood: decent, nothing special compared to other brunch chains like yolk and bongo.there are places that might sell it for less, but i think for the location and the environment, it justifies the higher cost.living in miami, there are really no good chicken and waffles places.they also have the regular breakfast items, so don&#39;t take a hard pass if you are not in a trendy mood..this place was super crowded for labor day weekend.the waitress we had acted like she didn&#39;t want to be there and her service proved it."

all their aioli sauces that come with burgers and tacos are full of flavor.the creations coming out of the kitchen looked delicious and were also beautifully presented.the only reason i do not give them five stars was due to an additional charge of $1.also, byob is always a plus.very delicious.friendly service as well....i would come back for the burgers alone.can&#39;t wait to go back for dinner and brunch!.we took advantage of some specials they were having and, between the two of us, we had the t &amp; b mini burger, the spice mini burger, fries, t &amp; b taco, fish taco, chipotle steak taco, and pork belly taco.i&#39;m not a big burger fan but the minis are perfect!

naansense-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/naansense-chicago,2,"I&#39;ve been to the always good bombay wraps nearby and looking for something new i remembered my cousins&#39; suggestion of this place and i finally got a chance recently.i don&#39;t type in caps lock very often, so you know they&#39;re good.it&#39;s super quick, which makes this a great lunch option - especially when places around the area often have lines out the door and down the street because they aren&#39;t as quick.i appreciate that he cares a lot about the opinions of yelpers and is willing to go the extra mile to rectify a bad experience.it was warm and the perfect texture.i was glad to get there at 12:05 and just beat the rush - this place gets busy!  i liked also that they had infused water and self-serve cups while you wait in that line.the even better thing about naansense is that the meal won&#39;t leave you feeling soooo overly stuffed that you can&#39;t be a productive member of society afterwards! i had the chicken vindaloo rice bowl with everything on it and it came with the perfect sized piece of naan on the side.since this is a fast food place, it gets bonus points for offering really tasty meals.so much better places to try.this place is like indian style chipotle.any spot in the loop where i can get a decent meal for under $10 for lunch is a good win..yeah there&#39;s a couple other things on the menu, but that&#39;s the nuts and bolts of the business..we need more locations and food trucks all over the city.i wish i picked a spicier sauce, but i will next time.more of a takeout spot.).not enough food to fill up someone who is very hungry, which is one of the reasons chipotle is so popular.now i can&#39;t wait to try the actual location.bread, choice of protein, sauce, toppings and more sauce.there are just a few tables (i assume most grab and go) but also no line, which was nice.i don&#39;t consider myself to eat a lot or that i&#39;m being cheap..think an indian-style chipotle with a series of choices of bowl, sandwich, etc.that being said, i think naansense is great for a quick meal on the go when you&#39;re not feeling the other fast food restaurants in the area!.so much flair for being a sensible place..the interior design is tasteful, everything looks new.i got a paneer naanwich.servings are large and it&#39;s nice that you can customize.i write this review as i finish my meal.while i did enjoy the chutney, i thought it paired a bit weird with the vindaloo so i think i&#39;ll try the chef rec next time.tried it twice in last couple weeks.it tastes more like pita.at a worker&#39;s suggestion, i had the mixed savory tomato sauce mixed with the spiced coconut sauce; amazing! i can&#39;t wait to bring my kids here the next time we are in the city.this place used to be so good.i found it delicious and aptly priced.i went in with a group of 12, we were able to sit together by combining all the tables together.sauces were complete garbage.in fact they refused to take my order and told me to go to grubhub.i did not hear a single complaint from anyone who had the food, and heard far more compliments than typical after a luncheon.i&#39;ve read some negative reviews of the mango lassi but i love it.had the rice bowl with chicken and tikka sauce.delicious, healthy food! get the rice bowl with chicken or lamb - you get a free piece of naan with your order! and come before noon during the week to avoid the massive lunch crowd.but i&#39;d like to go back during the day to try it again, maybe with some sides and the mango lassi :)...of which, i put on tomatoes and cilantro.there is an indian influence, but with indian food being my favourite cuisine hands-down, i am aware of when influence overshadows authenticity.this place is awesome.seriously, so many options..i got the rice, chicken, curry sauce, and veggies.pros:tasty pitasgood saucesnot so goods:only get to pick one of each thing (kind of)sauce served on the sidepicking up your wrap will lead it to explode.naansense is absolutely amazing.a great concept for indian food.i had high hopes to dine here yesterday while i was visiting the loop with my wife.if you want indian food the fast version (like a fast food style) then this is your place.oh i love this place!!! i usually frequent this place during lunch time since it&#39;s so close to my work place and it is always packed during those hours!however, the service is quick and even with long lines, you&#39;re usually out of there with your food in 10 minutes.i think it was korma mixed with a little of the spicy sauce.so you walk in and pick a meat and add a curry.we decided on the chicken rice bowl &amp; pork naanwich."
disotto-enoteca-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/disotto-enoteca-chicago,2,"The food was really good (bruschetta, ravioli, and spaghetti).delish food and great atmospere.party of 6.whether you whisk the over-easy egg yolks with your fork, or just slice away with the knife, you will helplessly be taking one bite after another of this decadent antipasto.if you do choose to give it a try, be sure to call before you go, just to make sure the enoteca is available.some of the portions are much larger than you would expect for the price.the location is a little hard to find - it is below francesca&#39;s, which means there isn&#39;t much signage out front and you have to actually go through francesca&#39;s to get downstairs.i don&#39;t recommend francesca&#39;s itself if you are looking for a quiet setting..loved it!.highly recommended!.all and all we had a great time.the truffle egg toast is very delicious, i recommend it, i love anything with a runny egg on it..my date and i split the carpaccio di manzo (beef carpaccio), the pane con tartufati (toasted pullman + egg + fontina + asparagus + truffle oil) and the veal with polenta entree.they just tasted like cheese, which is probably why people liked them.in a hood where people go out to dinner 5-7 days a week ( there still is only 7 days in a week) people should know about this gem.this was a great spot to go although the plates are small, they are tasty.not overpowering with sweetness.i could see this as a nice starter location for date night too.dinner for one and its intimate enough to not feel awesome...will be back!.gnudi pomodoro- excellent, simple.i went here with my girlfriend based on the strong yelp reviews.the restaurant was very nice and cozy.went to rosebud instead who was more than happy to serve me when i walked in 5 minutes before close.for all you tourists out there, please visit this delicate place..it may have been because it was late, but their food menu was limited - but have no fear because everything was amazing..a separate door entrance can be found next to the hotel.this place is the reason we keep coming back.others stopped by and quickly left due to the lack of patrons, but they decided too hastily!once you step into this place, you feel as if you&#39;ve just walked into a grotto or an intimate cavern so it definitely has a romantic and rustic feel.i&#39;ve been there a couple times and love the atmosphere.we ordered two plates and loved them both.my wife and u both enjoyed the experience...it had the feeling of a true enotecca in italy!.there&#39;s no signage outside on the street.this italian restaurant has cozy warm feeling especially around the fall and winter season.bad start, but the food was beyond incredible so i had to give it 5 stars.after all, i&#39;m glad i got to try disotto - it gets solid 3.the portions are amazing, the taste unparalleled, and the ambiance my favorite.i came with a party of four, so i was pleasantly surprised that we found a table right away.location is a little hard to find the first time but keep at it because once your downstairs, it&#39;s well worth it.my vote for the most romantics &#39;bar&#39; in chicago.the beef carpaccio was overwhelmingly flavored (not a good thing in my book)...what a fabulous wine bar! tucked away in the basement we almost missed it but thanks to my husband&#39;s keen eye we were treated to some lovely wine, tasty meat and cheese board and relaxing music.i took some to go for my partner who was working in the hotel.there are plenty of wine bars in our fair town.i got a glass of red without paying too much attention to what it was (the side effect of being dead tired), but it had a nice, firm, complex taste to it that worked well with what we ordered - in particular, the seafood pasta, which was hearty, warm, and had a tomato-based sauce that was heavily infused with the taste of the ocean (or the lake?).the wine list is well varied and somewhat pricey.wow, wow, wow!!!! a picky new yorker can&#39;t complain!!! the ambiance, wait staff, food and drinks were all incredible.i went here, solo, early on a weeknight.although i know good wine doesn&#39;t necessary come cheap, it would be nice to have more inexpensive options as well..also, on a saturday night, we were able to walk in at 7 p.since it&#39;s tapas style i&#39;ve chosen: 1 piece mushroom and goat cheese bruschette, beet salad with ricotta, orange and mint and then the gnudi with butternut squash.very pleasant little wine bar with great food, although a limited menu.nicely-edited wines by the glass, amazing warm olives and snicky-snacks in a lounge-y, cave-like, romantic atmosphere.i love coming here when i&#39;m in chicago it&#39;s alway a must!  the menu is awesome and everything prepared to perfection.excellent food--flavorful and delicious.i went to therestaurant talking with the manager (alex?) saying that i am willing to pay forthe extra service.we make our way down the stares to find a cavernous, dimly lit room with a large wine rack lining the wall.if you&#39;re lucky enough to grab a table, you can order from both francesca&#39;s and disotto&#39;s menu!.actually, we might have found it since (later) one of my good friends stated he and his wife had their engagement party at disotto enoteca..it was empty when i went there but i&#39;d be be eager to to try the wine bar downstairs.perfect cozy, out of the way date spot.there was a big party there and it was difficult to hear but once they left, it got a lot better..don&#39;t leave without trying their desserts !! a must for everyone !."
nandos-peri-peri-chicago-18,https://www.yelp.com/biz/nandos-peri-peri-chicago-18,1,"Delicious.the staff was pretty unapologetic about that inconvenience and i was never informed that the normal 12 minute wait for carry out had doubled in length because of delays in the kitchen.we went 4 days after the opening of the store, and i have to say we came across the nicest employees ever! they checked on us at least 3 times in the 30 minutes we were there to ask if we need anything.i ordered a 1/4 chicken + 2 sides because i was worried that a 1/2 chicken would be too if for 1 person, but it&#39;s a small chicken so go ahead and get 1/2 chicken per person.peas were also a home run and the only bad part was the fries which were way way way to salty for me.great decor, great food.a bit underwhelming of an experience.great service and better tasting food.i will definitely return because i adore the food.they were all delicious!  the tights was moist and tasty! i love good tights that are prepared well.i wish we ordered more because my husband and i hardly got a word in shoving the delicious flavors down our throat.food : excellent..the locations near home have never been this busy.the portuguese rice was flavorless so skip it, i was curious to what it was and sorry i ordered it.everything else i wasn&#39;t blown away as i feel i should have been given the raving reviews.i&#39;m really not sure why but it took the person at the register over 5 minutes to take our order which was a half a chicken two sides and a drink, this should have been able to be rung in in about 30 seconds flat and yet they seemed so confused as to how to work the touch screen register.the chicken is juicy and packed with flavor from the marinade which reminds me of jerk chicken but then every dish is served with the signature and distinguished peri peri sauce! the portions are super hefty and you will find yourself taking home left overs! i ordered a salad and the best part about it was the chicken along with the savory pieces of queso fundido.i went with 1/4 chicken (hot) with peas, and my boyfriend got the chicken (hot) and chip meal.so there you have it.it&#39;s colorful and plenty of seating even when they are slammed.the food is fabulous and the staff is wonderful...i love hummus and fresh veggies so the hummus plate is great.weirdest of all, though, was that my chicken breast was very tough to cut and pretty dry..why have a hostess? why not have people just sit themselves?.first, when you enter, the hostess will give you a menu, and assign you to a table if you&#39;re dining in.never coming here again.she brought me a reciept for the cake.the service is also above average.awesome food.the chicken was delicious! we decided to taste the hot, extra hot and xtra, xtra hot.i love the food and the tastes and smells conjure up memories of my youth.i got the chicken breast wrap with fries and their special perinaise sauce.the garlic bread &amp; mashed potatoes are consistently great.unlike other reviewers i was not so crazy about the peas, but the mashed potatoes were outstanding.so maybe only visit once in awhile.it is grilled chicken and you get to choose you have it tossed in an underwhelming  array of different sauces.you have to be seated first and note your table number..the fries were good.ordered the chicken breast with mashed potatoes and rice.its the most amazing restaurant for grilled chicken that i have such fond memories of, from my visits to south africa and uk.loved the mashed potato and garlic bread! the sandwich was okay.come on.juicy tender chicken exceeded our expectations! perfect level of spicy.regardless, it tasted sooo good!.the portion could have been a tad bit bigger, but i definitely was satiated.the medium heat has enough kick to scare away someone who fears spice.nando&#39;s special chicken wings, and garlic bread as appetizers and on the other hand a handful of chicken burgers, veggie burgers, sandwiches etc.what&#39;s worse, the paper bag fell apart in 3 minutes, had to hold all the hot boxes myself.now i need a nando&#39;s peri-peri to open closer to my office.the chain stems from an african dish and started in south africa, now in chicago, not too expensive and good..we ordered a drink that they ran out of and they didn&#39;t even come back and inform us - we had to follow up! overall decent food if you want to try something new, but be prepared for slow service.we ordered a full platter with garlic bread and portuguese rice on the side.their unbelievable marinades range from just basic heat to unbearable heat for the average human.chicken dishes which is rotisserie style  were very tasty.definitely worth checking out, but consider doing so outside if the lunch hour rush.my boyfriend was feeling very nostalgic of his childhood in britain, so nando&#39;s was a huge priority, seeing as it is one out of 29 restaurants on the east coast.the fresh brewed iced tea completed a perfect, quick lunch, in the loop, all for only $13.even better you get to choose your heat level/sauce so everyone can be happy.one of worst customer service in a nando&#39;s restaurant.i typically get the chicken breast medium (medium has a really good kick) with 2 sides.aside from the food, the ambiance and decor give each nando&#39;s restaurant it&#39;s own unique personality.reasonably priced for one person and sure dishes are a decent price for the group for a casual meal..amazing food, really cool lightbulbs and metal structures over cashier counter, and the decor was so colorful.take a try and you won&#39;t regret!."
j-smile-51-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/j-smile-51-chicago-2,2,"I am craving it as i type this review.cute date spot with really yummy desserts.the honey toast is good.they make a killer latte and their deserts are to die for! hope they are sticking around for good.if you like taking pictures, this place is great, but don&#39;t expect to be wowed.the employees are helpful and knowledgeable..me and my friend got the key lime and chocolate caramel tarts, both were good though i liked the key lime one more.the sandwiches and panna cotta are pretty good.ordered vanilla latte to warm myself from the cold.1st time there.the chicken crepe was good - too bad you can&#39;t order it alone.though the desserts can be a bit pricey, it was still very good for most and same with their coffee specials.the dining area is cute and the staff is very welcoming.we came after a show at the icon on roosevelt on our way home.they have egg waffles (ji dan zai), which is a huge plus.we will be back soon for sure !.i&#39;m glad this place popped up in the neighborhood..the chicken breast was juicy and flavorful.the tortillas need to be doubled up, they&#39;re filled pretty good but fell apart after one bite.there was a lot of turkey in the sandwich, made it too salty, and not enough avocado..okay, the service and price isn&#39;t the best but the desserts look are awesome..this place has a great environment to study and chill...also, the ice cream was superb.:) they don&#39;t have waiters but will bring the food out to you and are very courteous.the ample selection of parking and a place that is not crowded on a sunday morning, what more is there to ask for? i had the caramel toast served with ice cream and banana and it was delicious.i haven&#39;t tried anything else yet.the only people who were waiting for their food was the couple.it&#39;s even more expensive than artopolis.tonight i got a salad, two macarons, and panna cotta.we went for the oreo egg waffle plus, the mixed berry smoothie, and iced tropical mix tea.so when this opened in the neighborhood, i couldn&#39;t help but check it out.i don&#39;t recommend the egg waffle.i tried a few different desserts including the bananas foster which was pretty good although very gelatinous.they were sweet but not overly so - in a way that doesn&#39;t make you feel guilty for eating them, and makes you want another! the total was a little over ten dollars, which i feel is comparable to any other coffee/pastry shop.they try new things and are still adding and changing things to the menu.the ice cream was good though.( he was on his iphone).i recommend it.got the vanilla ice cream, crushed macaroon, and mango sauce.came here with my sister-in-law, we both ordered turkey, avacado, &amp; tomatoes sandwiches with iced coffee and vanilla macaroons.the customer service and efficiency of service is lacking big time..they&#39;re new so still smoothing out their act.the salad was just lettuce leaves with cheese and a salad sauce.happy new bridgeport location with excellent desserts and dishes."

i would definitely go back.second time coming here and like everyone else i agree the food is delicious.there&#39;s no other thai restaurants in the midway area, and i like to support and patronize local businesses.love this place!  portions are big, so when you order there&#39;s definitely enough to share!  the food has very good flavor.as good as everything tasted, there was almost no meat in any of it.service is great even if you&#39;re only coming in for takeout! such friendly, inviting staff makes you want to come back over and over.it seems like a family place and had a fair amount of takeout business too.the food is decent but i have had better up north and for a better price.dine in option is cozy, or order out ahead of time.we kindly asked that they temporarily move the glass square sitting on top of the table so we could suspend the baby seat..go get a bank loan or checkout kabbage for capital so that you can get a decent sized location, appropriately decorated with ample parking..awesome thai food! especially  since there isn&#39;t many places to get thai on the south side.what a great lunch!!.the cucumber salad is amazing and refreshing you cannot go wrong stopping by here.1.frank is great and the food is delicious and quick.it&#39;s amazing..our first time ordering from here and definitely won&#39;t be the last.everything we ate was excellent and fresh first time here will be back a must eat place.super friendly! i prefer their pad kee mao  (sp?) because it&#39;s spicier than their pad thai.the owner is a very sweet man and everyone that works there is super friendly.this place makes you feel at home.in fact, i would not dine-in with more than 1 other person due to how tight seating can be and that is the only reason why this place loses a star.i was so exited i finally had convinced my husband to try it, so we came in today.i also had the beef pepper steak was excellent.i just ordered from here for the first time and the food came faster than any order i&#39;ve ever placed.best thai i&#39;ve had!!!! the place is small but the service is awesome.my son took us out to eat so we all agree let&#39;s try this place, with no regrets food was fresh the place was real clean.the prices were also very good for the amount and quality of food we got..they perfect the pot stickers like no other and there pineapple fried rice is bomb.i ordered a dish and asked for no onions or peppers and asked to get something else substituted for the meat and missing veggies was told &#34;no, we don&#39;t do that per the owner&#34;, then when i said &#34;ok&#34; it got better, i was then told my $10.this time i ordered pad thai (my fave) -- that was not my favorite.if you&#39;re into spicy thai food, you&#39;ll have to ask them to kick it up a notch.great thai food in midway area.best &#34;hole in the wall&#34; thai place that i have eaten at in a long time.dine in, it&#39;s too crowded and small for me, especially with kids..fresh, appetizing and amazing customer service! so many vegetarian options with the ability to customize.bree thai you have won my heart!!.the owner was super attentive and very friendly.my seaweed salad was really a cucumber salad with a little bit of seaweed sprinkled on top.this is not thai food.great customer service.first experience with thai food and it was delicious!  the waitress was extremely helpful and explained the different dishes and sauces to us.this place is very small but the food is delicious! the owner frank, was super nice and friendly and came out to make sure everything was good with our food.it tastes kinda like a asian milk tea drink but its actually a great tea drink.there is so much variety in there dishes that they offer.highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you are short on time.bree thai is the cutest.i will go back if for the great service alone.it has large glass noodles and broccoli chunks steamed to perfection.had it delivered and did not disappoint my craving for thai.i have only been here once, but i went a little over board and got enough food for dinner too and everything was awesome.onlyreason i&#39;m giving them a 3 is because the service was good.but if you just want quick delicious food at a great price this place is a 10.very small place but food presentation was great.vegetarian egg rolls are appetizer size but they give you three in n order and are light and so delicious! amazing! i would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the neighborhood ! yum.amazing!!i had their pad thai (beef) lunch special and it was great!!  it came with miso soup and a pot sticker, which was also great!! my son was still hungry as their lunch special was not quite enough for a growing 14 year old whom just finished playing two basketball games, so we ordered the crab rangoon and it was amazing!!!  my son absolutely loved their thai iced tea as well.."

bin-36-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bin-36-chicago-3,2,"We tried every dish on the menu and they were all delightful we had 4 bottles of wine all recommend by the owner and they were all exquisite.not exactly.5 stars, but that&#39;s not an option and i don&#39;t want their average to suffer.terrible!!!!  took my lady here for dinner on her birthday.the wine flights are great ways to try the product and i guarantee after trying, you will bring some bottles home with you.recommendations: blue bay mussels, bone marrow, house aged strip loin and roasted rohan duck, any cheese flight/charcuterie.i can&#39;t tell you what a nice gesture that was!  very classy of them.it was sweet, smoky, and spicy; in other words, perfection.&#34; maybe for a bird, guy, maybe for a bird! i explained that there are many other restaurants nearby, even chicago raw in the french market, with bigger and better salads at $10 each, instead of this joke for $12.we were especially fond of the rabbit pate &amp; duck.i know i&#39;ll come back again..we enjoyed our dinner outside and the atmosphere, wine, and food couldn&#39;t have been better...never had we had this type of service before- so incredible!!! sure enough, he brought out a new steak that was perfectly cooked.our server immediately asked us if we wanted anything else but water while the hostess was handing us the drink menu but when we were ready to order, she was too busy clearing other plates.i love the new and improved bin 36.we finished our meal with the raspberry beignets! not too shabby.they overcharged us for our dessert wine, but once i pointed it out they fixed it right away and without complaint.asking if this was our first time at bin36, we said yes he proceeded to lament over the fact that we were new and he had to explain everything to us.probably no.it&#39;s clean, and well executed.this was amazing the flavor profiles were perfect, the chicken was tender, the greens perfect, grits amazing,  the only negative is the consistency on the beans some were slightly under cooked but pretty much on the cusp.needless to say, we feel ripped off and taken advantage of...wine flights on wednesday are all $13 and there are quite a few to choose from.left undisturbed they would have been very unpleasant surprises for anyone sitting there, but our server, after we gave her a heads up, did the humane thing and moved one of them to the sidewalk (via a menu).not a good experience at all.somehow i was able to make enough room to have some desserts as well..however, i was craving salmon.mum had the amish chicken, i had the glazed pork chop, yep its juicy and tender and.the new bin 36 is a must try.bin 36 will continue to be my favorite place to enjoy delicious food and drinks any day of the week!!!.can&#39;t wait to come back here again the the hubby!.i went to bin 36 with several work colleagues for lunch on may 14th.even just an explanation by the server would have sufficed.still no.i was so afraid that the move from river north would temper our enthusiasm for this place but no - it&#39;s as delightful as ever, and we&#39;ve been there since bin&#39;s beginning.fried brussels sprouts were a good contrast, and how can you go wrong with pimiento cheese fritters?really lovely and attentive staff.the food takes some nice turns on traditional lunch/brunch orders: the chorizo burger was great.i was there on friday and sat by the bar.my so got the cauliflower steak, which she liked, but could have used a protein component for sure.was all great..first off, it was randomly difficult to find, and not a minute past my reservation time, i was getting texts from the restaurant asking if i still planned on coming in.everyone left happy and we were in and out in about 45 minutes.16 that).party of 9 and every one had a great time.the wine, cheese, and food were great.we ordered the ham prosciutto, artisan breads, the risotto, the amish chicken, and a cheese flight and shared everything..i was pleasantly surprised.we had a reservation for a party of 8 at 7:15pm last night (tuesday).which is so hip right now.have been to bin 36 twice now for brunch and have been overly blown away both times.enoch, the owner is incredible and the menu belongs in an art gallery!..the only problem was my fries were unbearably salty.i had a wonderful dining experience at bin 36.the menu has wine pairing suggestions listed with each dish which is helpful.great wine selection.bin 36 has proven, on a multitude of occasions, to go above and beyond to provide exceptional service and even better food.a good place to hang out with the big group of people.so relax, go enjoy brunch at an old favorite in a new location!.long enough bubbles list to get silly over, charcuterie platter features daring mustard and spreadable option.great selection of flights - red, white and bubbly.my friend, she had a german fruity wine which was number 24 or 25 on the menu, and it had like a awesome fruity after taste to it.this is the best brunch place in the city."
sweet-maple-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweet-maple-cafe-chicago,2,"Carmen g&#39;s scramble was great, and i was lucky enough to sneak a bite of my boyfriend&#39;s holiday french toast which was yummy as well.the biscuit itself was good, but it was so sweet, it tasted strange with the sausage gravy (which was also pretty tepid)..it was a nice day out and they had lawn chairs in front so you didn&#39;t have to stand and wait so it was a nice gesture.the scrambler comes with your choice of toast/biscuits, and fries/grits.having breakfast here reminds me of nashville.decor was shoddy.he said it taste like the inside of an incredible chicken pot pie.the potatoes were average, and honestly, the food is just that--a little average.good menu and just need a little bit more of taste to the food and coffee...the prices are reasonable and there&#39;s something on the menu for everyone- scrambles, omelettes, french toast, pancakes, biscuits, etc.on the hunt for biscuits and gravy, we ended up at sweet maple cafe.45.the biscuits r the world best, great balance.my bkfst was good &amp; hot which is a good thing some eggs come out cold..you have to get the cinnamon roll pancake, it&#39;s new and seems temporary (it&#39;s only on the chalk board) but i&#39;m hoping by some miracle of miracles it gets on the menu permanently.eggs were cooked perfectly too! overall, my experience was very pleasant.pancakes, eggs, meat, are good but the rest of the menu is a little bland.staff is always friendly and the service is stellar!.amazing food.it didn&#39;t take long (10 minutes wait) to get seated with big table for large group.cool neighborhood diner feel.the biscuits are the best i have ever had.it&#39;s so busy on weekend we have to wait at least for 25 minutes.you gotta try the monterey home fries.the husband had the that&#39;s italian country scramble which was eggs scrambled with red bell peppers, green bell peppers, romano and mozzarella cheese sided with plain grits and a cornmeal biscuit.i honestly can say that those were the best pancakes i&#39;ve ever tasted in my whole life.the coffee was good, always a plus, and for being in the north, the grits were good too.the  cup of hot chocolate will bring you back.we got the cinnamon roll pancake which was amazing, sweet maple special (sausage was dry) and chicken liver and onions special.the ambience was great, it had this retro look to it which gave it a lot of character.the cheese grits was just ok, but maybe i just don&#39;t like grits..with options like square and clover, there is no need for a system where you need to tip before swiping, can&#39;t split checks and other limitations.our total including tip was $32..the cinnamon bun pancakes that my friend ordered were like a dream.sunday is brunch day and i happen to come across sweet maple cafe on taylor st! great cozy brunch spot on taylor in little italy.i ordered the corn beef hash, eggs over easy, and (to my surprise) one really huge biscuit..just wish i could make a reservation even when my party is less than 6.will not be back.i am happy to have gone to experience it, but i don&#39;t think i will be going back.i wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s the main dishes that make sweet maple cafe good.we turned over the table after seeing the long line, and it was a lovely breakfast before our flight out of chicago!.try them!!!  you&#39;re welcome in advance.solid brunch spot on taylor street..get there before 9 to avoid the line.if you come on the weekend, be warned that there will most certainly be a wait.she was very rude and when i asked for clarification she rolled her eyes and smaked her teeth.they are unbelievably good.refills were on point.the menu here is simple and delicious-everything really tastes homemade and after an egg n cheeser ( sweet bscuit egg sandwhich), homemade applesauce, an order of apple spice pancakes with real maple syrup, ham cut off the bone, and unlimited quality coffee, my friend and i were very satisfied! the atmosphere is very warm and this place doesn&#39;t need breakfast food gimmicks to shine!.i came here with a group of people after getting off work to have breakfast.the waitress said no.nice little place, decent food.very rich, you can order one.just delicious.my girl got the egg and cheese sandwich which she said was good and filling.the cheese grits were lumpy and not tasty, they forgot the warm maple syrup so by the time they got it the pancake was cold, and the eggs and turkey sausage were just ok.the portion size was big, but not huge to where i couldn&#39;t finish it.homemade biscuits."
acadia-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/acadia-chicago,1,"Acadia is not to be missed.he was also talkative and friendly, which was a great experience.there were very few misses.everything was delicious yet conservative.this is primarily a review of the &#34;bar area&#34;they open for dinner at 5.i have convinced my friends and will be going back soon..i am not impressed with this restaurant.i highly recommend this spot.all of the food was good, but the lobster in bone broth and the cucumber sorbet dessert were stand-outs.i was not too pleased with my portion of oyster coated in granola, since portions of the coating was too difficult to eat; i almost had to gnaw away at the outer layer to get to the oyster.as many folks have mentioned, there are some additional bites throughout the meal too.i have to say i was pleasantly surprised at the quality and creativity here.i been going to acadia for a last 2 years.and i came here the day before thanksgiving to celebrate a small career success for kenny, and while the food was delicious, the service was kind of laughable.you can easily spend a decent chunk of cash, especially if you order a couple of things, but the staff is nice and the minimalist interior really makes for a swanky meal out in the south loop.the whole thing rivals the best cold lobster salad rolls in massachusetts (its not a connecticut-style roll so i won&#39;t even go there).you will not regret it! so lucky to have this place in my neighborhood!.they certainly try to impress by providing a few amuse-bouche throughout the meal including when you leave..acadia was offering small crispy biscuits.i have been going here since it opened.we honestly didn&#39;t think we would be very full after small plates coming at us, but boy were we wrong! with all the appetizers, in between courses and desserts, we were stuffed silly!! a 10 course meal was easily more than that!service was also supremely top notch! they took such good care of us and were very attentive when we were finished with our plates.really, truly, amazing..from the time you walk in the door until you walk out they make you feel special.i apologize for the 3 star review but the food was good, however the service was very spotty and it seemed they were short staffed for the night.i&#39;ll have to make it back for dinner sometime soon.basically, no sharing.i am really happy that they got upgraded to 2 michelin stars as they truly deserve it.i would assume that it would be relatively busy.my husband and i went for our 1st wedding anniversary dinner a few months ago.probably wouldn&#39;t go back.the standard looking conteporary american restaurant.while i love dinners at acadia, don&#39;t miss it for brunch.&#34;  every course featured tiny portions of small things.had the 5 course tasting menu.i heard alot of great things about the lobster roll and drinks at acadia.his answer was it is something like that.- food - inventive and creative.i was a bit disappointed we couldn&#39;t order a couple of the bar snacks to the table once we were seated but it wasn&#39;t the end of the world..they staff was very courteous and took care of us very good.five stars on the service, but i was pretty disappointed with the food.however, i&#39;m glad i tried it but i know what i like and i&#39;m very picky about it.went for the chefs tasting sans the foie gras which i may or may not regret learning afterwards from someone that it tasted like a reese&#39;s peanutbutter cup.the four course meal was spectacular, memorable, and worth the cash.my wife and i tried the acadia burger, the pork belly bahn mi, and dessert tasting menu.the presentation was beautiful, but i discovered that the best way to eat it was to mix it all up and cut the bananas and foie gras into little pieces.the waiters explained each of the courses as they brought them out and helped us with recommendations when we were ordering.i would love to give it 5 stars for the food but not for everything else.i had the flu shot which was smoky and delicious.the chef is clearly very talented.we tried the tasting menu , delicious !!!!! full of flavors , lots of seafood , would tried to eat more but was so full.2 cocktail i highly recommend, tiger tonic* i think that was the name, which has tonic ice cubes, it was a bit on the sweet side.house made pasta filled with pheasant.the atmosphere is modern with excellent music and not at all stuffy as some tasting menu restaurants can be.pretty sad.i recommend the tasting menu.#iamnotasommelier5.a few weeks ago, i made a short weekend trip to chicago, where we were lucky enough to score reservations for acadia, which not only received two michelin stars, james beard recognition, and numerous distinction, but also has a reputation for delicious yet unpretentious fare presented in a welcoming, non-stuffy setting.plus they served it in the shells but those shells were placed in this planter filled with sticks and pebbles.i only hope that having a full house is not something acadia does purposely (as it clearly compromises the experience for patrons), but that&#39;s just my opinion.we had a party of six and the service was very accommodating and timely.if you like cream, butter and not a lot of creativity this is the place for you.loved the extra touch with customized print menu on the way out!.you will be pleasantly surprised, it tastes absolutely delicious.if you do not want confusion, do not have confusing ass policies.-they went above and beyond with making us feel special on our anniversary...the wine pairing was another highlight but food was not! a few of the dishes in the 10 course meal were good, but nothing was outstanding.we we&#39;re told acadia is an homage to the place in maine where the chef spent his summers.you&#39;ll enjoy the food."
el-milagro-tortilla-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-milagro-tortilla-chicago-2,1,"This is a must try!.place is awesome..i&#39;m coming again!.the short cafeteria line makes me feel like i&#39;m back in high school, but the food is much better.bomb tacos.this is saying something!!each taco is $3.the only reason this review is not 5 stars is that today i wanted to switch it up and try something new so i ordered a torta...also loved, loved, loved the slaw that seemed to come with or on everything.they run out of certain tamales by the end of the day sometimes, but i only have myself to blame because i didn&#39;t make el milagro the priority it should be.i come for the tamales--the chicken in the green sauce to be exact.the best! tacos are huge, i usually only eat 1.everything looked great in the &#34;cafeteria like line window&#34;, but i made a panic order and got a carne asada torta, i would say not the best i ever had, but a-ok.he recommended the steak tacos and it was delicious! it&#39;s family friendly, quick, and clean.i will be back here as it is great value and solid quality food.they were a hit at the work event...the tables were not clean, they charge you for extra tortillas even though they have the factory right next door.delicious food at this amazing little restaurant.1at time coming for breakfast but i guess n i&#39;ll settle mcdonald&#39;s.i would compare their steaks with the cheapest cuts from ronnies steak house.the tacos are enormous, and really, you should order about half of what you think you need because it is easy to get too much--although last time we were there we just took home a dozen tamales--why not, they are so delicious.in my opinion, these are the best asada tacos in the city..i&#39;m sure others have mentioned this too, but be very careful when ordering tacos.large portions, cheap, very flavorful.dear lord, what a nightmare just trying to get a plate of average food.it was a massive fried pepper - bigger than the size of the corn tortilla itself.it&#39;s not fancy or anything but its good for what it is and i can&#39;t complain about that.the tortas were a bit on their dry side but all their meats and other &#39;wet&#39; dishes that they have on trays are always a hit.now, if you&#39;d like some tortillas to take with, you can go next door and buy the dough to make them, or the package already made (flour or corn).the mole taco had a bone-in chicken leg sitting in a delicious mole sauce on top of a pair of tortillas.it was watered down and had way too much cinnamon..i walked into something totally unexpected.perfect atmosphere.great price.it tasted like the meat my dad would grill growing up.we walked into el milagro randomly and were very impressed! the portions are huge, the ambiance is very authentic, and the food was very delicious --and very affordable.i would bike by here in the morning and smell the fresh tortillas.cant beat the price for lunch, great food.piece of shyte restaurant.with its generous portions and an attentiveness to quick service, there is very little to complain about., nachos, quesadillas, fajitas, the like), you ended up getting a bag of el milagro&#39;s finest chips, corn tortillas, or flour tortillas.el milagro works basically cafeteria-style here: order at the counter, see your food being prepped, grab a number and a table, done.i just feel like they take for granted the good reviews they had.i would pass on the chiles rellenos and quesadillas because they are made with american cheese and are too greasy.to start with, you really need to know how the process works to order and get what you want here..i would highly recommend the busters plate.i visit el milagros at least 3 times a month.it&#39;s a hole piece of steak wrapped in a corn she&#39;ll of goodness.extremely inexpensive.(hmmm.come here if you want excellent tacos!.the tongue tacos are also amazing.the food is fine, it&#39;s just not awesome.no idea what they put on the top, some sort of cabbage mix, but it&#39;s really really tasty! highly recommend this place as its my go to when i&#39;m in the area!.the only down fall is the they don&#39;t have cilantro and onions for their steak tacos.years actually.first the tacos.there is a nice selection of things to choose from but everything i&#39;ve had here, lengua stew, tortas, tacos just don&#39;t have any flavor and the portions are either too much or not enough..yum!.been going there since in-utero! consistently awesome food."
antique-taco-chicago-7,https://www.yelp.com/biz/antique-taco-chicago-7,1,"Very rich and tasty.some other things that disspoints about this place is everytime i have a taco it&#39;s cold...i&#39;ve been to their north side location and preferred the atmosphere and set up there.fish and shrimp tacos are a must!!.other establishments are open but this is too early,especially on a beautiful summer night.the woman taking orders at the counter was cold, bordering on rude.lived up to all the hype.service was meh.i&#39;m really glad they&#39;re in the neighborhood, and i&#39;ll probably be back - the drinks were great, and pretty cheap compared to the competition ($8 for a craft cocktail isn&#39;t bad) but the tacos were just ok and too expensive ($7 for 2).so happy to see another at location.the drinks are refreshing, especially the house margaritas.i came here with some friends for dinner on opening week and the line was long, as expected.if you are looking for your typical mexican taco served with bland rice and beans than do not come here.i normally love horchata but i couldn&#39;t even finish this it just tasted like chalk and was incredibly small for the $5 price tag.team is friendly, young and local.delicious, beautiful food.july 6th, 2016:so i was going to stop by the antique taco that opened today.everything is super fresh! i wish we had this place close to home, i would eat here all the time.i ordered the shrimp and my husband ordered the pork carnitas.we also had the chili cheese curds and they were delicious.for appetizers the chili cheese curds are a must try.fish taco issue was excusable..the only thing i wish you could do is order tacos separately..the pork carnitas tasted like pork in bbq sauce on a tortilla..antique taco goes for quality over quantity for your price, which is what you should expect.won&#39;t be back.the tacos are yummy (a little salty but still enjoyable) and the atmosphere is great.it comes out fairly quickly, seasoned greatly, and perfectly portioned..could also be because i ate this after the amazing fish taco, so nothing could really compare."
leña-brava-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/le%C3%B1a-brava-chicago-2,2,"Very intimate spot best for dates.the crisps were light and delicious.we&#39;ve been burned out by the chicago dining scene for the last year as it seemed like most new spots were churning out the same dishes with a different spin.like i said, he tells it better.love the ambiance and the staff is sooo well trained :) they give wonderful suggestions and are so knowledgable of all the ingredients.went to another bar near by so we didn&#39;t just uber home sad faced.i can&#39;t remember the last meal i&#39;ve loved as much as this one.both visits have afforded unequivocal, amazing service.very friendly staff upstairs at the brewpub.for dessert, we ordered the tres leches.highly recommend sitting downstairs near the open kitchen by the way..the presentations were much more rustic than i expected.service was basic.their green sauce served with the oysters was ahhh-mazing.i loved the combination of flavors from the soft and sweet apples, smoky sauce, and cold ice cream.everything was delicious! we had a total of 13 dishes (6 appetizers, 5 main dishes, 2 desserts) and i couldn&#39;t really say anything bad about any of the food.will be back soon!.live nearby, thought we&#39;d grab dinner before a late-evening party.great food, lively atmosphere.the staff were knowledgable, the service was beyond attentive and the beers and cocktails were delicious..i have to say, just when you think rick bayless has hit the ceiling with his collection of great eateries, along comes lena brava to once again, knock your socks off.the opah was alright.we&#39;re only here for cocktails tonight (we ordered the monteromero &amp; the last pina) which were outstanding..the shrimp and pork meatballs (shrimp albondigas) are a must try.i&#39;m not really sure what i was expecting from a food/flavor standpoint but i was definitely expecting a more relaxed and less interrupted experience.we also ordered the shrimp albondigas and the caldo de piedra (scallops in a corn broth with squash and pea shoots)..so good.for the price, it&#39;s ridiculous! service was meh.i love how clean and simple the presentations were.sat in upstairs dining room by the bar.5 because 4 doesn&#39;t do it any justice.everything else is awesome too, the portions are relatively small, but delicious.you can smell the fire as soon as you walk in which really makes for a nice atmosphere, the tables somehow seem to feel cramped but an observation not a criticism but kept feeling very close to the other tables.ok, guys this was our first time here.fresh fish, perfectly executed dishes, and tons of choices from a part of mexico that quite honestly is not well represented in restaurant land.pineapple dish and tomahawk steak dish was amazing!!!! best rick bayless restaurant in my opinion.the classic preparations along with the inventive take on other dishes left you wondering why no one else is offering this on the level we experienced.came here for my birthday and it was the highlight of my whole day! i mean i love rick bayles and all his restaurants/food but this place is pretty amazing.try to get malcolm as your server, he knowledgeable and efficient.everything was flavorful and well marinated.cruz blanca old fashioned made with templeton rye whiskey was a great choice as well.we weren&#39;t starving so we got the roasted chicken, scallops and roasted plantains.great service, too!the clasico was everyone&#39;s least favorite dish at the table (none of us ate it after a tiny bite)we also tried:verde cevichegill-roasted pineapple with goat cheese (probably my favorite)avocado, jicama, grapefruit dish (a second favorite)black codcauliflower mash (amazing)butter-roasted plantains (also amazing).very well thought out.drinks were good as well.very simple and clean entrees, that are well executed really sum this place up.our first time here and just like other rick bayless upscale restaurants, this place offers another top notch mexican infused food selections.the romaine salad was wilted, and if that&#39;s the style, none of us liked the style.all in all a great evening.we were looking forward to the visit and they did not disappoint.i believe it is only available at lena brava and it is delicious.the waitstaff was amazing and didn&#39;t rush us through dinner.only waited about 1..i would recommend this place as a fun adventure.i would come back for those items.our dinner began with christian (from mexico city) explaining things on the menu, though we went in with a pretty good idea of what we were going to eat..hands down best restaurant in chicago right now.from spanish language instruction on your way upstairs.we were directed to the upstairs bar because our table wasn&#39;t ready and the bartender was in the weeds.right from the cocktails till desserts everything was amazing.the sea bass was probably the best piece of fish i ever had - we ordered it a la talla, which was just the right amount of spice.one of these will get you feeling good.the bartender needs time to clear up the other clients waiting for drinks--(whatever that means..the cauliflower steak is delightful..the water stopped being refilled, the finished dishes sat at our table for over 15 minutes, and we clearly were done (knives and forks crossed on the plates with the empty entree dish in front of us).the service was amazing.so these are all small dishes so you may need to order 3 entrees for your dinner if there are two of you.rounding up from 3.we will be back!."
mott-st-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mott-st-chicago-2,2,"Very unique flavor combinations and a good variety of small, medium and large plates.they&#39;re a little smaller, but two people could easily split 3 dishes for enough food.it reminded me off a traditional laos dish we have made with fish..amazing amazing amazing! the best for me was the wings i will come again every one that worked here was so cool and nice i will come back for sure..she kept describing the food and ingredients, but her accent was so thick and the room was very noisy.definitely worth going back to in the future.make a reservation if you can.my husband really liked it though.the bright spots: stuffed cabbage = layers of pork, kimchi and rice, baked so it&#39;s crispy on top.i definitely will be back to try more things on the menu!ambiance: very chill laid back feel.so the food between 2 people this was plenty of food, i was so full after.the brussell sprouts.brunch with a friend who is celiac (actually, not just &#34;gluten-free&#34;).friendly and helpful staff added to the stellar evening (thanks, kady!).just yum.having 2 yrs of server/hostess experience and 6+ yrs of retail mgmt/customer service, i am a bit disppointed that service was a little hurried..texture was excellent with lamb pancetta.they did a fantastic job with their menu.loved cozy atmosphere and nice + cute staffs.i wished that there had been more wines by the glass offered but the two i chose were very good.over priced much? it came with rice and plantain to eat with leaves.is a jewel in whicker.very attentive, friendly and helpful.that was pretty memorable.i thought the kimchi flavors could have been stronger to balance out the rich butter, and i really wasn&#39;t a fan of the pork butt, which had a strong and somewhat unpleasant meaty flavor.the menu is on point!  we went here the day we got engaged.do not miss this gem!.the udon remains my favorite dish.stuffed cabbage, i liked it but not as much as my friend spoke of it and how it is a house recommendation.we started out with ~15 minute wait (with a reservation), which was not a big deal for us, but not a good first showing.every time..there were only a few items to choose from, but my friends loved their food.came here for dinner with a friend recently.everything was flavored well and the congee had some interesting flavors since it was thai inspired i believe..the chimichurri creme-fraiche was a nice addition.the soft boiled egg was a delicious addition.i was super happy with our date night out and would return here any given night for a great.the service is a little overly structured -- the restaurant was half-empty, but they made us wait until everybody was present before sitting down; they made us order all of our food at the same time, which is hard when you are sharing dishes among six people and don&#39;t know 1, what will be good, or 2, exactly how much to order.we sat inside, but the patio looked adorable.here&#39;s what you need to know: overpriced, mediocre food.we were 3 people, we spent $50 each, and we left very hangry.at the end, i was asked which item was my favorite and honestly, i couldn&#39;t think of one.the burger is worth getting, but overall the food is not worth the price point.i am looking forward to my next trip in chicago to visit this place again!.will definitely be going here again.amazing food.i can&#39;t wait to come back post pregnancy to try it out.it is definitely not an everyday eggs benedict you&#39;ve had at a boring brunch place; the addition of asian flavor definitely made this dish quite fun.food were just ok and overprice！the chicken wing was good, the empanadas were so bland.so - there&#39;s a thing called bias.the watermelon flavor was lost in all the different types of booze.the bartender was a definite highlight with creative drinks and an obvious passion and expertise.oh, god, and the wok-smoked gailan.i have been here several times for drinks at the bar.our server took the time to help us navigate the menu and gave us an idea of portion sizes and how much to order, especially since many of the dishes run on the smaller portion size.i arrived a little early, so i just hung out by the bar at first.thank god we went! it was super tasty.i probably wouldn&#39;t have ordered them myself, but i thoroughly enjoyed the few bites i had.we tried:everything wings (5/5) - modeled after the &#34;everything&#34; bagel, these wings were topped with soy, cane sugar, chilies, fried shallots and a healthy portion of sesame seeds.ok, cool, no big deal..this place was pretty crowded but the service was still great and the employees were super friendly and accommodating for us.with 10 or so different dishes, they came out to the table in groups, and we really felt rushed (and weren&#39;t exactly huge fans of the required tetris game to ensure all the plates could fit on our table).the mushrooms with the bread are my favorite and there is no place that makes wings like they do.make sure to get a reservation.the pork jowl was a really unique dish, blending familiar chinese flavors with bright pineapple and crunchy sweet potato &#34;noodles&#34;.i chose the belgium ipa.ordered the wings, cauliflower, dumplings, empanadas and short ribs and it was perhaps one dish too many but we finished it all anyway.they should also be willing to slightly bend the rules knowing we were about to have a hefty tab with 6 adults ordering dinner and drinks.they brought out a candle for the birthday song which we loved."
the-publican-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-publican-chicago,2,"So if anything, thanks publican for the take-away.also, if you come with another person, they&#39;re going to sit you face each other, not next to.the best brunch i&#39;ve ever had! the food was out of this world! i also had the bloody mary which was spicy and strong.now we were annoyed.delicious cheese, lots and lots of meat, and cool decor make the publican a great place to grab drinks, snacks, or dinner with friends and family.the mexican chocolate and strawberries were amazing, and the toast was very thick but still fluffy..every bite had a great mix of egg, grilled bread and panchetta along with whatever sauce was on it.quick service and nice seating outside which was quiet.fyi a few tips before you go - the google maps directions do not bring you to the right address, it brings you over to the publican market across the street.chewing them quickly released more flavors..our first true meal in chicago was at the publican and what a way to set the bar....definitely my favorite of the meal.matriarch &#34;we&#39;re familiar with your menu, but i was wondering if i could get a steak or a burger.a meat-eaters paradise.they bring a sticky bun.they brought us something like 9 courses.can&#39;t wait to see what&#39;s on the menu during my next visit to the windy city!.i enjoyed the texture of the heart over the bread!squid ink pasta -- we were disappointed with the portion size and the flavor.the communal tables didn&#39;t bother me, but we got placed at a table adjacent to the bar which was just really inconvenient - i was in the foot traffic of all the servers and bartenders which was really inconvenient.started out with a full portion of the bouchot mussels.make sure to let it sit for 4 minutes.probably serves the best meat dishes, especially chicken holy moly.the outer seating is booth seating enclosed by swinging doors.haha.they managed to get it super crispy even with it being underneath the sauce, so i think that&#39;s part of the reason i enjoyed it so much.bathrooms here are interesting, there&#39;s a vestibule that opens up to multiple dual gender stalls and in the middle there are communal sinks.amazing food and drinks.i love the publican.amazing brunch! no wonder it&#39;s on the top 10 zagat list of best brunches in chicago! the publican really isnphenomenal.luckily, we got a table right away! we were seated outside which was nice because it wasn&#39;t as loud as inside.good food, and good service.we all agreed the 2 veggies we tried, the brussel sprouts &amp; the cauliflower, were some of the best veggies we&#39;ve ever had.overall, none of the dishes were terrible, but none were memorable enough for me to rave about to other people either.just dreadful, if you&#39;ve ever actually had suckling pig.fun!the food was alright, but nothing memorable.the steak was tough, chewy and not tender.the restaurant set up is super cute, and i love the booths that they sat is in for breakfast.still cooking in portland.we ordered the chefs selection oysters, the spicy pork rinds, the striped bass, dry aged new york steak, fried quail and the half charcuterie plate.i&#39;ve come here for both brunch and dinner.if you don&#39;t live in chicago and ever visit there, you should probably make this one of your stops..do not miss out on this place whether you live in, or are visiting, chicago!.the food is decent, nothing too special in particular and i&#39;d say over priced.my only complaint was the communal table we sat at.overall: cool place to check out in fulton market with minimal veggie options.i really wish i could have sat closer to the kitchen, but all other seats were taken..great old country communal eating.loved the decor and the lamps on the inside.seriously, who doesn&#39;t love the publican?!? it&#39;s farm to table, some community style tables and some booths.make a reservation if you&#39;re dining during peak hours.my boyfriend had the schnitzel and i had the sirloin..the chicken pate was also super delicious as it had pickled shallots hidden inside the pate as a surprise.cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.everything we ended up having was delicious.they make the menu up everyday so this review will probably be obsolete soon.seating: we made reservations so we were seated immediately.want to come back for dinner!.my publican mimosa tastes a lot like a blue moon, which was cool, but the coffee.just what i look for in sunday brunch drinks!definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great sunday brunch, just be sure to make reservations in advance, as it fills up quickly.overall i was very satisfied with the experience.trust me- even though it might have looked ordinary, it has flavor and warmth to hit the spot on a very cold sunday morning!i paired that dish with their burton&#39;s maple syrup-braised publican bacon, and that took that meal to a whole new level.the mimosa was okay.also disappointing were the other bread sides - the butter tasted like when you&#39;d get at the grocery store, and the date and mint spread mostly just tasted like tomato sauce."
ground-control-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ground-control-chicago,1,"The item i liked the least was the curry fritters - there wasn&#39;t much taste to it or anything special about it - didn&#39;t really seem like &#34;fritters&#34;.only gave four stars rather than five because of the service.big thumbs up!.the mushrooms actually kind of reminded me of fried oysters, minus the ocean taste.split the avocado orange salad, fried green tomatoes, and jibaritos sandwich.yo..my fiance had the veggie jibarito, and they hit that sucka outa the park.i ordered the baja tacos and hubby ordered their famous beet burger with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy.the curry fritters are delicious.nothing special, beet burger was okay had this weird flavor (not beet).the fritters were out of this world..yes, the one of dennis hopper with the gas mask on as he&#39;s grabbing her hair.the jibarito was amazing! the seitan was succulent and thin.-side of spicy mac n&#39; cheese: big portion! it is spicy, so fair warning.we had the cheesy italian, southern fried tofu, and smokin&#39; hot mac n cheese, all were amazing.you&#39;ll also want to get the mac and cheese, it&#39;s a good home style mac and cheese.the fries were tasty but we usually prefer sweet potato fries.i had a dish that i believe was a southern fried tofu (?) that was amazing!!  it was filling and absolutely delicious.zerooooo.parking is limited, which is to be expected because it&#39;s in a major city.yum! my husband does not normally like vegetarian entrees &#34;disguised&#34; as meat, but he loves this place! our favorites are the buffalo tofu wings, the jibarito and the asian bbq sandwiches.i have finally accepted that i am lactose intolerant and that gluten does me no good.ground control will now be our go to spot for sammie&#39;s and brunch.it is made with seitan and topped with relish.everything that&#39;s vegan is labeled.overall, i would visit ground control again, definitely a good choice for vegetarian, vegan and gluten free dining options..underwhelming overall.they also have an excellent cocktail menu..i live around the corner and love this place!  everything is wonderful!  my favorite right now is the po boy and mashed potatoes.best food on my recent trip to chicago (and for a food town, that&#39;s saying something).one of the best *if not best* vegan/veg options around! love their wings and beer selection..i can&#39;t wait to go back.hopefully the staff was just having a bad night and it will be better next time.totally going to be a regular here..really, really, really, really good.it took about 45 minutes from when we arrived to get our food..the accompanying cilantro mint chutney was delish.some of the best vegetarian food in the city..i wish i ordered three entrees of this..very tasty.however, i thought it was too loud in the restaurant to the point i couldnt hear ppl on my table.nice work.so you can get tofu buffalo wings (quite nice), a vegan cheese steak, etc.i had the sweet potato hash for brunch it was really good &amp; simple full review on my website!!bit.we got there rather early for sat night dinner, 5pm-ish i think, before the crowd started pouring in.the food here is great but be sure to make a reservation, especially on friday and weekeneds.i never have any critiques about chocolate, so i thoroughly enjoyed that..service is friendly but can be very slow in busy times.they had a great flavor and nice texture..they also have blue sky sodas, which are very good.the asian bbq sandwich was extremely flavorful and rich.jibaritos, where have you been all my life? and why, as a puerto rican, have i never heard of these amazing sandwiches before? the answer to both those questions is that i live in az, and jibaritos are a chicago delicacy.it&#39;s not a place for the health-oriented vegan or vegetarian since so much of the menu is deep fried and salty.i got the beet burger, and added avocado.not to mention the prices are very reasonable.i wish they opened up earlier in the day so i could go for lunch and breakfast too."
south-branch-tavern-grille-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/south-branch-tavern-grille-chicago-2,1,"I pride myself on being a connoisseur of tequila and when i asked for a patron margarita, the waitress said we don&#39;t serve patron, which is my favorite.one at the front inside, back inside, and one outside.wine glass had old imprint of lipstick, but besides that i ordered the salmon, which was perfectly cooked and moist.they&#39;ve got a nice setup that is understandably packed given their prime location.great location, great atmosphere, great food and drinks, friendly service.i ordered a salad and it took half an hour to prepare, then requested a box since i had to leave (due to not having time to eat) and that took another 15 minutes.it&#39;s busy and people are in and out.great food and drinks! the place has a good ambiance with great views.salmon and mahi mahi were amazing!  service was great as well.i had dinner and drinks here recently with a few friends for a happy hour event.the food menu on the other hand is limited and not very creative.it&#39;s pretty crowded here and so reservations for tables are encouraged.they have a really simple yet delicious menu.we always love djing and working with south branch tavern &amp; grill.i had the french dip sandwich, really good but the tater tots took it over the top for me!.unfortunately, i can&#39;t comment on the food.will not return unless i&#39;m sitting outside.it was busy, as expected on a friday afternoon, and the service did not suffer because of that.he gobbled up the tater tots, and also a bowl of tortilla soup that looked good too.we did it once before and the experience was decent..great layout as well.the salad is about $17 so...been back a couple more times (again, location location location) - drinks are not too sweet (spa, sinners &amp; saints, french 100, london mule) and decently mixed -  not aviary perfect of course but much better than a well g&amp;t at a dive bar.good working crowd for lunch and happy hour.after closing out my tab, my friends and i went to grab our coats, and mine was no longer hanging on the rack.wonderful atmosphere, fantastic food, and river view.nice space on the river with tons of windows so you actually get some natural light.their salads are really tasty, but today i treated myself to the bacon and swiss cheeseburger piled high with avocado and served on a pretzel bun with tater tots on the side.it just an average restaurant..it was pretty good, but the beets were a little overpowering for me.my friend said that she liked the buffalo chicken wrap..establishment is a bit pricey so wouldn&#39;t be a regular stop for me but it was good..after a long day at work, the manager, tim, could see that i was bummed and immediately went to the kitchen to see what they could whip up.delicious salad, friendly staff, generous portions and no tv&#39;s.knew their beers, wines, and bourbons.their array of beers, great sweet potatoe fries and fish tacos are amazing.i ordered one of the weekly specials: smoked brisket grilled cheese, which came with this sweet potato &#34;soup&#34; that was supposed to be used as a dipping sauce.as many reviewers have stated, you need not arrive without reservations at 12:30 for lunch without the willingness to find a seat at the bar.also, cheese curds should get their own emoji..my only gripe is not with the food or service, but the fact that they block reservations on opentable from 11:30am to 1pm so you have to call for a reservation (grrr).when i left 3/4 of my burger still on the plate i think my co-workers almost had heart attacks since i always eat everything.they were very accommodating when hosting myself and coworkers for events.i give credit to restaurants and security for cutting people off, but it wasn&#39;t appropriate this time and there were visibly more drunk people than us.i so needed a splash of vodka in my kid drink.."
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,1,"They had our table ready for a while but did not seat us because they said they needed menus, which was a little odd.instead i got the piggy moo sandwich, which is aptly named with its two types of pork..the scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked, soft, moist, eggy.lemon pancakes were amazing.we had a large group and we were seated at the front table near the host stand.not your average/ standard fare.probably due to the high volume of people.will definitely go back.the jam on the toast.the omelette was large and it also came with potatoes and toast which where also good.i am glad this restaurant came on check please..also, very vegetarian and vegan friendly.sis thought her tofu miso scramble was a tad salty while cousin thought his shrimp egg white frittata was quite bland.i will be back!.hot, and rich with an abundance of mushrooms mixed with fresh and tangy with spicy arugula topped off with bacon! seriously this bacon though you guys.both.front door staff lacked the easy smile we should expect (especially when we asked to move), but wait staff were lovely.the food was good! we both had omelettes with veggies and cheese.the vegetables were plentiful and fresh, however, the salad was quite plain and bland.this is a cool place!interior was gorgeous - the outdoor seating in the summer i&#39;m sure is incredible.i heard about the lemon pancakes and they were really good..no crayons or anything to occupy the kids so they will get antsy with how long it takes to get their food.the coffee is delicious and so was the homemade turkey sausage.overpriced by $1.we were especially eager to try it out because we had been big fans of  work of art, it&#39;s parent..the servers and baristas have always been friendly.great ambience.great atmosphere and extremely friendly staff.when that arrived i took one sip and nearly got sick.recommend getting 1/2 decaf as it is full bodied.but that&#39;s a good thing.this was my second visit to the place and definitely it has now become one of my new favorite brunch spots!.i had a choice of potatoes or tomatoes, and opted for the latter.i&#39;ve heard there&#39;s always a wait on the weekends but we were prepared for that.i still gave 4 stars is because i went there once during the week and food was only good, like good but not as good as the weekend special menu :).wow, it looked amazing and she loved it!they also have lemon pancakes which we didn&#39;t order but looked at longingly and envious from afar.every bite got better.thick bread with unbelievable raspberry preserves, this tasted more like cake than toast.so if you want to grab lunch without it being an overwhelming experience at whole foods, then this is another great option!.do it.….there are valet, garage, and metered parking around the area.would go back just for lemon pancakes.this is an outstanding riff on carrot cake.it looked great but the vegetables had no taste whatsoever..no offer to refresh coffee.right fully so.i ordered the chai tea latte, and it was disappointing because it was lukewarm at best.all of my guests were happy and well taken care of.i&#39;d always nice to see operators that take pride in their trade.good sunday brunch.the speed of the food being brought out was right on par and the quality of the food was good.the egg whites, spinach, roasted tomatoes, and giant prawns just go together more perfectly than anything i&#39;ve ever eaten in the morning.delicious food, beautiful interior, and outdoor seating! great for lunch or brunch and can accommodate big groups.i started off with the house bloody mary.one thing to note is that this place is really loud on saturday mornings during brunch..delicious.yum as ever! came with breakfast potatoes.whenever i have someone in town and we&#39;re looking for a brunch, i always take them here and everyone always is blown away with their meal.they can get fairly busy on the weekends, but don&#39;t worry-you&#39;ll have their line-up of pastries to drool over while you wait.it was so loud in there.it was a perfect taste of sweet! a must try at this place! i usually get the chilaquiles here, which are always delicious and i like how they use fresh jalapenos on the dish.great brunch spot! very busy, but worth it."
goddess-and-grocer-chicago-6,https://www.yelp.com/biz/goddess-and-grocer-chicago-6,1,"Will not be going here ever again.amazing food.fresh food (whole foods status) and gelato station in the front.the shop is really clean and neat too - pleasant experience.have been going there (this location and the old one that used to be across the street) for years.so far i have not been disappointed with anything i purchase here.today was probably the 5th time in 3 months.dang, that kale salad got my knees weak.the upstairs area is nice, especially when it is warm enough to enjoy the outdoor seating.i expect quality for a store like this.they have a passion for their food -- not only flavor, but quality.they have lots of veggie and good meat options.think sauces, coffees, etc.i&#39;d come back only if i was in the neighborhood, but wouldn&#39;t go out of my ways to find this place again.idk if they brew their beans for regular hot coffee or regular cold brew.the food is typically good but it&#39;s not fun when you get home or back to the office and it&#39;s the wrong thing 50-60% of the time.he still didn&#39;t get it, ignoring her completely, and she ended up getting it for me.if i lived close by, i would definitely order from them again.the good thing is that the dressings in them are not overpowering so the taste is always great no matter what you mix.expensive, but it may be worth it if they don&#39;t mess up your order.convenience and quality have been the norm.we thought this was rude..the food is pretty decent, but the service is awful.always have a good experience here.this place is expensive as it is, least they can do is not be rude.i will definitely go back and try something else!  i&#39;d consider this place more of an in/out lunch spot.29 minutes to prepare two to-go sandwiches falls well below my expectations.the salad bar never disappoints, and the breakfast sandwiches are always delicious! it&#39;s fun to sit on the roof too!.will not return.so, one afternoon in january i was wandering around wicker park and stumbled upon the goddess and grocer.the staff was so friendly when i walked in offering me samples &amp; tips!upstairs offers so much seating, they have a make your own salad bar (like whole foods), free cucumber water, free wifi! also, they still have all my favorites like the chicken salad and the california dreaming!i would definitely recommend the california dreaming sandwich  (i order with no mayo)they have an outdoor rooftop patio on the second floor that i&#39;ll be back to enjoy sometime warmer!.the pleasant &#34;whiff&#34; you get from just walking into the placeeven if it were accidental, it would be a beautiful mistake.sometimes this place can be a bit confusing on the customer side, but you cannot beat the chicken salad.i used my groupon here on a beautiful june day, when i would&#39;ve loved a seat on the patio (can you call it a patio with two tables?) but settled for the end of the communal table inside..ridiculous.a bit pricy, and the staff is usually not interested in helping anyone.i come here for my cheat meal for the week.i wouldn&#39;t splurge on the packaged stuff though, you really do get the exact same product for less at grocery stores...fix your act and figure out your marketing deals people.their almond cherry pie with strudel crust is amazing.the salad bar also looked really fresh and appetizing.everything in here looks and tastes great."
longman-and-eagle-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/longman-and-eagle-chicago,2,"They arrived around 9:15am and we were seated an hour later (only after reminding the 2 ladies up front, who were friendly but forgot we were waiting!).went for brunch at 9 am--no wait! got the fried chicken and waffles and was pleasantly surprised by the large serving size! the chicken was moist with crispy skin, the waffle was sweet, the sweet potatoes were crispy, and the pancetta in the potatoes was perfectly savory.i am not a big fan of tripe, but it was incredible.but eventually i was persuaded to drop by around noon on a sunny saturday.they are well made and so delicious..arghh i hate when popular restaurants don&#39;t take reservations!! so sucked it up and wandered over to azucar for dinner #1.....the pacing was right on, and we enjoyed all the magical flavors and textures this fine evening.i went with the beauregarde - el buho mezcal, blueberries, lemon, sugar, absinthe, creme d&#39;violette.it&#39;s right across from the blue line station, making it easy to get around (and leaving you more room to try cocktails).over all nice place.tried it finally.inventive menu.the host was super friendly and awesome, and kept us in the loop on when a table will most likely be available.he loved that as well.the salty oatmeal, caramelly sweet potato, and sour greens were carefully balanced.i thought it was pulled pork for some reason.it&#39;s a weird to describe a restaurant&#39;s vibe in terms of a 90&#39;s fashion trend.long wait, but great brunch and drinks! we got there around 1:30pm on a sunday and waited for about an hour to an hour and a half.the hash was perfectly crispy and soft when it needed to be.again, not the meat itself but the dish as a whole..there are over 200 bottles with the restaurant offering $3 or $5 shots, flights, and some really, really good and creative cocktails.it was a huge portion! the fries it was served with were amazing.5 stars all the way.definitely worth coming in.the place was starting to get even busier, so i&#39;d definitely suggest getting there before 10:30!the menu looked great.in any event, the chef was unable to make the french toast without the jam (also kind of surprising, but oh well), so i ordered the chicken and waffles instead.my two friends and i got there just before 10 am and the wait time was already an hour..depending on day and time each category of patrons will ebb and flow.for the food.i had the &#34;contraband picnic&#34; which was comprized of whiskey, la guita manzanilla sherry, watermelon, grapefruit, lime, and pickeled watermelon rind.every restaurant/hotel should strive to be as cool as this place.again, bland, boring.i&#39;ve lived within striking distance of l&amp;e since it opened way back when.i came here for lunch and i saw that the only fried chicken offering was from their chicken and waffles from the breakfast menu, which is what i ended up ordering.they have a pretty extensive brunch menu.while the elements of the plate were flavorful, the plating was sloppy and the price was ridiculous for what we got..striped bass entree - this was ok.oh man sooo good.ambiance: it was kinda chilly out so we sat inside.if you can get a seat at the bar, it&#39;s probably the best seat in town.our main courses of gnocchi served with broccolini pesto and cauliflower and lentils were both very tasty - the latter had a bit of an indian spice taste.the food was good was good but didn&#39;t blow me away..the wait wasn&#39;t bad on a friday night, and we went to the back bar to grab a drink while we waited the mere 20 minutes.service was quick and pleasant and if we lived in chicago, this would be a regular spot for us.i highly recommend it, make sure you try all of the desserts!.right off the logan square stop, it&#39;s the perfect brunch destination if you&#39;re looking for an elevated version of something you can&#39;t cook at home.we left hungry, perturbed and disappointed.it was lukewarm, eggs were rubbery, and the sauce was both overwhelming with truffle and vinegar and underwhelming with any full bodied flavor.it does have malort in it so be warned!the service was excellent.striped bass: what caught my eye was the frog legs.the brains and execution of the food and drinks are hella good here.i&#39;m not joking.drinks were more on the astringent side, needed more balancing of flavors, somewhat disappointed for supposedly being a top notch whiskey bar.i appreciate how everything is made fresh to order.great outdoor seating, good service and a knockout sazerac!good for brunch and group ears outside.no sliders stacked on as garnish or anything.i haven&#39;t overstayed long enough to need to stay overnight in a room of the hotel (i do only live a quarter mile away) but it&#39;s nice to know that&#39;s an option for those days when venturing out into the world just isn&#39;t for me.a dozen whites to put you in your place..the combination of awesome taste and texture makes these a step above the rest.the giant marrow bones with bacon-shallot jam, green apple kimchi, pickled garlic and shallots were a sight to behold and eat! kimchi, however, is a strong taste and its appearance in this and another dish i felt was too overpowering a fermented-y taste.first off when we got there, it was 12:45 and the place was dead.last but not least, the servers and bartenders are down to earth and are nice to you.with little research online i found out about longman &amp; eagle..a restaurant that is divey and has a mechillin star."
compass-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/compass-bar-chicago,1,"Overall this is a nice little bar...she was also helpful in selecting some of the food options.we had a large party reservation and our waitress was fantastic.my favorite pizza in chicago! try the pork shoulder pizza; personally i like it best without goat cheese.i tried five different beers form their  large well organized beer menu.or smoked pork shoulder.my favorite was buffalo chicken pizza.the customer service is great and they always have good beer recommendations..hi--we&#39;re on the patio and it&#39;s colder out here-i promise you as i type this with my frozen finger.luckily for him i love getting drunk at restaurants, so the extra time it took to make our replacement pizza, i ordered a few of their unique drafts and went to town on a couple of whiskeys.great pizza made fresh and full of flavor.that is the only reason for 4 stars! the brick oven pizza is fantastic, calamari is one of the best i&#39;ve had, and bruschetta to name a few of my favs.i also have to add that the guy on water patrol is awesome- i never had an empty glass (it&#39;s the little things)! food is delicious- great margerhita pizza! beer list was everything i was hoping for! hoping to try brunch soon!.their food is nothing special.5/10..$6..the overall atmosphere was chill, the service was great, and the facilities were clean...i&#39;d go back!.the pizza is amazing.went with a revolution brewing company antihero!.it&#39;s clearly geared toward the sports-loving crowd, and there are several screens all over.i went to compass on a weeknight.been here for drinks as a bar, been here for lunch, been here for dinner and been here for dates.the price was average to below average for the area, and they have a pretty impressive beer list.the food is just average bar food at best.real swell.only suggestion is to make some sort of food/drink deal for wednesday nights like a lot of the other bars have in the area!.best and most low key bar and grill i have been too while living in the lincoln park area.great location, cool looking bar and great tvs, decent service, mediocre food but great beer choices.there is celery, carrots, and a couple other things on it that were not on the menu.wish there was a wider selection of food (read: vegi friendly food) but alas, this is a pizza bar after all.it&#39;s a great spot in the summer(when it&#39;s not so humid) to have a cold glass of beer and some appetizers because they have awesome outdoor seating.new favorite spot right off the lakefront! great outdoor space and clean bar inside.someone else had kept their hat on...i came in for lunch/brunch yesterday with my french bulldog having found this place on a website of dog-friendly restaurants.they have the best black bean burger i&#39;ve ever had (literally dream about it).they are known for their wood fire pizza and i&#39;ve only had it once but can&#39;t tell you much about it.both were delicious.we met our bartender phil and he was really nice and personable and the owner patrick stopped by to say hi and ask how we were enjoying our food unsolicited.the plate comes with two peppers but we collectively ate about 1 and half of them because we were attempting to save our appetite for the pizza.i highly recommend the pesto pizza..we also had the truffle fries and a few beers..stumbled into compass last night after a long day of moving, and we were pleasantly surprised by the service, atmosphere and food.i have been waiting for something a little higher scale than duffy&#39;s for the neighborhood.the beer list is endless! it&#39;s a wonderful neighborhood place.highly recommended for anytime you&#39;re trying to go out for some pizza and drinks, also have plenty of tvs (one outside as well) if there are any games on!.) it&#39;s a cool little spot, indoor and outdoor seating with a wood burning pizza oven in back! cocktails were tasty but when are they not!? while i can&#39;t comment on the food, the smells were unbelievable.one of my favorite patio spots to go to! i bring my little french bulldog and the owner always makes sure to bring her a bowl of water :)the food is great and their is always an awesome selection of craft beer..the good:- when we walked in we were greeted by the bartender who was very friendly.i&#39;ve been back about 4 times since and the pizza has become much better in terms of the dough and the ingredients added to the pizza.lots of places to go to afterwards in neighborhood, and all walking distance.5.the food here is awesome and great drink specials all the time! :).the pulled pork pizza is a 10.overall, great experience and we can&#39;t wait to be back!.and the mini burgers appear to just be regular burgers sliced into thirds.on saturdays, they have $6 chicken tenders, so we ordered that..i really enjoyed their outdoor seating area and the flatbread pizzas i consumed thereupon.and our server was a rock star -- danielle -- she brought us a complimentary skillet cookie for our birthday celebration.we got the shrimp/calamari pizza and the italian pizza, they were all right, tho i love the fact that they put shrimp and calamari on a pizza.great place to sit outside and enjoy a pizza! they even have a tv on the patio.good for watching sports games too.the pizza is pretty solid but unlike most yelp reviewers on here i tried a lot of their other menu items.the interior is really nice and is really good for a first date spot.at times the service is great but all in all great bar!..me me happy! múy būènõ!.my boyfriend and i grabbed a table and immediately started paging through the menu."
bacchanalia-ristorante-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bacchanalia-ristorante-chicago-2,1,"I had the filet mignon smothered in mushrooms and white wine sauce.i could not eat it.its average at best!.the meat ravioli and lasagna are also delicious.i&#39;ve been coming here since i was 2!! it&#39;s just a tiny, family run place.but they gave us free bic pens when we left.with the exception of a few appetizers, the food is hardly italian (i grew up in rome).we began by ordering an appetizer of baked clams..its cozy, inviting and the food is so good.well i was definitely disappointed after reading the rave reviews.we have been coming here about 18 years and i never tire of it.also, it&#39;s hard to find good tiramisu, and theirs is probably the worst i&#39;ve ever had.i came here and had breaded pork tenderloin - it taste like it was sitting next to a piece of fish or something , not very good.this kind of carelessness and disrespect toward customers drives me bonkers.came here last night with my boyfriend and we loved it.i have never had the pleasure of dinning here until i had lunch recently.he was on top of things and did an excellent job of keeping our water glasses filled and the table void of dirty dishes.they use a béchamel sauce rather than ricotta so it is amazingly creamythe cannoli - delicious creamy filling that was to die forthe not-so-good:the yelp pasta appetizer - this is just a plate of whatever pasta the chef wants with a little sauce.i look forward to visiting again soon!!.they were so creamy and had a great flavor.....try the superior white fish! you won&#39;t be sorry!.had to take my left overs home.they were right.rock solid italian food..had lunch, our waitress was friendly and very knowledgeable about the food and was able to answer all my questions.also try their fudge cake when you&#39;re there.this place has been zagat rated as fuck for years, so there&#39;s a touch of resting on laurels here, but if you&#39;ve got 50 or 75 bucks to blow for a date, i&#39;d recommend this place for sure.not so good.best calamari and baked clams- delicious soups and salads.the atmosphere, the food, the staff all come together to bring a piece of italy to your table.we ordered the &#34;dinner option&#34; with ala cart menu items which includes soup, salad, your entree, and a dessert.go there, eat there.i know it sounds strange but their sausage was delicious! very nice people.owners are great-you&#39;ll feel like family when you eat here.the portions were quite good..well worth the drive.very large portions with very atypical service (not a fancy place at all) and old fashioned italian family restaurant.my family never ever ever eats italian food when we go out for dinner, except at bacchanalia.the focaccia bread, soup and both vesuvio dishes.the food is delish the staff is amazing...well they got full off bread, his boss had to leave before their food came because she had to go back to work for a meeting.no ones marinara compares.man opens his own joint down the block.never had a bad meal.bacchanalia is one of my favorite chicago restaurants.hands down the best italian food!!!  please don&#39;t waste your time with other places or chains.skip this place and go to ignotz down the street!.my mom and i come here after work some times.this is the best restaurant ever they serve the best meals love the lasagna simply the best.somehow, most of us ordered ravioli which was great.i&#39;ve also had their seafood diablo several times which is quite tasty.this place was a complete disappointment and probably the first time that yelp has ever led me astray.i like the whole neighborhood feel and decor.great staff.my tilapia ala toscana was decent enough, but the antipasto salad had more girth than green."
frontera-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/frontera-grill-chicago,1,"Highly recommend.i was torn between a 4 and 5 star review, would probably choose 4.the guac is awesome.this was just weird.the topolo came in a martini glass and xoco was a refreshing cucumber one in a tall glass.they sat us downstairs - which i didn&#39;t know they even had.i love a restaurant that plays mainstream latino music! such a great vibe..thea guac was exactly what it should be, but it didn&#39;t taste any different from what i&#39;ve had in texas.instant energy as you walk in and enjoy the bright colors and incredible margaritas.besides the price was high for the quality of the food.each dish is a wonderful mix of flavors and you do not need to gorge yourself to feel satisfied..we attended the rockin lobster bash on 8/31 and after having met and tasted food from rick bayless there we had high expectations for frontera..we&#39;ve had better food at better prices, so it goes into the 2 category.the salad was good.i don&#39;t want an ice cold shrimp quesadilla.the duo flan came out beautiful with a traditional vanilla flan and a very non-traditional chocolate flan that tasted more like a mousse.we ordered the jamaica sangria which was pretty good, but kind of strong, which wasn&#39;t a bad thing in our case.there was just nothing that clearly separated it from many other similar, really good quality places serving the same cuisine.the clear winner for us were the quesadillas.under cooked steak skirt and over spicy pork.after waiting about 40 minutes for our meal to arrive, the top of the black bean side dish was dry, and the enchiladas were barely warm.there is couple dishes are must order: seafood cocktail, beef brave, and taco trio.we ordered a side of rice and beans too.the beef, chicken and duck were awesome! our favorite was the duck; it was so tender and fatty, we couldn&#39;t stop eating it..hello everyonei enjoy great food and they have good food! service at the bar was one star but service in the dining room was 4 stars.all of the ingredients are fresh and locally sourced.and it apparently usually sold out within the first couple minutes of service.the chicken quesadilla and sopes were very good but not differentiated.they also have breakfast until 11am.the steak was creek stone meat (which is halal!!!) was cooked and seasoned perfectly! the ceviche was the best ceviche i&#39;ve ever had and i don&#39;t even like ceviche! i can&#39;t wait to go back and try the rest of the menu! my husband especially liked the wide variety of sauces given especially the habanero sauce (which is good but way too hot for me personally).but we&#39;re good.we could hear their conversations, and them, probably ours.one bite however completely changed my outlook.good news is there were still plenty of seats after all the groups were seated, but i can see the reason why everyone waits after eating there.next time i&#39;ll skip the fancy vibe and just got straight to xoco which i felt like had better food for a better price.i enjoyed a lot of the flavors but felt like i could get the same food for a lot cheaper.benito picoso - special drink recommended by the bartender...who know....i really tried to like this place.5 star.scored a table within 15 minutes.the drinks are strong (blue agave margarita is great) and the fundido is terrific.all were amazing!!! the corn tamales were moist and came out perfectly warm and delicious.light and refreshing yet tart and sweet.the shrimp was the standout dish from the meal.i went here first of all because i had tried their salsas from the grocery store and they were delicious.and it lived up to what i had expected.will absolutely come back!!!!.had dinner in the bar.i watched his shows on pbs and on iron chef america, and top chef masters.green mole sauce was really good.duck in mole was outstanding and a great value.while you are in the area, check out xoco as well sometime.the three of us each ordered different meals, and they were delicious.for our main courses we shared the mushroom tacos and the shrimp/fish tacos.yummy yummy get into my tummy!first you need reservations,months in advancesecond before u sit down u have to get a genuine blue agave margarita.after my visit, i am convinced the food at frontera grill is among the best mexican food i have had.drinks are really good too.saturday we will try again to est at xoco, if not we will just need to visit chicago sooner..everything was excellent."

petterinos-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/petterinos-chicago,1,"I had the gnocchi with spinach, ricotta, and chicken sausage.i came to petterino&#39;s for a company lunch last week.first time here.perfectly chopped with the right amount of cheese.we also had tiramisu!!! yum!!.everyone here is upbeat and talkative.you can never go wrong here..food came to my wife cold,  server graciously took it back.the well-made martini was accompanied by three olives stuffed with blue-cheese.i would like to try out their dinner menu especially if i&#39;m planning on seeing a show near by.i will definitely be back..accordingly, i would also encourage those in need of a downtown venue for receptions, office parties and the like, to explore petterino&#39;s as a viable centrally located venue option.could not have been happier that we choose petterino&#39;s to celebrate our 13th anniversary.also, i don&#39;t know any place who does grilled calamari better than petterinos.food was lackluster and service was even worse.i had friends in town to see beautiful at the oriental theater so i wanted a place to dine before the show.for.the staff is always well trained and makes sure you are having a good dining experience.i had the salmon cakes that were on special that day, they were so good.i would definitely eat here again!  (see photos as well!).food and service was excellent! great menu with a wonderful variety to choose from.our waitress was excellent.once a favorite of my family&#39;s, the recent changes to the menu removed some of their best items..maybe even have a matching wine flight?fresher salads - burrata, caprese, some thing with arugula and a fresh shaved parm-regiano.the bruschetta appetizer is the best i have ever had! so fresh tasting.the service is average, food is average, decor is decent.finishing off an evening by standing at the curb, watching the most disorganized valet operation in the city bringing up an average of one car per five minutes takes a great experience and absolutely flushes it..let&#39;s just put it this way, it was delicious!!!the food is on the pricier side, but that is expected because of the central downtown location.definitely will go back.a platter of the housemade pork &amp; veal meatballs were served in a nice marinara sauce; the meatballs were not overly-gigantic, and they were quite delicious - i liked the slight crispiness on the exterior..regardless, the food was good.service good, room very noisy.i went here for lunch and had the burger, sans bun and fries but with sautéed spinach.would definitely go there again.do yourself a favor.i  highly recommend this awesome restaurant and every time we come to chicago will be a must go.i have never left here hungry..i&#39;m afraid i have to dock you one star..good lunch spot downtown.the food isn&#39;t particularly glamorous or unique, but the chefs stick to what they know and cook it well.definitely overpriced for quality.overpriced and overrated.if you&#39;re looking for a place to wow your potential clients, this is not the place if you&#39;re getting a big dose of haterade at the front door.we would definitely go back.fun environment..bit expensive overall but the spinach and ricotta gnocchi in vodka sauce is worth it.ideal if you&#39;re going to the theatre and their top service and kitchen get you out on time.maybe that is because the food is just average and the restaurant is really just an elegant fast-food quick stop on the way somewhere else."
carbon-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/carbon-chicago,2,"The prices are super reasonable and the employees are super friendly.an awful lot of cops are there in the evenings.my favorite is a fish called william burrito, it&#39;s filled with 3 types of white fluffy fish, cilantro line sauce and a few other items, outstanding.best fish tacos on the southside.there was no mention on the website, grub hub or yelp that the restaurant was not open.and you can make it a meal by the free add ons such as rice, beans, etc, which they put inside the quesadilla..) definitely don&#39;t hesitate to give carbon a try though!.i hear the fish tacos are very good so this will be my next order.im a fan of carbon grill and have been coming here since the doors opened, i order from here often at least once a month.food is very good, so is service! i had the steak tacos and i also had fish tacos...lots of great flavors..they are both full of flavor and big in portion! the steak and chicken is always juicy and they always give you a ton of meat! the soda was even ice cold when it was delivered to my door only forty minutes from when i ordered! this place is great and i will continue to be a customer :).my friends got two horchatas for free..alright so i checked out this place for lunch, and thought it was good..we went and picked our food up, but they do deliver on grubhub and we might do that next time, and there will be a next time.very busy place and i would recommend ordering online before coming..it has been a long, long time since i have had it.i always order the &#34;mother clucker&#34; when i come.25-2.tacos were cold...overall not a good experience triple check your bags and your receipts fyi.i had the tequila lime chicken and the tortilla infused tilapia tacos and both were great.com/chicago/2016….no beans? no sour cream? no cheese?? the guac has no flavor.lol.my only complaint is that the chicken and steak provided was not as much as i had hoped.options are good, drinks are good.highly recommend popping into this place.the interior is kind of small - hole in the wall kind of feel - but it&#39;s cool, not friendly, people keep to themselves - but chill enough to eat comfortably.let&#39;s just say the hot sauce is just worth the risk.it was probably worth the wait because it was bursting with flavor.coli outbreak or not (and thankfully i was not a victim of such).i was referred to this restaurant by a friend and i&#39;m pleased to have came here.funny, i did.."

jaks-tap-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jaks-tap-chicago,2,"On nights when there is a blackhawks or bulls games, i know that the local restaurants can get busy because of their proximity to united center.the food can be really good or just really okay-never bad.i go for the burger which is good but nothing spectacular...i like the menu choices, and both entrees i had came to the table quickly, correct and they were delicious.from the veggie burrito i had yesterday (using real beans instead of refried mush) when i was insulted by a co-worker to the bar nachos that are a staple of each time some girl has told me she&#39;s just not that interested in me, the combination of great food and painful conversation just keeps winning me back.however, they have an excellent beer selection.for example, today i came here for couple simple drinks.service: 7/10atmosphere: 8/10food: 8/10.the food sucked and for a burger with bleu cheese allegedly at the center i could taste none.sliders and burgers here are pretty good and i tend to get the ribs a lot as well.i ordered the jerk chicken sandwich which was pretty good..it&#39;s about 15 bucks for a full rack of ribs with fries and slaw on saturdays and sundays.we were waiting for a while to get our orders in and to finally get the check.on weekends they have a pizza special.bar tenders will memorize your name after about two visits...great beer selection and pretty good food from what we could tell but only got an app.recently moved out of state and miss it terribly.awesome food, great layer back atmosphere, and even better service.as i approached, he walked by me and said it would be a minute.oh and they have a full bar.hummus is awesome! marshall the bartender rocks!.there is also a larger meeting space (say 30 people) that is reservable.i had the bbq sandwich and it was tasty.we ordered fish and chips, which were soggy and non-flavorful, and wings- which were ok.great place to be for warm drafts and slow service.for my side i chose the jalapeno mac and cheese...extensive beer list (though i know that one of my companions was bothered that they didn&#39;t have his heinekin but hey, we can&#39;t all be evolved beer drinkers..overall, jak&#39;s is a neighborhood bar which caters to locals (mid-day parents and their kids at tables), united center crowds (bring your blackhawks jersey), and after work gatherings (wear your suit).i would recommend everything they have from their nachos to their burgers, even their salads have a big variety of ingredients.they also played really good music.the pool table is cumbersome to move around.the food has gone to hell.split a chopped salad that was very tasty and reasonably priced.i really like their salmon caesar cajun style.the food was fine.this would be fantastic place for a happy hour...comfortable, warm, great for a sit down place with friends.whether its a big game or just getting together with a few friends.overlooked a medium rare by miles on my burger..but that&#39;s bar food for you!.:).food was superb and atmosphere was great! total a+++ service and quality!!! thank you mike, thank you jaks tap!!!.it&#39;s like a restaurant had sex with a sports bar.it&#39;s not too loud that you can&#39;t chat up your partner.my friend and i both really enjoy mike &amp; chris!!  :) both are super attentive and a good conversationalist.the fries needed salt and the chicken needed something.we were told ahead of time that the chicken wings take a little more time to cook which we didn&#39;t mind at all! it was great that our server mention that from the start! the minute the food was brought out to us we were ready to dig in!my boyfriend loved the wings, he mentioned the sauce tasting like no other he&#39;s had before.i would recommend.knowledge bartender.so my co-workers and i go here quite a bit for birthdays.their food? well i love it...greatly appreciate his up beat attitude despite us taking long to order.this is so my new favorite bar in west loop!the drinks were so great, the bartender was a perfect consultant, and the selection on tap is so tremendous!  can you say weihenstephan.my favorite neighborhood place to grab a great beer, some good food, and watch whatever game is playing when you&#39;re near greektown.love the wings tossed in the hot house sauce!  the sauce is like a wet jerk seasoning and pretty unique and memorable as far as wings go.i found this place randomly when a friend and i just needed to sit down."

native-foods-cafe-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/native-foods-cafe-chicago-3,1,"The staff was very engaging and patient enough to explain the menu to me, recommened something and i thoroughly enjoyed it.assuming you&#39;re an actual vegan that wants to get the closest thing to a cheeseburger you can find, this is pretty good.the employee working at the cashier was friendly, and wished me a happy birthday.it was around 8:15pm, it slowed down, and it took her longer to say that than to take a quick picture.portobello-sausage burger devoured quickly.third store that i have been to and love each one..if i want pricy vegan food,  i would go to chicago diner.the salad was awesome, i swear there was ground beef on that thing.s- i recommend their sweet potato fries and dip.needless to say, bit meat eaters and vegetarians alike will find the menu approachable.great food and reasonably priced but not particularly welcoming.it was very busy, which i can appreciate, but it still wasn&#39;t a great first impression.a variety of vegan proteins, my aunt still thinks she ate chicken.i hope one day native foods deviates from (nearly a pure) fake meat/cheese heavy menu and focus on making good veggies.if you are looking for good service, then you will definitely want to go elsewhere.they also seem to dump in bean water and the warm beans start wilting your romaine..the soul bowl is one of my favorite comfort foods.even he found the chicken run ranch sandwich and the scorpion burger to be delicious at this place! the tea is also really good, along with their bowls (the gyro one is my favorite), desserts, and sides (fries and veggies, yum!).i also got the watermelon fresca, which was watermelon juice.i love this place.until then, time for a break.my favorite vegan restaurant! i&#39;ve had multiple dishes here and they&#39;ve always been exceptional.the second time i came, i specifically asked that someone make sure i get enough cheese, but again barely any cheese to be found, making the dish dry and less tasty.open, beautiful interior.and they have wine! i brought my non-veggie friend who has probably never not had meat with a meal in his entire life, and he actually enjoyed the food here (almost) as much as i did.eating here at least once a week, i am always happy with what i try.well not my cup of tea but the rice was good (coconut sauce).they have big signs posted that explain the various types of meat replacements that are available.the first time i came i did not even really know it was not meat when i took a bite out of what i thought to be chicken, taste is really unique..delicious.psa to my fellow vegans:yaaaaaaas.never had so much fun ordering food.but honestly, why bother?  the prices are beyond reasonable here, i would have paid $6 more dollars on average at this restaurant just as an added cost to trust it is all plant based..the cashier recommended the greek gyro bowl, so i went with that, slightly concerned about how they can pull it off as a bowl and without meat, since grilled meat, tzatziki sauce, and pita bread are the most essential components of a gyro.too expensive for the quality of food.i&#39;d recommend this if you&#39;re looking for fast, healthy &amp; not-heavy.flavourful food, made with fresh ingredients...if you are looking for a healthy but still tasty option for lunch, i would recommend checking out native foods.you can see my previous reviews of native foods and they all have been 5 stars.;).while i was waiting to get my order one of the friendly employees walked past with a tray full of the most delicious looking cupcakes.there was one location in the inland empire in cali that had the best service evvvvvverrrrr..eat here several times a week every time i&#39;m on business in chicago.they were great.best way to keep up with your veggie intake while traveling! quick service, yummy food.the best part of the salad was the cilantro lime dressing.&#34; nope.the chili is nondescript, not a complete failure but wholly unsurprising.i had native chicken, bacon and avocado open face sandwich with sweet potato fries and they were awesome! !.my favorites are the chicken bacon avo club and the bankock curry bowl.their portions of the side of fries and sweet potato fries are not the much..it took a little bit more time than we are thinking.i really liked the food here.while their chicken sandwich &#34;meat&#34; tastes like just the bread from a fried chicken sandwich, it&#39;s still better than any other place you&#39;ll try.the prices are very high for the portions you get.as some people have noted in their reviews, it is not all &#34;health&#34; food.loved the food.i mostly appreciate being able to get a large plate of veggies, tofu and brown rice at a casual service restaurant.what a relief to walk in a place and pick anything on the menu and its vegan.this time, i had my sister, brother in law and their infant baby with me."

benjyehuda-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/benjyehuda-chicago,2,"I think the secret to good fries is double frying them.rock music is the perpetual soundtrack...i get the same type of meal at the other, comparable falafel locations around town and this by far is the best.i&#39;ve been to israel (see my yelp photo taken in jerusalem) and this is the closest i&#39;ve had to the food over there, although jerusalem is much better, something about the spice mixture.there is a plethora of middle eastern restaurants around the cbot area.the pitas were okay, but i found the meat to be a bit too dry and the falafel seemed to have been fried for too long.perfectly balanced.hey-o, that falafel really was spicy but so tasty! loved being able to customize the box with the extras and sauces - ended up being filling and a good value for the price!..it&#39;s a &#34;look at the menu and build your box/wrap/lunch&#34; kind of joint, but that doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t fresh.the hummus is a bit bland, but textures of both the baba ganoush and the hummus really ties everything together..i basically add a bunch of stuff and mix it like a burrito bowl from chipotle, but this is definitely healthier and probably contains less calories.recommended!..they do have a bit of unique flavor to them, and if i&#39;m in the area, i enjoy going there for a nice falafel sandwich.i&#39;ve been on a mediterranean fix lately and heard great things about benjyehuda.overall, a quick and easy lunch spot with pretty good food.this fast food-style middle eastern spot might be quick, but the food is certainly not lacking in flavor or quality..they are pretty cool people in my opinion and it makes it even better that they&#39;re involved with every order making the food.there is no going back from the merkts.i always get the chicken box.i noticed that they have merks cheese after i ordered or i definitely would have gotten that on the side--can&#39;t pass that up! the red cabbage salad was great and flavorful.falafel customized to your liking.i personally find it extremely satisfying when a &#34;carrot salad&#34; is not secretly a &#34;carrot-and-random-pork-parts salad&#34;, so being able to top my falafel with salads that are bright, colorful, and healthy, with the confidence that what i&#39;m seeing is what i&#39;m getting, is a beautiful thing.i got the yehuda flight, which lets you try the best of the best-- a mini falafel in a pita, a mini chicken shawarma in a pita and the steak pita, along with fries.this place is great.i&#39;ll walk the extra block because i think roti is better.plus people at the tables eating were all there to eat and move on with their day so it wasn&#39;t hard to find a seat when i got my food.first things first - the fries at benjyehuda are the bomb!  seriously, if you are like me and love crispy fries than i advise you go over there - right now - and get an order.oh, and don&#39;t be alarmed/disgusted when you see &#34;ball sac&#34; largely printed on the menu board.seating can be rather limited, but i mean it&#39;s the loop.oh, the smells.my fries were only great, and not &#34;best in the city&#34; (the term a number of friends used to describe what i would think after eating the fries), so i am coming down a little hard on those golden wafers of magic.it&#39;s chipotle-style mediterranean food, like roti or cava grill (in dc), although i didn&#39;t like it as much as either of those places.honestly there are so many mediterranean places to eat around this area, but what makes this place different? what does this place offer that really make it stand out? the flight.i love the option of having half rice and half lettuce with the box option, making me feel just ever slightly healthier.the steak is moist and tender and the chicken seasoned just right.the box of food was robust flavor-wise in general.thanks for simplifying the menu, guys! its a really handy touch when dealing with a loud restaurant serving foreign food that the menu is really easy to make choices from.generally, pretty good.everything else is perfect.new york) had started hocking crab juice outside the cboe.stopped in for lunch and was my usual indecisive self struggling to choose what to eat.i assume this was to help snap his coworkers out of their conversation.what sold me was the &#34;includes fries&#34;i can&#39;t believe i paid for this, how are you gonna sell these old ass fries? that&#39;s like making guacamole w/ an old ass avocado, you just don&#39;t do that.the food was good and the customer service was great...as i was headed to the south loop i gave this place a whirl based on the reviews.everything i&#39;ve had here is good!! steak pita or chicken pita is always an easy choice for my lunch break.i love food and this place has become one of my favorites spots in the loop.everything was warm and fresh and the display was pretty!  we will definitely be ordering again!!.please come to hyde park!!!.you cant go wrong here..you can add your choice of any or all of these: tomatoes, corn, cabbage, baba ganoush, hummus, pickles, carrot, onion, tahini sauce and/or hot sauce...food is decent, meat is a bit greasy and too high sodium.my food was delicious and filling without that overly overly feel.and a long line..do not get the benjyehuda flight.the parking isn&#39;t their fault and i understand the early close as well because it&#39;s a heavy business district.falafel was awful though.they just opened another location at 500 w madison which is open for lunch and early dinner.the pickled cucumbers, cabbage are great and so are the other things in the vegetarian box.the tahini and hot sauce really add to the flavor of the chicken.ben yehuda never fails, i have to have once a week, quick easy service, great portions a really good value and the food is always good.but i was intrigued that this place is pretty much only open for lunch and has gotten so many reviews.a colleague suggested we take a trip to the loop for lunch, and i&#39;m glad she did."

the abbreviated menu was pretty expansive making it hard to make selections, i ended up with the following: hamachi, scallop, chicken and dark chocolate mousse..if you are looking for a night on the town and willing to spend some mula then this is the place to go!.we didn&#39;t think the menu was very creative or different, it was just a-ok (which is certainly not bad).dessert: mango bergamot.my favorite was the heirloom carrots with pistachios, roasted bulgar, and smoked goat cheese.you can&#39;t stand behind that michelin star for long.perfect timing in between dishes too.this place has top notch service and delicious food! from the minute you walk in, you are doted on by the host, and given a coat check ticket if you so choose to take your jacket off at the door.my wife and i went to boka for a special occasion on 10/20/16.our server informed us that since everything here is tapas style the best way to order is to have each person order a cold, hot and entrée dish each but since we couldn&#39;t decide on what to get we just got one of each.now as an asian family chicken breasts aren&#39;t always the highest on the list to order (grandma says dark meat is where all the flavor is).crispy veal sweetbreads - preserved lemon, capers, fennelfirm but tender texture.it was quite nice.spacing of courses - cocktails,wine, appetizers, mains, is extremely important to me and having to wait for wine aggravates me to no end.our group of four nearly tried the entire menu and have nothing but positive reviews on the dishes.great place for date night!  food is amazing, wait staff is on point and all the drinks are top notch.when it was delivered, i questioned the server, because it was clearly farmed salmon -- i&#39;ve cooked wild salmon for 44 years.service here was also very good and attentive.she recommended a bottle of sancerre and it was great.the hostess took our jackets and umbrellas for us as we waited.the atmosphere, service and food were impeccable.we both got the scallops for our second dish..double chocolate cherry dessert.after seating, we proceeded with dinner.drew was perfect, answering our questions and tending to us with charm and grace.the ambience was quite and nice.m.the chestnut ravioli was pretty good as well, but the sauce was a little watery for my taste..a once-in-a-lifetime quality of a meal; everything was outstanding from start to finish, including the impeccable service.it was quite exciting to have these extra complimentary.- poached pear: hazelnut, fennel, and bourbon ice cream.then came good chestnut ravioli in a creamy foam or emulsion, along with a glass of cava.can&#39;t wait for the next time i&#39;m in town!.thank you boka!.carrots and octopus as apps, chicken and halibut for entrees, plenty of food for two people.especially sublime: handmade pasta with burgundian truffles; seared black bass with maitake mushrooms; pork neck with onion, chestnut, and creme fraiche; and the dessert course, a coffee puff with salty-sweet crumble, praline, and fresh milk ice cream.i&#39;ll probably never fulfill my dream of being a guest judge on iron chef, so i&#39;ll settle for boka.i wouldn&#39;t mind coming back just for a drink at the bar.the lamb and the short ribs were quite tasty as was the beef tartare and chilled corn soup.both were full of flavor and delicious.i would definitely return here on a regular night for the food, service, and atmosphere.second courses were perfectly balanced and delicious.the service was impeccable, food was creative and scrumptious, decor was classy and upscale.service was not as refined as similarly ranked restaurants.boka is a great place if you&#39;ve got money to spend and appreciate stellar service.the soup was decent but when i was listening to our adjacent table swooning over the carrots i was insanely jealous..there isn&#39;t much lighting, after the sun goes down, but it just helps to set the mood.for beginners they only had one person doing the valet we had to go inside the restaurant and ask where was the valet person.i loved the different experience.foie gras (4.i recently have the chicken and the skin was perfectly cooked the stuffing underneath the skin was intriguing and in its flavor and texture.for mains, the halibut and duck are both excellent.i recommend the carrots! for our hot appetizers, we both ordered the scallops :) so good! our mains were the arctic char &amp; the beef short ribs- i enjoyed the ribs more.my roommates ordered the roasted venison loin, roasted pekin duck breast and grilled beef short rib.i was actually very happy that the waitstaff wasn&#39;t in our faces all the time or overly deferential - it&#39;s not fun to eat when you&#39;re expected to smile and nod every 5 minutes.perfect sear on the outside but soft and tender on the inside! very flavorful and delicious.food -- good not great..they even invented an extra course on request - my wife loves foie and there was none on the menu - so they invented us some.by the time we finished our meal, we were already thinking about a second visit!."
garifuna-flava-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/garifuna-flava-chicago,2,"The food was flavorful but the portions were small and they up charge for 1 additional plantain which seems a little stingy..i ordered the belizean stew chicken, soft juicy chicken rinsed in spiced-up sauces.the drinks were great.wow! my taste buds did not expect this most pleasant surprise! jerk chicken is off the chain, belizean chicken stew is tasty, guacamole had a perfect consistency and very flavorful (especially with the plantain chips), and the rice with gravy was scrumptious.this place has character and delicious food.caution!-rice and beans are good but i&#39;m hispanic and have definitely had better, more flavorful rice.i had the chicken stew.if you&#39;re looking for something different to try,  this is the place!  a gem on the southwest side.every time i go i get something different and i am thoroughly satisfied.the garnaches was made different than how we make it home but it was good.i would not on my own accord  stop here if it weren&#39;t suggested by the man.stew chicken is amazing and the ducunu is spot on..can&#39;t say enough about this restaurant - the jerk chicken is so good that i cannot stop ordering it despite all the other amazing looking menu items.based upon the reviews, i decided to drag my little cousin along for a cultural dish.just what i want..i was totally wrong.the flagship cake was dry as all get out..a must have.homemadethis place is for real..these reminded me of cod fritters that my mom used to make for us when i was much younger.looked it up on &#34;diners, drive-ins, and dives.very delicious, despite the caribbean jerk chicken being smaller in proportions than i&#39;m use to i have no qualms with either the flavor or the service.good amount of spice on the chicken, and an awesome little plantain that comes with it.the chicken was amazing, smoked and seasoned perfectly.go during lunch with a friend and split the food.a winter time &#34;go-to&#34; for me in the future..best around in the south side.i look forward to trying more of their dishes in the  future.no gravy for the chicken.definitely a good place to try and they&#39;ve been featured on check please.we got:conch soup - pretty good but i think we should just get a side order and order the conch fritters.the panades are so tiny n tasty it&#39;s a blissful surprise and the lil accompaniment with it was perfect.my first time here for mother day my husband is good  the food is all i can say is omg!!!!!!!!!!  thank u.the parking lot is convenient and safe.as was the rice n beans.absolutely fantastic..it was so good.for those that work downtown definitely take advantage of nosh market at block 37 (extended through march)..however, i&#39;ve had several items from the menu and you can&#39;t go wrong with any of them..i thought since i was ordering the entree portion, it was coming with beans and rice, but it did not.ah grow up eatin&#39; it fresh fram dih watah an&#39; cook rite deh on dah key.i finally made it here tonight.our server was super attentive..the ox tail looks delicious fall off the bone as well.we&#39;ve been to most fancy place in the loop but man the food is amazing.it took a little long to get everything, but we could tell it was all made with love by the owner&#39;s mom! (yes his mom is the chef!!!!).the conch fritters were huge and were so delicious-definitely my favorite out of what we tried.love this  bit of the caribbean on the south side..i also ordered the lunch special i don&#39;t know if the portions are smaller because of that, but i only got one slice of fried plantain kinda depressing :c since it was so damn good.he tended to us like we were family:-)the restaurant and the guests have a pleasant aura--you&#39;ll think you&#39;re in belize.service was friendly,prompt and informative!!! loooved it!!!.i&#39;m spoiled and done with the others, whoever they are.i took my mom here for a late lunch on sunday and she loved the jerk chicken.although i did notice there were alot of fish recipes, and i am so not a fish person.so we ordered a variety of menu items from conch fritters and panadas, to king fish and carmel cake.the food at garifuna flava is awesome!so many choices and very affordable for the amount of food you get.we started with the appetizer platter and conch fritters, which came with the most amazing habanero slaw.a well balanced spices, deeply marinated chicken and wonderful authentic sides.this was my 3rd really bad experience.took the trek over to garifuna flava on a friday night with some friends.served whole, it is deep fried &amp; garnished in a sweet pepper, tomato, purple onion &amp; garlic based creole sauce...gf hit the spot.found this place on yelp and dropped by a few hours before closing time on a saturday night.."
a-tavola-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/a-tavola-chicago,2,"Our server also paid wonderful attention and the service in general was impeccable.the wine list was nice as was the service but keep looking for a nice steak dinner.all in all a bummer but we were happy to be outside on a gorgeous night with some wine.3 1/2 stars, but first a caveat: my boyfriend and i just had a delicious dinner at a tavola.i came in on an &#34;order&#34; from a friend who discovered them on the travel channel and since i was to be i chicago for work, he gave me no choice but to go.please change it).so i would go out on a limb and say that everything here is awesome.i repeat not authentic italian.we were impressed by everything we got, although i will say i was a bit disappointed that they ran out of the wine we wanted to order.the location is the absolute last place you would expect such high quality, authentic food.easily the most bland dish i have ever had in chicago and possibly my life.the atmosphere is quiet and perfect for a low key and delicious date night.there were four of us and we started with three pear salads and a gnocchi.you can have amazing meat at chicago.little pillows of brown butteryness that just melts.highly recommend.overall a great experience but definitely on the pricey side..&#34;  i appreciate it, and i&#39;m glad they were aware of the problem, but i&#39;d rather have paid for my wine and had good service.overall, maybe the place had too many good recommendations but i was expecting great food and all four of us had okay meals.i recommend making reservations due to the limited space and tables.get the gnocchi as a starter the best i have had in chicago.it is in fact a house turned into a restaurant, the small living room is basically the dining area.that kind of kills the mood.i participated in the april cooking class - we were invited by friends that won the class from a raffle.definitely worth a visit...we all left completely disappointed with the quality of food for the price we paidonly savior was pear salad but don&#39;t get me wrong.as the chef said, it is all in the quality of the ingredients and the technique.so all over a 3 star place.the gnocchi is out of this world..super friendly wait staff.terrific spot for dinner for two.and there is no need to get dressed up as this place is casual yet nice.and now let&#39;s talk about the food - delicious!!  fit for a foodie!!  pasta bolognese, lamp shank.we decided not only to try the tonnarelli cacio e pepe but to split the ginormous bistecca fiorentina (the 32 oz bone-in-center cut ribeye for two, or in our case at that time, for three).the place was very romantic, low lit and we were greeted and seated right away.i much prefer a restaurant to do a few things really well than lots of things mediocre.our past menus have included gnocchi with browned sage butter &amp; parmesan, saffron risotto, salmon, and panna cotta just to name a few of the items.when we got there it was half capacity with mainly an older crowd.this cooking class can be purchased through their website, and the menu changes monthly luring you to come back again and again! our class learned proper techniques when cooking roasted chicken, marinated mushrooms, apple tart, and my favorite dish: brown butter sage gnocchi.the service was awesome, the best i had in chicago - we had kevin as our server, and he always checked up on us, refilled our water, and always had a wonderful smile on his face.i live next door to this restaurant and every time i eat here i get mad at myself for not having returned sooner!  i just dined here for restaurant week and it was very good, started with their arugula salad, gnocchi for the primi course, chicken for the secondi, course and a flourless chocolate cake for dessert.spectacular double date place.it was a perfect date night on a cold winter night!.the place is totally unassuming, which i see some people consider boring, but i found charming and unpretentious.they have a limited menu so my husband chose to have the veal steak which was on special.i can&#39;t wait for summer to try out the backyard and possibly bring the lady friend there for a date night (they have gnocchi making classes on the top floor).the food was fine, but the atmosphere was a bit stuffy.wine was good, dinner was great.the atmosphere, the dim lighting and the music are perfect for a quiet evening.a magical night in a quiet (yet full) restaurant.we needed a red sauce dish of course so ordered the tagliatelle bolognese ($18 or $12) - a combination of ground pork and beef in a san marzano tomato sauce.the wine list has a few bottles that are priced fairly (around $50 a pop), so that combined with the focaccia that was brought out before our pasta arrived helped pass the time.we arrived for our 8:30 reservation and were seated outdoors.i found this little gem because of yelp.it&#39;s location inside a townhouse makes the experience even more intimate and special.easy to find parking.josie, our server was welcoming, friendly, attentive and extremely knowable about the wine list.i found myself laughing after my first bite of my entree because it was so unexpected.this is not a &#34;scene&#34; restaurant and it&#39;s off the beaten path for visitors to chicago, but it&#39;s exactly the kind of place you&#39;d want to quietly celebrate good news with family members or take a date with whom you want to engage in real conversation.the flavor was pretty overwhelming on spice (cloves?) and salt."

taza-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/taza-cafe-chicago,2,"It was delicious and i had enough left over to add with a salad for dinner later, so it&#39;s a good value too.my lunchmate got the lunch plate and said it was outrageous in size, tasty, and worth every bit of the..i have ordered many things from this place, and i have enjoyed every one....--grape leaves (not the correct name for the item) were super tastycons--chicken was dry, not that flavorful--not a ton of side choices, no salad option like roti--hummus was very average--pita bread was cold, didn&#39;t taste fresh, below average.who knows? i didn&#39;t stroll in way past lunch time though - came in at 1:15.i always have the special which is 2 meats, rice and lentils, hummus veggies and pita bread and end up having left overs for dinner or the next day.the first time i was impressed with the lentil soup and tabbouli.the food was.fantastic!!  cheap and quick but so delicious, and everyone was super friendly!  had the combo plate with a really great falafel and some super tender gyro meat.this place was okay, but i won&#39;t be ordering again.i&#39;ve sampled a majority of the menu over the past year and loved everything i tried.great lunch!.i thought the chicken was extremely dry (it appears they use white meat chicken here instead of most places that go with a dark meat chicken on the spit) and the gyro was fairly typical.they also have a great &#34;dinner&#34; special for $21, where you get a catering pan full of gyro, chicken, rice, fallafel, hummus and pita (enough to seriously feed 5 people, if not more), which might be the best deal the city.the humos was average at best.&#34;where&#39;s the hummus, tahini, cucumbers, fries, pickles, etc? it doesn&#39;t have to include all of these, but at least some would be nice.i don&#39;t know if i&#39;ll go back which is sad since it&#39;s my favorite lunch spot for my breaks.the taste was pretty good, but not enough to warrant a 5-star.the owners were supper nice and inviting, which is why we went back 3 times before we headed back to arizona!.great gyro sandwich and good falafel.i went today and got 2 chicken shawarma salads.this places fills up pretty quickly around noon..also, what could be more enticing than hot falafel wafting in your face for samples?!everyone in our party when we visited chicago was happy: our vegetarian said the falafel sandwich was delicious.this is my favorite spot for lunch..back to roti.the falafel were kind of hard and very dense.great service! the people working there r friendly and nice.are there other places with better pitas?  yes.definitely get falafel.the workers will immediately make you feel right at home.food : loved it, really healthy, good for diet conscious peopleambience : casual, good place to have a quick mealcustomer service : really friendlyoverall : inexpensive and for quick healthy food..i&#39;m looking forward to having more.it is simply one of th best, and in some way reminds me of the ny chicken over rice.they&#39;re also generous with their lemon wedges on the side (a must).despite the dryness of the meat it&#39;s flavor was plentiful with all the delicious spices it was cooked in.however, i find the food bland with not enough seasoning and flavors at other middle eastern places nearby.but that is all: good, not great, not &#34;amazing.i ordered the special combo that included chicken, gyro, and a falafel ball and a side of hummus and cous cous salad for $10.it was okay, but compared to the hummus plate i normally get at naf naf it really didn&#39;t do it for me.like another yelper recommended, grab a cup of ice water with your meal.although it&#39;s possible that i may just have been lucky enough to have experienced really awesome and authentic mediterranean food, making me jaded.i wasn&#39;t sure how the falafel would keep after a 10ish minute walk back to the office.pretty good place to eat.my favorite lunch spot! i usually get the vegetarian plate and lentil soup.my coworker introduced this place to me years ago and i have been spoiled ever since..i love you lentil soup from taza.they are very nice here, and the food is amazing!  even the &#34;greek salad&#34; was good.having never eaten greek before i had to ask what things were.so the place pretty much rests on the laurels of its food.try the morrocan chicken.staff is always extremely friendly also."
de-quay-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/de-quay-chicago-4,1,"It isn&#39;t big so i&#39;d highly recommend advance reservations.for appetizers, a friend and i ordered the frites, crispy and light and that come with a peanut satay sauce and mayo with dill; the nasi goreng, spicy fried rice packed with heat and roaring with flavor; and the black pepper gouda dumplings, rich and creamy and gone in two seconds once you taste them they&#39;re so delicious.the sommelier terry is so nice.what made our visit outstanding wasn&#39;t just the food but the engaging hosts from the general manager to the bartender to the server.loved it, unassuming restaurant with amazing food and even better service.5 hour meal.the nasi goring was good though not like home.we had the chicken satay which is by far the best i have tasted.the drinks were good as well..i had the de quay &#34;nasi goreng&#34;.the duck was done well, it had the right texture, but the glaze didn&#39;t stand out at all, neither did the side of apples and greens..food:for our appetizer we split the black pepper gouda dumplings.so happy we did! everything we tried was delicious and had a different flavor profile than anything i&#39;ve had before.a layered almond cake with pistachio ice cream and a divine chocolate rice pudding with cherries and a sprig of thyme.add this to our list to bring out-of-towners.fantastic service and superb food.they do make good kroupeouk, but a six year old with a vat of boiling oil can make that.overall, very much enjoyed our experience!.and terry and his team have simply tremendous food combined with some of the best service we have received world over! excellent ambience, friendly staff (danny is awesome!) perfect service! we came here for my wife&#39;s birthday and terry and team made it a joyful celebration!!we will be back for more, esp.highly recommended!.this was an enjoyable meal.excellent food.for entrees, we ordered the porkchop with rookworst, buttermilk chicken, braised beef, duck with the pear salad, and the lamb chops.the entrees were also delicious.went to de quay recently for restaurant week with a group of girl friends and we had a great experience..my mouth and body were left completely satiated.nasi goreng - indonesian fried rice - is hugely popular in the netherlands.i took a friend for her birthday dinner and in her thank you note to meshe said &#34;it is definitely one of the best meals i have had in chicago..dessert was delicious too but not as &#34;wow &#34; as the main meal.the service in this place is very good, our server never stop refilling our water and is always there to attend to our needs.wait staff very responsive and attentive.we&#39;ve been to hundreds of restaurants around downtown chicago and this is seriously a top 10 of them.nice ambiance with dim lights and cute decor.i&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t get a table, we learned so much about the restaurant from the staff behind the bar.i shared with a friend.we will be back again soon and bring more friends to share in this amazing experience.we liked the compact menu -- it features a blend of dutch and indonesian choices that i haven&#39;t encountered before.the food was interesting and terrific all around.i had the braised rabbit and i am still apologizing to bugs bunny for devouring the dish the way that i did.a really awesome meal.it is a beautiful place for a quiet and intimate dinner both for date night and group meals.good starting point for fish development.overall, neighborhood gem for date night or dining alone (there&#39;s a nice bar to sit at as well).top notch and will definitely be back!.i highly recommend this place for a night out.the sauces..for entrees, i tried the chicken, shrimp, and beef short rib.yep.the food at this place was fantastic (the duck was unreal), but what really convinced me to write a review was the service.my buttermilk chicken did the trick and if you don&#39;t order the stroopwafel you should just consider ending your life.we both agreed that it was quite good and filling but it wasn&#39;t amazing.for our entrees, i had the tamarind and sweet soy barbecued duck while my wife went with the buttermilk marinated chicken thigh with indonesian aromatics.i came here with 7 friends to celebrate a birthday and we had an amazing time.i write this review with some hesitancy.we also had the gouda dumplings and tamarind bbq duck, both of which were delicious and well prepared.our server gave us the rundown: some dishes are exclusively dutch, some exclusively indonesian, and others a very well calculated mix of the two.our only feedback for improvement is that the pork was slightly over cooked but has excellent flavor nonetheless.so grateful - but even beyond that stellar service i would recommend this place to anyone!!.a gem in any city and a standout in chicago, which has many lovely restaurants.had the shrimp sate and lamb curry for entrees.nasi goreng came with condiments that on their own i could nibble on forever, but the rice itself didn&#39;t have much flavor except for spicy and a bit sweet..the manager came be my table a few times to check and see that i was enjoying my dinner and even offered a glass of sparkling wine on the house.more importantly, the staff is friendly, helpful, and  knowledgeable.one more tip: erwin helfer and barrelhouse chuck, chicago jazz institutions, play for tips in the &#39;secret&#39; and lovely lounge in the second floor of barrelhouse flats two blocks north.they were very nice and asked us to pick some other dishes instead.the mussels are amazing!!! the sauce with the mussels we used to put on the fried rice.the food was really incredible.flush with white ordered the bartender can recommend.we got the almond spekkoek for dessert and it was basically like eating a marzipan cake.this is all about the service, i haven&#39;t even started on the food.i will certainly go back and experience more of it all with more people so we can and will order one of everything on the menu.we will be back!!.would be a great date spot or a dinner with a few friends.the first time we went, we started with the cauliflower cream appetizer which i thought was very tasty, bf didn&#39;t think it was anything special, mostly because there are so many other good options.go for the food, but not after 10:00.very impressed, especially with the service."
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,2,"We love their okonomiyaki, agedashi tofu, scallop rolls with salmon roe, grilled saba, sashimi, chicken karaage and so much more.the restaurant looks really neat from the outside, and definitely drew my attention.i have been eating sushi for 27 years and sampled the best from all over the globe.the staff was slightly slow, but attentive enough.we came in on a thursday night around 7pm and we were the only people at the restaurant.you should dine here!.i have only had their sushi though..tekka maki and mochi ice cream (green tea)..i wish i discovered this place sooner! it&#39;s such a cute little japanese joint.try the hawaiian poke and the hamachi jalapeño for appetizers.amazing oyster shooters - spicy, fresh, sour, and salty - explosion of flavors with two oysters in each shot! the sushi flavors were also pretty good, although i wasn&#39;t a fan of the ika that they used (it wasn&#39;t the typical ika somen, more white and maybe cooked seeming rather than the transparent kind).can&#39;t really mess that up.we were the only people in there.excellent ramen and sushi.i ordered the spicy miso ramen, my bad, as i normally don&#39;t eat a lot of salt in my diet.the presentation was noteworthy, and the mochi was pretty standard.in many places, they would just offer a veggie sub.i still haven&#39;t had anything on their menu that i didn&#39;t enjoy!..tsu kiji has quickly become my favorite neighborhood sushi spot.the sushi here is fantastic! the okonomiyaki is one of the best things i&#39;ve ever tasted.great place to eat out and also order in from.absolutely worth the trip in from the western &#39;burbs!.i totally doubt there is something fishy going on..the hamaguri sakamusi (steamed clams in sake broth) is wonderful - we get it as an appetizer every time.i saw sushi lying there that seemed to be unrefrigerated and wondered how it could have been fresh.rainbow roll was excellent.first time trying and the fish was fresh and tasty.love this place.highly recommend this place..one of the best tonkotsus i have had since leaving california.ordered through grubhub..only bummer is its on the pricier side.guys.most of the places i like  have a polite  staff  and are reasonably quick, but take enough time to make good fresh food.very vast array of cooked foods and sushis.ultimately we all left laughing because there was nothing left to do.best sushi in the city! i have ordered from this place numerous times but never went to the actual restaurant until last night.great spot.they moved to a bigger space and i can see why.it&#39;s legit, guys &amp; gals.i&#39;d expect it to be busier, but since it&#39;s not that always means we never wait for a table!.this is the place.the maki&#39;s we&#39;ve had were pretty awesome.i appreciate that they don&#39;t also have thai (like so many sushi places do these days) and just focus on one cuisine.so glad i did! my girlfriends and i wanted sushi before heading to a show this eve, and we came here..hands down my favorite sushi spot in chicago.wow! authentic ramen, fresh sushi, friendly service.what can i say, it&#39;s just that good.the only thing i would criticize was the ramen as the noodles were off a bit.awesome ambiance including the lighting, music, decor, and the paint designs on the wall.the tonkotsu ramen, however, was pretty disappointing--the broth was way too salty, and the noodles were slightly overdone and strangely wide for ramen noodles.the nigiri was whatever, the uni and fish weren&#39;t as fresh as i expected.will not come back.if you come in the winter, get the tonkotsu ramen, add a little chili oil on the side and boom! amanzingness!!!..went tonight for dinner and had a great experience.caramel sauce on top.the sukiyaki and kara miso ramen are among my favorites."

il-vicinato-ristorante-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-vicinato-ristorante-chicago,2,"Unfortunately, because of the way that the owner handled my complaint over the dried out pork chop, i am not inclined to return.service was a bit slow- but as long as you are not in a hurry and don&#39;t mind lingering over the meal, i don&#39;t think it will be a big problem.entree&#39; choices were their signature home-made ravioli with veal sauce, and one of the specials: tortellini with gorgonzola and fig in an alfredo sauce.have been going here since the 90&#39;s, food has stayed pretty much the same, neighborhood has not, remember my father taking me here when i was a kid, you feel like you&#39;re in some old italian lady&#39;s kitchen when you dine there, calamari is some of the best we ever had.i park on western and usually get a spot.definitely a unique story.twice-baked clams, veal ravioli, shrimp, meatballs, figs wrapped in bacon..he also brought us a special little treat from the kitchen that we didn&#39;t ask for - some charred jalapenos to eat with the bread and olive oil, which we had never had before.the food is great, service is great too!  best meat sauce ever.and, they make the best chicken parmesan in the city!!!  i love this place for the neighborhood feel, and they are totally affordable.check there daily specials those are great as well!!!..we were more than excited because we read the specials while waiting for a table.i&#39;ve been here twice before for dinner and was very happy with my meals.it was really good! the portions for both the salad and ravioli were very large too...phenomenal restaurant..great food, great service, great atmosphere.only people in the restaurant seemed to be lost tourist, like us.they are also part ofrestaurant.if you are still hungry, the homemade ravioli in meat sauce is incredible! by far one of the best!! we frequent at least once a month and have never been disappointed!! the staff is  always warm &amp; gracious!as for the negative reviews?

guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-chicago,2,"Chicken was fried beautifully.the staff is also really friendly, which i always appreciate..i tend to get delivery from here because it&#39;s quick.i wasn&#39;t expecting much off the sides, as most yelp-ers seem to think they are lackluster, but we had the baked beans, the coleslaw, and the mac and cheese and thought all were really, really good.we also got the cole slaw and mac and cheese - which contrary to what others are saying, i thought were fine.you charge these prices, load up on the beans and slaw, eh?.absolutely fantastic chicken worth the price.typically when i read titles like, &#39;world famous,&#39; i think,&#34;yeah, right!&#34; but gus&#39;s fried chicken definitely has a world famous taste! i got the 2 thigh and one leg plate with mac and cheese and beans for sides..the fried pickles and okra are a true southern treat, fried crisp to order.and when she brought out fries and we alerted her, we got another sigh.i loved the fried okra, the french fries were terrible and so was the potato salad so just stick to the original cold slaw and beans if you must.i ordered three tenders, fries, and mac and cheese.i love fried chicken.sides can also be substituted for a small cost.that being said, every time i think about going i am reminded how terrible the choice to use styrofoam plates and cups makes me feel.i ordered the 12 chicken special and asked for 6 wings and 6 legs.for $25 (two two-piece meals and the pie), i would expect a little more food, and if you are spoiled by more soul food-ish places like harold&#39;s or uncle remus, ponying up $25 for fried chicken in the west loop will be a punch to the gut.i ordered a small side of the mac n cheese.the mac &amp; cheese was on the kraft side and i prefer baked.the dude suggested that i check out gus&#39;, and offered to pick it up for me (he&#39;s nice like that).it was amazing! the bartender was very welcoming and friendly.chicago&#39;s first taste of the world famous fried chicken!fried chicken is still the in thing for new restaurants in the city.50 for a tiny slice.there is nothing famous about it.dude fries each piece of chicken like it is his last.i would gladly come back to gus&#39;s, but i like places such as buck&#39;s, and especially the roost, better.took a stool at the bar and quickly put in an order.one of my favorites (although most unhealthy) is fried chicken.while the okra was light and tasty, the greens were way too salty.chicken so crispy you feel your crunching might be audible to others, yet so moist you keep a napkin at the ready!the service is fast and friendly, the down home feel a bit hipsterized but pretty spot-on considering i&#39;ve been to the hole-in-the-wall original on hwy 70 in mason, tn many times -  and while it costs a bit more here, it&#39;s still a great price for chicago.we each got the 2 piece white meat with the greens, slaw, fried okra, and the beans..you&#39;re welcome chicago!!!!!.greens were good too.we even saved room for desert and ordered the chocolate chess pie which was like a gooey warm brownie pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.the chicken had a nice flavor, was fried well and had a nice spice to it in which i like.the collard green sides were delicious.and i&#39;m not super into anything fried but it&#39;s a must have.awesome! i have ordered from this place twice...i&#39;m pretty disappointed that gus&#39; was actually worse than harold&#39;s even though it was almost twice as expensive, give or take a few cents.they also kept coming back to ask if everything was ok, even the manager monica came by a few times to check on everything.i&#39;ll try a diff side next time.lol how is this place world famous?i mean the name is a total send off.slaw is great.service was very good and the server was chatty and fun.the batter is so complex to me, and i have never had anything like it.but it was really juicy and flavorful!  the mac n cheese was meh.hot sauce on fried chicken is a pretty common exercise and using your own hot sauce could seperate you from the competition.been here several times and every time the food does not disappoint me.the beans tasted like they came out of a can, the greens were meh and the fried okra was the biggest let down.i&#39;m weak when it comes to spice and this was just the right amount for me - gave it a good kick, kept my mouth tingling but didn&#39;t make me feel like i was close to death.when you literally call yourself &#34;world famous&#34;, you betta live up to the hype! and they do!they fried my breast fairly quickly, so i was dubious that the meat was cooked all the way inside.&#34; slow down.chicken was juicy and moist.40&#39;s available upon request.located in the west loop fulton market.this place is over hyped.it is goals.will definitely be back! this chicken is so good, you&#39;ll take yo&#39; shoes off -- so you can wiggle your toes! started with the fried pickles.the pie slices aren&#39;t ginormous, but my body would be upset with the calorie count had i downed two slices.if you get sweet tea, they have unlimited refills.the chicken was super hot and juicy and the batter thin and crispy.the way people have raved about this i thought it might be a worthy contender to some of the outstanding chicken spots i have visited, much like a hollyhock in indianapolis, worthy of a drive to satisfy a lust for some crispy bird.this fried chicken was perfect.prices, including wine/drinks, are reasonable.at the rate that west loop is filling in with new eateries, no one who frequents that area will have a reason for complaining about what to sample.french fries were good, but fried pickles were not my thing.it&#39;s like, top notch fried chicken.we passed by gus&#39;s on the way to brunch and couldn&#39;t help but notice the smells! glancing through the window, the space looked pretty busy for a sunday afternoon.."
chicago-q-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chicago-q-chicago,1,"The benedict was unique with a creole style hollandaise and fried green tomatoes instead of the typical carbohydrate that is served with a good old fashioned benny..it definitely ended the meal on a high note.he didn&#39;t steer is wrong once.the food is most important, though, and chicago q shines there as well.bartender pat was simply phenomenal.really good bloodymaryreally really good bbq.louis style ribs and i was incredibly happy with them.that said, it is a wonderful setting and the patio is a nie place to gather with friends on a summer evening just temper expectations.this cheesy dish will more than satisfy any mac &amp; cheese addict.great food reasonable prices with tons of food!my friend had the cobb salad, another had the mac n cheese.great food - a bit too high class setting for barbecue, but the meats and sauces were good.i been here quite a few times but didn&#39;t realize they had a good brunch.everything seems brand-new and it&#39;s very modern.more.he rates it 4 stars because the flavor was phenomenal but the meat was just a bit too dry, and the corn bread that came with it seemed to be old (extra dry and hard).if you&#39;re watching your carbs, pass on the meh cornbread and save room for the peanut butter pie.the problem was everything else..food is delicious.came on a weekday lunch and restaurant was quite slow..the slaw and fries were mediocre at best, and again, nothing to rave about..we went to brunch here on sunday and had the worst dining experience we had in chicago.but enough about my salad since i&#39;m sure most people don&#39;t go there ordering salads.i like my ribs with the sauce on them already and it&#39;s nice and warm.my wife and i arrived at chicago q for our first experience this past saturday at about 6 p.the  atmosphere is relaxed and interesting.first, don&#39;t let the outside of this place fool you.when i flipped over the brisket piece it was seared on the bottom, which is a no-no in the barbecue world.that is above and beyond.it would more likely to change your mind!.i can say the competition are great, but, the normal ribs were just as good to me..the carrot cake was ok.the steak was cooked to perfection.the steak was nearly the size of his head though so he couldn&#39;t finish it, but gladly took the rest to-go.we were seated immediately, but waited and waited for a server.service was phenomenal, food exceptional, and great brunch spot.the beer list was decent as well.but no worries folks, the salmon over arugula and kale was to die for! it was cooked to perfection, seasoned deliciously and the house dressing left my mouth watering.the building itself is really cool and quite different from most chicago restaurants, very spacious.ericka ordered her steak medium rare, the first time it came out it was well done and the second time it was rare.however, last night&#39;s dining experience was not one i would consider a good one.would definitely go back, maybe for dinner next time to focus more on the bbq menu.never coming back here....i was staying at a hotel just up the street so i figured i&#39;d try some bbq.my first time here, i was not disappointed.the bbq smoked chicken is excellent if you don&#39;t like pork or beef, but the pork and beef are superb, including the brisket.ordered the pulled pork and brisket with a side of fries.omg!  we got the bbq flight appetizer and the burnt ends appetizer.we haven&#39;t had barbecue this good in ages.the brisket here does not disappoint..overall, amazing service, great ambiance, the food is delicious and very fairly priced.it was marvelous.the downfall was the service, our waiter never came back to refill our drinks and i ordered cornbread but it never came although we were charged for it.if you&#39;re looking for a classier bbq joint.we also had their potato salad and an order of smoked chicken wings.the place is actually pretty huge! looks smaller on the outside...ball the runners were so attentive to us that anything i asked was brought to me.such a great place! delicious barbecue &amp; sauces&#39;.went for bunch and ordered the prime brisket eggs benedict which did not disappoint -- generous portions and the meat melted in your mouth.i haven&#39;t had hush puppies in a long time, so these were an amazing reintroduction.it lacked flavor in my opinion.i ordered the blackened fish with cornbread and slaw and my companion ordered the prime brisket eggs benedict."

summer-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/summer-house-chicago,1,"The whole restaurant has a glass ceiling, which makes it so bright inside on nice days and there are numerous ferns hanging from the ceiling to help make this outdoor/indoor concept really work! very coastal feel.99) -- excellent value!  perfect.i was initially disappointed because i had made a reservation online and when i called to increase the size of my party and we were told that they could not accommodate 2 additional people, but when we arrived it seemed that the restaurant seemed to empty out soon after 2:30pm so maybe they could have worked something out?anyway, it&#39;s a beautiful place with plenty of natural light.very bright, open room that is great for brunch.variety of goodies to choose from.i&#39;ll definitely be back.the menu is simple prepared and diverse with local/seasonal dishes.everything was just super fresh and yummy!we ended our meal by splitting a homemade chocolate chip cookie with ice cream.a beautiful restaurant, with solid service and food.like the sahara desert.it also got some fried cucumbers mixed in there.i checked in and the waitress happily honored the yelp free guac n chips promo.all of that with awesome food and a great beer selection, and i didn&#39;t even feel bad about not eating at my usual lincoln park lunch spot.food is just alright.they have a great wine list as well.also, props for handling what must be a mountain of blue gingham in each of their closets (it&#39;s the only shirt servers are allowed to wear).i had the avocado toast which was delish! we grabbed some cookies to go and they were amazing.summer house has a great vibe! it&#39;s always buzzing and the service is great.the ambience is great (the garage door was open so we sat near the outside tables) and our server was great as well.i used bar napkins to wipe it myself.the thing that caught my eye the most was their rosé bar cart! they had so many options.make sure you make reservations because it&#39;s always packed!.if you are in the area, you really have no excuse not to come try summerhouse out for yourself!.my boyfriend got the seared tuna tacos which were amazing.i might come back if someone else wanted to, but it&#39;s not on my list of favorites in chicago.side order of brussel sprouts for 5 halves burnt charcoal style.get bacon on it! i can&#39;t believe it is an option it should be already on it..just before our table was ready the host brought a glass of champagne to those who had been waiting longer than expected which was a nice surprise.besides the bread fiasco, the salmon had no seasoning and zero flavor and the fries were unseasoned as well and just not good.i ate the mashed potatoes on the side.....the host stands are to either side of the entry way, not super obvious, and took me a few minutes to find.walking into summer house feels like you&#39;re leaving chicago and entering california.good lunch/brunch spot with a nice casual atmosphere.it&#39;s in the nice neighborhood of lincoln park and in a very big space! when you walk in, you&#39;ll be in the lobby where you can purchase coffee and pastries.it&#39;s a really beautiful restaurant - i imagine in the summer, it&#39;s perfect!we were warmly greeted and seated quickly with our reservation (not sure if it&#39;s always packed, but it was really busy during the week for dinner when we visited).i ended my meal with a latte with almond milk and it made for a really nice ending.make no mistake that this is a peanut butter cookie and i love that!4.i could see the wait being tremendously long without one.overall, i would come to the summer house again no questions asked!..my friends love this place so needless to say i&#39;ll be back!  hoping for better service from restaurant and cooking staff.my another friend ordered chicken and waffle.:)-huge cinnamon roll was a huge let down.haha i&#39;m pretty sure i asked the waiter if people had gotten married there, i can only image how beautiful it would be!this place is exactly what i look for when i want to brunch...food drink and wait staff were all great!!!would recommend tuna tartar app and avocado toast.service is good and my waitress was friendly and on point! she made sure we had everything we needed from the minute we walked in the door.my friend had the burger on a gluten free bun.we waited another 20 mins for the burger and when it came it was good.99 was extremely bitter tasting, and i like certain bitter drinks but this was overly bitter with no flavor..we were told there was about a 20 minute wait to be seated at about 2:40 in the afternoon and we headed over to the bar for a few drinks while we waited.all of the employees are super friendly! i am always look forward to coming back!.i got free cookies when i went there for my birthday.that was great..somehow, they made the small space they were given seem larger and more open because of the glass windows overhead.it was that night we were all told there would be a blizzard out..the reason they&#39;re missing one star is due to seating arrangements.on our way out we stopped by the little bakery/sweets cart and i bought a sleeve of their english muffins.great ambiance, delicious brunch, and good service..they use what taste like pizza italian sausage.she brings my drink, but tells my brother it will be a few minutes.after finally having gone, it&#39;s easy to see why it gets so packed."

the best tacos i&#39;ve ever had!! they made the tortillas and chips from scratch!! and they have unique drinks that are great!! you must try - you won&#39;t be disappointed!!! they have brunches on sat/sun and we can&#39;t wait to try it!!!.it was fantastic and i am a tough critic when it comes to guac.i doubt i go back again.so when they started remodeling this place i was surprised to see how nice and modern the place was coming along.one time, i ordered a cheeseburger without the burger at a wendy&#39;s in kentucky.50 each is a little expensive for the size of the tacos despite the deliciousness and quality ingredients.forget the pretense, this place is not super fancy, or expensive, but the food options taste gourmet and the cocktail list has some thought put into it.tv&#39;s for watching games..it&#39;s not quite as good as taco joint and not quite as cheap as bullhead catina, but if you&#39;re in the neighborhood it&#39;s a good alternative.the attention was wonderful, friendly staff brought us our food quickly and steaming.the steak was my favorite.my gal pal and i ventured here for sunday brunch recently.the place looked clean and our server that evening was top notch.such great food.there&#39;s not a lot to say.a-mazing mexican food!! we scarfed it down! we&#39;re all really impressed with the quality of our meals (especially given that it&#39;s takeaway and an hour before closing) and happy to finally have a great place like this in our otherwise lackluster neighborhood.i read about this place a while back and just got around to checkin it out.we will definitely be back..the tacos i had, including the chorizo and the short rib, tasted very homemade in the best way.a young couple had come and sit by us on the patio.the braised short rib taco.the raspberry sauce was perfect!will definitely come back and take advantage of the patio!.but prices are high and portions are very small.the food was delicious, i had the spicy pumpkin seed guacamole which i totally recommend.i&#39;m not a big fan of brunch in general, but it really doesn&#39;t exist in our neighborhood, until now! my dad is in town, he had chilequellas, delicious! steak was super tender (everything is organic!)..and the tacos!  i had a short rib, steak, and green curry shrimp taco, all of them were total knockouts..i ordered 4 cheese quesadillas, not one quesadilla divided into fourths..i also want to mention how friendly the service was overall.no fake margaritas here.was very fresh.the quesadilla was fine.i haven&#39;t had a full meal there, had some appetizers only.the nicest owner and management -- inventively delicious tacos -- and the best michelada in the city! so glad to have this restaurant in the neighborhood.my family and i will be dining here again.rojo gusano is diverse in its own right -craft but unostentatious taqueria fare and chopsticks at each table for asian-inspired rice bowl offerings, reflecting the demographic mix of the neighborhood..fantastic.i expected the habanero to be spicier but it was enough.it&#39;s more than worth the trip.overall the experience was good here, though i&#39;d probably try something different than tacos next time.we had three tacos each, which let us try a variety and feel satisfied without being uncomfortable.so if you&#39;re in the neighborhood and crave mexican, you should definitely try this restaurant!very friendly stuff! and you have to come there just to check out what they did inside! it has the ambience of a very cool beach bar!your order will take a little waiting and you can easily spend $15 on a very modest portion.came here on a recommendation from a friend and i was not disappointed.food is amazing and has been consistently served warm and fresh.food is great, atmosphere is modern and trendy, they have specials every day of the week, staff is nice and accommodating.the drinks are so very yummy &amp; well made ."
doc-bs-fresh-kitchen-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/doc-bs-fresh-kitchen-chicago-3,2,"The staff is friendly, although they only have 1 person working at the bar, making ordering a drink somewhat of a challenge.she recommended a number of items including the fried chicken sandwich or one of the wok out bowls, but i chose the cajun fish sandwich.this review is based on my order online and takeout experience so i know it&#39;s not a lot to go on but it&#39;s nice to know you can count on accuracy of order and have the entire experience be easy and seemless.the perfect lunch spot before a shopping spree in 900 n michigan..food was fresh and delicious.i&#39;m not sure what did it, maybe it was the best sweet potato fries and black bean soup in chicago (probably in the world), or perhaps the elderflowers that lazily turn my crazy beautiful drink into its namesake, leaving me in a pretty pink reverie.their wok bowls are my favorite, including both the brown rice and noodles as a base with the thai sauce (i am not much of a teriyaki type).the fries were exactly how i like them (want to say truffle), and well-seasoned as well.just a-ok.went through 4 napkins trying to eat the thing.excellent service.when i got my bowl, i realized that i received rice instead of noodles-- not a huge deal, but i asked our server in case it had been a simple mix up.burnt my tongue.i had the ribs and fresh veggies as a side, and i don&#39;t have any complaints.the staff &amp; atmosphere: very nice!coming back again to try to other sandwiches/burgers.service is fast.i took several minutes to stand there and read the menu to decide what i wanted when the person behind the counter finally spoke up and asked me if this was to dine in or take away.i shared this with my husband as an appetizer.she had the wedge burger, which was messy but good.nicki is amazing and takes care of the people! matt and johnny also wonderful.live in houston.really cool place....husband had an arnold palmer.the server filled my drink without me asking and we were brought mouse and warm towels right when we needed them after eating the wings.the food was just kind of blah..i was quickly seated and order taken which was appreciated.their california salad (add extra kale + tofu always) is a legit salad, not some sad side thing &amp; keeps me full all day.great food and amazing service! a must go if you&#39;re visiting chicago.definitively recommend the carnitas sand which with sweet potato fries.i appreciated that we were greeted by a staff member as soon as we were seated, even though they were not our server.5 stars is just beyond comprehension.also very fresh, handcut, crisped perfectly, and they have some sort of herb mixture sprinkled on top.cons:kind of loud, but it&#39;s nothing to fuss over.will be back again and again! we all ordered something different (salads, burgers, sandwiches, wine) - and it all is absolutely delicious!  wonderful friendly staff - our waiter louis was so nice and, friendly and had great customer service.that being said, i am incredibly disappointed in my visit.hubster&#39;s &#34;plate&#34; was an assortment of awesome veggies prepared in a variety of ways.great way to create your own meal while being health conscious and dining out.yummy, yummy!.i did order some fries just to snack on something and they were really good..there was a wait for a table but i was able to slide into the modest bar.it&#39;s difficult to get seated because of the amount of people waiting to get seated.they don&#39;t have ranch here.my mom thought the corn chowder was too creamy, but that may be a personal preference.also love the wok out bowl and the tangled asian noodle salad.i would love to be back to try out the other menu options!..close to the beach, friendly staff, ahhmazing food..happy to hear they are expanding the restaurant chain.cruelty free, too! lots of healthy things in there; black beans, kale slaw, and quinoa.they had plenty of vegetarian options that were not cop-outs--i got the vegetarian plate and it was not only delicious but pretty hearty.they were overcooked, soggy and tasteless.great for catering for clients and i love their salads.i wonder if they were discriminating because of my sister&#39;s disability.recommend it highly.my water was never refilled until i asked.we each ordered a different entree and there were no complaints from anyone at the table.it hit the spot and made me want to come back and try more.i must have swallowed it before it had the chance.disappointed given other good reviews.we happened upon this place and i&#39;m so glad we did."
gilt-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/gilt-bar-chicago,2,"I was in the mood for dessert, and particularly a warm brownie a&#39; la mode.the service was great as well.(and great drinks!)our favorite dish is the steak tartare.everything from the ambiance to the food was on pointe.we got a late dinner here on a saturday night.a little pricey on the food, but definitely a place to go at least once.with the eiffel tower lit up in the background, jezebel, and for their honeymoon they&#39;re going to machu pichu to see the ruins, the mountains are spectacular, mossy with wisps of fog, isis.so cozy but elegant.there was only one waitress for the library, so service was a little slow, but it was actually nice to not rush and to enjoy the spot for a while.i like this place, though i am happy that my work picked up the bill! happy hour here can get a little pricey.we both were in heaven!!!  the ribeye steak was perfectly cooked.all i can say is amazing!.i felt like i was alice from wonderland since i didn&#39;t really know where the dark hallway was leading me..my expectations were high and while the rib eye was good, it wasn&#39;t my favorite dish..literally, i can see it from my living room window :)walk into this dimly lit place.bone marrow!!!! this appetizer was amazing.con: the only reason i&#39;m not able to give 5 stars is that our service was pretty slow..also, the beer list was pretty representative as well.can&#39;t go wrong with this place!.she did serve me another drink that was good - i think it was a dark manhattan - or a black manhattan.the music is at an audible, but not overpowering level.after waiting a good twenty minutes bar tender finally took order.meanwhile, i was washing this down with a well-crafted old-fashioned.they said this was too large a group and the waiters, and kitchen would be a mess and wouldn&#39;t be able to keep up, despite the fact that we had said they could split the group up as they wished.nice lil outdoor patio seating and tasty burrata--great for those summery chicago days/evenings.mussels- freaking awesome! very strong with lemon and thyme and served with good bread for the delicious broth!our bill (without tip) was only $155.we sat at the bar got a drink then he came back over and said if we gave him $60 we could go downstairs.great atmosphere, nice staff.service was good but for the familiar chill/pity vibe as a solo traveller that happens so frequently.they even served it up in an old fashioned soda fountain glass!for one person, my bill was around $50 (without tip).for entrees we had the orecchiette pasta and ricotta gnocchi.i decided upon the coal fired rib eye, which was cooked perfectly.dining on the main floor on a saturday was very lively, spirited, and such fun; the energy was incredible..nothing special.first time having bone marrow in my life and it was better than i expected.roasted and then rested for a hour, it is basted with bone marrow before serving.would go here again, yes.it&#39;s always good and the atmosphere down there is fabulous.leave the kids at home but really enjoy the rich flavors and attention to detail presented in each entree.it really took my eyes a while to adjust to.still, if it weren&#39;t so expensive, then the cocktails probably wouldn&#39;t be so expertly made, the liquor and wine selection wouldn&#39;t be so perfectly curated, and the food wouldn&#39;t be so outstanding.my number one recommendation for any outsider who asks, &#34;where should i go for dinner?&#34;one of my favorite places in the city.good food, super social server and an awesome ambiance! this is the type of place where glamour meets the prohibition era.regardless, you should visit this place just for the food.we ordered a variety of appetizers - brussel sprouts, cauliflower, garlic oil and bread - and enjoyed them all.i liked the decor and atmosphere, although it was pretty dark and some of the tables are really close together.the kitchen closes at 11:45 pm and i got here at 11:27 pm and, sure enough, i sat down at the bar and asked my bartender alexandra for recommendations.g.great place to bring a date, beautiful setting and rustic feel.i had dinner a few times when they opened years ago (maybe in 2008 or 2009).working late (as usual), i found myself with vending machines as my dinner options, and knew i could find better.so, it might be necessary to be a little pushy if you don&#39;t want to end up waiting 15+ minutes at a bar and ignored.5 stars for gilt bar! the ambiance and food were amazing.the plates are large enough to share if you want.the food was amazing.my table was ready for me when i arrived.on one hand, all the flavors and seasonings were phenomenal.the best that we ate though were the truffle pasta and the brussel sprouts -- both were so delicious!the place is super dark but still a fun place to have dinner and drinks.as my wife joked about the mule, &#34;i don&#39;t think they even got two ounces of liquid into a glass this full of ice!!&#34;the best thing about gilt is the price point; we spent exactly $102 last night for enough food and two drinks (that included tax and tip).i thought the noodle/pasta was tough and did not taste as fresh.they have a awesome selection of alcohol and drink options plus i had the best pour over coffee i have ever had in my life!! wow, just all around a spectacular time here, cannot wait to return and sample some of their food menu!!.we had no difficultly getting a table around 8pm on a monday night.we started off with drinks, i went with a whisky sour, which came topped with a lovely egg white froth, and i was super surprise, when i got to the bottom of my drink to find, one of my newly discovered favorite cocktail garnishes, a dirty cherry.i didn&#39;t expect such great food from a limited menu.too much for them to handle, apparently.tip: use the jelly spoon to get the marrow out.are all worth recommending, and they&#39;re very reasonably priced..let me start by saying this place would really be a 5 out of 5 if it wasn&#39;t for the wait staff always complaining how it is just one of those nights to us every time they come up to the table.the menu to my surprise was limited with not much to choose from.they had a secret downstairs restaurant that i think served noodles, but i&#39;m not sure.if you&#39;re tripping on the urge to feel alive, and have a priestess date wearing a velvet dress that passes the test, gilt bar might be a tip-top date spot for you.because the price is on the higher side i would recommend this place for special occasions or for showing someone the town when they&#39;re in chicago for a visit.who cares? it was phenomonal."
bellyq-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bellyq-chicago-2,1,"Both were delicious, good portion size.not.some of it though, was odd.it was just okay.as i said, the food was phenomenal though - ranging from the unique flavors of the curry mac to the comfort food style of the roast pork and grits, these were all unique takes on both asian and american bbq  cuisines.we ordered the pig butt, bellyq fried rice, adamame &amp; avocado hummus, and crab rangoon.also get spices to season the beef before you cook it and sauces on the side for dipping  black balsamic and hot sauce and ponzuyou also get warm side dishes a purple potato salad which was amazing and a bi bap rice which was crunchy and chewy all the same timeeverything was very very  good the wagu was  delicious as with the short ribs the scallops were a little over seasoned  for me the purple asparagus was rocking good.we had reservations which we clearly didn&#39;t need..we had great service and the food came out quickly.it also seemed very upscale and clean, loved the decor.beautiful place.i mean bacon with a crunchy tempura breading served with maple sake..1&#34; was also unique.delicious food but the quantity sucks! went here for a special even and i dropped off a cake earlier in the day to surprise the bday person and they were nice enough to keep it until i got there for dinner.the ribs were slightly over-grilled because the edges of the meat were dry.it had major mushroom morsels and chopped chunks of chicken to complement the lovely and light lemongrass.also, previous dinner companions included friends with various food restrictions ( gluten free, vegan, paleo - once all in one dinner) and the staff was super accommodating.the meal started off auspiciously with a curry squash soup..but food just kept coming and coming and each better and better.after dinner, we mentioned the birthday girl loves karaoke and our waitress spoke with the general manager and in a matter of minutes, they opened the private karaoke room just for us !! before we knew it, we opened the door and realized it was 30 minutes after close and the staff still was so pleasant to us - they had to have known how horrible we felt!overall, the food will fill your belly and the service will make you smile!.it ran right up to when the kitchen closes.i would highly recommend the lamb satay! the cocktails are well designed and delicious as well.i&#39;ve been to their other location belly shack and really enjoyed it so i was expecting good things.overall, this seemed to be one of the fancier bill kim restaurants.our server knew his $hit - even kids options and veggie options: he recommended their sister restaurant&#39;s menu, urban belly for their chicken and rice for the kid and mushroom ramen for me - both excellent choices..i just don&#39;t understand why the bar is never full, it&#39;s the best seat in the house with service to match.forgot his name- but tall guy and very cool.i have defiantly had better, but this is not the southside and i should expect the ribs to be a-ok.for the price, i probably would only come back for a very special occasion.5 stars for that..korean short ribs i can eat for every meal.we had the b...my friend was very happy with the japanese beer that he helped him pick as well.i was here with a group of people in the private room, which has karaoke.the mac n &#39; cheese comes with thick round noodles with melted cheese and some great spices, including  curry..i came at around 9 on a friday night with my fiance and did not need to wait for seats at the bar.we had dinner here recently and went as a group of 6 and had the tasting menu, everything was delicious, the optional dumpling course is a must if you do go for that menu.but small portion..i had the sweet potato potsticker and i loved it but no one else liked it.the bowl was amazing.i will attempt to explain as best i can.5 stars but i can&#39;t..the staff were so helpful and accommodating, especially with small things like bringing out the kids&#39; food first and providing special meals for the vegetarians in the group..i appreciated the old mixed with the new.soo fresh and the most perfect flavors/spices..so many options and all were great.note: we did not complain about this because we all had trains to catch.just ate here for an early father&#39;s day dinner after a day in the city.but before that it was pretty free.was quite happy with my brunch choice and would highly recommend it..the food was tasty, grilling much of it ourselves was entertaining and the cocktail menu is awesome! reservations definitely required for the grill table..the meal started off good (rib tips and papaya salad) and then took a turn for the worst."
rangoli-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rangoli-chicago,2,"My parents from montana (where there is little food diversity!) agreed to try this place while visiting, and both couldn&#39;t stop talking about it their entire trip!if you go during peak weekend dinner hours, expect to wait if you don&#39;t have a reservation--which would be anywhere worth going in chicago without a reservation! it&#39;s a small, cozy restaurant with nice decor.absolutely delicious, best indian i&#39;ve had in chicago..you won&#39;t be disappointed with single profile flavors or bland meals..was expecting very much out of this place, food was decent but nothing special i will visit again.i feel like some indian restaurants tend to water their food down or the basic items will lack in flavor, but not here..the service is a disorganized, as is the front of the house, but the food and ambiance made up for it.upon calling the restaurant to check our delivery status at 8 pm and three other times there after, none of our calls were picked up and the voicemail was full.if you enjoy food that challenges you, this is your place, if you don&#39;t, steer clear.great indian food.* plain and garlic naan - bread with butter and garlic flavor.3$+ for naan!! and it&#39;s not the best i have had! most places on devon charge 75 cents a piece, 3-4$ is crazy! all the dishes are overpriced, most were excellent but none the best i have had.i&#39;ve eaten many butter chickens in my day and this is a very good one.price was pretty decent - we ended up paying 70 (incl.okay, so i was soo excited to try this place since i&#39;ve had it on my bookmarked list for quite some time and heard so many good things about it..order delivery at your own risk!pro-tip: order through grubhub so you can quickly receive any potential refund involved.i really appreciated their level of consideration and desire to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.the platter was 2 parter and they arrived at different times, which was weird in the wrong way.i phoned ahead and ordered naan, two samosas and chicken tikka masala.it&#39;s a shame, really.it was truly one of the coldest nights in chicago and the boy wanted something different, so he picked indian via grub hub.delicious traditional indian food.advised by rangoli staff, we ordered half pans of butter chicken, tarka dal, and mutter paneer (peas &amp; cheese), along with a dozen veggie samosas, plenty of naan, and two regular orders of aloo gobi.it was a really nice touch that they kept coming up to make sure things weren&#39;t too spicy.the flavors were still amazing and butter chicken is a staple at every indian restaurant, so i would still get it.if i have to choose between fresh and fast i choose fresh!  but yes you come here for the food, not exceptional service.my friends and i were dressed kinda ghetto but we were polite and quiet, still, the service was bull, we weren&#39;t treated as customers, what were they expecting dine and dash? we didn&#39;t get a menu until asked for and this place was practically empty except for 4 other tables who were already eating.it can be a long wait, but it&#39;s worth it.small and cozy..atmosphere: this place is small and gets filled and a cramped waiting area is quickly followed.we came to rangoli for my boyfriend&#39;s birthday because we love indian food.used to really like this place.it took over 2 hours!!!! the app said 60-70 mins so after 90 mins i called.we ate in and ordered lamb vindaloo and a chicken dish with spices.rangoli has amazing indian food and an authentically indian atmosphere with their decor and seating arrangements! however, if you plan to eat in, i highly recommend making reservations.this place is legit!   i&#39;ve been to devon street spots and other restaurants around the city, but rangoli is the place i crave!  great, authentic environment; friendly &amp; attentive staff; &amp; amazing food!   i love that their food brings the heat - there&#39;s no dumbing it down for westerners.get here at a decent time or you&#39;ll have to wait a while.all in all, it was pretty good..my husband and i tried the food here a year ago for carry out since we live in the neighborhood, and were not impressed.we tracked down the guy with his pad of paper, &#34;thirty minutes&#34; he said.we knew that it would be the worth the wait.i was so happy when i found an awesome indian restaurant on the west side of chicago.pick up or a delivery might be a better option :).i thought the food was good.i just recently moved from san francisco where it seemed like the indian was always cheap and good.if you want to try rangoli go to the restaurant for pick-up or eat inside.my sister lives down the street and i don&#39;t know how she doesn&#39;t eat here every single night.have to try more dishes.they pack everything nicely to stay warm.recommended.*star*.it provides your body with waves of sweaty thunder bolts that makes you both nervous and excited to be alive.the palak paneer was watered down with not much flavor..food was great - flavor was on spot!the temperature of the dishes brought out all the flavors and spices.i myself am indian and have been eating and going to devon street since before i could walk.rangoli has surpassed my expectations every time.when we came in, there wasn&#39;t really too many people so the waiters were able to put 2 tables together to make us more comfortable, which i really appreciated."
papas-cache-sabroso-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/papas-cache-sabroso-chicago,1,"Unfortunately, that&#39;s were the improvements end.steak jibarito was fantastic.some of the other places in the area are very inconsistent with hours and available items.i love this place man, the best rice, fried plaintain sandwich (jibarito - hib a reet oh) and good nice owners who care about the quality of food and service.we had to wait 25 mins for rice and when our food came the chicken was dry with not much flavor? when our check came we were surprised to see a 20% gratuity already added to our check? what? we were only a party of 4? although the lechon and rice were delicious, the tip situation totally put a bad taste in my mouth.i waited a half hour to be served glasses for our drinks very very rude.the food is good though but service can use some help.although, i never arrive home from the drive to the restaurant with the food i just ordered because i&#39;ve eaten it on the ride back..then they hung up on me.loved the steak flavor combined with the garlicky plantains.either they totally forget items, add cheese to one but not the other, or pick what they give you instead of fulfilling the order.also.get the rest, get you some rice, get you a pop or malta, but get that chicken jibarito special.when i bit into it i literally just tasted mayo, the meat had lost the little flavor i can taste..overall, awesome food and service..as a latin man, it&#39;s hard to eat latin dishes because mom is always the queen...also their rotisserie chicken is to die for.juicy and well seasoned..but if you believe that there is somewhere else better please send  me message of your  suggestion.service amazing - it&#39;s byob but there is a liquor store across street.i really enjoy their chicken and pork jibarito and consider it to be tied for best jibarito in chicago (with the shrimp jibarito at joey&#39;s shrimp house a few blocks away).the jibarito is outstanding, the chicken is juicy &amp; delicious, and try the taco&#39;s with momma&#39;s hot sauce..i got my order around 10:10pm.no one smiles and that kills the whole vibe..their food is not healthy by any means, but it is fresh, homemade, and leaves you feeling like you just left your puerto rican grandma&#39;s house even if you don&#39;t have a puerto rican grandma!the wait can be a little long, as the servers can be chatty with their regulars and the chefs are busy completing to go orders, but other than that the service is good!.i can appreciate that this is a small family run establishment, but even if the food is good, poor service will keep me away.my mom has gotten the rotisserie chicken for our family and everyone loved it!.it was just way tooo oily for me.edit:food was terrible this time too.i tried a piece of it and loved the perfectly spiced flavor and she was very happy with it.definitely going back!.this is great for jibaritos! enough said.absolutely wonderful.the steak jibarito is a winner ! loved the fried garlicky plantains used as the &#34;bread&#34; for the sandwich.i just wish they&#39;d open a bigger location!.there should never be an excuse for that.i heard the chicken here is good too! i will be coming back many times that&#39;s for sure!.lol.went here a couple days ago with friends and i ordered &#34; mamas salad &#34; which wasn&#39;t your ordinary salad, it was more like stir fry and the chicken was dry.reason why i gave them 3 start was because i had taste better ones but this one was good nothing wrong just not impress but in overall was a nice rican rest.service was quick and they have a parking lot right across the street.all in all, it was an ok experience but i wouldn&#39;t go back again.i didn&#39;t call ahead to place my take-out order, which was my mistake.love this place everything on the menu taste like moms cooking.i found myself eating the beans even though i don&#39;t really like beans - they were done just that well! oh, and the maduros were perfect too, thin caramelization on the outside and sweet and luscious on the inside.i live in the south suburbs and i plan to be back before the end of the week.there was also this welcoming and homey feel to the restaurant.i freaking love this place with the exception of their rice.they can easily run out of specials before they close..i was shocked that i had not written a review for one of my favorite puerto rican restaurants (or if i want to change it up and get my freak-on with other pr joints i hit up la plena or juanita&#39;s).my hairstylist recommended papa cache&#39;s for pr food that i was craving!! it is such a small place, but they do have an outdoor covered patio.i tell all my friends about papa cache.the food was delicious i had steak i highly recommended it.the odd thing is that they automatically added a 20% tip onto our bill, even though it was only a party of five.it is truly worth the wait.eat al fresco!.oh my gosh, the best ever!.the meat was flavorful with a great texture; add in the lettuce, tomato, and white cheese.awesome rotisserie chicken lots of flavor the place is small but the service is awesome.overall, the food was absolutely excellent and we both really enjoyed our extremely reasonably priced huge meals!!! we will definitely be back.my new fave spot.hopefully they increased the quality of the delivery processes because the food is great.it&#39;s a pretty laid back type of place."
ramen-takeya-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ramen-takeya-chicago-2,2,"I love that the soup/broth focuses on chicken here, though the ramen i had definitely had a japanese-inspired chicken noodle soup vibe going on.we started with pork belly and spicy chicken buns..anyways, my boyfriend and i both got the vegan ramen and it was so delicious.service is usually good, but had a couple of service issues over my visits.from top to bottom all the menu options are delicious and and leave me slightly sad when i&#39;m full and can&#39;t eat anymore.this was just that good! esp on a rainy and gloomy day in the city.a slight letdown to its sister restaurant wasabi in logan square, but probably one of the better options for ramen in the loop.everything was pretty good except that the takoyaki was a little on the overcooked side &amp; only had 5 in total.just saying.my friend took me here for dinner..and finally, they  make a mean cocktail.the ramen was mediocre at its best...i had a vegetarian buckwheat noodle bowl, best one i ever had in the states! really good broth, lots mushrooms in my bowl, great for this winter weather!.i love their noodles.the broth only gets better near the bottom of the bowl.quality over quantity.we meant business so we wrapped this meal up in about 40 minutes, tops.i&#39;ll probably give the miso bold &amp; spicy a try next time!they do serve beer and alcohol for those of you into the boozy lunches!great ramen option, but to be honest i prefer yusho and urban belly&#39;s ramens (once again just personal preferences).i have checked into ramen takeya 11 times now, which just goes to show you how amazing their ramen is.ok, i&#39;m not a big fan of ramen, but i did enjoy this new ramen shop.there really was no room to spare in the place.they did a good job with this one - so i can say i liked the interior design and vibe of the place a little bit.came here today on a saturday around 12:20 and there wasn&#39;t a line.my husband and i are regulars here.however, their gyoza and karaage tasted better! food is more on the expensive side.you can&#39;t wrong with any of them, and variety in all aspects, is the spice of life.but the menu is deceiving - they made it sound like it&#39;s very healthy.price around $12.food is served quickly in about 10mins.so the first time i came here, i left disappointed.i am glad i did as i would have probably been dying if i had the other one.the spicy chicken paitan is not too spicy; i just wished it came with more than two small chunks of pork.we came in well before closing and the manager actually had the balls to kick us out because they were &#34;closed&#34;.you have to try the ramen here; you will not regret the decision!.side note: the bun appetizers are ok..some places way over do it.i personally thought the bowls were big enough and filling enough on their own but i&#39;m looking forward to coming back and trying some appetizers.the chashu was very tender and melted in your mouth.the service is fairly quick.my wife had it there and enjoyed it.we were warmly welcomed by the person working at the bar, and we were seated and given menus promptly.we hit the tail-end of dinner peak time at approximately 7:30 pm, so we were invited to sit at the bar since there wasn&#39;t any table available.the runny egg told were beautiful and golden, true liquid gold.we initially chose to dine at high five ramen, but the wait for three was two hours...when the restaurant is so elite, it doesn&#39;t have a sign..the osaka shio ramen&#39;s broth had a very clean and flavorful taste.that said, as far as ramen goes it wasn&#39;t anything that blew me away, and while i suppose i give them some props for making a flavorful broth out of chicken instead of pork, the bowl itself didn&#39;t stand out much in other ways; the noodles were just alright and to be honest the portion was smaller than i would have liked(the bowl they serve is essentially a vase in how it narrows out).the noodles were al dente, pork cha sui was delicious (just melts in your mouth &amp; it&#39;s berkshire pork) and the egg was just perfect  (very flavorful &amp; not overcooked).i ordered miso bold &amp; spicy, and i was very impressed with the level of spiciness, especially with the chili threads that they added in the bowl.service was fine.the bad and the good and somewhere in betweens.beautiful, tasty &amp; nice atmosphere.by the way, the ikura don is big enough to be a meal.came here on a weeknight with a friend...ramen is pretty good too but the spicy isn&#39;t quite as spicy as i&#39;d like.my spicy chicken was fantastic - amazingly good pork belly, fantastic egg and bamboo shoots.eating the noodles and everything in the dish wasn&#39;t too spicy.true ramen is almost impossible to reproduce outside of japan.we were seated towards the front of the restaurant so i&#39;m not sure how much further the room extended.ramen takeya just booted wasabi from the &#34;best ramen in chicago&#34; throne.the salt ramen is a clearer broth and can get a little too salty for me personally.i give takeya a lot of credit for a subtle difference between the noodles in its two ramen options, as the urban legend is that &#34;true&#34; ramen chefs pair noodles according to broth.it&#39;s definitely my go to ramen place in the city even though no japanese ppl work there lol.the beer cans are very small (with the exception of the only available draft asahi super dry - which is actually out of a keg, the revolution anti-hero, and bottled beers)."
crosbys-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/crosbys-kitchen-chicago,1,"We put our name down and waited about 20 minutes at 7:30 on a saturday night.the burger itself was deliciously juicy and a pretty decent size.it&#39;s good.though delicious, it could have had a bit more hollandaise (but can&#39;t every dish?), and the eggs lacked the fluffy mouthfeel i craved.although i don&#39;t particularly enjoy cornbread, my bf really liked it and his salad.i also did not care one bit for the potatoes..the food was great! we shared the cornbread appetizer and i had the wrightwood salad as an entree and my friend had the pork chop.food - love the food!! essential especially the dessert!! soooo good! rotisserie chicken was tasty, but not too special.we came here for dinner on friday night and enjoyed our experience! we ended up sitting at the bar after waiting for about 30 minutes.i took off a star because my cousin&#39;s omelette was not made to her request--egg whites and caramelized onions.again, a great place for brunch.i had asked for it prepared medium, however it was on the rarer side of medium rare.again, the food was just spot on, and the service was beyond stellar! suzanne is the best!! we absolutely love, love this place! although there are so many restaurants to try in the chicagoland area, this is our go to, when we want foolproof food and the same for the service! we are in love with this place! go try it today!.we came here pre and post babies and fit right in!  the brussle sprout salad is the best in the city.i&#39;ve been to crosby&#39;s kitchen multiple times, and there is always great food and service.i have heard about this place over and over again so when my dad came into town and asked where i wanted to go for my birthday i said &#34;crosby&#39;s kitchen&#34;.i&#39;ve never heard of a restaurant claiming that a steak with 50% red showing in the middle was medium, which i&#39;m used to being pink with no red.lunch and brunch are excellent.kind of embarrassing really.we live just north off southport, so ever since this place opened it has become one of our favorite local spots for a night out.for one person it&#39;s a lot to eat, but for a group of three or four it&#39;s just enough.the menu was extremely limited and what we ordered was average at best.i went after a movie on a weeknight.i wanted to find a real &#34;chicago&#34; restaurant (i.great host/managemen..i love the little bits of horseradish floating throughout.the food was excellent and the menu had great options.also, i&#39;d be remiss if i didn&#39;t mention the spinach artichoke dip.and outdoor seating in the summer is great.service was friendly, helpful, and attentive.it was delicious! the biscuits and gravy was a perfect savory dish to offset the sweet of the monkey bread.crispy, fluffy, perfectly done in the cast iron skillet.they do rush you though it seems so if your trying to relax and take your time this is not the brunch spot for you..pretty good prices as well.casual yet upscale family atmosphere with really friendly and attentive service.great food, trendy and rustic atmosphere and the cutest lil patio! for realz check it out.i was told the wait was 30-45 minutes, so i had a seat and waited.went there before a cubs game with my son and it was amazing all around..(apparently sunday is bring all the small children night, be warned)crosby&#39;s has a great location along the southport corridor and has a very warm, inviting atmosphere.i had the roasted chicken with veggies which was delicious.i love the bacon slice and the miller grenade..for brunch, we ordered the monkey bread, which is sweet, soft and oh so delicious! get it for brunch, no regrets! i also split the bacon strada benedict, which is easily large enough to split..but before i could get halfway up the rickety old scaffolding, degrading the effigy of a man i had never met, i saw that the cake is indeed rotten, black and toppled, obviously forgotten over the years.great food and good service.good stuff even still.atmosphere/location: great right on southportfood: pretty good but nothing amazing.we ordered the cornbread &amp; found it dry - the maple butter was tasty..rhubarb jam,.their bloody mary&#39;s looked great and came with a beer.three words: brussels sprout salad.you&#39;re welcome.i&#39;ve been wanting to check out crosby kitchen and i&#39;m looking forward to coming back with the dude!.i can see how that can happen once.it was a saturday night and our wait was about 45 minutes, but luckily there is lots of stores along southport to occupy you while you wait..a proper bloody mary.i came here on a weekday for lunch with a cousin.but that and a waitress clearly doing the best she could are the only reason this isn&#39;t one star..oh and one other thing.service was acceptable, but salad is worth returning for.this is a great place to come with some friends or family, or a date for brunch or dinner.they must have sprinkled magic on it because i couldn&#39;t get enough!!overall, i&#39;m really glad i checked this place out for brunch.be creative! create new dishes..the maple butter takes it over the top.."

beatrix-streeterville-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/beatrix-streeterville-chicago,2,"Healthy breakfast with a twist.overall, i&#39;d like to try brunch or lunch next time.warm feel.now for my entree, i got the escarole and potato ravioli and it was phenomenal.had the chicken tinga eggs which was an alternative huevos rancheros type dish, minus the beans.filling but not too heavy.wooooow.so they certainly need to fix that.2.i stopped in for a bullet coffee and a triple chocolate gf cookie.beatrix is worth a visit when you are in the downtown area.people say the breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and i have to agree.but we minded our own business and enjoyed our drinks.after going to beatrix for the first time last week, i have returned for lunch almost every day since then!  they have an extensive food bar with salads, hot meals, soups, pre-made sandwiches, etc.we order the straight a salad and it was very good.the server forgot my coffee and brought it over when my burger came out..it was very unbalanced with far too much acidity..make sure to grab a michelada to wash that all down.we came here for dinner during our last night in chicago, based on previous reviews.excellent brunch, nice patio, great service.staff was friendly and helpful!.breakfast review only..the fries were good, not great.i sat at the bar and the service was great.great breakfast place.our server offered us some drinks recommendations and told us about the specials as well as telling us the &#34;mission&#34; of the restaurant.i&#39;ve had their coffee which is pretty good-not to mention cheaper than starbucks!  i&#39;ve dined in for lunch and tried the prime burger which was awesome.incredible service..my burger was totally uninteresting.beatrix never disappoints! the service is fast and friendly, and the food is so tasty.the appetizers, entrees, and desserts were all wonderful - but it was the service that stood out: super friendly, attentive but not overbearing, and smart.not impressed at all! the service, and the food options were terrible!!!first i heard so many great things about this place and that is good and healthy on the menu there is not one normal thing that they have that&#39;s vegan!l except salads!! that i got and its only arugula and the grains that were there was probably half of a cup!!! seriously for a $16 salad i just get arugula! the other thing the service wasn&#39;t there too there were dirty  plates all over the table too that were not picked up.i&#39;m not absolutely crazy about the food but i would come back.it&#39;s hands down, one of the best chocolate cakes i&#39;ve ever had! #heaven #whatwaistline #yolo6..breakfast should be fine.there is a section to sit down as well as a grab and go section.&#34;the whole experience was kind of similarly disjointed.we elected to sit at the bar and this time i went with the goji berry blossom and it was delicious, too!  we also got a chocolate chip cookie and they were happy to warm it up for us so it was soft and chewy when we dove in!the servers were super nice and attentive and they took care of us.one of my favorite meals is the turkey meatloaf that comes with the creamiest mashed potatoes and kale.great customer service!.they only serve breakfast until 11:00.not a bad quick place to grab a breakfast over by the magnificent mile..beatrix is just ok.i found myself here twice this past weekend; once for a late friday night dinner, and then again for sunday brunch.absolutely delicious, and although it really wasn&#39;t necessary, what great customer service!  i plan to return many times!.now i always stop by and grab something from the fresh market when i am at the doctor&#39;s office since it&#39;s right on the northwestern campus.the rich elixir is so buttery and full bodied that it slides down without swallowing.the hostess was also kind enough to hold our table for quite some time as we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive.i will be going back for that salad, so good!.in comparison, the fries on the side pretty much sucked.99 a pound it adds up quick!! since i work at nmh it&#39;s very convenient and always busy! will be back for a lighter option next time!.can&#39;t blame them, coffee is great but it makes the place more lively than you might have liked.got the pepper and egg sammich and the lemon pancakes which were very fluffy and melted in our mouths.the root veggies on the hot bar taste amazing and the mac and cheese is pretty delish also.but this location isn&#39;t bad either! i made reservations for 7:15 on a tuesday night for restaurant week.all in all a perfect sunday brunch experience - will definitely be coming back to try all the other items on the menu.the crispy kale salad is excellent.lots of good stuff around here now.the dining room has dining three areas.recommended!there is a buffet style right next door if you need to grab and go.chicken salad; meatloaf; prime burger; mushroom/quinoa burger; fries; straight a salad; apple strudel; lemon pancakes; le colombe coffee.dined here for the first time for restaurant week.pastries are to go crazy!.food was astonishing! i ordered the chicken tinga (with two sunny side-up eggs and avocado) and my wife ordered a healthier version of eggs benedict (over a quinoa patty instead of an english muffin).i came here with a friend for a 8:30am breakfast on a sunday to meet a friends..the hummus w/ pita (they call it nan but it tasted more like pita) was brilliant.there are other fried items in them, like peppers, but the most amazing part is fried lemon..each time the service was impeccable and the food was delicious.family friendly restaurant, food was fantastic, juices were great too.it&#39;s so near home so i went a couple of times just to grab a coffee, but i didn&#39;t sit down to enjoy the menu! the pastries looks so so so so delicious! i want to try the angel cake muffins so bad.the food: executed in an exceedingly well fashion..i couldn&#39;t have been happier with the food, drinks, or service i received!."

blackbird-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blackbird-chicago,1,"Love the prix fixe lunch.this was an excellent experience.the service is quick, but with little warmth and little interaction..the waiters asked about any allergies and were very accommodating.the service was completely non-judgmental about that, which is nice.great nutty parmesan, slight hints of floral marigold, and a fantastic blend of savory and sweet that had me licking the back of my spoon.pea soup: 3/5i think the point of this soup is that it&#39;s supposed to be refreshing, which might explain the lack of flavor.i was with my parents for the tasting menu, and one course was raw fish which neither of my parents liked and didn&#39;t eat.the entrees ranged anywhere from $30-$42.if you want a meal the size of your face get a deep dish pizza.and for $25, the three course lunch worth the price.the frog legs and rabbit loin were decent.it&#39;s a fantastic concept.i think the food lacked some cohesion and progression.also, the tables are really bunched up together and if you have to go to the bathroom, it is a bit of a squeeze to get through all the tables clumped together.the kitchen also brought out a complimentary small bite.monkfish was nicely prepared, rich texture and flavor, not dried out at all, pleasant char flavor.i would try to come with either a long lunch break so you can sit outside on a nice sunny day or come as soon as they open for lunch! the drink menu is great- i got a napa valley sauvingnon blanc and that&#39;s not easy to find in the city.i liked that the lights were dim what created this romantic sense....there was a hook for my purse underneath the table, which i appreciated at first, but it actually could not accommodate the size of my purse (which wasn&#39;t *huge*), especially because the women sitting at the two tables flanking us also were using the hooks for their purses.we tried the prix fixe lunch menu.if i&#39;m eating pea-sized portions of food that are extravagantly priced, i need to be blown away.my boyfriend and i ordered.the only complains that dinner were the sweetbread was a little overcooked and the dinner was not as impressive as the starters.we went here for the first time for my husband&#39;s birthday.we especially liked desserts, rare exquisite tea collection.i will return each and every time i am in chicago..my friend ordered the hanger steak, which was delicious as well.this was all followed up by the pork belly and the duck..anyways, moving on.came for restaurant week, and the monkfish alone warranted five stars (although the amuse-bouche that is being served this week was a close second).had nothing special.i was skeptical to say the least but blackbird won me over..we didn&#39;t indulge anymore but loved our experience from beginning to end.not sure why places keep doing this, over stuffing their space for increased number of diners at the expense of a little more room for those eating.i&#39;m not sure i would say it was fabulous.i will say the wait was long and the hostess had an attitude problem.i have so much respect for this restaurant group for many reasons now and am glad to have finally gotten here.hard to get up once seated and tables are so close that there is no privacy.wow.the bread was truly excellent and started us on a great note of fall flavors.first time here (at blackbird &amp; in chicago) and this is already one of favorite restaurants.came here for their prix fixe lunch for $25.that aside, i&#39;m definitely coming back.service was simply perfect and overall meal was also perfect...clever chef.service here is like a well-oiled machine: efficient and unpretentious.we were excited to try this place...they are a bit serious and can come off a bit pretentious, but you are going to a fancy restaurant, so i guess thats to be expected..for an appetizer i started with the rabbit sausage with gnocchi which was very tasty.this place is pricy but you get what you pay for and in this instance, you pay for perfection.the fried frog leg balls were a bit soggy..i asked them to not put any fruit on my plate, and i got the fish with berries.this place is absolutely phenomenal!  i highly recommend this place to anyone in chicago.we had the chef&#39;s tasting menu and it was original and well presented.we asked for the check and they comped the second glass of wine and apologized..all items seemed thoughtfully crafted with unique ingredients that went together pretty well.i am willing to give blackbird a try again, but my previous experience leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth so to speak."
osteria-langhe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-langhe-chicago,1,"Again because of the great reviews these dishes got.would go out of my way to dine here again next time i&#39;m in chicago.single.we were there sunday for our anniversary and the dim lighting was romantic and the music was good as well.they are completely accommodating and polite (we were 20 mins late and i called ahead and they were so gracious about holding our table).service was good.not a typical risotto, but extremely tasty.the portions are on the smaller side, so we definitely saved room for dessert.for starers we had the pomodor, plin and fritto misto.i recommend treating the menu as a &#34;shared dish&#34; menu! order a couple things for everyone to try! the portion sizes are big enough to perfectly split between 4-5 people...the server made a recommendation on gavi that we both enjoyed.i think it had to do with the ratio of flan to the rest of the dish - less flan and more fonduta/ truffles/ egg would be better.but pretty much everything was very good.this is the real deal.pricier than your typical neighborhood italian restaurant, but the quality and experience are well worth it.i went as a group of three at 7 pm on december 11th and put in our name.this is still our go to for date night..all the food was just fine, but not great, as implied by the price.it was great! the plin was by far my favorite dish and i&#39;d also highly recommend the cauliflower.was seated at 8:10.we were satisfied when we finished our meal and weren&#39;t sure if we should have dessert but i&#39;m so glad we did.it is a gem on armitage street - twinkle lights all around.great dinner at osteria langhe! had friday night reservations and were lucky enough to get one of the tables on their front sidewalk patio.the memorable dishes were the octopus and the panna cotta dishes.words cannot adequately describe the delicious plin at osteria langhe..if this place was in nyc, it would last 2 months.i&#39;ll definitely be back!!.traveling from san francisco and love this place.the owners have adapted the former brand bbq space well, whitewashing the walls to offset the dark wood floors, and covering the banquette with a massive rural mural that really ties the room together.a meat heavy menu that is italian inspired rather than actual italian.this makes you want to close your eyes and imagine sleeping on purring kittens.although i liked the flavors and texture, there was one herb/spice that was definitely overpowering the rest of the meal), duck breast with foie gras (love duck breast), poached pear dessert (not a fan of pears but my sister wanted it.also - dinner they have an all you can eat meat ragu on sunday&#39;s for their dinner special.tiny mediocre overpriced dishes and an inconsistent staff and atmosphere.one of the best i&#39;ve had.our appetizers: capesante (scallops.my husband and i decided to take our families to this restaurant for dinner.favorites include scallops with potato puffs and duck/mushroom ravioli..we had to restrain ourselves from licking the plates, and the service was great.highlights include: bacon scallops, cream angel hair pasta with black truffles (they can do it if not on the menu), plin, risotto, wild boar ribs, most of the small plates and all of their deserts.this is an excellent little italian restaurant in the neighborhood! highly recommend visiting osteria langhe on tuesdays for their $38 pre fixe menu and half price cocktails at the bar.this ragu.i&#39;ve read a lot of reviews with negative comments on timing / spacing of courses, but everything came out for us timely.it&#39;s soooo good that i can literally eat this everyday(highly recommended!!!!)- tajarin(entree): perfectly cooked house made pasta with meat ragu sauce.dimly lit ambiance enables a romantic vibe as does the low volume background tunes.pro tip: if none of the desserts strike your fancy, tastee freez is right across the street.the staff was extremely attentive and helpful as well..having a dessert like this prepared at the restaurant means it comes without artificial ingredients.since lamb is a heavy meat with sauce, foie gras got lost in flavor.the dessert was a seminola and was also amazing.i&#39;m never so happy as i am when the chefs have obvious pride in their craft..not sure why he was trying to talk her out of it.great service, waiter was very professional and pleasant.i definitely will return..the low-key atmosphere and relatively affordable prices hide a true gem: fresh ingredients, perfectly executed dishes, and an interesting menu with more traditional italian delicacies as well as some more liberal creation of the chef.i believe they do all-you-can eat tajarin + ragu on sundays, and i will most likely be back for this within a few weeks.small and romantic.a tequila based drink with grapefruit juice and a salted rim.next came the tagliata.- they did not give me any hassle for showing up with only half the party- we were there for a good 2 hours and everything went smoothly.the hostess and a gentleman that i am assuming was the manager or owner were very sensitive and responsive to our waiting.inside it&#39;s actually bigger than it looks with a nice bar, tables towards the back and a communal table up front in the big picture window!  first things first.best house made pasta i&#39;ve ever had.the food was just ok.once again, delicate and flavorful with each bite and may i add a generous portion for restaurant week and in general."
312-chicago-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/312-chicago-chicago,2,"And not a good idea to have one so close to people&#39;s feet, especially when they aren&#39;t clothed during summer.and we live right down the street on randolph and canal.5 starsgood service, decent food for dinner.my salmon was perfection! wow.the bartenders don&#39;t seem very enthused..we had the linguini and fave salad and it was delicious! yum!..food is ok, best part of my meal was the soup, some type of tortellini soup.great discussion he thinks i&#39;m awesome and killing the numbers, i happen to agree with him, i am awesome! server was great very patient with us and attentive.that being said, 90% of the time when i come here i forget to make a reservation and they can usually accommodate a small party (2-3) within just a few minutes.they were staying in the very beautiful attached hotel allegro..my whole meal was outstanding!i will definitely be coming back here real soon.the chicken soup was was fresh and the chicken broth was made from scratch.i am staying in the attached hotel decided to get some too cold to walk around looking for food that could be trouble.we were out of the restaurant in 45 minutes, which makes me wonder how fresh the food actually is.everything came quickly but was obviously freshly made.the pork chop is succulent accompanied with the best corn salad i have ever tasted.not only did she put me at ease (i felt sort of odd eating/sitting by myself), but the bar staff was talkative, nice and quick.the price range is also a bit high for such simple breakfast dishes.mediocre at best.waiting for service was like watching paint dry..i thought that was weird.i had the goat cheese ravioli with wild mushroom ragu - this was a little watered down, and i thought the sauce would be a little creamier; there were ample amounts of mushrooms and the raviolis were nicely filled with goat cheese.fabulous brunch! my husband had the short rib hash and i had the french toast.walked by here all the time but never really noticed it..the brioche bun was very nice.able to valet park at the a hotel allegro and leave car there for the show..wonderful personalized service.sigh.this is the second night in a row that i have eaten here for dinner.i had a very nice early dinner here yesterday.we selected 312 chicago for lunch as we were going to a show at cadillac palace theater.312 is a fine establishment but i am unlikely to return in the future.it was a good but a little on the salty side.the food is ok, and honestly a bit overpriced.our party did a mixture of off the menu and the 3 course prix fixe orders.their lasagna melts in you mouth - literally!  great ambience and service!.he was very charismatic, answered all my questions, and made cooking sound like so much fun (anyone who knows me that i do not belong in the kitchen).very disappointed in where we were seated.feels like when the restaurant arrived 15 years ago, it was trendsetting.nice service, attentive staff, lovely salad and fish my guests and i ordered.convenience matters a lot first thing in the morning!i think our servers were sleepy because it took forever to get waited on.would be a mistake to overlook this gem because it&#39;s in the loop..always a good problem to have when you&#39;re stuck between 5-6 options to order.hard to find delicious branzino fillet tender and flavorful with crispy crust.our server zhanna apparently had my email printed and in her pocket (in it i had listed a couple of wines we would be bringing).check came at the perfect time $120 a couple including tax and tip."
sociale-chicago-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sociale-chicago-chicago,2,"Great place for small bites with titanic taste.plus our server was too awesome!.i dined here for the second time and had another good experience.not sure...3.obviously they are a shared plate restaurant.the star was the branddade fritters! they were incredible.if the flies weren&#39;t such a deterrent, i think the price would be given the food.drinks are good, food was average.i&#39;ve seen dogs on their patio countless times but when i showed up for my reservation with my dog they were incredibly rude.we enjoyed sitting out on the patio and people watching.i live in the area and have been wanting to come here for some time; finally did so this past saturday afternoon for a quick bite, and it was great!we took a seat at the bar, and took a look at the menu - immediately my boyfriend and i agreed we&#39;d be back for brunch in the near future, as their brunch offerings looked awesome, however it was around 1pm when we strolled by, and we&#39;d already had an early breakfast of eggs and bacon.they&#39;re also masters at pacing and making sure you get enough attention without interrupting your date.sociale has set anew standard for me.the service was quick and friendly - i wish i was staying longer in chicago to eat again!.i went there with two friends and we ordered:- smoked salmon flat bread - it was above average, but not exceptional- clams - the best clams i&#39;ve ever had.we will go back !.before we ordered dessert the owner came to our table with four complimentary flutes of champagne (completely unexpected).on a recent birthday weekend, we decided to spend our sunday morning at sociale.welcome to the neighborhood sociale!!.it was pretty open and likely easy to get a table without reservation.i had the chicken croissant and frites (another version of french fries) and it was really good.head chef is a genius!.a little noisy but we had a table of 6.oh boy, were we wrong.great food! a variety of dishes to please everyone! martini was good, as was the service.the scallops may be the best i&#39;ve ever had [no small fete], and their dessert called bougatsa, a phyllo pastry perfectly done with sweet semolina custard and sabayon, is heaven.food was okay, some dishes a four star (scallops) and some dishes a 1 star (sea bass, shrimp).the asian fritters were delicious and the pork belly wrapped in bacon was also tasty, too.i was most impressed of the texture.this is a solid 4-star restaurant for the neighborhood.countless times i have been here, and the quality of everything is 100%.check it out if you&#39;re in the hood, but it&#39;s not a destination..that&#39;s service!..food is just okay.the service and atmosphere was a bit of a drag, though.my bf and i went on a date last saturday here.been to french laundry, trotter and jules verne.i would choose sociale over blackie&#39;s and bar louie any day! and if the wait is too long at umai, then come here!the food here is good and hearty...we arrived on time and were seated promptly.i don&#39;t make my way over to the area all that often but will definitely be back now to dine at sociale.came here with my boyfriend and had an excellent experience here, a combo of good food and great service..just moved to the area and very excited to experience everything there is to offer.our food was approved by a 4year old.i thought the crispy chicken thigh was meh, but the people i was with disagree vehemently; the beans it was served with were delicious, though.the flatbread was tasty, as was the panzarella salad.the waiter told us before ordering there were carrots about 4&#34; long.get the bacon wrapped pork belly..the scallops were amazing, cauliflower was different and delish, the bacon wrapped pork belly was dry.when you visit a new city, it&#39;s daunting to think about trying to find good food and drinks without knowing anything about an area.the drinks were nice and refreshing.there should be some note on the menu or the waitress should have given the expectation that the bougatsa needs a longer time to prepare..it&#39;s just really good.ordered their savory bread pudding.checked out this new addition to south loop with some friends for dinner.one of the best meals we have ever had.it had great reviews so we decided to check it out..stopped in for happy hour, all you can clams.great cocktails.made reservations here on yelp for 7:30p on a saturday night.i got the duck has and it was good and filling."

big-and-littles-restaurant-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/big-and-littles-restaurant-chicago-3,1,"However, the shrimp wasn&#39;t all that good.the fries are also great.the japanese beef short rib!!!!! from the well seasoned beef short rib to the sweet sauce drizzled on top.the sauce and pickle contribute to creating the perfect party for your taste buds.all units were in working order, but the floor was somewhat dirty.walking in you see a chalkboard style list of menu which included tacos and hamburgers.meat tacos are ok.the sandwich was excellent and sauce was to expectation.my third time here i went with a chili cheese dog and beer battered grilled cheese.however, service seemed prompt and efficient.last i was there, it was cash-only, however they have an atm available for use.this place, however, has taken them to a new level.it looked really good i was bummed i didn&#39;t order it.the jap taco was actually freaking delicious, but as noted above, very, very poorly labeled.if you love to live a little with food, this is your place.this will be a regular stop for us when we are in the city.extremely salty, soggy, and the taste.saw this place on thrillist then heard it was on diners, drive-ins, and dives which totally makes sense after going there.first off the food is great.probably the best tacos in the city.soft shell crab po&#39;boy - crunchy, freshly fried, but the bread tasted stale and the sandwich could&#39;ve used more sauce.and the truffle fries are amazing.great cod and chips.i guess i was more excited about the food before i actually tried it.it was very good and unexpected.they seem to have 8 people preparing the food for the mötley crüe that&#39;s here to eat: millenials, people from the neighborhood, construction workers, bike delivery folks, tourists, yelpers, etc.the prices were right.truffle fries spot on..some of the best fish tacos i have found in the city and for so cheap! had the big &amp; little&#39;s and also the talapia tacos.there&#39;s lots to choose from.i didn&#39;t like the breading on it, way too oily and it just tasted too fishy for my taste.get the &#34;samurai&#34; and you wont be disappointed.if you&#39;ve never had food before, then this place is extraordinary!i went here because i saw it on one of those food shows and a celebrity chef was raving over the soft shell crab po&#39; boy.we loved the bench seating next to the window.the place isnt ostentatious.love this place.very cool owner who took the time to talk with us and helped us choose items on the menu.i ordered the kimchi fries, hawaiian pork taco, spicy short rib taco and the japanese short rib taco.the atmosphere was perfect for a ddd locale and they surprisingly have a lot of room when you you go back to area beyond  the order  section.my first stop in chicago had to be big and littles! i will definitely return when i come back to chicago! i tried their soft shell sandwich and their crab and tuna taco.love this location.75  fried whitefish, jalapeños, lettuce, special sauce, samurai saucebanh mi $4.note that this place only takes cash.there should be one on every block.it had no flavor whatsoever and it seemed as if i was just eating something fried with a lot of sauce drenched in it.if you&#39;re not a fan of vinegar, i advise you stay away from the malt.i wish the sauce had a little more of a kick to it, but all in all really good fresh food.we went with my parents and everyone enjoyed their pics - which ranged from the crab po-boy &amp;fish tacos, to the meaty short rib and vietnamese tacos.next, the staff and atmosphere were great.the soft shell crab looked exactly liked the pictures on yelp, and was definitely a good size.my friend bf and i had the grilled shrimp taco (which was just okay), the soft shelled crab taco (amazing), the porkbelly po&#39;boy and the kim chi french fries, the entire meal came to a total of only $27, which is a steal.well.i will gain an extra ten pounds because of big and little&#39;s and i don&#39;t even care.it&#39;s kind of a hole in the wall, and my friends loved it.so good!.came here on a groupon.we were in the area and finally checked it out on a saturday afternoon around 2pm.you won&#39;t regret it!.boring.small little broken pieces that seemed like they came from the bottom of the pan.it was very hard to remember which is my top 5, as best as i remember i enjoyed the soft-shell crab tacos, mango chutney, hawaiian pork, banh-mi and the littles&#39; taco&#39;s.and it doesn&#39;t disappoint.heck - i can&#39;t complain about guy fieri&#39;s food either, because i&#39;ve never tried any of his restaurants (though there&#39;s plenty of folks that have gone off on that!).he was very indecisive when visualizing the big menu written on the board, but the young man at the counter was friendly and ready to suggest.came in for lunch and wasn&#39;t as blown away as i thought i would be.cash only.a chicago sandwich staple! i had to try the pork belly po boy after seeing all the pictures.it was greasy (yes i know its battered and deep fired.that&#39;s why it&#39;s worth spending the extra coin for unique stuff like soft shell crab or poke.we got a lift over and we were so happy we went! this restaurant really knows about food and takes pride in every order.the lines move @ a decent pace and the people that work here are nice.a soft shell crab taco on a flour tortilla.those two areas don&#39;t have a lot of dining hot spots but conveniently enough my connecting bus to the blue line had a stop near big&#39;s and little&#39;s which i bookmarked on yelp.our total came to around $30 and we had leftovers to take home.there are a few picnic tables outside, which is nice for summer."

burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,2,"No way around that.maybe you never were and i have experienced a better burger elsewhere.i would also highly recommend the bbq wings for an appetizer.uh.it was the large pretzels just like you would get during oktoberfest in munchen.the service was fast but the meal was lacking flavor.great experience.the only reason why i did not give burger bar 5 stars is i wish they had more craft beers on the menu.come see her.on a weeknight around 7p, the restaurant wasn&#39;t very packed and conversations flowed easily over beer flights and cocktails - i particularly enjoyed the old fashioned.wish i took a picture.parking is street or valet.this place was awesome.(plus, thursdays are $1 pbr nights.the food seemed a little pricey at first, but after consuming it i would consider it well worth the money.we will definitely be back for more grub and soon!.nice beer selection (although a bit to the light side, but it is summer).i added a fried egg and extra hot sauce.the shakes are also pretty good i ordered the smores.i want the flavor, but not anything to overwhelm my burger.anywhere i can get a burger with goat cheese i am all for it.i also highly recommend their boozy milkshakes, which are spun thick and spiced up with a shot of whiskey.the chips with blue cheese &amp; bacon are outstanding for a snack or as a starter.goods:burger was cooked very nicely and sweet potato fries were done right.we both got the grass fed burgers with regular fries.will definitely be going back.great place to go though.great food and nice interior! me and my friends ordered three burgers, pickle fries, and bacon lollipop.something tasted spoiled on the burger.smh.i highly recommend it!.i made the mistake of getting one of their signature burgers - the lamb burger with lamb sausage.cooked perfectly, juicy and plain delicious..i walked so far for this! it was crispy but it wasn&#39;t a tater tot!.my boyfriend got the shrimp burger and he said it was amazing! i got the high hog with has bbq pulled pork, thick cut bacon, smoked ham and apple-cabbage slaw.bar tender is nice however at least.accidentally stumbled upon this place.great whiskey selection.i would not say it&#39;s the best burger in chicago but it&#39;s still good.this is a phenomenal burger place with a lot of great burger options.the fries were great.burger was just eh.paired that with a tall chalice of delirium tremmers aka the flamest ale known to man.the food was just terribly disappointing..so classic with the goat cheese, tomato chutney, arugula, and bits of heaven, yum.i&#39;m not in love with the food, but i&#39;d go back.staff was also very friendly and knowledgeable.best deal in town! the burgers are fantastic too!i ask for half the sauce..shout out to the mgr.we got the fried pickles and the bacon mac and cheese and both were phenomenal.the mac was ok at best.i&#39;ve had great burgers, and this one definitely wasn&#39;t one of them.great prices overall and really good selection of beers.this is a true chicago gem! great burgers (high quality meat, big portions), large rotating beer selection, unique sides.juicy beef patty was topped with gooey brie, red onion jam, slab of pork belly, and a dijon mayonnaise blend.lots of beers to choose from and good burgers,  also the wait staff was very friendly and even recommended places i could hang out, while in chicago.burger bar gets 3 stars  because their sweet potato fries are awesome and they have a nice kids menu at reasonable prices ( e.the myo burger option is pretty lit too.this place is for sure better than your average bar burger, but probably not the absolute best in the city.after multiple lies from the waiter julian, i will never come here again on principle.5 (standard but ate the whole thing)sriracha mayo - 5 (really spicy and well made).they did run out of their specialty shake so one of my friends couldn&#39;t order one which was unfortunate.while we were taking our sweet time to order because we were waiting on another friend to arrive, our server went over the highlights.i went on a tuesday night so it was pretty quiet, but that was fine.i have been there 3-4 times and every time i enjoy a new style of burger with the hand cut fries."
hakka-bakka-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hakka-bakka-chicago-2,2,"Food is portioned well and tastes good..the employees are very friendly and make sure you enjoy the food.enjoyed my visit here.we loved it that we ate different types of rolls.the salad has literally a cup of watery liquid at the bottom and the fries were soggy and flavorless.do you love indian cuisine?go here..ordered online for delivery.it was inedible- but worse yet, i didn&#39;t order that so i never could have guessed biting into this thing i would end up eating a jalapeno, let alone massive chunks of fresh cut jalapeno that caused an actual burn on my lip.finally, there is a good place to go eat at by depaul campus.i had the lamb special kati roll.tasty as m8! i got the chicken tikka roll with all the things and it was spicy as all hell but i was leaning into it and everything turned out well so no complaints here.the base was their basmati rice, choice of protein, and i asked them to do 1/2 their chicken tikka and 1/2 their paneer tikka, which are the yummy cheese cubes that they do very well! the guy even mixed the chicken and the cheese for me..service was great! knowledgeable and nice!delish!!.the staff was super friendly and extremely helpful with what i should order.chicken tikka and lamb was my favorite.i ordered the paneer with spicy sauce and egg kati roll.we got the katti roll with the lamb.i also received a free mango lassi, which was super delicious.both were fantastic, especially the fries.really enjoyed the style of food.i honestly don&#39;t want to think about my experience there again.the food may not seem cheap compared to regular indian joints.ingredients were fresh and tasty and i received my order very promptly.i was excited to see a new place like this in the depaul area! it&#39;s pretty much like an indian chipotle, where you get to build your own kati roll (almost like a burrito), rice bowl, or salad.i just had them put everything on mine toppings-wise as well.i make it a combo.i had a shrimp bowl with rice, salad, and all the toppings.i love their lentil soup it warms you up in a cold wintery night..i&#39;ve given up on hakka bakka.there were eight workers there when i went on a friday night at 9pm.with extra charge, added jalapeño to the kati roll - which was average in my opinion.this food is great! definitely get an egg on your wrap it&#39;s life changing.last totally disappointed !.biggest kudos comes from previous complaints that their kati rolls were too soggy from having the chutneys added prior to customers taking them home and having too much time to be absorbed into the wrap..finally, chicago has something it has been lacking for a while - great kati rolls! living in calcutta and new york, i can feel content on not having to wait to get egg chicken kati rolls and simply taking the train to the very conveniently located hakka bakka in lincoln park!my friend and i both tried the chicken tikka and chicken haryali rolls - one is more than enough to order since they are so filling! the selection of sauces to add are very flavorful, and you can mix and match the sauces to your liking.poor management..like the concept but few changes can make the place better.i will definitely go back with some friends, because not only was the food good, the customer service was good too.i got the special kati roll with tikka chicken, all the chutneys, and ton of veggies.the food could use some improvement.we will definitely be back - this place is now on our regular list.everything is made to order fresh  in front of you.flavor is on point and they were able to turn the spice up for me.i&#39;ve had hakka bakka delivered before without really knowing what it was.just like yourself, he wasn&#39;t willing to believe that there&#39;s something wrong with the food.i&#39;ve also never heard about or have ever tried a kati roll.very excited to see a kati roll place in chicago and it did not disappoint.i checked into yelp while in there because i saw there was a deal for a free mango lassi, but the person ringing me up informed me that i have to order a min of $15 and i was a few bucks short.dont let the small place fool you - they have authentic delicious vegan kati rolls.all this lead to a soggy mess of a kati roll that fell apart.hakka bakka made the right move by opening next to depaul and offering indian cuisine in a modern and approachable manner.costed us about $50, and then on top of it, some of the chutneys and pickles costed extra.fast casual indian food, despite the sloppy execution of naansense in the loop, has yet to really penetrate the chicago market with its delectable flavors, so i was excited to try it out with an open mindset, far from the sloppiness of naansense.any place that masters good sauces is my favorite kind of place.refreshing to see a unique concept pop up in chicago!..i tried the spicy katil roll with chicken and rice bowl with lamb.i wish it was a little thinner and wished that the stuffing was more bountiful..this is a wonderful and different place.loved that i was able to pick my toppings.amazing blend of flavors! i&#39;d recommend a kati roll made with homemade indian flatbread, marinated chicken or lamb and side of crispy fries and cilantro mayo sauce that&#39;s to die for!!! a-must go place both during lunch and in the weekends and conveniently located in the heart of the city!

sepia-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sepia-chicago,1,"Desserts are also delicious and i ended up getting something similar to a peach cobbler which was fantastic.if you love fish, order the skate wing.first, the ambiance is weird.good thing we were with good company to pass the time but still, many of us at the table deemed service to be sorely lacking for a michelin-rated establishment.a 5.the ginger lime parfait was more of an ice cream and it was a great ending to the meal.then we forgot to use our $20 open table certificate and debated taking the loss because we so disliked the seating arrangement.the interior was charming with vintage lighting and a tone in the titular instagram filter.well done.this place really delivers, making all feel comfortable.stuffy pretentious crowd and food was nothing special.as you took in a bite of each you got a rich flavor of hazelnut and a burst of pure bourbon..this was also the homerun of the optional wine pairing, with an exotic italian pinot noir providing the perfect accompaniment..i went here for lunch years ago, and.i was less impressed with the fries.they even messed up our dessert orders so we ended up having four desserts for three people loli wasn&#39;t sure if their rw menu is representative of their regular quality.this place was so tasty! some relatives from out of town were visiting so we decided to come here.nice place for a cocktail during happy hour.i also felt they were racist...it&#39;s again a good entree but didn&#39;t really stand out.also the portions are smaller than usual.i would have liked to try this restaurant again but i have my reservations.we were recommended a great wine and just really enjoyed ourselves.beet salad that was totally atypical and a delicious pea-filled pasta.that was probably the best bite i had at sepia!.the atmosphere is great and the food was amazing! an absolute must when visiting chicago.the wine was lovely crisp too and the recommendation of the sommelier.the slightly tough texture of the noodles were great and the flavors of the sauce was solid, but a bit on the salty side.i was very impressed with attentive the staff was.drinks are creative and they have an extensive wine list.score.cocktails are spendy, but well-made..their attention to detail really made this a special experience.it didn&#39;t satisfy my sweet tooth so i ended up walking to the french market to get myself a couple of macaroons.not an experience i expect from a restaurant of sepia s caliber and not for the money we pay for our experience.smoked rainbow trout: exquisite.so many restaurants have a name that means nothing to the overall feeling of the place.being a michelin starred restaurant, i had expected a lot more.romantic and intimate.been there few times and will be back soon.this place was a total let down! over priced and nothing that left me saying &#34;damn that was amazing!&#34; which for a michelin rated restaurant you would expect leaving with raving reviews..and, for what it&#39;s worth, the bachelor who&#39;s party it was said it was the best meal he&#39;s ever had.small menu may not please everyone.none of the food stood out.the lunch crowd is turned over quickly, but we took our time with our meeting.what sticks out in my mind is that at one point during my second visit, one of the people in my party mispronounced an item on the menu and the waiter asked whether she was dyslexic.we were very punctual but our table was ready only 30 minutes later.usually i don&#39;t comment on the bread because it&#39;s not something that i generally care much about, but this was really good bread - crispy on the outside and very chewy delicious on the inside.used to be a great place and super nice.my appetizer of potato gnocchi was outstanding very light gnocchi great sauce..my friend and i together went shared items like the pork pate, the octopus carpaccio, the clams, and sauerbraten.good deal.i preferred the chocolate hazelnut tart, because it was the kind of dessert that i always crave.i got the steelhead trout which was laid on fresh veggies."

 love to come back again.this was my 1st visit but i have tried their food before as my office catered from here for special events.the empanadas had a delightfully flakey pastry.we were ushered to the back right of the establishment.this restaurant is popular though! so expect it to always be busy and a little loud.everything was delicious except the calamari - i&#39;ve had better.very lovely cafe with amazing spanish tapas! i especially love the yogurt served here.came here on a monday night and it was the best thing because of the $5 cocktails!! which we didn&#39;t know about before coming here (bonus :d).not sure why this place has 4 stars.food is ok.it has a low, red tinted lighting.for the size of the tapas i was impressed - it was honestly a lot of food for just two people and we couldn&#39;t finish everything.my boyfriend and i were really impressed with the service, as well as them letting us know about the specials on mondays! 1/2 off cocktails! there&#39;s really no words to describe how great they made our night that night ! thank you again, keep up the great work! :).we weren&#39;t very hungry but needed to try some of these excellent dishes.i would probably try a different dessert next time.overall, ton of food!since we were there, we absolutely had to try the sangria! we had a pitcher of the white peach one, and it was one of the best sangrias i have tried.i used to really like that place, but since my last visit that has changed.the service was impeccable.brunch is one of the best in the city.definitely order the patatas bravas as they are the most all-around-good menu item, enjoyed by everyone at the table.plan to be patient and keep eating and drinking..bread was given to us upon arrival and i don&#39;t know anyone who doesn&#39;t love a little freebie to begin a meal! the food came out rather quickly despite the large crowd on a friday night...love tapas! the place looks small from the outside, but its huge once you get in.sausage fried paella with eggiberico ham hashbuttermilk waffle with berriespatatas bravasbacon wrapped dateschorizo stuffed datesred sangriatried and true spotfrom those college days.overall, not very good food and was a disappointment given all the rave reviews.we started with their half bottle red wine blend with syrah and cabernet, which had a dry, almost pepper like aftertaste.the paella is excellent and a larger portion than the tapas.we got a variety of different plates-some of my favorites were the brussels sprout salad, chicken with peri peri sauce and steak with mashed potatoes.to get:- paella (chorizo one is my favorite)- sangria (mango and classic are great and not very strong but delicious)- bacon wrapped dates (perfect!)- goat cheese and tomato dip- mash potatoes and pork shoulder- scallops- brussels sprouts salad- can&#39;t wait to try more!to eat for free:- i love their free bread in the beginning dipped with olive oil..i received a free dessert through yelp and our server recommended the marcona-almond caramel bar.i will surely be back.i split a pitcher of red with another person and felt like i got a whole lot of sangria out of that thing.i&#39;ve been here twice now and the food has been delicious both times.i checked and it&#39;s not added.cool place! fun for groups or date night.you really cannot go wrong here.not what you&#39;d expect if you&#39;re a nando&#39;s fan.i went there several times and i think i have tried a large varieties of their tapas..the service is slow and they can get very very busy, but the ambiance is fun.amazing crisp on top and juicy inside.it&#39;s incredible! fun atmosphere, great for dates or big groups (went for a bachelorette party and they easily accommodated 15 people at one table)..here&#39;s all of the food we got to split between 4 people in order from best to worst:1.prices are decent and the cocktails are good!make reservations ahead of time!.although they look like mozzarella sticks, the cheese isn&#39;t melty, it&#39;s more cream-based.about2 tapas er erson would be sufficient.$85 bill for four small plates and a pitcher of sangria was not worth it..the caramelized banana we got as dessert was good and came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, but it was nothing special.don&#39;t forget to check in on your yelp app to receive a free dessert! :) you&#39;re welcome!the vibe here is very chill, i love it..a few must-have menu items:dinner menu:-patatas bravas (the aioli has a little kick and is delicious!)-bacon-wrapped dates (no explanation needed)-goat cheese baked in tomato sauce-fried green peppers (trust me on this)-shrimp-scallops-white peach sangriabrunch menu:pintxos:-short stack of pancakes (the cutest, tastiest stack you&#39;ll ever eat)-waffle-battered chicken sticki don&#39;t recall my other brunch selections, and i&#39;m sad to say i&#39;ve never had any of the paella selections, but that&#39;s definitely on my list.meatballs with sherry tomato sauce."

rpm-italian-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rpm-italian-chicago,1,"We ordered 8 appetizers for the 4 of us and shared them all.overall, it was a good dining experience.sucks for anyone who&#39;s allergic to shellfish because you&#39;re missing out! this place gets jam packed, so make reservations because even at 10pm it&#39;s a full house!.i&#39;m totally aware of the appropriate size of a pasta in italy (usually comes before your entree), so i wasn&#39;t expecting a big ole bowl of carbs, but i took six bites and my pasta was gone.it&#39;s been a long time since i&#39;ve had that service.great atmosphere and the servers were incredible.i will say that our waiter was fantastic and definitely elevated the experience.perfect.yes it&#39;s crowded, difficult to get a table and expensive, but it&#39;s worth it! you feel cooler as soon as you walk in.a little late in my review but came to rpm italian about a month ago and ate in their restaurant.it more felt like american-italian and there was nothing we had that left a lasting flavor on our palettes.i&#39;d come back for wine, pasta, and dessert..the ricotta gnocchi special was pretty delicious but the shaved truffle on top underwhelmed for the price.everything we had from the appetizers to dessert were amazing...i think there are better options out there for very good food without the sass of a server and being push out the door to turn a table.it was light, refreshing, and large enough to share.just perfection.the book of wine is almost never ending, and some of the wines are available by the glass.service was professional.service was friendly and time food took to arrive to our table wasn&#39;t terrible.was a little grumpy having waited 10-15 min past our reservation start time, getting scowled at and then placed in a pretty crappy table, but tried to make the best of things and i&#39;m glad we did because the rest of the evening was great from there!our waitress was fantastic.my go to&#39;s: carbonara pasta, the squid ink spaghetti, and recently, the potato gnocchi.very tasty, crispy prosciutto.for a trendy, downtown chicago restaurant, prices are also good..was this a restaurant week snafu? maybe.one of my chicago favs.but i walked out, having eaten pasta, without really feeling full and feeling much lighter on the wallet..i&#39;ve come here quite a few times now that it&#39;s not as hyped as it used to be and have loved it each time.it was very busy that night so we didn&#39;t get a chance to chat with him.- eggplant parmesan - favorite!! this freaking veggie plate stole the show for all of us, even carnivores at the table.the good news is that service was fast and efficient.he was sweet enough to send over a little bite to kick off our meal, too.not much to say for me.the food is excellent - especially the appetizers and deserts!the eggplant was a little smushed rather than crispy but did taste goodalso they have no non alcoholic beverages, i asked them to make a mojito and it was pretty bad so i gladly returned it.fresh homemade ricotta was amazingpotato gnocchi was really good, had lots of good flavor.the perfect marriage of savory, sweet and even a little salty.this place is very overrated.i really really wanted to love rpm after hearing so many great things about this place but it just didn&#39;t live up to the hype for me.i couldn&#39;t remember for the life of me what the third pasta my friend was that we even ordered.delicious.ugh.so would i go back?i think it&#39;s a place everyone should try but it&#39;s not a place i would push to go back too.the flavor was okay.my first dining experience (feb 2015) was with a group of seven food and cocktail lovers.a good wine selection and fantastic service completed the positive experience.i wasn&#39;t expecting that texture for meatballs.i had the bellini,  which was delicious.i called more than a couple weeks in advance and was told the only reservation for the friday night i was interested in was before 5:15 or after 8:45.we ordered the cheese plate and aged prosciutto to share for our app.you&#39;re paying for the name more than the food.years later! and still- favorite italian restaurant.i thought everything was amazing, fresh and super flavorful.i don&#39;t even like egg plant but it was good.we went after dinner for dessert.for sure we are coming back.we absolutely enjoyed our experience at rpm italian.some things on their menu are pricey but you can get away with other dishes that are $16 for a main meal.at any rate, the filling completely overpowered the delicate flavour of the blossoms.rpm is not hurting for $$.i&#39;m really glad that i gave rpm another shot since i left less-than-impressed the last time we came in.i would classify most of the items on the menus as pretty classic italian which suits the palates of my family and for me especially since i didn&#39;t want to tax my digestive system too much before the race..maybe it&#39;s the combination of the perfectly cooked al dente bucatini noodles, or the fresh pomodoro, or even the richness of the olive oil drizzled atop..the bruschetta had a basil pesto which was delicious, but overpowered the tuna to the point of it being pointless to have on the dish.service was superior, food was excellent, and our overall experience was very enjoyable.there are way too many other fantastic and lower priced restaurants in chicago to waste my time going back here.a few friends and i went out to rpm for a birthday dinner, and overall, it was very well-executed italian restaurant in a hip and classy environment.my wife wants to come back every night for our vacation in chicago."

izakaya-mita-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/izakaya-mita-chicago,2,"While i was in japan, nothing was salty enough and i covered everything in wasabi and soy sauce.izakaya mita is the best japanese pub in chicago! there drink menu is creative, unique and modestly priced.then, after all their food came out, i was still waiting on my last course.we also got the &#34;sliders&#34; which were basically crispy rice with whatever you chose on top ( tempura shrimp with chipotle mayo for example) these were tastyhappy hour m-thurs half off kirins!i&#39;d come back if i was in the area and would like to go back to try more noodle dishes that were on the menu.pleasant people -- all contributing to my higher than would have been rating.if you are adventurous or looking for something sweet and simple.the rice sliders and the vegan miso ramen were heavenly.they have dishes here that i haven&#39;t been able to find anywhere else (oshinko, chawanmushi, hi-chus) and the quality of their food always amazes me.solid menu with friendly service..really enjoyed this place.i remember them telling us that they also have gluten free (egg) noodles but not in their ramen.hipster place.we each ordered some of the skewered meats, among them: chicken meatballs, dark chicken meat, beef tenderloin, pork belly, and chicken skins.big chunks of food in chawanmushi don&#39;t work well, they overwhelm the delicate texture.i had fallen in love with traditional japanese cuisine.the bartender  was very helpful especially  with the cocktails.we embarrassingly asked how possible it was for us to split the check (for 13 people!) and she said it was absolutely no problem.tasty japanese bar bites.having the honor to write the very first review, i must say this place is awesome! finally an excellent non-sushi japanese restaurant.went here on opening day.the staff was super nice and helpful, because i had lots of questions from never visiting before, &#34;what is this? was the fish farmed or wild-caught? what is your favorite thing on the menu?&#34; the citrus mushrooms were fantastic, and the okonomiyaki (like a small but very filling pizza) was fantastic! i made a reservation on yelp and was seated immediately on a friday night.and the owner is a real sweetheart.service was great and the ambiance was nice.i liked the idea of the black sesame gomae sauce..we ordered the japanese pickles; gyoza; grilled dark meat chicken, chicken skins, pork belly and oyster mushrooms; and the ebi and green bean tempura.a lot of octopus and squid that was very.i highly recommend!.also tried the yaki soba (meh) and okonomiyaki (solid), kaarage (pretty bad), squid (not a fan - too sweet)the winner here is the matcha cheese cakewe had a group of 5 - total cost was 50 a head, with a bottle of sake.our server frank was very helpful, and on request set up a sake flight for us based on our tastes and what we were eating at the time..asked all the right questions to customize our experience!so glad he did because i would have never ordered the mushrooms or jalapeños and they were delicious! everything was very tasty and new and what a great experience!we were very happy to share a bottle of wine while letting someone else choose for us.i&#39;m obsessed with the fact that they have hitachino white on tap..i love the takoyaki.the service: 5/5.we initially ordered the restaurant week menu to get the food order started and told the waitress to comeback after we decided on some additional dishes from the regular menu and she never came back...i was kind of disappointed they didn&#39;t have onigiri.for many american people who don&#39;t know what izakaya is, it could be a &#39;bad service&#39;.again, they added too much sauce so we weren&#39;t able to enjoy it as much.it&#39;s a small restaurant and when we came in it was packed.i was totally en route to a sushi place on damen and just decided to try this place on a whim.jeremy behind the bar was so informative and a pleasure to get served by.what a pleasant surprise, it was packed during the dining hours on a saturday, but they&#39;re open until 1am on saturday and friday&#39;s! so it was the perfect spot for a night cap with a friend.both hubby and i thought it was the highlight of dinner.it also felt a little thicker than the ones i had in japan..the ambiance at izakaya mita was really charming and the food and drinks were also tasty and well priced.brian and helen are inviting and make you feel like a regular.the plum wine is thick, syrupy, super-sweet and fruity.good concept.it was probably also the best japanese food i&#39;ve had in chicago.just very average..i would definitely recommend the kinoko itame (mushrooms).soooo good.didn&#39;t offer us a drink or menus, not even a water while we wait..great hospitality and that is the core of japanese cuisine..this place was fantastic.the seasoning completely over-powered a really good piece of meat.skip the long lines and taste the better ramen!  takoyaki is marvelous!  mist try!.it was so gamey and over cooked i suspected that it was actually organ meat..had the restaurant week menu last night and it was fantastic..this is a health hazard issue, not something an owner/manager should feel is excusable.we stopped in on a whim and were not disappointed."

it was very vegan friendly as well!.rich, but tasty.for dessert, we got the paczki.hanger steak is very good, but still not as memorable as the duck or any starters.the fact that it was quiet on a saturday morning was also a big plus for me.food was good but not outstanding.to end the meal the blueberry kalancky was a perfect palette cleanser.i cant wait to come back!.definitely order the chicken paprikash!

 we started with the beef cheek perogis which were amazing.great attention to detail when the walls, tables and check presenters all echo the same theme!  personal favorites are the stenciled barn door and that dandelion puff of a chandelier.just kidding.i will not be late for the appetizer the next time..really nice ambiance and great service!.both dishes were perfectly cooked and full of flavor that really transported me to this side of europe.followed by chicken paprikash; which was outstanding.pork schnitzel was divine.beautiful space as well.our waitress was prompt and professional.not terribly though, and not throughout.there was a disappointing hour wait for the chicken liver starter; maybe they had to fatten up the chickens first? but we were compensated by the pirogis--fresh chewy dumplings with rich chopped meat, nicely seasoned and served with dollops of sour cream.i had a chicken liver toast with strawberry preserves and pistachios that was one of the most flavorful dishes i have ever had the pleasure of eating.great vibe but a foodie most try!!the service is outstanding! we opted for the bar and both ali and nicole made our experience that much better.yes, cheese.(i don&#39;t mean to give short shrift to the warm, inviting ambience.between the two of us we still had some food left over.i finally took my husband who loves his german heritage especially the food."

you like cheap? duh you do.i will return frequently.falafel was very fresh and didn&#39;t seem dripping in oil though deep fried...i do wish the hot sauce was a bit more.unfortunately it was too late.i still think naf naf (on michigan) is has slight advantage, but roti is a close second.i recently went the first week of april 2016 and noticed that they are really skimping on serving size.big fan of roti - we stop there almost every time we are in the city.chicken kabob and the hummus are delicious, also the yogurt sauce.had never been before but needed a quick lunch...still it felt rushed but the food quality was decent enough to go at it again and in a world where american food prevails, it&#39;s nice to have mediterranean food start to get more prevalent and quickly available for lunch in a timely manner.i was very pleased with roti.definitely filling and worth it! i&#39;d suggest this to anyone wanting to try this place.the rice plate contains a choice of meat, pita bread, and 3 sides/toppings.i work about a block away and am so happy i tried this place out.this is on my list of places not to miss, especially when working nearby looking for quick lunch.if it was closer to work, i would definitely take out lunch from there often.i guess if i was a professional always in the area i would value this place for it&#39;s fast service and it&#39;s uniqueness (meaning it&#39;s not a panera, corner bakery, mcdonald&#39;s or chipotle).75 cents more!&#34;  i like their food, but the experience and value is not worth a return visit any time soon.i fell so in love i found another one to go to when traveling to dc for work..roti is the place you go for a quick meal.)).fast fast food that is very tasty.if you go there frequently be sure to use their app since you&#39;ll be able to use it to get frequent buyer points.they had to cook it fresh for her.they also have other dressings you can add, like dill yogurt or tahini.the food staff switched gloves when i requested and appreciate it.final verdict: overall the platter is extremely fresh, large and filling.the restaurant layout is almost identical, and the food is about what you&#39;d expect as well - delicious but not authentic..good customer service, and great falafel rice plate.fast and tasty.i had the chicken rice plate with onions, hummus, and cucumber tomato salad.i usually order it with extra veggies, chicken, hummus, olives, and tahini dressing..i was in downtown for an interview and i was walking back to the parking garage after and seen this place right next to it.so good!  i was so greedy i ate almost my entire plate!their line seems to move pretty quickly, even when they are busy.lots of space to seat yourself..i should have read more on what this place actually is, but i was looking for mediterranean food for lunch and saw this place nearby with great ratings, and gave it a try.haven&#39;t been here for a long while and thought to go back to try their grass fed steak.they had just given the last falafel to an order that came in after we had ordered!i said forget this and we walked out.the staff was less than friendly.i did and my food came out right on time.the bread was so-so but it was the end of the day when we ordered.i noticed it was the last beef that was in the serving tray.i didn&#39;t say anything to the guy as i didn&#39;t want to make a scene but if i ever come back and get the same service and 3 pieces of chicken and steak, i will demand to talk to a manager.they give ample sides.the lady behind the counter was uber friendly !.a fantastic fast food mediterranean restaurant.i really want to try their falafel and sandwich next time i go.the line is long but it does move quickly so don&#39;t get nervous.roti is pretty solid.we trekked there during the brutally cold winter and ice, then through the sweltering summer heat from river north to hit this location...i just won&#39;t be in it anymore as the value to price ratio is way to low for my me now.overall a place to grab lunch that is filling and successfully satisfying to a certain extent.yummm! definitely try!veggie: pita sandwich + hummus + all sides minus cabbage/greens + spicy &amp; garlic sauce.i got a chicken roti rice plate with: hummus, cabbage, grilled veggies, hummus &amp; feta (paid extra, one too many toppings).operationally, they have it down pat with a chipotle-like assembly line for the mediterranean wraps, salads and rice bowls.this is kind of pricey, so try to get the bogo coupons from people outside of the train station whenever possible.the best fast food ever, not a typical fast food, it&#39;s healthy and have varieties of options.i feel that a lot of places in the south loop are not so great because it&#39;s by the campuses and tourist area.i had the lavash bread chicken wrap and it was excellent! the food was fresh and delicious..i love these guys! i use them for catering at work all the time.."

 the food and staff were both great!  we had a bread and goat cheese appetizer that was delicious.and people should know that she&#39;s great at her job).the chicken is real, flavorful and perfectly seasoned, unlike many other places that offer a salad.would you be satisfied eating that?no.simple pasta that does the trick.great pasta bar at a low price.it&#39;s also become a favorite of my immediate family and any friends that i take there.worth a try if you want something heavy and fatty.place is very casual and small not made for very large parties.the caprese appetizer was great to start our meal.they also feature a different special appetizer and entree of the day on their chalkboard.came here with 3 others and were waiting a bit long for a table so the manager gave us free cheese bread to eat while we waited and played the free bowling arcade game in the bar side.for ~$15 for a salad, it&#39;s not the most economical thing on the menu, but it was delicious.my confession: i&#39;ve been eating a lot of gnocchi from restaurants lately.-pasta boy peter blue.the pasta was perfectly cooked and their house cream sauce did wonders for the grilled chicken.i did not eat the pasta dish but my friend said it was ok, nothing great."

a frozen negroni on a summer afternoon while playing ping pong with friends!whether you want a frozen cocktail, a mixed drink, a radler with a shot of mezcal or gin, or a wide selection of beer, parson&#39;s really has something for every drinker.loved the menu, disappointed in the actual food.this would definitely be a four star experience if it weren&#39;t for the food.breasts are not whole breasts and cut at very odd angles with surprise small bones, etc.having lunch at parson&#39;s by myself on a weekday inspired me to &#34;eat, pray, love&#34; proportions.told there was a 20-30min wait to be seated.the hot was my favorite, but i really enjoyed all three.while the fried chicken is clearly a worthy main event, my favorite dish i return for is a seasonal faro salad.the fish to bread ratio was way off.why havent i written a review yet?!crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.my friend and i agreed to try it again on a weeknight, with the assumption it would be slower than a weekday and that the food might taste better.i was starving so it was hard for me to wait over 20 minutes for our appetizer.chicago is a city of drinking and dining ingenuity, and parson&#39;s epitomizes that ingenuity.bam it hit ya wow yum.must.i&#39;ve been wanting to check out parson&#39;s for a long time, ever since i heard they have alcoholic slushees.went on a random tuesday evening with my boyfriend, patio was jam packed! chicken was super juicy!! drinks are a little pricey but i expected that.walked in here around 4 pm on a saturday and there wasn&#39;t much of a crowd.cheese curds were really good and the service was amazing.for the price, you should absolutely get more..i&#39;m not gonna lie i feel pretty cool sitting next to these hipsters.:( decided to give parsons another chance because it&#39;s so close to my apartment and i really do enjoy their food!the service was definitely better this time around so that was a plus.fantastic food, get the chicken sandwich.i had the fried chicken, obviously and cheese curds.3-hour wait times for fried food on a gravel patio..sometimes/usually there&#39;s a wait but there&#39;s plenty of benches to wait and you can order cocktails and people-watch.i will never go back.they were so good that we ordered another round of each.we were able to get seats at the bar outside instead of waiting for a picnic table.the hush puppies are good as well.i was glad to have the tasty iced tea and side of pickles to cool my palette,  but eagerly moved on to the drumstick,  which was likewise perfectly cooked and delectably spicy.i&#39;ve been in the winter time and since they&#39;re small they add a covered addition to the side of the restaurant which can be a bit cold.very interesting people watching - we didn&#39;t know we were going to get a show with dinner.they have bang bang pie, which rocks.have a dog?  bring it.but i would never complain about a drink being too strong, lets be honest.they have ping pong and i guess an ice rink in the winter :).some in the group described the fried chicken as &#34;snail meat&#34; because of the lack of meat which is why i opted for the spicy chx.my husband had the chicken sandwich.the chicken was of course crunchy and tender.he helped kill time with me while waiting..i enjoyed my meal so much, i was thinking about going back the next day.the atmosphere was pretty good but i assume it&#39;s better when you&#39;re eating there and not standing around waiting to leave with your food.parsons is a continuation of that streak.i have been several times and have determined the fish is better than the chicken - wash it down with a negroni slushi.also the frozen pisco sour was amazing!! the chicken was nice and crispy.this place is cute! it was raining so i didn&#39;t get to sit outside but inside makes you feel like a hipster.i think they also have bocce ball too.while our server was very friendly, when it came to the back yard bar, they are awful.the food is served diner style and you can apply lashes of either of their two home made sauces which are delicious..he ordered the hot chicken(said it was disgusting and if you can&#39;t do chicken right then there&#39;s something wrong) and hush puppies.it&#39;s not convenient to get to, but definitely worth trying.we did however enjoy the hush puppies..great place for summer group.my best experience at parson&#39;s was ironically when i ordered food to go - i got the 2 piece fried amish chicken and hush puppies.this is definitely one of my favorite patios in the city! you can find me here many a summer nights with my pup enjoying a few cocktails! the patio is large, dog friendly and has a ping pong table for additional entertainment.my group ordered what must have been the werp farms salad (i wasn&#39;t paying attention).it definitely wasn&#39;t worth the price for the portion size."

everything tasted amazing, and the service was great! highly recommend this place for some great italian food!!!.hands-down the best italian food in chicago.great service.only gripe is i wish we had more people to join us so we could have ordered more food!! just come here already!.they were so tender, they just absorbed the vodka sauce so they became little vodka sauce bombs that exploded with flavor on each bite!!! incredible.it was very crowded on a friday night, so be sure to make a reservation if you will be dining at a peak time.there is no indication of anyone needing to be told what they need to be doing or hour to interact with customers.la scarola is like eating dinner at your grandma&#39;s house.this place was clearly a friends and family establishment.this is a hidden gem, i must say!  i&#39;m generally not doing back flips about italian cuisine but the food here.i got the eggplant parmigiana.i made reservations at 6pm on monday, however we showed up 15 minutes early, but were still able to chose our seats..i liked the bread so much but so much.i had the gnocchi primavera and it is a rich but delicious dish that you have to try!!i also had a nibble or two of the grilled calamari and octopus which were fresh and cooked to perfection.great value.valet service makes it convenient.the wait was longer than expected, but the owner was very persistent about letting us know it would be just a little bit longer until we sat down.dinner for 4 (to my surprise, we went over).but then again.the ambiance was crowded and vey loud.it totaled up to 3 meals over a few days for me! everyone else loved their dinners too, and everyone left with extras.great service too.a million stories not the least of which is his picture with sinatra, proudly displayed on an interior wall.this place is just ridiculously good- don&#39;t even get me started on the tirimisu! thanks for the great service, guys!..i&#39;ve seen closets larger and cleaner than this place.this gives you the &#34;authentic&#34; experience-neighborhood, atmosphere, service and food&#34;.i miss you la scarola.i have no idea why we were asked to leave!  the restaurant was so quite full.loud, no frills decor, but in a great way..one of my favorite italian places to dine.homey location- excellent food.i had the spinach florentine ravioli and my husband had the half chicken, both dishes were excellent!.but the appeal lies in the food.if you like seafood try the grilled octopus it&#39;s brilliant.ambiance is fantastic- don&#39;t think modern and sleek, but very old-school, where the waiters have been there for decades and the walls display a story of famous hollywood royalty.that made for a great meal the next day!!price is great too.nevertheless, upon entering, you immediately know you&#39;ve entered a true establishment; one that&#39;s been around for quite a while.the food - wow!!! the staff are sooo welcoming.the shell was fresh and crunchy, and the cream was the perfect texture.i&#39;ll be sure to ask for him next time.hands down one the the best italian restaurants ever!!! it&#39;s not fancy but great, great, great food.this place was fantastic!total family feel, 100% authentic, and you can tell this place has been around for a while.my lady had the eggplant i had the grilled octopus and the chicken vesuvio.everything is excellent and i like the wine list as well as the cocktails.la scarola is a little gem among the excess of chic and trendy italian restaurants in chicago, it&#39;s old school charm with a bustling and noisy atmosphere which is like taking a step back in time - maybe not for everyone but it works for me.i&#39;ve been going here for three years now and it never disappoints! the food is amazing every time! please go, order anything, and i guarantee you will return.for the main course, i opted for the eggplant parmesan, which was not the breaded kind (which is why i ordered it) and came with a generous portion of angel hair pasta.armando, edgar, and the rest of the staff make dinning a special experience.our party had a reservation and still happily waited for a table, despite the restaurant being 75% empty at the time.you&#39;ll show up and they&#39;ll ask you to come back in a few bc they&#39;re busy.the food, the service is priceless..the menu has a large variety of appetizers, salads, soups, entrees, pastas and desserts.apathetic waiter says to us that they are closed and won&#39;t seat us when clearly other diners are still waiting for their entrees.well maybe not charm but definitely old school.oh and we had a couple of appetizers, muscles and a shrimp thing over mashed potatoes..absolutely amazing food and very large and tasteful wine selection.now i&#39;m a big boy, and i eat at these places on business trips.our waiter was great, the wine was great and the food was delicious.a traditional italian restaurant that is not fancy but with history and charm.all were amazing.loved the food and the staff was very welcoming! made an 8pm reservation for a table of 6 on a friday night, when we walked in, it was so busy, every table was full and the ambience was great, everyone is there to have a good time.although, bread is bread in some cases, and we enjoyed dipping it in the olive oil and parmesan cheese on the table.they have a nice selection of wine and i ordered the chilean sea bass special, which was delicious.friendly, casual atmosphere..i only order my entree from the hand written daily specials.no discount on check was offered ($50 for two people) please avoid!.excellent service, reasonable prices."
rapidito-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rapidito-chicago,1,"Also enjoyed the garlic shrimp flatbread.food was authentic and delicious.the food is always delicious, though.owner is also very very kind =) i&#39;m surprised there aren&#39;t more people that know about this amazing corner spot!.colombian got was delicious with a apple soda.i support all deserving colombian restaurants because they are few and far between and should be embraced by the public as they are more than just coffee.but we&#39;ll be back soon.i have been going there for almost a month at least once a week and i am never disappointed.i always get the grazin pizza thing it&#39;s so good..we wanted to try a few different things, so i ordered the grazing dog and the salchipapas, while my boyfriend got the flying dog and the oinking arrepizza.the staff is very friendly and the food is delicious.the flavors are paired well and portion size is sufficient.i doubt you&#39;ll see me then, but i&#39;ll be back for lunch...the service is great and the food took me back to colombia.great neighborhood spot.hands down the greatest hot dog i have ever eaten.it was a bit difficult to find the place although it&#39;s on a main street partly because the area is nothing but residential condos.i recommend it highly for delicious, flavorful food in a friendly atmosphere..my first time here and i loved everything i tried, great taste and amazing service!! i would definitely be back! the salchipapas make a delicious side, definitely recommend.but the real winner was the grazing hot dog...**this review is not about the food, but rather service **i went in to this place under the impression that if i posted pictures on social media i would get a free coffee.pretty good place for a non-traditional hot dog.you get delicious food, rapidly!  i was quite impressed with my colombian hot dog order, which contained flavors that made my taste buds run wild.very delicious and inexpensive..this place is amazing! the flatbreads, the skewers and the hot dog are the best in town.nice people there too.one of the best colombian restaurants in the city! they have a very good hot dogs and a lot of small delicious dishes for very inexpensive price.arrepas, my colombian friend loved it all!overall: my colombian friend and i approve.anyway it want for me maybe it&#39;ll be for you.first time here but i&#39;ll definitely be back.don&#39;t see this place lasting long.:)..the service is friendly, the food is delicious and the prices are great.been coming since right after they opened.."
90-miles-cuban-café-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/90-miles-cuban-caf%C3%A9-chicago-4,1,"The sitting is very limited however the food is great!!! i&#39;ve had the ropa vieja and the cubano sandwiches and they never disappoint me.it&#39;s the closest taste to home i have tried in chicago.and sit and enjoy inside- but beware only about 4 people and a midget will comfortably on site..there isn&#39;t a lot of room to eat inside but we managed and luis the manager, couldn&#39;t have been any friendlier! everything we had tasted delicious and can&#39;t wait to go there again and try their breakfast! if you haven&#39;t tried this place, you must go!.it wasn&#39;t all that anyway.the space itself is small, but they do have an outdoor patio, which i imagine is nice for the summer.the man behind the counter was extremely warm and welcoming and helped me  with the menu when i admitted that i was new to cuban food.quick service.always place order before arriving but this place did not answer there phone for 1 hour 30 minutes! drove all the way there for them to tell me 45 to close that they are done not taking any orders?!?why couldn&#39;t u answer ur phone the 100 times i called.the steak sandwich was pretty awesome with the onions and chimichurri sauce.the guava and cheese is an interesting, but delicious combination.when you go their and you find your dish, you&#39;ll understand.best cuban i&#39;ve ever had in my life! better than any cuban place i could find in miami so that&#39;s really saying something.we had to wait 30 minutes for our food.i mean with 6 customers he&#39;s going to need all the help he can get.warning: not fast.great food for the price - you&#39;re paying the same amount or more for e.very fairly priced for chicago (7 bones for the sandwich and 1 for the coffee) - i plan to visit again when i&#39;m in the area..i searched chicago for a quality reviewed cuban (not mexican) restaurant because i craved masas de puerco.like paladar in logan square!.and my mission is to eat the entire menu, but it&#39;s so hard because i can&#39;t help but fill up on the empanadas!if you haven&#39;t been here there is an emptiness in your soul that you won&#39;t even know about until you fill it..sandwiches are pretty big and come with plantain chips (though some of the chips were cold and soggy), but you will be satisfied.rips vieja is our favorite.the price was a touch too high, so not a great value but if in the mood for cuban and i&#39;d definitely go back.this is the original 90 miles to cuba @ 3101 n clybourn avenue (hint it&#39;s actually a little further then 90 miles to cuba).i&#39;m officially addicted to cubanos now.i&#39;ve never had a bad meal here, and i can&#39;t leave without getting a cuban espresso!!!.it&#39;s byob and very reasonably priced.my boyfriend loved the meat dish he ordered too.i really enjoyed it.yummmm.make sure you check your bag before you leave because this is not the first time it&#39;s happened to me.i sampled some of my friends fricase de pollo and croqueta which were both delicious but would still choose the steak =)pros:the food- seriously everything is fantastic!byob- you can literally bring a bottle of whatever with no cork fee..empanadas.solid food and fun scene.i had the ropa vieja ( shredded beef) sandwich and was in heaven!  authentic flavors, not pretentious, humble but surprising!  i&#39;ll be back!.always a smile and willing to answer a question..great place for coffee as well.the food and service are always great here at 90 miles.small space with great character.in response to the owner stating dogs must be outside the sidewalk cafe on a leash, i researched the claim and its unfounded.tried their media noche sandwich (a friday special) as opposed to their cuban.really nice place, nice service, tasty tostones and yuca frita.byob!food is super super super greasy..the meat was juicy and flavorful and the pickle outstanding / great crunch! i haven&#39;t had a cuban since a florida trip years ago! a cute, casual and full of nostalgia place i will go back again!.i have spent a lot of time in miami and i thought that was where i would find the best cuban sandwich.refill their drinks but step out from behind the counter..it wasn&#39;t a big deal though since it&#39;s not normally like that, and they gave us a credit.this restaurant did not disappoint.the employees are lack luster, the outside tables wobbly and that&#39;s about it.the restaurant is small, with only enough seats for a handful of people.the traditional marinated beef served with rice and my favorite maduros (fried plantains).i came back in less than a minute and the plates had been cleared!  a table which had been empty for at least 15 minutes still had a stack of dirty plates on it but mine had been promptly cleaned..now, i recognize the fact that i&#39;m picky but what can i say, i know what i like.i come here once a week or more.this place is awesome! i order a sandwich from here about once a week and it&#39;s always good.there&#39;s only two downsides: they can be a little slow and they&#39;re pretty expensive for what&#39;s essentially a sub sandwich.the staff was nice but the food was not the same.even though i had a reservation that i made months in advance, we ended up waiting 20-30 minutes, and there&#39;s not much room to wait, even in the waiting room!in addition to prosecco, we brought rum to make mojito cocktails with.holy grease ball batman."
the-purple-pig-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-purple-pig-chicago,2,"The place is usually pretty packed so come early.i&#39;d definitely recommend coming to check this place out with a group of friends.now for the purple pig, we started with the &#34;j (jowl)lt&#34; with a duck egg and it was single handily the best version of a blt we&#39;ve had to date.this was the correct choice and tied with the pork belly for most flavorful of the night.everything tastes so good, i can&#39;t wait to try other things on their menu next time.third came our steak- and let me tell you, it was the best cooked steak i have ever had.had the pig ears with kale that were a little bit salty, and a beer.its the type of life-altering experience that future chefs will reference on top chef in the year 2034.since we weren&#39;t that hungry, we ordered the fried pig&#39;s ear and the sicilian iris.really liked pistachios for crunch.like most places in the area, they do not take resos.service was very on point, came by often to attend to us on a very busy night!overall, 5/5!.wish it was more than just three bites..it had big capers in it (or at least that&#39;s what i was told they were), which were great.not much else to say because i had such a fantastic experience, and the many many many other reviews can vouch for how great and worth your time purple pig is.i thought the cornbread and pig ears dishes were tasty but the cornbread was a tad too sweet and the pig ears needed more contrast from the salty and crispy.come try this place out it&#39;s well worth it.we literally walked in around 9pm on a saturday night and got a table for 2 with no reservation.all of the food is prepared on point and the service was impeccable..drinks: we all ordered the sangria, both red and white..every time purple pig  is our choice in chicago downtown.about 30 minutes later we walked back and was seated in about 2 minutes.pros: food is delicious and unique, service is accommodating (especially considering how long people are waiting they do a good job keeping people happy), and the ambiance is fun.tuna salad3.we ordered several plates that i&#39;m still salivating about..#noshame.so good in fact, i went two days in a row.if you don&#39;t have a reservation, you can still dine at the covered and heated patio as long as you are willing to eat while standing !the menu is innovative and  it&#39;s definitely nice to know that such great quality and selection is available on the magnificent mile.the restaurant was extremely crowded and inside, people were struggling to get around each other.a marathoner&#39;s gotta re-hydrate, you know.- foie gras torchon - yummy!! so rich and creamy and delicious!- crispy pig ears - this was really pleasant all mixed together, super crispy ears went well with the greens- pork shank - super tender and flavorful!- bone marrow - i didn&#39;t eat this, but my friends enjoyed.crowd favorite at our table.i cannot speak highly enough of this place (i mean clearly, i&#39;ve practically written a novel).especially tasty were the tater tots and the turkey leg...we got the bone marrow, chicken thigh kabobs, and gyro and all were sooooooo good!! the prices were so reasonable too!! the whole staff works together it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a manager or server or bus boy they all work hand and hand and all great!! when i&#39;m back in chicago i can&#39;t wait to try the other items!!! great place :) thanks adam for being so nice and attentive!!.we were talking and sharing stories with people all the way from florida.although, they were just pork rinds.pork blade steak5.chicago.mmmmstill waiting to try everything.although the restaurant was filled, we were seated immediately.i rarely remember dishes that were mediocre and will only be mentioning ones that i dreamt about or disliked!the sirloin tip didn&#39;t have many reviews on here but we were blown away!!!! get the sirloin now.it&#39;s a simple taste but was amazing.oh yea, we came here to eat! what what! just as a note, 5 dishes may be too much for 2 people so if you do decide to select your own dishes, ask the waiter how big the plate is.the bone marrow is out of this world! plan for very long waits.the pork neck gravy tasted like pulled pork and was so rich and creamy with a great tomato base..give this place a try if you are looking for delicious tapas and great service!.come in and put your name on the list, they&#39;ll call you when your table is ready..warm bread would have been a nice touch.they were both amazing.service was terrific and there were plenty of veggie options.we had a few drinks, the bone marrow, octopus, manchego, and meatballs..my only wish would be to have at least one or two kid friendly dishes.now this dish definitely had that out of this world flavor i was searching for.it states mediterranean food but i didn&#39;t see many options of mediterranean food.we also got the pork steak for two with charred red cabbage and bone marrow custard..i had long heard the hype about this place and finally made my way over for sunday brunch..before you get to enjoy the delectables, prepare to wait a few hours.really cool vibe.more on the sweet side than the savory.just when i didn&#39;t think it could get any better, the bone marrow came.by the time i had finished my meal there were a bunch of people waiting outside, with drinks of course so it&#39;s really not too bad..when you spread it on the toast it cuts some of the saltiness and is just a great appetizer.my skin pricked right up on my first bite and i got the shivers, it was that good! i normally hate cilantro, but everything just went great together.the meat board was very big and packed with treats and the tongue was freaking amazing.* octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes, and salsa verde ($16)* turkey leg confit with crispy lentils, napa cabbage, and agrodolce ($17)* pork blade steak with &#39;nduja and honey ($17)* squid stuffed with prosciutto and breadcrumbs, santorini fava puree, and charmoula ($15)* milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes ($13)from the above recommendations, we ended up going with the broccoli, calamari, pig&#39;s ear, and octopus.something more casual?service: our main waitress, andy, was wonderful! she was friendly, patient, and very knowledgeable with the food items.i liked it better than the girl &amp; the goat.i love their octopus too was the squid was amazing.the food was wonderful but i think my visit was ruined by a rowdy table with drunk guest next to us.had a lovely experience at the purple pig! the wait was lengthy but it definitely ended up being worth the time (and there are plenty of places you can explore or grab a drink at nearby while you wait).we had the pig ear, pork shoulder with ricotta, meatballs, and the sicilian iris.it&#39;s pricy but worth it for a special treat.i was reading the same cooking technique on a food blog the other day."

the-wormhole-coffee-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-wormhole-coffee-chicago,1,"Gonna miss your place.really liked the nerdy decor of this coffeeshop and how you can bring a laptop to spend the afternoon there chilling.they have great coffee, multiple different kinds of seating options [from couches to bar stools], friendly baristas, tons of outlets, and an 80&#39;s sci-fi kitsch explosion that suits my nerdy-tinged tastes.in fact, it seemed like seats were turning over regularly during the time we were there.everytime my partner and i vacation, he finds a few quirky or quaint little coffee shops to pop into and try.they have a lot of cool stuff around the store that i wanna check out next time i come back, like the old school video game console, the small section of quirky gift ideas, and the cool car in the back of the store.the honey bear was perfectly sweetened, creamy, and topped with a delicious and luxurious foam.okay so the place is amazing, i love the vintage set up of it and of course the ever so famous delorean! next the coffee was so good! i ordered the koopa troopa, i love the unique mix of peanut butter and dark cocoa (best of both worlds) i would love to try the other coffee that they offer.the whole place was covered in 80&#39;s decor  and they even had a delorean- but this place wasn&#39;t all for show, their coffee is just as good! i ordered the cool.the barista with the awesome beard gave me tons of tips for the best places in the area on top of my order.this cafe can definitely serve as an off-the-grid study spot.and while intelligensia is cool, they&#39;re a little too far off the beaten path for this silly comparison..two other musts are the koopa troopa (peanut butter latte) and honey bear (honey latte).i came on thursday afternoon and it was super chill finding a place to sit.the coffee menu is pretty minimalist, but of a good quality.my wicker park mecca, i love coming here to write papers and study.love it,very busy always, there is outdoor seating on the street.this place is adorable and has a great vibe.the interior is a little grungy, but who cares?  the coffee and specialty drinks are worth it!  wormhole offers your familiar espresso fare, but amps it up with drinks like the peanut butter koopa troopa (mocha) and honey bear latte (with local honey).the delorean is the closest i&#39;ll get to having a real one and just being surrounded by people and items that represent how much i love these films makes me happy.oh, love this place.the decorations are very 80&#39;s as the theme goes.it is hard to come across a place like this everyday so i really get out of my way to go here whenever i am in the city.when she saw were sitting across the bar and called our names for the drinks i still had to get up which was fine but didn&#39;t really make much sense we were right in front of here.i love the decor - they have a delorean car model in the cafe and a bunch of cool gadgets referencing classic movies and games.the staff always seems sweet and even gregarious.how can you not love that?if you are a tmnt fan, bttf fan or love 80&#39;s this place will knock your socks off.this place isn&#39;t super big, but there&#39;s enough seating if you get here earlier in the day, and sofas in the back.(late and non local customer)the wormhole was my first coffee shop stop in chicago when i visited over the summer duringa cross country road trip.i had to borrow some poor girl&#39;s hoverboard and tried to get away but those boards don&#39;t work on water! i won&#39;t bore you with the details of the rest of my day but it was pretty crazy..really cute hipsterish coffee shop.very cool 80s themed coffee shop.the business itself is great.but all this comes with a long queue - both for coffee and bathroom!.i also always bring friends and family who are in town visiting to check out wh.how can you go wrong with a place that has a delorean inside?  you can&#39;t, people.i tried the honey bear latte as well and it was delicious.super nice staff.so yea, five stars.the late night hours were what had originally brought my business to the wormhole.i was much too full after dinner, or else i would have tried the pb drink..i know that i will be going back wormhole coffee, to try more of their menu items.:).cute themed cafe to hang out in.this place is great for a 3 hour catch up chat or working on your homework or your new novel.i just wanted a macchiato and double espresso to go and the counter guy refused..i work at a coffee shop, so i know my order is sort of stupid.and after you&#39;re done with your first cup, you can get a refill of hot water for a second strain.this place is cool but i wasn&#39;t a fan of it being soo jammed packed, pretty loud (from all the people and workers dropping stuff), and the drinks were kind of mediocre compared to the surrounding coffee shops in chicago.great strong iced coffee at a decent price.all of their furniture is eclectic, different, and mismatched..i went here for the first time and loved it! prices are reasonable, and there are plenty of seats and outlets to plug in your computer.play video games all while being visually stimulated by 80&#39;s relics..if you enjoy coffee shops, you owe it to experience what worm hole has to offer!.it&#39;s a very cozy and cute place with unique decor.d) if there are bigger problems in the world why aren&#39;t you out there solving them?focus on the cup and the consumer mate, that is your lesson here.the lighting is a little dim - the windows do most of the work..also, there&#39;s a delorean.the inside decor is funky too.the service was great.atmosphere, 5 stars easy.i ordered off the specialswhich were highly varied and interesting in their coffee treatment.having permission to be a dork in a public gave me the greatest happiness.they have games, couches, and a casual ambience for social gatherings!.probably my favorite beans i&#39;ve gotten in chicago..the coffee is not half bad neither..they also have cereal, how cool is that?? they are unsurprisingly busy on the weekends but it&#39;s never too hard to find a seat on week nights.later on during my study sesh i tried the iced chai latte per the baristas recommendation.customer service is generally fine, a bit standoffish but nothing atypical for an artisanal coffee shop.fantastically delicious, not rude at all.great place to watch hipsters and students thrive in their element.great coffee!been here several times and the quality has been great all the time, if you are lucky you will find a seat during the busy hours, in the morning there&#39;s seating available most of the times.delorean in the back, wifi password on a floppy disk, light music, nes system to play, what&#39;s not to like? coming from austin, the wormhole became my go-to coffee shop, making me feel right at home."
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/opart-thai-house-chicago-2,2,"Great ambience, generous helpings, reasonably priced, great service and most importantly delicious food.what a great evening..will definitely be back!..thai is amazing.i have not been inside yet, but delivery is good..so yummy!  started out with the moo ping - totally reminds me of marinated skewers that you would find at some food stall in an asian nightmarket!  sweet, nicely charred, and a great contrast with the sour dipping sauce.they&#39;re everything i&#39;ve dreamed about and more!.can&#39;t forget about their thai iced coffee! i like drinking it as a dessert :dthe location is great, really easy to find parking, and the service and staff are super nice and friendly.very well done.they have not had a grand opening yet so the hours varies.the service is great and everyone is friendly.ambiance is laid back and casual..i ordered the  pad chou-chi, which was spectacular..i love the green curry, pad see ewe, penang curry, all with chicken.i have yet to experience table service so can&#39;t review service itself.every time i go to thailand the thing i look forward to the most is the food.everything was much spicier than i though but it was all delicious!.even though it was a little out of our way, we decided to have our wedding reception there..it looks like they use a bag of frozen vegetables.curry fried rice and the pad-see-iew were solid.great customer service.they have carry out and delivery, but their dining room is now open too..this place is good with a capital g..don&#39;t eat too much crab rangoon it will make you fat.the heart and soul here is palpable!.it was mouthwateringly delicious, and the beef was perfectly cooked and seasoned!  i loved the fresh chinese broccoli, and it was nice and spicy, as requested.i&#39;ve had the opportunity to dine at every pace that has occupied this location since it actually was a chicago public library.some surprising differences at this location opposed to the western spot in lincoln square - the ambience is so much better.beautiful place..from their tiger cry, to their curries, even to their peanut sauce, opart never disappoints! this particular location is something different, from their exposed brick to their half circle booths to offering open window seating for the warmer months, it makes for a nice ombiance for lunch or dinner with the family, on a date or even for an event under the skylight in the atrium.there will be many orders in my future.gotta get their potstickers!.it&#39;s the perfect mix of sweet, spicy and savory flavors.soooo delicious! i know it&#39;s listed under hot and spicy but i could request mild on their online ordering and it was super delicious.we&#39;re wondering if they&#39;re still remodeling as it looks sort of sparse.the delivery took a bit longer than expected, but the noodle dishes were perfectly seasoned and cooked, with our shrimp and chicken having both the savory and sweet flavors i was expecting.and it&#39;s byob!.decent food, but takes forever.since then, no other thai restaurants can compare their pad see ew and pad thai.normal spiciness is a 3, i ordered a 4 and it was a little too much for me.highly recommend the food here!!.tiger cry was amazing.second time not.opart will break the curse of this familiar restaurant corner.we started with vegetable egg rolls - they were very fresh and tasty.may need to dine-in to give it a fair shake."
blaze-fast-fired-pizza-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blaze-fast-fired-pizza-chicago-3,1,"The customer service here is horrible! blaze&#39;s credit card machine was broken this week and the woman at the register told us we had to leave the restaurant, walk to an atm, and come back to pay cash -- on our lunch break where we already waited in a 20 min line to order the pizza! there was no sign that said &#34;cash only&#34; on the door, nor did the person taking the order tell us we needed cash.not as great as the pizza i think.i waited around 3-5 minutes for my pizza, which is quick.i&#39;ve met the manager of this location and he&#39;s such a great guy, you can see why the staff are all so happy and friendly.yes, you can pick from a wide range of fresh yummy ingredients...the wait is usually long if you go right around lunch time so make sure you go get a head start or wait patiently in line.95.thank you for the free pizza coupon! i rarely pass up free anything.décor: think of this place as the chipotle of pizza..i swear by the white top, minus bacon and i add every freaking cheese (seriously), basil, pineapple and pesto drizzle...com/menu/nutr…if you&#39;re interested in knowing that information.how does a business run this way? if you have the option go to build your own for a similar concept but better experience.eat here if you like pizza.they recognize my daughter surina from our few visits and she loves them!!! not sure where they find their staff but it&#39;s a great recipe for a successful business!!!.the line was ridiculous so take advantage of the online ordering so that once you get there you can go straight to the cashier to check-in and you easily save 15-20 minutes.the roasted veggie gorgonzola salad and blood orange lemonade ar great add ons as well.the pizza was really good and the staff was awesome.the art lover was a good flavor combo, but not mixed very well so you wound up with big puddles of just ricotta cheese or just red sauce (it does say &#34;dollops of red sauce&#34; on the menu so this probably shouldn&#39;t have been a surprise).there is a nice taste of woodfire on your crust which is a very thin crust and you can chose all ingredients for your toppings.amazing thin crust pizza amazingly fast.laid-back atmosphere filled with young energetic workers who are filled courtesy.okay, i honestly don&#39;t understand the hype about this place.it takes very little time to make your own pizza unless the place is very crowded.totally unprofessional.after the pizza is baked, i like to add the pesto sauce.had the green stripe.the staff was really friendly and explained how things worked.this place is pizza perfection.so i was ready for that.i ordered one of the pre-styled pizzas from the list, and it was delicious.totally enjoyed the pizza, the service is quick and prompt.the red-orange lemonade (the name could be off) is great as well but can be super sugary so be forewarned.took max of 8 min from time i arrived and picked my ingredients to the time my pizza was ready..also, this joint saved our bacon last weekend, as we had planned to lunch at nearby native foods, which turned out to be closed for a looong holiday break (with no notice on their website)..everyone with smiles, even with working at a crazy pace that day with the grand opening.from different types of cheeses to so many kinds of meat and veggies, sauces, seasoning, etc.even the pizza cutter malcolm was friendly and suggested i put a bbq drizzle ontop my pizza.as of 12/31/2014, price was $7.lolwill be back next time i&#39;m at ogilvie instead of eating at the overpriced and lousy places at the train station.they are fast and they are efficient.but it&#39;s pretty great, especially when considering how convenient it is..one of the best parts is that even in the heaviest of foot traffic days with the line almost out the door you can bet your butt that you&#39;ll be in and out with your piping hot pizza in minutes and they never disappoint.i think i need to express their genuineness before i begin reviewing this restaurant.i got the meateater pizza but i added bacon and red peppers..i&#39;m a voracious eater, and one pizza is good for me!i ordered a pizza for pick up on my phone via yelp during the weekday rush lunch hour, got to skip the entire line, checked in at the cashier, waited somewhere between 5-10 minutes for my pizza and walked out.i&#39;d highly recommend it.i absolutely love this place and everything about it! where else can you walk in and every employee had a smile on their face and looks like they&#39;re having fun? i usually order a build your own on a gluten free crust where (the first time in chicago) they actually asked if i would like a glove change!!! for those of you who understand food allergies, this is huge! then you add toppings, they call you by your name and 3-4 minutes later you can be enjoying the best pizza.first off the pizza&#39;s are one price, no matter how many toppings you add..thanks again for the great service and food and for having nice options for people with dietary restrictions.first time to this location have but will be back.remember, fast-fire&#39;d is in their name.blaze and then blaze.why is it so hard to find fresh mushrooms or spinach on a pizza in chicago?  better yet, this place offers a salad bar of ingredients in which you outfit your pizza however you&#39;d like, without the ridiculous tradition of charging a buck or more for each single ingredient...this place puts punch pizza to shame.1-topping pepperoni is perfect for me.i&#39;ll definitely back - the menu options sound great but with all the toppings available, it&#39;s like a pizza laboratory.i personally recommend the meat eater.ask robin thicke.nice crust and nice sauce.we will most certainly be back.really good, fast,  and fresh pizza.service person reaches her gloved hand into the bacon and sausage containers, and sprinkles away.the size is perfect for one and despite an option to customize, i enjoyed their options as well.this is where pizza meets chipotle.loved it! fast, easy, good."
athenian-room-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/athenian-room-chicago,1,"Then, i ordered the salad with the gyro meat (extremely large portions, you could easily split).solid inexpensive greek restaurant with a relatively cozy romantic atmosphere.i had the charburger with feta on pita bread.it&#39;s all about the chicken kalamata style (aka &#34;tina fey&#34; chicken).our server was quick and nice.their food is really good.good food.i had the kalamata chicken with greek fries.the fries that it was served with were soggy and drenched in oil and lemon.one downside that some people (not me) might not like is everything is served with fries.i ordered the shrimp athenian dinner which wasn&#39;t bad.the staff was very friendly, we were seated quickly, and the water was always topped off.better to eat at the restaurant.great portion size, fast service.always has and always will be my favorite restaurant! my favorite is the steak but everything on the menu is amazing! the taramasalata is a must have!..the feta burger and fries is great.this place is fine, but leaves something to be desired.this is this best gyro i have ever had in my whole life..one of my fav local spots.desert menu and drink selection could possibly be extended to include other specialities.the best!!i live right next door to this gem.the gyro dinner was huuuge.one waitress told me i had to wait for him to be seated, even though i knew what to order the both of us and i saw tons of empty seats.everything is always goodbad part is that waitresses feel/look like they don&#39;t want to be there.no wonder it is tina fey&#39;s favorite chicago restaurant! try the kalamata chicken!.tonight was the last straw and i will not be coming back.i love their food, i&#39;ve only had an issue with a waitress once.outdoor seating.~jonathan.athenian room has great greek food with heaping portions.the food is filling and tasty so get ready to leave a little fluffy (and maybe take a nap after).&#34;as it turns out, the chicken k is as good as tina and the yelpers promise.the server that came and took our order was very nice.meanwhile my friends bit into the chicken kabobs &amp; discovered they were raw &amp; extremely tough.00 still a great deal!..they were perfectly warm and crispy on the outside.awesome place and amazing food but the front desk lady with glasses was rude but the guys were cool.they are very dry and salty.for athenian i tend to lean towards gyros bc im always eating chicken.i love the food, but whoever answers the phones over there to take orders is rude and unprofessional!!! i can&#39;t understand why they would have someone so impatient, rude, and inconsiderate answering the phones.it was probably one of the first nice days so i think they were understaffed.i always have leftovers for the next day.possibly the worst food i have ever had.the thick cut fries are delicious.everything on the menu comes w a beautiful little salad and great bread.great service and great food.but i was craving a salad.the chicken was pretty good, just a tad bit on the dry side.she comes back and picks up the plate and says &#34;i have to show them this&#34; so this was already pretty awkward but we were having a family dinner so i tried not to make too much fuss of her huge attitude.but looking for a nice lunch? or craving a great gyro, but don&#39;t want to eat in a fast-food place? then stop in at the athenian room or glasscott&#39;s; won&#39;t be disappointed!.we like the food, we like the ambience, but we don&#39;t like your attitude, your rudeness, or the shortness you direct towards us and your employees.go to the bar next door to buy your alcoholic drinks and bring them back to your table.i ordered the chicken kabob and my friend order the chicken platter, both of which were the driest chicken we&#39;ve ever tasted.there was no line and no wait for a table on sunday morning.the people are always friendly and attentive.i enjoyed the casual ambience.i will definitely return for more.i&#39;m giving it three stars because the food came quickly,  the server was helpful, and the bill was cheap.meh.."
mad-boiler-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mad-boiler-chicago,1,"Will definitely be back!.but i feel like this has been done before, at lower prices, and this place won&#39;t be long for the west loop at the prices they&#39;re charging with the overhead they&#39;re paying.here is why i didn&#39;t give it the 5th star.i hated the menu because it was hard to make separate orders.very clean and nice staffs too.after we added more cajun much better...look no further..the menu was vast and just about every seafood freak will love that there isn&#39;t a sea creature not featured here.great place !!!owners are very polite and honest with food which is hard to find.this place is legithad crab legs in garlic butter - so garlicky and buttery, i wanted to drink the saucealso had the shrimp with louisiana sauce, nice and spicy!had to get some coleslaw so i could get some veggies in toothey have a liquor license too which is niceright now it&#39;s not too crowded which is great.don&#39;t let the negative reviews fool you.terrible service, took them around 20 minutes to seat me at a table and then the waitstaff basically ignored me.the crawfish were smaller than my pinky finger and they were basically inedible..the sheik was delicious!!! i made sure to get more than enough so i could eat my heart&#39;s desire and be greedy and take some home.updatedthis message is a response to the owner&#39;s comment:you don&#39;t sound too sorry but offended.also, it was hard to gauge what a normal amount of food to order would be and, even after asking our waitress, we still didn&#39;t have a very clear understanding.never a wait for a table and the food is excellent.i tried a dry rub preparation last time, but think i&#39;d go back to the butter garlic, although messier and not great.the lobster roll is tiny and is served on a small hot dog bun.the décor is fine but it is obvious that it is built for one reason: the business of eating good food..get here before everyone else figures out what they&#39;re missing!.i wasn&#39;t very happy with the calamari, i think it has bland flavor or something, i wouldn&#39;t get it again unless they changed the way they make it so i was a bit down at first but the snow crab and shrimp, it turned my senses upside down! and believe me, it was amazing! it&#39;s a must.the garlic butter sauce is probably our favorite out of the three..the service sucked! the manager or whoever the dude is with spikey hair walking around seemed to have a stick up his butt.the prices and portions are perfect, especially considering the freshness of everything.fresh food, big portions great sauces and priced accordingly with awesome service.good service, fresh fish, i&#39;d go back.servers are kind.c- okay."
serai-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/serai-chicago,1,"Can&#39;t blame them really considering that a lot of malay dishes require an acquired taste..on the whole, the place was good.they should get rid of the t.the beef rendang (curry) was the highlight, the nasi lemak was not good, i asked for the fried egg to be sunny-side up, the server told me they couldn&#39;t do that, because all eggs are pre-cooked, that kinda kills it.so good that i ordered another one to take home to the boys.contained ramen noodles which soaked up the soup very quickly.it was the perfect amount of spicy to counteract the sweetness of the laksa.among the dishes i&#39;ve tried are the roti pratha, cumin lamb skewers, curry laska and coconut pudding.alas, i am still starving and paid $34 bucks for that.it&#39;s always delicious, fresh, and tasty..y.i will definitely order from serai again.would definitely come back.great service by the wait staff.for the main course, we got the char koay teow and serai laksa.both of them were really happy with their dishes!we also split a plate of water spinach fried with sambal (i think, anyways), and it was really good! the vegetables were really fresh and had a nice crunch that reminded me of home cooking.wow.so yum! my bf had the beef rendang - so good and spicy! we also had the iced tea which was delicious.for those who don&#39;t know, sambal is a spicy chili mixture of fresh chili peppers, garlic, ginger, shallots, sugar, lime juice, shrimp paste, fish sauce and all that good stuff.the excellent malaysian meals with great service keeps us coming back.you just get a strong sense that they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, and it&#39;s the patron that has to suffer they need to hire more wait staff and maybe pay them a livable wage.serai means &#34;good food&#34; and &#34;byob&#34; in chinese.serai is a delicious malaysian restaurant just opened this month in logan square! it adds exactly what the area has been needing to our dining scene..food came out quickly and was solid just as last time.would not order againlamb shank-different, unique, delicious.i got the beef rendang with my nasi lemak.very excited to finally have a good malaysian place in the city and hope they can smooth out the service kinks soon.the preparation and flavors reminded me of those found in small stalls in southeast asia..pork dumplings? delicious.a big plate of chicken.very sweet staff.the kangkong belachan was good but could do with a heavier dose of spice!a calming bowl of pulut hitam (a black rice dessert with coconut milk) rounded up the meal.it was okay...the roti was very good; warm, fluff, and easy to tear to dip into the curry.think i&#39;ve found a place to satisfy my singaporean good cravings.we will be back but we are going to try to new things since we like to view so much we want to try the rest of the menu.walked in with a malaysian friend (and i myself have stayed in malaysia entire), hence i think i know the food quite well.very accommodating and attentive.service was a tad hodge podge.it looked cool and sounded good in theory, but didn&#39;t really add anything to the dish.the food was spot on, and reminds me of home.although also offering the typical chinese fare, the bulk of the menu is specific to the chinese, malay, indian, and nyonya dishes found only in that part of the world..i would come back for this dish alone, slightly sweet, slighty salty, all delicious.my younger son had the dry wonton noodles and it was pretty good.if you&#39;ve never had malaysian food before, definitely check out serai.i was so excited when i heard a malaysian restaurant was opening in chicago.almost only) option in chi-town.i was expecting my olfactories and tastes buds to be under aggressive attack from the fermented, salted, and ground shrimp.cause it&#39;s hard to find some around chicago.i miss the roti kanai that i used to eat at panang.rendang beef: extremely tender with a nice touch of lemongrass infused in the beef sauce.it is also byob but i haven&#39;t done it yet but i&#39;ve heard good things.restaurant is split in two, we sat in the dark side.diamond in the rough - area looks sketchy but the restaurant itself is quite nice.given the price is only $4..nice environment and knowledgeable wait staff actually from malaysia, so glad to see a few new excellent south asian cuisine in the west town/wicker park neighborhood lately (serai and jj thai)just a warning, we might be a bit picky because i went with my boyfriend who had lived in singapore for 6 years before, so his standard for good and authentic is quite high, he told me that hainan chicken rice would have very good rice, like rice cooked in chicken broth or coconut oil, however we got a bowl of just plain white rice.it took 25 minutes for someone to take our order after we were seated and another 40 minutes for food to arrive.if you have the time and don&#39;t have any alcohol, there&#39;s a walgreens about two blocks south east.chicken rice (which is hainan/singapore style) is served warm - which is rather uncommon but is a good twist for chicago winter.exactly what i expected of malaysian food.overall though, these seem like &#34;new restaurant&#34; kinks that should work themselves out, so i&#39;m not worried! it&#39;s also byob, but that seems like a temporary thing.a good hainan chicken should have a burst of flavour that come through the meat itself.to say that i was super excited to find out that chicago now has a malaysian restaurant is an understatement.a legit malaysian restaurant with the authentic flavors of the culture!being malaysian myself, i can whole heartedly vouch for the food in this restaurant.the food tasted great overall, with the fried rice, the char kway teow, and the kangkung belachan being the champs.except for this little hiccup the overall experience was great !.served with coconut rice to soak up that sauce, &amp; broccoli &amp; big mushrooms.best malaysian restaurant i&#39;ve tried so far in chicago, where there is a dire lack of southeast asian establishments.be aware that portion sizes are a little smaller than at a normal asian place but the food is so unique and delicious that it is worth it!.the price is right, the food is just incredible &amp; authentic."

go back nope.i am giving it four stars rather than five simply because the restaurant is very cramped and crowded and because the prices are somewhat high.the goat was delicious.truthfully it tasted like pinesol, and you had to go through the kitchen to get to your table.best birria in town! food is delicious and the staff is super friendly.they automatically bring you the cilantro and onion - you gotta ask for the cheese.just...maria v has the worst attitude , we where the only table , and she was very busy talking shit about the costumers, my god, any time we ask her for some thing she will make faces, you dont like your job??? dont fucking do it.prices are a little higher than your typical mexican joint worth it..&#34;there&#39;s a chance this &#34;super authentic spot&#34; will make you feel like you &#34;don&#39;t know what or how to eat,&#34; but have no fear.food came readily, hot, and was delicious! meat is moist, well-cooked, and succulent."

we both came from far locations to this restaurant, after what we thought was adequate research.the food here is excellent!  i had the braised colorado lamb shank and it was the best lamb i&#39;ve had..but the real deal is the desert: baklava..food is good but service is awful.everything was excellent, very flavorful.needless to say, we got up and left.the food was still good, don&#39;t get me wrong! the driver must have been new though, the food was more than a half hour later that quoted, and he couldn&#39;t figure out how to get into my building.when my parents come in town, i have to find places to go to dinner.save yourself 3 hours, get take out.he loved it...the restaurant is small so call ahead, especially for larger groups.su böreği, beğendi and baklava are definitely recommended.the back wall is filled with wine bottles and there is a bar counter as well.every entree i&#39;ve tried is on point and the food is clean and fresh.the yogurt sauce it was served with was awesome as well, i usually don&#39;t like yogurt sauce and this was so fresh tasting, i loved it!  the serving sizes are really big as well, i had enough to bring home for lunch the next and then some.i would recommend the chicken kabob (my go-to), the short rib, chicken lemo and the salmon.our meals were well portioned.good service too.the lahmacun is a bit thick and wasn&#39;t may favorite.we ordered the caprese lingurian pesto to start which was enough to share among three people.came here for my husband&#39;s birthday dinner..but the highlight is the fresh baked homemade bread!.great patio in the summer where the people watching is fun along roscoe.wine helped.combined with outdoor seating made it a great night.the service was attentive, the bread was amazing.my wife and i have been to a number of turkish restaurants, and i managed to find someone on turquoise&#39;s menu that i had never had before: patlicanli islim sarmasi (braised lamb shoulder wrapped in eggplant and lamb jus, and rice pilaf).also, the waitstaff is always so wonderful here.i had the caprese salad, admittedly, this might not be their best dish since it isn&#39;t a turkish dish.a former semi retired coworker who had managed restaurants for over 40 yrs always said if the bathroom is dirty the kitchen isn&#39;t much better.everything is great about this place.a group of new yorkers (sorry chicago) thinks that there is better mediterranean food in the big apple.i guess if you want to dress it up with wine and nicer table cloths this is what you get, but the food is not worth the price, though it is good quality.the humus was so fresh and rich and the beef was so tender that it just melted in your mouth.this place is not great for lunch as they take forever to prep the food.the place is pretty small and you can hear the family upstairs thumping around their apartment.we went on a tuesday night for our anniversary dinner.great food and service! the atmosphere is very nice too - both on the patio and inside!.its deliciouslahmacunadanabut they dont have any iskender kebap and gyro.favoritesapps: fluffy pita bread, fried calamari, mujvermain: lamb chops w/rice, stuffed gnocchi w/pink vodka sauce, chicken gorgonzoladesserts: everything.i&#39;m sure there are a couple things i&#39;m forgetting (see picture).yum yum.it started to get really warm by us at our table for whatever reason.horrible restaurant! horrible food.i contacted chownow and they apologized for the misinformation but that turquoise is the one to authorize the refund.still the best thing is the more global mediterranean menu with middle eastern and italian choices as opposed to the template middle eastern pita/falafel/ kabob-orama.my husband had the donar and i had the beef ribs and polenta.the kabob is marinated is some middle eastern way but isn&#39;t too heavy where it would take away from the flavor.just not a good family option for brunch.we came here on recommendations for a romantic dinner that has long over due.i have been several times.i had the chicken kabbob and my brother had the mixed grill.i have been at least a dozen times and taken visitors there.they will try to scam you over the check as well."
the-boarding-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boarding-house-chicago,1,"Thanks!.i had a hard time deciding what to order as nothing stood out as particularly appealing and went with the blackened halibut.first impression of the place when i walked in was amazement! there&#39;s actually three story to the building, and the 1st floor greeted us with a beaauuttiffulll chandelier made out of entirely clear and polished wine glasses.we were greeted by not only our server but also the hostess on our anniversary and given complimentary glasses of champagne to celebrate.the food and atmosphere compete for top honors.the cocktail waitress was super friendly and their bar is very swanky and unique - a great place to go on a date, double date, or take out of towners.quiet, without obnoxious music.octopus and burrata apps were out of this world.for dinner, i can&#39;t rave enough about the venison loin (apparently came from australia and is one of the best pieces meat i&#39;ve had) and the berkshire pork chop.for yourself.gorgeous! i was very excited to try the food to see if it lived up to expectations.we had to actively ask for a veg menu even though they knew we were vegetarians.yes i was alone (which i never do) but i enjoyed every bite.selections of wine are superb and carefully crafted to pair with your meals.she is amazing at her craft..i vaguely remember being in this building back in the 80&#39;s (at like 3 am) in the catacombs -- i think it was cairo then, the boarding house has resurrected the catacombs as a snazzy sub level bar, definitely a cool place to impress your out-of-town visitors.our personal favorites: beet root salad, salmon tartare, tagliatelle and seared scallops.for our first course, we ordered the hen egg polenta fries and the braised octopus.loved the polenta fries and octopus for starters.i think the egg and polenta fries are their most popular appetizer, and i personally wasn&#39;t a fan.dessert stole the show - we had some sort of chocolate deliciousness that paired beautifully with port.wine was great but expensive, and desert was spot on..it was a girlfriends getaway which made it great to be able to talk and not have to yell over each other..we started with the ahi tuna crudo, the braised octopus, calamari, beets and goat cheese.after the multiple experiences i have settled that the boarding house is a great spot for small-plates and drinks downstairs in the awesomely unique bar area.for dessert, the chocolate bar, whipped cheesecake, and carrot cake were all to die for!  as you can tell, this was such a great dining experience.the scallops melted in my mouth, but then again so did the venison; they cook everything to such perfection with the perfect amount of supplemental flavor.this place is beautiful.the fried shallots on the bibb lettuce salad were like an elevated take on shoestring potatoes from childhood, balanced by the lettuce and vinaigrette.boarding house has now been bumped up the top of my list of recommendations, whether you ask for them or not..the only thing i didn&#39;t find spectacular was the carrot cake, but everything else was great.scallops are some of the best in the city!   their crab stuffed calamari is a hit too!   the place dies down early, around 9.for appetizers tried the hen egg and fries which were okay and the baby octopus which was okay as well.everything was good.it&#39;s the food that has me giving this venue two stars.delicious and interesting food.service was clean crisp and on point.maybe next time we will try something else- or we may not return because it was just all right and there are thousands of good options steps away.the boarding house was a fantastic experience, the food was delicious and the service was awesome..we&#39;d certainly venture back.the bar serves unique and great drinks.everything was great, gave it 4 stars cuz our waiter was awkward.this is my favorite restaurant in the city.-2nd course: we both got the seared scallops that were cooked perfectly! the sauce on it was so delicious!-3rd course: we both got the duck confit.i wanted to add chicken to my salad and the waitress said the only thing she could do is add the amish chicken dish to it ($25) and would have to charge me for both the meal and a salad.very tasty.our vegan friend ordered the sautéed vegetable entree and said it was very good.loved:arugula salad with beets and goat cheese.the atmosphere was dark, but yet romantic and intimate..a selection of small dessert items came at the end, but i would not recommend any of them.loved the building and the decor.i decided on the szeiger brut rose (sparkling) $15 per glass/$60 bottle.the restaurant was centered by the bar which seemed to be the main attraction.my friends ordered the octopus app and a salmon entrée.the bread we ordered came out long before our drinks.ambiance is great, the wine and cocktail glass ceiling in the bar is really impressive and so is the wine bottle ceiling in the dining room.now the desert was so basic and cold.the contrast of the black squid ink aioli against hte plate was gorgeous, but it didn&#39;t taste like much and was a little thick.it came out and suddenly all childhood attachment to my pal bambi faded.we came here for restaurant week on a chilly friday night.not impressed with wines by the glass."
first-draft-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/first-draft-chicago,1,"They also have a really good special for when the blackhawks and bills are playing!.great food and service was excellent.service was good but i felt like it could be a little friendlier...if i end up in chicago again this would probably be my sunday sports bar of choice..i can tolerate most things but for someone to be rude and insulting to a party for no reason is ridiculous.very good craft beer selection.great bar! tons of great beers on tap! menu is unique and they have tons of great dynamic deals having to do with local games and what not.(what a waste:  sober children in china, y&#39;know.i typically stay a bit more north when i come into town but if i am ever back in the area, i would hesitate to stop back in.the place was packed with locals in hawks jerseys,  and as expected the beers were awesome.i would definitely go again for a casual lunch or a tasty beer.adjacent parking lot.i really liked the fried chicken sandwich and fried brussel sprouts that i had..often no wait for a table at all, though, and there is a long bar for seating as well.was craving a burger on easter and it was raining so i didn&#39;t want to drive too far.great craft beer selection, excellent cobb salad (other semi-healthy to traditional bar food choices) and plenty of tv&#39;s.i made this place the last draft of the night after touring some other beer locations and having earlier dinner with friends.i expected the sprouts to be breaded, but was pleased to find that they weren&#39;t; they were actually pretty good!unfortunately, that was pretty much the only notable part of the visit.my server came be after another 5 minutes, returning (after circling my table a dozen times) to get my drink order, then went back to chatting with the other staff, as was the scene the rest of the night.i&#39;ve been here a bunch of the past couple of months and i can now confirm that the food is pretty good (specifically the turkey burger).cubano draft sandwich recommended by bartender was a hit.will definitely be coming back!just don&#39;t expect much from the food.the bartender was the only waitress but she seemed to be able to catch up.the bar has a good atmosphere.one problem i have with this place is it is so loud..they also have menus tucked underneath each table, so you can sit down and get lookin&#39; right away.the tap and scotch lists were extensive! can&#39;t wait to come back.i take the strategy of just slowly working my way through it from tip to tail.i&#39;ve had very little in the way of food from first draft (though, both times i have gotten food, it was fantastic.go there.don&#39;t be scared by the sports theme, the kitchen is better than anywhere in a 1 mile radius!  i cannot remember life before porksicles, you have changed me forever.solid sports bar type place, with a pretty above average draft beer list, there were several options that i&#39;d never seen before, not too packed or loud, but not dead either..this was what i think of when i want mac-n-cheese.great atmosphere, great staff and great beer/food!i loved the brussels sprouts and the burgers are great..but everyone makes it home safe and you keep thinking &#34;i really need to go back there and see if they have any $5 bomber specials&#34;.just do some hard-core investigating on the specials so you&#39;re not surprised when the bill comes.i&#39;m more of a foodie and i thought their food here was pretty delicious..everything that went by looked so good.they served me cold pizza..overall, they had a good beer selection and at decent prices.if beer isn&#39;t your preferred poison, don&#39;t fret ya can still have a gem time &amp; get tipsy cuz fd offers a wide selection of spirits &amp; other liquor too.we watched the blackhawks there and truly enjoyed the experience.minor improvements, and they also put in a nice custom back bar.if you are in the neighborhood and want good craft beer might as well check this place out.the service was great and i would definitely recommend coming here if you like good beer!.another review mentioned $5 bombers though, i&#39;ll have to come back to try those!.i checked with friends at other tables, and they all agreed their meatballs, pizza, sandwiches and fries were all grossly over-salted.overall, it&#39;s a place that i would go back to.the food is delicious and the beer menu is extensive.stopped by here with my bestie for a beer and some bears action last sunday.came to chicago on business and just wanted a night to chill without a big fancy dinner.thanks to yelp we found this perfect place.not great at all.we were easily able to find a table and we had no problem getting more drinks..a host took our name down for a table which is better than most bars where you have to stake out and fight for a table.it was pretty darned tasty but truthfully would have been better suited to the end of the night, too soak up the tail end of a bender, than it would have been as a lunchtime gut bomb.great service and a wide beer selection make this place a spot worth visiting.in town for work, but would definitely come here again.there are tvs plastered to the walls, but they let people play music on the touchtunes machine even with sporting events going on.i was in town visiting and got to my hotel a couple blocks away around 8pm.had a flight of illinois finest brewers."

 our party of 4 visited with a gilt city voucher*, so at the discounted price of $23, i got a cocktail, bourbon shot, and an appetizer.even halfway through my main i felt like i was still on a flavor safari, excited to see what my taste buds would uncover next.my friend got the roasted corn and the pork mac n cheese and she liked them both.it&#39;s a little pricey, but worth it!.i cannot tell you how good this was-just get it -and you&#39;ll see!!.the side of bacon was very generous.after we closed out, our server surprised us with champagne, which was so thoughtful and definitely made the evening that much better.review for brunch service:the good:-menu is a little different from a standard brunch.we had a couple drinks prior to going to dinner across the street.one nitpick, i would have cut the tuna into smaller pieces..&nbsp;ha..yes, i come to this hip west loop restaurant and order the cheeseburger.maybe next time!.what&#39;s better on a warm summer afternoon?a third star for the bites they were serving up..pork mac and cheese - so delicious.$15 for 4-1 inch chunks of pork was rather expensive but the flavors were amazing.the server brought our check already split into the two couples and one single diner..i&#39;d probably look forward to coming back to sit  in the patio and have cocktails.i will be going back for drinks though! well worth it.the cauliflower was made mediterranean style with tahini and parsley.my experiences with the bartenders and the servers have been good..the dawson delivered a solid experience.however, if you aren&#39;t into floral or herbal flavors, this might not be for you.the ambiance is elegant and the drinks aren&#39;t overpriced.amazing brunch! we had the pork mac and cheese (the sauce was incredible) and the steak and eggs which was fantastic.we had dinner at the dawson with friends and had an enjoyable meal.ok, i&#39;m done nerding out over bourbon, but a great selection here.i ordered &#34;the black angel&#34; which included old forester 90 dawson barrel, zucca (squash), pineapple, blackberry, lemon and bitters.win!ambience:  i love the feel of this place! the outdoor patio has romantic string lighting, green ferns/plants/trees and plenty of bright sunny seating! my fiance fell so much in love with the ambience that the first thing he did when we left was email to inquire about this as a wedding venue!food:  the dawson burger is now one of my favorite burgers in all of chicago! it large and perfect brunch fare when the egg &amp; bacon are added on! it&#39;s cooked to perfection and while it does cost a lofty $20, it is extremely memorable, in my opinion.the albacore ceviche was simply amazing.the bartenders were pretty cool too.went we first walked in we were greeted by stephanie harbour, their beautiful guest liaison.not sure why they messed with the menu so much.the plates were all flavored deliciously well.i would definitely recommend reservations as they were busy and i can imagine they are like that most of the time.kudos to the chef.knife and fork all the way glad i opted out of the bun.couldn&#39;t ask for a more pleasant evening.the mac n cheese might be good for a table to share but it is way too much for one person, and after the fifth bite it becomes a slog with no way to finish.enough for 2-3 people and so scrumptious!.after trying to send it back the owner came to our table and offered us mimosas and pastries.my favorite is the triple berry pie! get extra whipped cream with it!.their fish taco for 2 which changes depending on availability3.as i said, it was my birthday, and i wanted something chocolate for dessert.better late than never! the girlfriends and i enjoyed a lovely night on the patio..thanks again bartender!!!!.great spot for a drink - especially outside in the summer."

 perfectly cooked and cut like butterlobster-hell yes.here comes the cordial connoisseur  with his cart.swift and sons is in a different class than most of the other randolhp/fulton joints.you cannot compete with the others if the basics are not covered no matter how wonderful the place looks.i also had a cocktail w/ pear &amp; basil but name escapes me, that was real good too.my silly pet peeve is when servers interrupt guests&#39; conversations to launch into a scripted talk - not the case at swift and sons.the beef was a show stopper for sure; cut table side with a cute little cow made from the puff pastry.it was all phenomenal! the crab legs were so fresh and perfect it melt in your mouth.maybe do some comp research and you&#39;ll find out nobody else serves those baby drinks.this is a big mistake to seat any tables in here except maybe if they had a big party.went to the new rick bayless restaurant 2 weeks ago and give it 3 while this place gets 5.we had a selection of food, drinks and deserts.that&#39;s all i remembered!  the evening was quite a blur..once the food finally did come out, we all just stopped talking and began scarfing down the ounces of steak.attentive and knowledgeable service, delicious food, great wine/cocktail list and all within an old-school steak house style interior.it&#39;s got a modern old school feel.i had the roasted halibut which was excellent.she delivered his oscar toppings about 20 minutes after we received our steaks and she informed him that she would &#39;take care of it&#39; since she wanted him to still be able to try it.also, loved their retro chocolate trolley, $3 a piece! the hostess was able to push back our reservation, and they even sent out a salad on the house from the chef! define my go!!! cool vibe, great staff, great place!.the hanger steak was good, but didn&#39;t wasn&#39;t the star of the dishes that we had on the table.if i were to come back, i probably just ordered the dessert and skipped everything else.i&#39;m a huge mastros fan.good stuff.the team is very friendly and is committed to service excellence.all were amazing.the service by the whole staff was outstanding.the steak is good, but not exceptional..it makes this place very swaggy! they were very accommodating to seating us right away.not overbearing to put us over the top.the boka group once again nails it and raises the bar for others to shoot for.crab cake and steak tartare were both great.can not get enough of this place.never mind that its another boka group owned restaurant.this is a steakhouse and i can only describe the steaks with a comment - perfect.i would come again with a group of friends or colleagues but if you want personality or a more romantic vibe, you won&#39;t find it here.we chose your amazing venue for a dinner tonight to celebrate our recent engagement and josh was such a great server to have tonight.we both agreed that the carrot cake wasn&#39;t as mind-blowing as we thought it would be.however, it did have the perk of being right by the back bar! the lighting is lower here, but not too low; just enough to set a low-vibe atmosphere.after the experience i made reservations to go next month.the service was excellent which capped off a perfect dinner experience and why i gave them five stars.the location is beautiful and decorated nicely.i felt that their steaks were overpriced including the menu.large venue, multiple bars within the restaurant, three dining areas-one of which appears to be for private parties.5 stars for his knowledge of everything on the menu &amp; hospitality! excellent food overall! starting with the bread basket- wow! every morsel every bite.the manager, adam, came by to check on us and ask how everything was and that is always a great sign to me.my group of four also ordered the beef wellington, which is so simple it&#39;s often underrated.several tables used their flashlight apps to see the menu..my scallops were delicious - cooked to perfection and the sauce was extremely tasty.started our meal off with crab cakes and steak tartare.so cholesterol laden that i&#39;ll be juicing for the next two weeks!  the mushrooms come with a porcini aioli and croutons.it was a bit bright for dinner.stumbled upon it when we were in the area.finally the &#34;chef himself&#34; re-did them, and they were finally somewhat hot.i&#39;m shocked that none of the other reviewers mention experiences similar to these.main course was beef wellington carved and served table side as well as their porterhouse.the tomatoes were ripe and juicy and delicious with great balsamic to add a delicious flavor.we shared the key lime pie which was part pie/part ice cream, and the peanut butter mousse."

cemitas-puebla-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cemitas-puebla-chicago-5,2,"They don&#39;t have a lot of seating so not great for large groups.atmosphere was very nice..great spot to grab a bite on the cheap before going out for upscale drinks nearby.the sandwiches are really good.myself and the entire office were extremely satisfied with everything, and can&#39;t wait to order from cemitas pueblas again!.enjoyed my first cemitas experience and would like to dine in next time.they also have outdoor seating.....though my spiked horchata was far too cinnamon-y, the price point was fair and i&#39;m sure the other drinks have potential..then there was hardly any seafood in it..out of all the places i dined at so far, this was the most disappointing.as i&#39;ve said in past reviews, i am hard on mexican places, but no need to be tough with this place.they fit in well with their surroundings and fill the gap with their poblano foods.the bread was not toasted.both were delicious but the carne asada was truly special.overall impressions - good mexican food (can&#39;t comment on the authenticity related to the puebla region because i have not been to that part of mexico), really good for lunch, liked the feel of the place, tables were being bussed very attentively, don&#39;t care much for the neighborhood (parking is a bitch).for eats we ordered chips and guac, a chicharon quesadilla the 3 cemitas: milanesa, arabe, and the al pastor.good tacos and the cemitas special is a must..i feel that they are putting less meat and less ingredients in the cemitas at this new location.the green salsa is where it&#39;s at.pretty disappointed in the level of service as i was excited to try this place and live right next door.after sampling each salsa, the worst part about them was that it was too hard to choose which salsa to put on each bite of chip! they were awesome! as an unofficial guacamole expert, i can say this place does it right- the tang, spice, and saltiness was perfect, and the best part was that it was super reasonably priced!i had the opportunity, no, the blessing to try the elite taco de government precioso (steak and chorizo), the cemita de arabe (roasted pork and onion), and just a plain old quesadilla that nearly blew my socks off.great service.the sesame roll is amazing, the texture is both soft and crispy and holds the delicious meats and toppings very well.the food was great, simple (seemed like only a few ingredients), and delicious.the place very clean and the staff were great!well very disappointed on the cemita i had the al pastor which lacked flavor, very bland.please keep in mind that this is the west loop so the prices will reflect the location.also, don&#39;t miss those delicious sauces! the staff was extremely helpful by answering several questions and they were really friendly too.but monday it kinda changed for me i&#39;ve been observing this woman for the past few weeks and i can&#39;t believe she still works there this is not the first time she&#39;s done this while i ate lunch there but the way she was treating her coworkers i was so appalled especially mistreating them in front of customers she&#39;s an asian short blonde woman be warned if she ever helps you out she&#39;s miserable and not a people person it&#39;s pretty sad to see this i feel that if your not a people person and not happy you shouldn&#39;t be in that kind of business i think i will give this place a shot in the evening.incredibly expensive for barely any food..hopefully, i will not take so long to visit again.basically tasted like a taco barfed onto bread - though not a particularly flavorful taco.so how do they make their sandwiches here? first, start with a sesame bun which is large enough to hold all the meat, while still being soft and flavorful..the ambiance was very nice for a fast casual place.i will have to come back another day and try a cemitas with a ice cold cerveza.i was very disappointed.cow foot is basically beef tendon.if i could buy those rolls by the dozen, i would.the chips were fresh.you get more bang for your buck..hardly authentic.my friend went for a hotter option, and my quick sample of it was positive.this is one of my favorite mexican spots.it happened to be happy hour so $3..it&#39;s a good spot, and it wasn&#39;t crowded when i went like some of the places on randolph.will definitely be back to try the cemitas some time--they look delicious!.i also really enjoyed the chips and guac! you can definitely tell the chips are homemade.i had gotten a doordash delivery coupon in the mail, and doordash also had a special on a couple menu items.flavorful food, laid back atmosphere."

the decor is a bit quirky and it can get a bit loud but it adds to the charm.to be continued as i want to like this place and will go again soon.northdown is like a little piece of heaven on earth.i stopped by here with a friend as his roommate said that northdown always throws out a solid beer menu.my meal (with plenty of leftovers):pork frites (a must have)grilled cheese and tomato soupten ninety imperial porter3 floyd&#39;s drunk monkfiery alice chicago hot sauce (put it on everything!).love this place!great local bar that never gets too crowded or loud and has both amazing beer and really good, well priced food.i live pretty close to northdown now, and i was sad to see i had left it with a 3-star review.be sure to wash your meal down with some tasty underberg!.the menu is different, lots of variety, better than typical bar menu.they got hard really fast so that instead of a fluffy inside and crispy outside, it was like biting into biscotti.horrible food..you can drink and eat like a grown-up, with grown-ups.we each ordered a grilled cheese and tomato soup, piping hot and tasty..the southern outpost of some milwaukee classic restaurant entrepreneurs seems to not know what it is..walked by it many times, but considering it&#39;s lakeview, i always just dismissed it as another bar similar to the ones a block away.and service/ staff- best in the city.stopped in for lunch on a saturday and had a breakfast sandwich and a beer for brunch.coat hooks: yes, under the bar seatingalso, fries are nicely seasoned, but get a bit too greasy in that basket, food portions are normal sized but the plates are tiny.the waitress seemed upset that we didn&#39;t order drinks, and was kinda pushy clearing our table and handing out checks.every time i come here, i really want to like it because they have great vegan options for me on the menu.when my party decided to stay for a beer after brunch we asked some questions on beers we weren&#39;t familiar with and again, our gal had no clue.friendly and chill.i have been to northdown often over the last year or so, each time with groups of 2 - 5 people.every employee was angry to be there.fantastic beer list of stuff you don&#39;t find everywhere.love this place and will totally be back.kate and her husband, the owners, were very friendly and helped point out things that were of interest in the area.then he told me to sit back down and he&#39;d get the server over to get our orders.as others noted: vegan bar food!  no more costco hummus and cucumbers!  no more greasy fry dinners!  the pork slaw sandwich (vegan) is absolutely delicious and very filling.also had a great variety of homemade pies.i definitely make this a destination spot when i visit chicago!..not blaming the guys working behind the bar or the kitchen, but clearly the owner(s) were not around and do not have systems in place to handle even a meager lunch crowd.northdown never lets me down!when i believed in nothing i called your nametrapped in a high-dollar joint in some place i called your nameand though my days were slipping byand nights so cruel i thought i&#39;d dieshe danced her little dance till it made me cryshe was shaking like this honey doing thatnever let me downyou never let me downnever let me downyou never let me downthanks, david bowie, and thanks, northdown!.very good food, friendly staff.it&#39;s sad because this place is so close to my condo and has a great beer menu, but the food.it aint good if she aint sweating.that&#39;s why we eventually left sooner than we had planned to.we were drawn in by the pictures posted on yelp.the food menu features a number of vegan options.the decor was very fun to look at and they were playing a movie on the tv above the bar.excellent conversation also.absolutely empty but because we had a baby, &#34;house rules&#34; was going to seat us in the back instead of next to the wanted window.absolute crap.i love this bar, its really cool.nothing special.the regular mac and cheese (gouda base) is very good - the right amount of rich and creamy and there are a few meat and veggie ingredients to add in....fries were cold..i would definitely go back, especially for the fried pickles and candied bacon, great starters before an awesome burger..the biscuits and gravy taste like a 17th century blacksmith shoppe and i mean that in the best way possible."
kai-sushi-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kai-sushi-chicago-2,2,"I redownloaded it today because i had to tell the world about my experience here.what a cute little gem! i just moved to chicago from nyc and have found most sushi places to be very mediocre (except the really high end ones).loved the dynamite roll (baked crab and scallop)..we were here last saturday and i can see why this place has high ratings.as i said earlier, this place is definitely comes off as a place where you&#39;d order to go rather than sit down and eat.a small hidden gem just south of printers row..good neighborhood place not too far from the loop.great food and service staff were super friendly..5 stars.this place had some very standard sushi but it was all well prepared.i&#39;ll go again for sure!.this will be my new go-to sushi place! we had a hard time deciding on what to get and ended up ordering a few rolls: ocean, dragon, chicago fire, spicy tuna, and alaskan.watching the marine life at shedd&#39;s aquarium nearby put us in a sushi mood.the freshness of the sushi/sashimi being the best on chicago is (in my opinion) untrue.the turtle, volcano, and philly roll were also all great.but i am friends with people who are.i recommend the ocean sushi! everybody seems to be a regular as they all know the byob policy.our server, zero (that&#39;s her name) who is barely 2 weeks into her job here was excellent! the rolls did not disappoint and it was a great meal.great service too--for take out and eat in!also, it&#39;s byob.this is a lunch time sushi yelp.i quoted the costs but they kept repeating the new, inflated price.just had dinner here and the sushi was fantastic..the fish quality is very much so so.edamamegreen tea ice cream-absolutely amazing, best tasting dessert for a sushi place!!!!!cucumber salad-4 starspros:locationstaff is friendlycan accommodate for large parties just be ready to wait a bitmusic selection is main streamcons:stupid lights kept flickering and that was annoying.they have a lunch special every day from 11-3 which is a great deal! in the summer they have a really nice patio! it&#39;s.small intimate dining with al fresco seating as well...so yummy!!!! highly recommend the green turtle roll.i have just had the most humiliating experience of my life!!! we recently visited kai for a late sunday lunch.will be back very soon!.they used it as a to go placement for orders instead and kept us waiting 15 minutes for seating.every roll i&#39;ve had there is excellent..the food was amazing! i ordered two appetizers and three sushi rolls.at the end, they gave us a half of oranges, craftily placed.waitstaff is awesome! food is awesome! shiitake special is still awesome!.great prices just a true local gem.the last time, i brought the kids..i was completely ignored by the servers and sushi chefs when i got to the location, even after telling them i was there for take out.we checked in yelp, so got a coupon for half off a specialty roll.west town would have been very good had i not ordered the other two rolls.and they have an outside seating area perfect for the summer nights!.we had edamame to start and 1 bowl was good for 4 people.we were waiting for maybe more than an hour and she checked on us often to see if we needed anything else.after he clearly added and undeserving 18% on our bill.we arrived around 9.after i told her yelp, they delivered a free ice cream desert with fried bananas and a sliced orange on the side.fun and casual place to hang out with friends and grab a bite.best sushi i have ever had in south loop or even perhaps in chicago in general..the yellowtail and fresh water eel sashimi are always a big favorite for me.all of my fellow south loopers love this place too.they also brought out some cucumber salad for us before the meal and a complementary dessert of green tea ice cream and banana tempura after we were done..the rolls were originals and tasty and the service was very nice and quick...unless you&#39;ve only dined in fast food restaurants your entire life, you should know that any great restaurant establishment do not use gloves during food prep.(no drinks)one more star giving to the beautiful lady who served our table and gave us one more bowl of miso soup as complimentary.service is fast and their sushi has amazing value! their fish is very plump in each sushi piece and two specialty rolls + udon + green tea ice cream made the night one of the best dinners i&#39;ve had in south loop!.went with some friends in march and it was amazing.i will give them a pass however because the guy said it was his first daythe food: 11 big slices of fish over a generous portion of rice.staff:  very friendly and super attentivefood:  what can i say, it was high quality sushi, they don&#39;t hold back on the ingredients and everything tastes fresh..the dancing eel is the most weird taste i ever tasted for my life.byob, good service, outdoor seating, fresh sushi."

dawali-mediterranean-kitchen-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dawali-mediterranean-kitchen-chicago-2,2,"At under $8 including tip it&#39;s got to be one of the best deals in pita bread that i&#39;ve ever had.all of the juices were soaked up in the tasty rice underneath.i enjoyed the baba ganoush, chicken shish kabob sandwich, and baklava.the food was fresh and delicious and cheap to boot.i really enjoyed the masakas and falafels too...best falafel ever, loved the baba ghanoush as well.liked it a lot.the place is nicely decorated &amp; clean.there are lots of baby stores round these parts, so we always end up finding ourselves cruising with a kid, semi-exhausted and scouring for lunch places.all i had was vegetables and hummus.i have had the falafel, baba ghannouj, jerusalem salad, hummus, and ful mudammas - everything was delicious and came out promptly.the ambience is very relaxing.i&#39;ve been disappointed with chicago selection, being from michigan (where in my opinion we have the best outside of the middle east itself) but this place is good.can&#39;t understand the rave reviews.we don&#39;t live in the neighborhood but were over that way shopping and found dawali to satisfy our hunger and yearning for hummus..from nyc perspective, this would get 2 stars for the pitas not being packed for the price or the taste.i shared a beef kafta, spicy chicken kabob, as well as an mixed appetizer platter with my girlfriend (babaghanoush, hummus, and two other items), everything was very fresh and tasty.came to get some work done for lunch and was told this.will not carry out because this place is way too expensive to carry out.i had the falafel gyro and baklava which were totally delicious.actually, everything i&#39;ve tried here has been really good.i have had better shawarmas elsewhere.i usually order double helpings of meat every time i order as well.i went here with high expectations, and those expectations were not met...overall: great tasting food for an average price.have yet to have a meat portion selection that i like.pretty dang tasty! quick friendly service with great people watching.the service was excellent but i am assuming this is more of a lunch spot more than anything.you&#39;d think they&#39;d make it right and not with bad meat if it&#39;s a &#34;classic&#34;.could my bill be correct?  i really love this place! we will be back.this place is ridiculously good! i came here for my birthday with my boyfriend and we had an amazing time! we ordered falafel, pick 3 combo (chicken, shrimp, and beef kufta), and the lamb/beef shawerma.i ordered the classic shawerma sandwich (with hummus +$2), an order of feta cheese bread pies, and a small baba ghannouj.went there for lunch with family.also sampled the chicken &#34;gyro&#34; shawerma and beef kabob.the veggies (lettuce, cucumber, tomato) were fresh.crispy meat that was still juicy.each meal has been even better than the last.i had the hummus and baba ganoush so far.the food was amazing.this is probably my favorite byob place in chicago..the food is simple but delicious, and dawali works in multiple timeframes.it was very flavorful.waitress and service - friendly and efficient - terrific!food is great - grilled shrimp and chicken schwarma - mmm.i&#39;ve been there many times.i had eaten here once or twice before a while back and remembered it well.no  frills place with great flavor.i had beef/lamb shawarma; it was a bit dry &amp; chewy, but had good flavor.very good traditional mediterranean food at a surprisingly low price considering the location.they are all exceptionally good and that is why i gave this place 5 stars.our waitress was extremely helpful and accommodating when we mentioned my finances seafood and nut allergies.the outside was soggy and the inside was ok.we ordered the hummus (a must), the spinach pies (a little too much dough, not enough spinach), a falafel sandwich (i liked this, but hate parsley and the salad mix they put in there kind of fights for attention with the falafel, but overall great falafel great pita and great hummus), and my friend ordered a spicy chicken kabob, which she liked, but said the chicken definitely was better when dipped in hummus.my combo comes with rice, small salad and two sauces.everything was yumm  we finished with creme brulee! have to make a second visit to try out other yumminess on their menu.the six of us got six entrees, two orders of appetizer bread pies, and the hummus, and the total with tax and tip was $66.we are going try other restaurants in the future..i highly recommend it.the chicken was juicy and flavorful.might have been the most unauthentic mediterranean food i have ever had flavor and decor wise, especially the portion..it was $5.yuk."
roti-modern-mediterranean-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/roti-modern-mediterranean-chicago,1,"Even with a long lunch line, it goes fast and if you&#39;re lucky they might bring out some free falafel to snack on while you wait.it&#39;s always fresh and the staff is wonderful.staff are friendly and tables are clean..the zhug is good, but could be a bit spicier.if you&#39;re extra hungry, order a side of falafels! they&#39;re free if you check in for the first time on foursquare! you can also get nice free goodies if you download their app on your phone.but seating inside can be limited, especially during the lunch rush.the service was quick and the line moved fast, and the menu was easy to decipher and everything was reasonably priced.i&#39;m trying to eat meat in a more responsible way, so it&#39;s great i can go here as often as i&#39;d like for workday lunch.we will go when there is nothing else..shocking due to the size of the hummus container...choose: meat/unmeatschoose: toppings/etc..you feel rather rushed and  they did rearrange a couple of things like the cooked veggies are now near the front of the assembly line, so if you weren&#39;t aware, you would be &#34;disrupting&#34; the line when you ask for veggies and the server has to go backwards to get it.yummy food.i&#39;ve come here a few additional times since my last review and been pretty underwhelmed.it was messy, but i&#39;ll be coming back.i used to have this during work meetings where there was catered food.the hummus usually comes home with me.you definitely get a bang for your buck here, and i would equate it to chipotle in terms of price, amount of food, and quality.can&#39;t wait to come back again!very happy with the chicken salad that i had the other day.found this place in the loop on my new job.i love this place for that fact alone.great food and fast service, also reasonably priced.literally tastes like rice-a-roni vegetable.the lines during lunch hour can be long so go early to beat the crowd.this is a great lunch spot!  you get a ton of food with your order, and quite the variety as well.indecisiveness would make you feel like you&#39;re holding up an otherwise well-oiled engine.they used to put this automatically in your bag, thats great.really baffled by all the great reviews.chicken kabob with tzatziki, brown rice, tomato, cucumber, onion, kalamata olives, hummus, salad.that said the food was pretty good.their sauce and hummus are tasty and you can mix and match.definitely one of the best lunches i&#39;ve had in a while! ordered the chicken roti rice plate with a lot of the basic toppings like cous cous and cabbage and asked for the hottest sauce they had.i would call their attempt at falafel an epic failure actually.you can see them shaving off the meat right onto your pita pocket or flatbread wrap.love this food.it was good but there was nothing special.rice.even though the line gets long at lunchtime, they move through it quickly and efficiently.they were hot and the crust of the falafel crumbled just slightly as i bit into it.food is great for the price and customer service was absolutely top notch! we did come in while it was pretty slow but the employee who served us walked us thru everything on our first time thru! soooo much food with the rice platter!  if you&#39;re looking for a quick fix this is definitely the place.however this place had tasty food and well done.roti has some tasty mediterranean food..delicious fast mediterranean food with some healthy options.the service is the worst i have ever experienced.a key suggestion to newcomers is take some time to figure out exactly what you want because the line moves quick and it&#39;s easy to get overwhelmed by the different options.it would probably be unrecognizable to most authentic mediterranean-ites.i love all the sauce choices and sides of tabbouleh, tomato salad, hummus, etc....i had rice, couscous, hummus, tomato and cucumber, eggplant, and chicken chunks on a big plate.definitely one of the best mediterranean food spots in downtown.this place is great, portions are stellar, employees are nice, actually too nice.good salads...everything was cold and tasted very much the same.simply the best lunch option near my office.they are a little stingy with the portions by using a scoop to ration out each serving but everything tasted great.i have had a wide variety of items and been pretty happy with them..the plates were always pretty good and satisfying.the only downside i suppose is that they are a bit expensive.the flow of the place resembles your typical chipotle, potbelly, or subway formula: you get in line, order what you want, and then tell them what to put on it as you mosey on over to the cash register."
el-ideas-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-ideas-chicago-2,2,"Thank you!.it was such an interesting dish with unique flavor and texture that i keep wondering how the kitchen even came up with these ideas.i was hesitant when i was invited to eat here as it is pricier than what i like to spend on a meal, however, i was shown a great time and ate great food that made the price worth it.and the brown gravy on top?? tasted like the packet.4 stars:  very good, would definitely return.with only 8 tables, it is a very intimate dining experience.but damn the lardo made all the difference.we were given unlimited water (i am from ca where there is a drought, so i was super grateful for copious amount of free water).cabs are scarce in the area...i think with further development and maturation, the second star should come soon!  email the restaurant for ticket purchase for the meal.i would recommend bringing two bottles of wine - each seating takes a few hours and i wished we had a second...note: i dined here about a year or more ago on a business trip--not sure when, but there was snow on the ground so it could have easily been any day out of the year.the milkshake was cool.i love it that much.i was still hungry after dinner, and that&#39;s something i never want to feel after dinner.foss was warm and welcoming and gave straightforward explanations of each course, noa foss was delightful and a wonderful addition to an already awesome staff, the casual, open vibe made for easy connections with other diners.the experience, however, was probably the most appealing to me since there isn&#39;t really anything else out there like this (at least not that i have tried).makes fine dining fun and entertaining.just like any midwestern family would do, they invite you to hang out in the kitchen, help serve the dishes if you&#39;d like, and just chat and get to know each other.they seat the entire dining space at one time to give a dinner party atmosphere.i thought the yogurt that came with the dish was a perfect compliment and really brought out the flavors in the sausage.i couldn&#39;t wait for the date to arrive as i had heard many great things!!the building is a bit hard to find.foodwise, highlights were the roe that were licked off the plate, cube of onion soup, oyster with fried shallots.now!.all the patrons tonight was so nice also and made the experience even better.coolest dining concept in chicago.wow! what a hidden gem in this foodie town.one of my favorites.we always had new silverware, never looked at a dirty dish and never had an empty water glass.i am not going to review individual dishes because the chef said that the menu will likely be completely different in a month except the french fries and ice cream dish.can&#39;t wait to go back!.i am very happy i got to share it with my bestie.the calamari, salmon, fries and ice cream, and pork dish were all phenomenal.however, in my case my reservation of 2/27 @ 5:30 p.the fun music (lots of 90&#39;s) and the end of the meal and coffee/tea offered in the kitchen is super fun!! my friend is also pregnant and we called ahead to see if there would be a lot of raw dishes~ they made sure to substitute any raw components or cook it a little more and explained each dish to her as they came out~ we didn&#39;t have to change venues and she enjoyed every dish!.el ideas? well dey don&#39;t got any good ones!! they serve me an egg inside a spoon, and i was like tf!!!! there had better be hot sauce up in this egg or i was bout to bounce, that cost me 30 dollas!!! i could get an egg at uptown food mart a nickel playa!!! foe da fam out there, i would strongly recommend latrell parfé iii jr.the directions on their website are very descriptive and made the restaurant easy to find..needless to say it turned out to be one of the best dining experiences i&#39;ve ever had.very very creative and exciting to be a part of the experience..salted caramel for dessert might be the best thing i&#39;ve had all night.all in all, the whole thing feels like a genuine experience, which highlights special occasions and is what i believe fine dining should be like.corn: caviar, ghost pepper (taken off of mine), cojita                       -   85/100olive: tomato, plum, snow pea, fig, almond                                     -   90/100cauliflower: anchovy, lemon, parsley, caper leaf                             -   95/100carabineros: jalapeño (omitted from mine) jicama, fennel, ramp    -  100/100squash: salt cod, chanterelle, chickpea, smoked paprika               -   95/100french fries &amp; ice cream: potato, leek, vanilla                               -  100/100jamón ibérico: ricotta, crackers, basil, peach                                  -   95/100foie gras: kumquat, mustard, radish, lettuce, saffron                     -   95/100sweetbread:  quail egg, salsify, sorrel, truffle                                   -  100/100these were veal, from thymuscherry: duck, quinoa, tosaka                                                            - 100/100profiterole: pluot, green tea, black sesame                                      -  90/100banana split: dried fruits with banana pieces                                   -  90/100the chefs who guided our tour through el ideas dinner experience were phillip foss, david goody, michael and catherine.don&#39;t hesitate to go here.this is a wonderful experience..while it is one of the few times you can lick the plate in fine dining without being given the side eye, it still felt weird.love this place!.being a true extrovert, i was so happy when chef foss encouraged us to &#34;walk around and meet each other...such a shame.make sure you either drive or uber back from this place as public transportation is not an option.i am so glad we spent the night at el ideas.so creative!- &#34;french fries and ice cream&#34;- i won&#39;t ruin the surprise but i&#39;ve never felt quite as satisfied to dig a spoon into the bottom of a glass..this place doesn&#39;t need another 5-star review, it goes without being said that you have to come here.yes, playing with the food was encouraged.fun, unique, inviting, great food.it&#39;s a group dinner with everyone served at the same time with an explanation of the dish..came here with a group of six.one can pick any table at which to sit.i gotta say i love the concern of being able to interact with the chefs while they are preparing for the food and hanging out in the kitchen.luckily we had am amazing group of people, so we tried not to pay attention to the lack of personality that the main server had! we were enjoying great food, wine, and company! however, when we asked for our picture to be taken and then this main server (has eyeglasses), overall demeanor was unpleasant and cold.cast off your old, tired view of fine dining and go bask in the joy.as usual, really relaxed atmosphere, fun music and super interesting to watch and engage with the chefs..on a positive note, the chefs were friendly and offered nice descriptions of each course and they had some clever dishes, but none were good enough to make the uncomfortable experience worthwhile.the chef is extremely friendly as are the rest of the staff and i just can&#39;t wait to go back again!.my husband is usually very weary of fine dining restaurants and he had a great time! the food was amazing and the chef/owner phillip foss encourages his guests to interact with the kitchen staff and the other patrons which makes for a fun night which feels more like a dinner party with friends rather than a stuffy dinner at a fancy restaurant.hence 4-stars, not 5.everything was fabulous!."

bub-city-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bub-city-chicago,1,"It was hard to get a good feel for the place having only come mid-week after work since i know it can be a bit of a scene on the weekend.enjoyed the ribs and &#34;king&#34;.popped into bub city on sunday afternoon.i absolutely loved it! i seriously didn&#39;t stop smiling from the moment we walked in to the time we left.appetizer:the fried pickles are a big step up from any sports bar.it was really annoying and made you feel rushed to finish your drink.the place itself is not meant to be authentic, it&#39;s tacky in a cute way.i also got the baby back mac and cheese.i&#39;ve been to bub for brunch, lunch, dinner, and for a night out and i honestly love this spot for all.nothing crazy but everyone enjoyed their grub.the food, friendly service, great bar, tvs, and live music make this place simply perfect.great food and great customer service.also serious shout-out to the waitstaff and hostesses--my friend was heading out of town after our dinner and they stored her enormous suitcase without batting an eye.i wouldn&#39;t waste my time here going back again.i think of this bar as its &#34;themed&#34; as a once in awhile bar and not a go to spot..so that was awkward.kick back drink beer with good comfort food.you&#39;re welcome.not as hot as they should have been bought good flavor and spice.don&#39;t come for an 8pm reso because they shove you in the bar area with w/ a bunch of drunk chads and trixies who are all smashed up on your table while trying to eat.order some biscuits.the staff has always been super friendly as well.save for the brisket, which was reasonably tasty, the rest of the vanilla brunch items (biscuits and gravy, omelettes, breakfast potatoes, mimosas, eggs, etc.do yourself a favor and come here for drinks, a bite, or both!.the man who tried to set his drink down proceeded to buy another drink and set it down in our place while looking me dead in the eye, then flipping me off and saying fuck you..my friend&#39;s bbq ribs looked very good as well.shots rang in at about 10$ a pop.no dinner menu because it&#39;s made fresh daily.good environment, but not worth it if workers are untrusting and stealing.the guys behind the bar can be a little absent, so i tend to avoid bub when the guys are working the bar.i had a &#34;meat &amp; 3&#34; special for $16 which i chose a pulled pork sandwich, macaroni &amp; cheese, corn and fries.the server was super nice.this place should be your go-to for a laid-back, good time with beers, good food, and country music.i don&#39;t like bloody marys but bub city sure as hell makes me want to convert.they call themselves an authentic experience of nashville culture, with traditional barbecue staples and a rotating music scene of up-and-coming country talent.the food wasnt to bad all the appetizers had a kick to it but the waffle fries with the brisket and cheese etc was really good.great atmosphere and good drinks, they had live music (country) i don&#39;t even like country and it was still a great time.i&#39;ll be ashamed to call it bbq.when we arrived they still had their bloody mary bar open which was extremely impressive.the hostess was great and took the cupcakes that we brought for her to the back (and remembered to bring it out post dinner and drinks)!!our waitress was also really cute and bubbly and apologized for orders taking long..man, the food.the macoroni was delightful..it leaves others in the dust.and let me tell you, both dishes were so good.check it out during the week.everyone working was super friendly and nice.this tennessee inspired country bar/restaurant is pretty fantastic.the chicken was so juicy and tender.having lived in nashville i feel back at home with the live country music, food, and a bloody in hand.mine was four rose yellow whiskey - on the rock (old fashioned style).finally, after years of being surrounded by rap-loving friends who drag me to too-trendy bars, i have found a place where i can enjoy my country music, strong cocktails, and live entertainment.i can honestly say i don&#39;t truly appreciate country music, but i really dig this place.the dancing area is not real big, the place in general is not really big.the brussel sprouts side is also surprisingly good: crispy and not over-salted, but still with plenty of flavor.bub city seems like a very hip, energetic bar &amp; restaurant.i have been wanting to check out bub city so i used my grubhub $10.our usual place was closed and our second choice was out of ribs! we haven&#39;t been to bub city but have been curious about it.i wish i had, because i would have never recommended it for dinner."
cupbop-ramen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cupbop-ramen-chicago,1,"It was subpar.the only fumble was the seasoned soft boiled egg was a little overdone, came out hard boiled, but i&#39;m sure this is just a glitch as they settle into things (just opened yesterday).and the japchae was exactly how my mom made it.glad there&#39;s finally a good ramen place in lp.good price.if you want a light meal, a cup bop is the way to go...the overall price of the meal was average, but was not super cheap.tried their food for the first time and i will definitely be going back! very delicious!   we had the man doo, the combo cupbop (pork &amp; chicken), and the dolsot bibimbop hot stone bowl.saw they were opening up in our neighborhood and decided to give it a try, we definitely were not disappointed! the food was amazing and the staff was extremely helpful and attentive.the beef cup was full of meat, noodles, rice, and flavor.i can&#39;t speak to the spiciness of the food, i intentionally asked for mine to be &#34;as mild as you can give me.i love that they serve it in the clay pot just be careful you don&#39;t accidentally burn yo&#39;self.definitely recommend!.this place was great! the ambience isn&#39;t anything to write home about, but it was cheap and quick, and the food was amazing! we had the ramen and bibimbap, and both were excellent! we also enjoyed their assortment of spicy condiments..wow this place is delicious.the spice level is real.kimchi was not bad.something for everyone.the decor was nice and i liked that they had a water and ice dispensing machine.i loved it and so did everyone in my company.service was super speedy with a smile.he convinced me to go tonight.soup itself was ok, but my boyfriend loved it.ok, now that i offended a bunch of korean food-loving people, on with my review..you will think to yourself omg, so cool! what a fun idea! i have to try.i could definitely see how a place like this would be great to pick up some ramen on a sick day or a cold day.we love cupbop.good food for the price.cost 14.delicious! the staff was extremely friendly and even gave us somecomplimentary drinks from the fridge :) reasonably priced and incredibly tasty!.usually there&#39;s a nice balance in the texture with this korean favorite, but in this case, i was perplexed.staff is really friendly and they make good recommendations.spicy miso ramen is perfect for a cold night in..the space is clean, there are a bunch of community tables and service is nice.the hot sauce was a little sweet with a kick.great food for the money, location is good, easy parking..deceivingly large, i&#39;m very full.was some of the best oriental food i&#39;ve had in awhile, highly recommend for someone on the go.very filling and would definitely go back.my boyfriend ordered the bimbimbop.i would have both again, although i preferred the ramen.the portions are the perfect size and the prices are fair.the ramen was delicious! the broth was superrrrrrr flavorful, noodles and veggies were amazing, and i loved every damn bite.but whenever i have a lunch break (i work a few minutes away) they always prepare cupbops within five minutes which is great for a limited break time."
the-windsor-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-windsor-chicago,1,"We had soup and scallops both delicious..sounds petty but everytime he came around with plates he just left them on a stack on the table instead of passing them around, which was annoying as my girlfriend&#39;s mother had to pass them around each time (he left them by her).excellent food and drinks.on a saturday night at 9pm, this place was dead.i am so glad that i took the advice of the previous reviewers and tried the windsor.i came here for lunch and it is a nice casual place with great service.the food was off the chain excellent.third pancake was very overcooked out of the three we received for $12.slow to refill water but quick to clear your plates.m.they&#39;d never been refilled.we had julie as a bar tender.spätzle mac and cheese, and some ridiculous hash browns are standouts...the food was very good.it&#39;s a minor thing, otherwise this would be 5 stars.a bit pricy..great food, simple ambience and fast service.the food here is outstanding! we came here with 8 girls on a saturday night.barkeep was very friendly and we had a great chat.we got to try a wide array of the foods and i can say it was all amazing..the waitress was very knowledgable.....really friendly staff and quick service.others were less impressed with the salmon.hello, it&#39;s always cloudy here i don&#39;t know what time it is!  almost just got up and left lol but glad we stayed!  the food was absolutely amazing!  we also had a few cocktails as well, which were great.prices appropriate..just absolute wow.we spent the the afternoon at the place with our kids.good thing i stumbled upon it on opentable giving 1,000 points! the vibe is pretty neat and i went for brunch and lunch where both times i got the crab benedict which was english muffin with crab on top, with a poached egg on top and some sauce that was delicious.with the homemade chips...staff was nice and let us linger to chat over coffee.pretty dead on a saturday night and slow service.sat at the bar and had an appetizer and entree.simply the best filet i&#39;ve ever had!!!  great atmosphere and service...a spicy and smokey mix that can be paired with your favorite vodka (i was offered tito&#39;s, grey goose, or belvedere) has a goodie stick with a spicy slice of sausage, a piece of cheese, pimento filled green olive, and a long crisp pickle spear.cookie was a bit undercooked in my opinion.everything was pretty good but the crab toast was the bomb!.we did a few small plates and a couple of beers.so light and crispy, not greasy and really generous portion.definitely a meal.the water glass refill guy was the only one  who seemed to care if we had a good experience.i am a gin martini man so am hoping they add a few more gins such as chicago produced ch and leatherbee.the scallops are the best i&#39;ve had in years and the rotisserie tenderloin is great.really tasty, big portion, reasonably priced ($14).wonderful food and wonderful service..we happened to chat a bit with the couple sitting at a highboy next to us (in what i think would have been inside the restaurant if the pocket doors were closed), and they raved about their food as well - she said the mussels were the best she&#39;d ever had.great price point for the amount of food received.my husband and i came here for brunch before a play at the lookingglass theatre.when we were seated the server told us it was still happy hour if we wanted drinks and they were excellent and priced great during happy hour ($6).we split a burger and chips and guacamole, which left us full and happy.nice bar for lunchtime light bites, esp handy after doctor appointments at northwestern."

yes, i said it.most people associate bar food with fried greasy unhealthy options (which are totally available here as well), but it was refreshing to be able to eat a proper meal after starving all day at a music festival.daily beer specials..when coming to chicago, it&#39;s become a tradition that i check out handlebar.if you like vegetarian or vegan food, definitely come here..we ordered the chimichanga (no eggs) and black bean tostadas.while i have nothing against doing whatever you want to your body as a grown-ass man, just don&#39;t let that interfere with carrying out your job! i might return to handlebar solely for this sloppy joe and mac but i would do take-out, quadruple check my bill and pay in the simplest form possible since it&#39;s obvs these employees can&#39;t handle their duties.i have some nice memories here.it was a smaller appetizer with only 5 spears but was well worth it! the sauce that came with the app was superb!i has the ahi tuna steak sandwich with the house cut french fries! it was great!they are know for there appetizers and nachos!i loved this place! the food, the atmosphere, the style, creativity and diversity in the menu, the staff! this place is a must and i can see why the locals love it!the only downside is i tried to buy a shirt on the way out but the didn&#39;t have my size, probably because everyone loves this place just as much as i did!i will be back handlebar! cheer!.this place was a perfect mix of friendly, funky, interesting people combined with awesome vegan grub- delicious, and super drinks.we finally decided to split two entrees that looked the most delicious to us (vegetarian friendly options for my girlfriend).sam bal tofu is suuuuuuper spicy and salty, had to order a side of brown rice, which is super small and cost &amp;3, this place is overrated and overpriced.the gin cocktails were refreshing and surprisingly strong."

firefin-poké-shop-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/firefin-pok%C3%A9-shop-chicago,1,"Lettuce is padded at the bottom and lettuce is not mentioned in the ingredient list.the prices are seem a bit high for the larger portions, but i think seafood is a little more expensive for lunch and indulgent.for the helpfulness of the staff, they deserve at least the 3 stars above.the fish was also much more bland and less fresh than i remember.unlimited garnishes and various toppings can be added.fast, fresh, and delicious.as a caveat, if you have never been to aloha poke or any other poke place, then firefin will blow your mind.i just didn&#39;t like this.my tuna tasted funky &amp; the lady doing the plating didn&#39;t look like she knew what she was doing.i&#39;ve been waiting to try this place for a couple of weeks now, especially after falling for aloha poke.flavors did not work well.the line moves fast even though it can be out the door during lunch.best ever! go here and get a custom bowl!! great service!! super fast service and really fresh ingredients.so line wasn&#39;t an issue.i&#39;m normally a slow eater, but this was so good that i couldn&#39;t get it in my mouth fast enough! and they weren&#39;t kidding when they said this bowl was spicy!i would&#39;ve came here more during my short stay in chicago, but they aren&#39;t open on the weekends :(.you get what you pay for here, and that is quality and excellent service.and the veg is fresh and delicious as well.definitely plan to take your meal to go though since the inside of this restaurant is tiny.the fish was extremely fresh although i tasted more tuna than any of the other fish.sorry, but it just can&#39;t compete with aloha poke co..loved every bite  a healthy, fresh option that tastes as good as it looks.long line went pretty quickly and service was very friendly.i went for my own custom bowl with purple rice, ahi tuna, ono sauce, edamame, cucumber, red cabbage, pickled jalapeños, hijiki (dried seaweed), and crispy shallots.the fish was incredibly fresh, and sauce was delightfully spicy.can&#39;t get enough of this place, go check it out!.just a thought that if you did order online, you could come through the side door and it would be easier to skip the line.i&#39;ll try it again in a few weeks in hopes they&#39;ve ironed out opening week stuff.the bowl itself was meh - the flavoring bordered bland, the fish wasn&#39;t crazy flavorful and overall i caught myself wanting to reach for salt more than anything.off the bat, this restaurant is very similar to pokéworks, the sushi burrito place in new york.other that that, i can&#39;t wait to go back and try the firefin creations.there was a good amount of ahi tuna, but the flavors would have combined better if the tuna was chopped a little smaller so you could enjoy it in move bites.it is quick and has a vibrant atmosphere.very disappointing being our first time ordering from here.i went during the weekday, around 1-2pm and the line was pretty much to the door  but it only took about 15 min wait.still new, so i will try again!.95.lots of tuna and has some great spices.overall i highly recommend it!.i ordered the regular size, and it was definitely enough food.customer service is great, and there are many options.the rainbow bowl has tuna, salmon, avocado, cucumber, tomato, scallion, fried onion, and tobiko dressed in a tasty combo of mayo and ono sauce.i was walking down the street and saw a really long line so i just got in the line without knowing what it was about.compared to aloha, which is nearby, firefin has the added option of getting noodles as a base and has more protein options, adding albacore, snow crab, chicken, and tofu on top of the traditional tuna and salmon.staff is nice, and willing to customize your order/do replacements easily.firefin did not let us down!  the sauces are absolutely delicious!great for lunch!..the warrior is a must have next time i have to have mango added.in others (the salmon) it just didn&#39;t seem as fresh.the bowl here wasn&#39;t bad.the addition of goji berries were a pleasant surprise, little  sweet chewy bits of goodness....there are several bowls to choose from and you can have your own choice of fish.if you love sushi, you&#39;ll love poke even more.this place is gluten free friendly!ordered the regular citrus salmon pokébowl over organic mixed greens with avocado and edamame.this place is amazing! my favorite has got to be the tuna on fire.i decided to create my own regular sized bowl with ahi tuna on top of mixed greens, fire sauce, edamame, cucumber, sweet onions, carrot, all the garnishes except goji berries and coconut, and added avocado.all the poke places we visited in hawaii served poke bowls with seaweed salad.you feel fresh and satisfied after your meal and not gross which is always great.the fish is flown in fresh daily from hawaii and is sustainably sourced.yum!!!!!!! the warrior bowl and the rainbow bowl are my favorites.umm! about 6 months ago i was in hawaii and i had poke for the first time and i knew i was in love with the dish, so you imagine how happy was to learn that a poke shop was opening up downtown.at firefin, i was having trouble focusing on anything else because the fish was just not good."

taco-joint-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/taco-joint-chicago,2,"I will definitely be back.i recommend this joint if your near.i drive by this restaurant a lot and i have heard that they have &#34;the best tacos&#34;.i dined in here this past monday and had two tacos--the ceviche and a beef one, i believe...in addition to the great tacos, they also have some great guac choices.it was as if someone cut up avocado, pineapple, and mango into small pieces, stirred twice and called it a day.i&#39;ve been all over mexico and this is better than what most tacos in mexico taste like.the queso fundido was pretty tasty.i tried 4 different tacos here, the guacamole, and the queso fundido and i thought everything was just ok.oftentimes i just wish those daily specials would be the regular menu items.maybe one of the days i will try it again and see if they have improved.service was always satisfactory, no complaints.julie was our go-to leading up to the big day and she went above and beyond making sure everything was in order.i&#39;d rather get it delivered because the place is incredibly loud and uncomfortable seating.1) blood orange margarita - literally to die for2) pozole taco3) queso fundido w/ chorizo - hand-pressed tortillas are so good!4) steak michelada taco5) rojo guacamole - variety of chips were awesome6) del dia guacamole7) ceviche taco - do not get.two will due--i had the shredded pork and white fish..taco joint is located on halsted and armitage, it&#39;s pretty busy in the area, not too much parking on the street.very delicious and filling! the spicy guacamole was also good.i ordered just one of these and next time i think i&#39;ll make a meal with only these..it&#39;s a giant glass of sugar mixed with some stale toilet water called tequila.we asked for separate checks, which i&#39;ve done here multiple times, to which he said they don&#39;t do.their food is delicious!chicken tinga taco is the way to go!.i wish i would&#39;ve visited sooner.the restaurant is fairly small so get there early or prepare to wait.is it just me or are places doing that less and less lately? bring on the hypertension.so uncomfortable, too much traffic...nothing about my first impression indicated that it could possibly be a restaurant and serve tacos.stopped here on a saturday, had their daily special taco which was the brisket, meat was well cooked and had a smoky flavor.overall i&#39;d recommend it for a group but not a date since it can get loud and def get the guac, pork tacos, and margarita.i could sip on that all day.i wish they had called before doing that-- i had already eaten everything by the time the cheese arrived, and it put me in the position of having to tip a second delivery driver for $1.quality of food has gone down since it first opened.this place is great! it definitely gets busy during peak hours, but is worth a wait.unbelievable place!!! best tacos in town and the margaritas are the bomb! left this place full and buzzed.4 meows out of 5!0 hisses-mowgli.i think their happy hour is one of the best around.don&#39;t get me wrong the place is awesome, good vibes, great environment but way too expensive!.the barbacoa taco was really the rating changer:).i don&#39;t know why they didn&#39;t call when they got our order to let us know they were out and ask if we wanted to order something else.i do not think that this is a &#34;let&#39;s go have a family dinner&#34; kind of place, but it is great for having one of their many flavorful margaritas, a couple appetizers and i really great time.but management listen up.great guacamole and chips.give the daily special a try and definitely order the churro donut holes.they came and set everything up, brought staff to serve the buffet line, helped clear tables after dinner was done, and were generally fantastic.trio of guac is a must.it was good but too sweet.i had good old-fashioned lime, and i tasted my cousin&#39;s prickly pear - also delicious.we had the al pastor chicken tacos and the tacos de rajas, both so good! house margarita was ok..service was polite and quick.will not be back.i grew up in southern california and the tj margaritas, tamales (a must have) and carne asada tacos were way better than i expected.food is 4/5 just because the flavors are really unique and tasty.you can put your name down for a table 30 minutes before you arrive which i don&#39;t know many place that do that.coming from southern california i struggled to find decent mexican food and taco joint hits the spot.i loved this place- we actually got seated next door at bbq joint but ordered the tacos.will definitely go back and also try the river north location..tried almost all of the tacos amongst a group of friends and each were unique and full of amazing flavor, their guacamole is perfect.i went here on a tuesday for the 2 dollar tacos and was not disappointed.the taco joint salad is very good too.walked in with a friend but wait was too long on a saturday early evening, so we decided to go elsewhere..if you&#39;re vegetarian, there aren&#39;t a lot of choices and substitutions are not allowed.phenomenal! if you still have some room."
casa-yari-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/casa-yari-chicago,2,"The two vegetarians in our group easily found items on the menu that they could have, so this is definitely a huge plus..the food was tasty as well as their flans.i would&#39;ve liked a little bit more of that dressing because it was seriously so good.came here for lunch as it has high praise from other reviewers..hard to carry on a conversation over dinner because the music was too, too loud.la sopera: the spicy mayo-like sauce was integral in knocking this potato, plantain, and seitan dish out of the park.we even talked about delicacies of the island.this place is very clean and polished looking with an inviting atmosphere.mouth watering.get it.we got the yucca patties, flour tortilla with beans/eggs/chorizo, and mofango with seitan.casa yari is new-ish and worth checking out for sure!.it melted in my mouth and screamed rich flavor without being drenched in sugar.i like the layout of the tables and decore  the pillows are a nice comfy touch to settle in for an extravaganza of flavor for your taste buds.this place was wonderful.casa yari will definitely join our rotation of favorite brunch places!.took some flan home- a mango w/chile &amp; avocado w/ lime..i have a wheat allergy, so it&#39;s always great to have more options for tasty food within walking distance.it&#39;s a breakfast / lunch menu.cute spot for a date.i really appreciated the friendliness we were greeted with and i was amazed by the depth of flavor i tasted.this morning my girlfriend and i ordered the chilaquiles and the caribbean french toast.seriously good food and just amazing service.there were 4 full tables and one guy running everything - food, water, taking orders, etc.the chicken was tastyi ordered the jibarito sandwich it was amazing the garlic aoily was on pointi wanted dessert but they ran out so otherwise they would have gotten a 5 i mean a lot people talked about it so was really looking forward to it.the restaurant itself looks like a homey kitchen in a beloved aunt&#39;s home.the caramel sauce was so fresh, not too sweet.i went in this past sunday after going to the logan square farmer&#39;s market..i had a pork sandwich (forget exact name) and tortilla soup.best vegetarian mofongo in chicago.i had the specialty, the first thing on the menu and it was delicious.when my husband inquired about a side dish, he brought him a sample.you guys may visit casa yari !!!!..have to say ughhhh.absolutely worth a visit!.incredible.perfect vibe when you walk in...you can tell the chef/owner makes the food with love!.food was incredible ambiance is great, service outstanding and all food made with the freshest ingredients.what a hidden gem!  i was looking for a byo spot that served different dietary needs and this fit the bill.we got the vegan version of pernil encebollado (with jackfruit and white rice), and machuca.i feel that should be the other way around, but that&#39;s my take..&#34; this is a place to go to have a leisurely night out.this is the kind of place that once you eat there, you just end up thinking about going back and eating there again!  like, the *next day*.we ordered a steak churassco plate, steak jibarito combo, &amp;  chicken jibraito combo.we splurged and tried the reese&#39;s flan for dessert - it was so smooth and creamy it tasted almost like cheesecake.the menu is a combination of guatamalan, puerto rican, and caribbean food with a lot of offerings utilizing plantains..best flan in town!!!! coconut flan is to die for!! the spicy mango one is amazing too! yet to try the pineapple cheese flan but i know it won&#39;t disappoint! try their mofongo!!!! everything tastes home made.highly recommended it.it also came with lightly flavored rice pilaf and some coleslaw with a vinegar base.but all in all byob also makes it rock..service was attentive.just like you&#39;d make with a well-worn coffee sock (the pr folk will get that reference, trust me it&#39;s good).i went for lunch and got the wednesday special, the jibarito for only $5..we will be back!.my friend ordered a burrito bowl (she said she liked it, but was unable to finish it due to its big size) and i ordered the vegan jibarito sandwich.simple and to the point.ive had both brunch and dinner and they continue to amaze me! last night i had the pernil ensebollou.first impressions.it makes me come back again and again.my partner ordered the grilled salmon entree.i would recommend this place in a heartbeat!.we had all of the specials and thought hector the waiter was fantastic.check it out, you&#39;ll be happy you did."

glazed-and-infused-chicago-6,https://www.yelp.com/biz/glazed-and-infused-chicago-6,1,"Both were amazing.so, since i tried those, we decided to order a few other flavors.i think the risen yeast-style ones are fine.i left the money on the counter and left extra tip.i&#39;m glad i got them to go, as the seating is pretty limited and the atmosphere seemed cramped.we came in the late afternoon (3/4ish) so the donut selection was not that great.upon inquiring from daniella alonzo ( catering manager) why it was so small and thin and looked nothing like the display or the email i received, her response was &#34; she didn&#39;t know, but could refund me my money&#34;.glazed&amp;infused always keeps me on my toes with the most interesting flavors.we got the nutella s&#39;more, vanilla bean glazed, red velvet.you can also buy a dozen for $30 or less! we came in when they had the &#34;2 for 2 deal,&#34; and couldn&#39;t resist trying 4 of the mouthwatering options.50.what a way to start the morning.pb&amp;j was just as yummy as the classic sandwich and the real fruit pieces in the fritter were a pleasant surprise.maybe it&#39;s just me but it does seem a little pricey at $3/donut for sugar and flour..this is a cute little shop and the workers were nice! but the donuts were meh! granted i bought them over 2 hrs ago and just tried them now but for the price it should be super fresh and good even 2 hrs later! i got the maple bacon i really prefer the bacon chopped up so you get it with ever bite the glaze was a little to crunchy as well on this one, this just lacked in quality for me and the dough is to dense i prefer light and fluffy maybe it is right out of the fryer? the flavor of the pineapple,mango,lime tajin was good! but again the dough was not how i prefer but the glaze was better on this one.i paid 12 bucks for 2 donuts and one latte.the maple topping is yummy, making an excellent combination.while down in chicago for a conference i decided to pick up some goodies for my co-workers and myself..a true beauty to behold.marcus is wonderful.what more can i say ? sweet sensation ! great place to ger some interesting doughnuts &amp; we love ur staff.beautiful.(note that the entrance to the river north location is through the restaurant around the corner and past the hostess stand.i had a strawberry glazed donut.we decided on big star.- the pilsen: definitely my favorite.unfortunately i did not enjoy glazed &amp; infused as much as i expected..all were super tasty..love the maple, bacon infused long john.i&#39;m partial to another location a couple of blocks away.i would explain the deliciousness of each donut, but i would probably run out of room.the staff was very friendly and helpful!.so this was my first time here and j was intrigued by the creme brûlée donut that i saw on yelp..pop-up feel to this small corner donut-coffee shop inside the larger italian restaurant you need to walk through to get inside.the mini donuts are great! the samples generous.the donuts, the crack coffee (we swear they put crack in it.obsessed with this place.get the classic glazed donut and you won&#39;t be disappointed..i was looking for the creme brûlée donut, that was a no go, so i went with the next best thing maple bacon long john..despite the fact that the raspberry donut was not in stock this particular day i was extremely happy with my selection of donuts, though the price of these mere four donuts was not exactly enthusing at $13..wish that there had been a full sized maple bacon long john available..the selling point was definitely the guy behind the counter.tip: they have $20 dozens on tuesdays so that&#39;s a good time to snatch a bunch of donuts.the main number connects you to someone at glazed and infused who can check all their locations for the doughnut(s) you are looking for.big fluffy donuts!  they&#39;re about the size of two normal donuts.they have a small selection of types of donuts, so i assume they run out a lot quicker, but these bad boys are dangerously good!! we went with a red velvet and cajeta donut, and they were nothing short of amazing.warning: these doughnuts are massive.my only gripe is that they close early, but i can get over that.i would describe the texture of the donuts as being cake-y and more dense, which is what i prefer.donuts! so so many donuts..the vanilla bean flavor was good, but the moisture and texture weren&#39;t there.i got there after they had closed but they gave me a free box of hawks donuts they had left over and my brother loved it! will definitely be back!.after living in the city for a year i had yet to try this place...; ).amazing donuts, some are more like cake donuts, but always fresh and delicious.it is a little strange to get into though, you go into a restaurant and then turn right to actually get to the donut counter.please open in nyc!!.got here around 7.they were friendly and quick, and didn&#39;t snuff at our huge family that practically took up their entire dining area.while staying at the marriott i had a late night sweet tooth and decided to give them a try.i arrived to the airport ready  to indulge on this sweet dessert to find 4 donuts! i was totally shocked.if you want an excellent apple fritter, try starbucks..glazed and infused did not disappoint.chicago.definitely, try one.the line gets long, and customers frequently get large orders so be prepared to wait."

bandera-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bandera-restaurant-chicago,2,"It&#39;s located on the 2nd floor, across the escalator from a men&#39;s wearhouse so i had some trouble finding it at first.anybody woild be crazy not come to this place if you&#39;re it visiting chicago let alone living in chicago.i&#39;m from los angeles and go to the bandera in brentwood frequently..not over priced.we had to wait awhile to grab a seat at the bar.we came all the way to visit chicago and highly recommend to this restaurant, since they have good steaks one of our friends was wearing tank top bc the weather was very hot then they told him he&#39;s not allowed to get in and the hotel was far away.my husband and i love this place.our waitress was the friendly carolyne who then offered us a bottle of champagne to celebrate the evening..i had a reservation at 7:30pm...if you&#39;re coming for lunch, get the prime rib french dip sandwich.awesome food.the servers and staff are very attentive and very professional.do not miss this place!.great date spot with dim lighting and a great, intimate atmosphere.the macho salad is my wife&#39;s favorite.cocktails are awesome - mules and margaritas especially! goat cheese salad is a perfect choice and don&#39;t forget to get dessert - the apple crumble, food-gasm!..girls got burgers with the highest quality ingredients but i.read the reviews and they were correct.everything we ordered from the drinks to the appetizers to the main was cooked perfectly and had lots of flavor.if you check it out get the enchiladas but be sure to make reservations this place is always packed.soon.again, the food and service was wonderful.service was good and the live jazz music is big plus.i loved the macho salad, seared ahi tuna salad, iron skillet cornbread, prime rib and banana cream pie.nice soft jazz.the chicken tortilla soup was really good! it had really good flavors and tasted as if it was simmering for a very long time.we also got a plate of fociccia bread and olives which were ok, the bread was better than the olives.visiting chicago for the first time.my boyfriend had been planning a date for weeks during our vacation/business trip in chicago.we both ordered the bbq chicken and prime beef ribs.my colleagues got the mancha (?) salad and lamb sandwich and loved them!would definitely go back if i were to visit this city again.stop burning the corn bread.despite the fact that it was busy, our server didn&#39;t rush us through our meal which was great..m..no complaints here! seems like a fantastic date spot..this is truly one of the only restaurants that i miss and begin to crave after several months of not eating there!there rotisserie chicken is by far the best i&#39;ve ever had.their signature bbq beef ribs with coleslaw and fries (served at both locations) fall off the bones and are simply the best!.the cornbread was very large, so definitely get it to share with the table.well, bandera&#39;s did not disappoint! the jazz was playing and the lights were low when we came in..our party enjoyed the tuna poke and the salmon appetizers.definitely recommend! great atmosphere too.exceedingly disappointed.just had lunch an amazing machu salad with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice.it was really nice to hear them play!the first course we got was the cornbread.if you decide to visit bandera you have to try one of the desserts.a terrific, trendy spot on michigan, bandera (while a little hard to find), boasts some delicious farm to table food..the waiter was young and didn&#39;t look like he liked this job - you&#39;re a waiter - smile a little.the restaurant presents a fancier and quitter appearance, so loud 20 year olds celebrating a birthday was probably not the best mixture.great experience!  the cornbread is a must,  my macho salad was fantastic.all ingredients were fresh, seasonings just right, a perfect dining experience!.she had hers cooked medium, and it just might have been the best burger i&#39;ve tasted..highly recommended!.everything tasted great, portion sizes were generous, and presentation was good too.service was good.the cornbread is great, bbq ribs are fantastic, we also had the fresh catch of the day, also delicious.there is a restaurant in lake view, called crosby&#39;s kitchen, that has basically the same menu, but not as expensive.house smoked salmon is very smokey, delicate and flaky, served with crisp toast and a mayo and dill based spread.recommended by the hotel staff.our waiter was excellent!we started with the spinach and artichoke dip and the jalapeño cornbread.it was our first dinner place of our chicago getaway.came here for lunch on a weekday and sat at the bar.the companion ladies ordered the juicy amazing rotisserie chicken &amp; beef bbq ribs, also just perfectly seasoned with good flavor but not over powering, a great balance of textures and flavor.the service here was also exceptionally good.i am going to make this easy for you.i always feel wealthier than i am when i dine here.i am writing this, risking that this place will become too popular and i can&#39;t get in anymore.we ended up settling on this place due to another place having an hour-and-a-half wait.one of my all time favorite restaurants in chicago."

the-big-state-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-big-state-chicago,2,"I was pleasantly surprised when the burritos came out not too heavily greased! the food was tasty but standard.so yea, basically everything we&#39;ve tried we&#39;ve enjoyed (we&#39;ve been twice in the last week).the potatoes and rajas tacos are super flavorful, and the corn tortillas are homemade.and all of it was sooooo good!!!! next time we will dine in:).the pork was seasoned really well and savory.not the best i&#39;ve ever had in my life but great for when you&#39;re in a pinch and need quick food.the green and red salsa the comes with the chips is nothing short of the most flavorful salsa i&#39;ve ever had.fresh ingredients and good spice.great prices..i haven&#39;t tried the breakfast but my boyfriend had the french toast.the guac was great.i have never waited so long for mexican food (approximately 30 minutes).nice neighborhood restaurant..ok, i have to give this place 5+ stars.great lunch or dinner date! see you again soon big state!.the torta de papas (potatoes) is one of the best vegetarian sandwiches in town.they also have excellent guacamole and horchata.this place has great food, but the service and speed is awful.it&#39;s byob, and the tortillas were homemade.will be back to try breakfast.love the burritos..fresh, flavorful, and in case you missed it, these tortillas are hand made when you order.order in, and you get your burrito presented on a plate unlike any other location in the city...the presentation of the food was very nice, and friendly service..for some reason the burrito was served with fries.either way, can&#39;t say enough good things about this place and the people who own it.they are absolutely delicious!  have ordered tacos on both visits to dine in, and was served a basket of homemade chips and salsa.being a native texan, i am quite familiar with tex-mex, those that claim to be tex-mex, and authentic mexican food.service speed is still incredibly slow; today, i waited about 25 minutes for a shredded chicken, rice and bean burrito.no glitz, thousands were definitely not spent in the decor.was disappointed that they ran out of horchata last time i was in--this is some of the best, non fake-tasting horchata i&#39;ve had in the city.i take my food to go 90% of the time because the eating area seems kinda sterile and cafeteria like.one of my favorite mexican restaurants in chicago.these are currently my favorite tacos in chi!.great tacos and amazing service.this place serves great food for dirt cheap prices.6-stars! this place was amazing.can&#39;t beat the prices!.i recommend it.i tried four out of their seven tacos and all four of them were amazing..amazingggg! three tacos: one steak one chicken one pork- all equally flavorful and tender."

fremont-chicago-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fremont-chicago-chicago,2,"A group of lady friends and i decided to hit up fremont chicago after having brunch downtown.once you get over the fact that you&#39;ve been bamboozled into an expensive brunch, it is a good place to come with friends.it&#39;s a trendy spot, and reservation is highly recommended.pretty good for people watching, could be subject to a seizure with all the strobe lights.oh, to be young again, carrying cases of champagne up the stairs to the second floor.if they were charging more i would be violently complaining, as it is i&#39;m just leaving a review.i highly recommend their moscow mules.i was told by multiple sources that this pink drink makes the girls slutty lol! in all seriousness, i was somehow tipped off that there is a thursday happy hour deal going here from 5-7.they were awesome!! oh, they also had ice cream in this station too! they were just alright though nothing special.worst place in all of chicago.this place is great for brunch with a retractable roof that makes for an awesome summer time destination.while we were weary since i&#39;d never been to fremont and usually wind up at the usual standbys for sports watching (benchmark, public house, parlor pizza, etc), we had an awesome night..they took care of our whole bill and made sure that we were able to have a great time.do not be deceived by the pictures posted on their website.i was celebrating my birthday with my family and close friends and we reserved a couple of tables on a saturday evening.this is a review of their oysters via their thursday night oyster/rose happy hour.cons:my only complaint was that the seating was a little strange.i only came to fremont for after dinner drinks on a saturday night and expected a rooftop but it&#39;s more so a second floor patio.make a reservation, seriously guys, this place is packed for weeks sometimes and reservations are key to getting in...if you want a boozing brunch experience that makes you feel like you are in a vegas night club.for two people, we had leftovers to take home.there was also a mini bagel station with all the fixings but i was not a fan of the smoked fish.so, i think that&#39;s probably a good thing? we did partake in their unlimited mimosa package - at $15/per person it was absolutely worth it.seriously, let me repeat: bottomless mimosa.gross.the waitress was wonderful! she was attentive, efficient, and friendly! the food was wonderful! we all shared the brussel sprouts, an avocado dip, and a fried chicken app -- all of which were delicious!! the platters are huge!! don&#39;t try to conquer one on your own unless you&#39;re looking for leftovers! a friend and i shared the chicken and waffles platter.and i didn&#39;t even try the doggone thing.great food and they kept the mimosas coming.the service was fantastic and the food was divine! it is one of our go to spots in chicago for breakfast.pro tip: make 10am reservations so you can take full advantage of the 5-hour time frame.felt very vegas-y...the service is also a little off - the girl put soda water in our water glasses and had no idea.the omelet station was good, as was the mac and cheese and carving station.waaaaaay obnoxiously loud.needless to say, they keep asking when were going back! it was a blast! food was great - fun variety of savory and sweet! and the bottomless mimosas were awesome for the bday celebration.bussers frequently picked up our empty plates as well.the space is large and has much potential for a fun night or even sunday funday for brunch and drinks in the summer with the retractable roof.arrived at 1 p.i finally was able to make it there after rescheduling with the manager, and guess what they still didn&#39;t have my reservation.the staff were all very nice and helpful as well.amazing atmosphere, attentive bartenders like antonio, and really good food.most of our table did the bottomless mimosas brunch deal.can&#39;t remember when it starts.the third time i dined here was on a thursday for the $20 all you can eat oysters &amp; all you can drink rose.very fresh food.it&#39;s a very cool place, and the porterhouse appetizer was pretty solid.anyway, the beef tartare was actually decent but my drink was not.around $35 which is a great price for river north! includes and omelette bar a waffle bar and a doughnut tower! meat section and awesome mac n cheese.i was nervous coming here that this place would be super douchey (which to be honest it kind of still is) given it&#39;s location in river north, proximity to el hefe, and bottle service brunch.came in for sunday brunch on the rooftop for my best friends birthday.keep in mind they add 18% gratuity to your check, i don&#39;t even think that&#39;s enough!can&#39;t wait to come back!.we hilariously pointed this out to one of the employees, to which he responded &#39;hahaha, you should have seen what happened here last week.are you sensing a pattern?the atmosphere and venue, however, were right up my alley.it was too cold to sit on the roof but the main level with window seats worked perfectly for the three of us..the brunch experience is amazing.if you&#39;re hungover or want to have a nice buffet atmosphere with your boo, i doubt you would enjoy this.even after we told her we were going to take a couple minutes.upon arrival i noticed the long line for brunch which i was dreading.great live dj house, hip hop, top 100 music, and awesome brunch.i stopped by fremont for a drink on a saturday night around 10-ish.really impressed with the amazing service we received here on a saturday night.i wasn&#39;t expecting much since it looked like a bougie spot but i was definitely impressed.but, they were 100% worth the short line.need to come back to the try the chorizo and shrimp flat bread, as they were fresh out when we were there, bummer!also love that four corners has kept a good thing going with the retractable roof, such an awesome thing on those random nice days we have in the middle of january and february!.and the drinks were definitely watered down! i&#39;m a lightweight and 6 shots could do nothing for me.nice atmosphere! i was honestly only here for 30 minutes early on a friday night so i can&#39;t comment too much on the place but i would definitely consider coming back in the future.i love love love fremont!! it&#39;s my favorite brunch place! the oysters yum.."

no problem..but not nearly as fine as the art itself.the chicken was moist and tender, but it wasn&#39;t super flavorful.overall, i like this place and will return again for another stroller walk lunch with my kiddo.but i have to say the best side of all is the mexican rice, it is our favorite..i thought the chicken was really well done (in execution, not temperature).nothing mind blowing about it but done very well and tasty-red hot saucemy mom loved this! it&#39;s quite spicy though so be careful in pouring it on your chicken!grand total ~$15!the art of chicken is a great deal and has very very delicious chicken.i have been here maybe 4 or 5 times.try the fries, mashed potatoes and mac n cheese.i live a block from here and every single day it is a struggle to not walk in here and order the el jefe..i had the el jefe white meat quarter chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy for lunch on my way back from o&#39;hare, and it delivered.chicken was perfectly spiced lots of great flavor and the meat itself was fresh and delectable.very friendly staff and i love the chicken artwork.love the crazy chicken..poor service..fries are a no brainer.warning : this review is based solely off of customer service, never even got to try the food.i love art of chicken for quick, yet scrumptious dinners.attention all chicago foodies !!!i found the perfect mexican grilled chicken spot !!!i had the el jefe order.when you&#39;re tired &amp; beat down from the chicago winter, there is really nothing so great as art of chicken and netflix.the main reason i&#39;m updating my review is to update some information.the associates are very nice and care about the food, i have only positive things to say about this place.it&#39;s a good spot, but it&#39;s missing some options to take it next level.the service is friendly, the prices are reasonable, and the bird and sides are flame!.ordered the corn which was frozen corn on the cob.they both were great sauces, the red being spicier and maybe barely edging out the green (jury&#39;s still out).we&#39;ve never actually been here but my fam and i have ordered delivery from there 3 times now and it just hits the spot! the el jefe and crazy chico are both delicious as well as the fries and mac and cheese.had corn on the cob, sweet potato fries, and veggies.we try calling at 11:00am when they open thinking that we might beat the lunch crowd, but because there is a catering order, they want us to call back around noon or 1:00pm and then it ends up being an hour and a half wait.would love to try again without all of the issues.the chicken has plenty of flavor and the sides are good.i hate comparing it to chains like el pollo loco or pollo campero, as it&#39;s much much better than those places.salsas aren&#39;t my thing with chicken so i&#39;m no judge there..everything was just so good.it&#39;s a small business so it&#39;s a small menu, but i appreciate having something a little different in the area..the chicken is amazing, well seasoned and properly cooked..hope they expand for more seating soon!.you must try.blows honey butter chicken out of the water.it was very flavorful and moist--perfect! the restaurant was clean and staff was nice.if you&#39;re craving chicken, this place is great! a very simple menu makes it easy to decide what you want.i was still pretty hungry after spending $10 so i was pretty bummed.the sweet potato fries and rice are very good, though i think the other sides are a bit lacking.everything i ordered came with lots of bread and sauce.omg soooo good!just ordered this yesterday when i was yelping for chicken while shopping at target (elston)..we will be back.the skin was super crispy and full of flavor, although the flavor didn&#39;t fully penetrate the chicken.holy smokes.food is really really good, but there are just too many of this type of chicken joints in chicago that do the same thing for so much less money..maybe i was just lucky but i think this place will be here to stay.delviery order.friendly service, and the mac &amp; cheese is to die for! great quality chicken and seasoned to perfection-- however, even though i ordered a quarter size chicken, i was kind of let down when i saw just how small the chicken leg &amp; breast piece were.every bite is heaven.if he is running late, which only happened because of the puerto rican parade in humboldt park, he gives me a call to let me know that he is on his way.however the wait time is outrageous for a couple pieces of chicken..will definitely be back soon! i do wish the pita that the chicken comes with had a bit more flavor- something was definitely missing.i go with the whole el jefe everytime and even the leftovers are amazing!.cashier was not helpful at all.so moist, fries so crispy!..the girl at the register is not exactly very friendly, but is ok."

hardboiled egg, sausage, seemingly bland (as it would be fried) but with mustard.you definitely get lots of fish but ours lacked flavor.i love the gage! the environment is great and the staff is so friendly.friendly bar staff..stellar menu, great drinks, cool ice cubes, good looking crowd, amazing location, awesome interior, stupendous lobster roll (as said by david s.i ordered the eggs benedict dish and finished the entire thing.you think in order to have juicy tender flavorful meat, u need good quality meat of course and excellent marble on em.very good guality meat.we sat at the bar and had wonderful service from friendly bartenders.that&#39;s the type of experience you always want.the benedict was really good."
sweetwater-tavern-and-grille-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetwater-tavern-and-grille-chicago,1,"It was the biggest waste of $18 ever spent.good prices given its downtown location.we ended our meal with the chocolate chip cookie, which was a little soupy but a tasty treat all the same.the menu sounded good and it is in a great location on michigan ave.burger is the sunny side up - tillamook cheddar, mozzarella , fried egg, carmelized onion, applewood smoked bacon, crunchy lettuce, fresh tomato, and steak sauce on whole grain bun.great ambiance for sporting events as there were tv&#39;s everywhere.friendly and attentive staff, great beer selection, lots of tvs, but the salad i ordered was disappointing.we ordered a to go order and the nachos were chicken and chips with a bland cheese sauce on the side.the fancy lot and crispy calamari appetizer teased us with the promise of excellent entrees to follow, but the baja fish tacos and the steak salad left us gustatorily dissatisfied...service was fine, drink was fine, i didn&#39;t order food so there&#39;s no issue there.fun spot! good food, with a wide variety on the menu.service: 5/5.with the bun, it was at least 6&#39; tall (also had mozz, avocado, and a cranberry spread).i love their mules!.had the pineapple cider-omgosh yum-and a few good bartenders along with both the soccer and hockey games turned on.sat outside right on michigan ave which was great for people watching.good food - service sucks.we walked right in and it wasn&#39;t busy.food is not particularly good, but it&#39;s a good, central location to watch games with friends.sweetwater gives a good intro to chi-town!..definitely has that sports bar feel to it with tvs everywhere.i have been here several times and have never been disappointment.we also tried to drown ourselves in savignon blanc after a long work week..is a huge sports bar, with tvs everywhere.thee best i&#39;ve ever had.how a chicago sports bar can refuse to put on the chicago blackhawks can never, ever be rationally explained!  especially when reservations were made to come there and watch the blackhawks game!we left after appetizers, picked up a sixer and hauled it back to the hotel room to watch the game! this place should be avoided by all chicagoans at all costs!the loaded potato soup was runny, the fried cheese curds were mediocre, and their beer selection omits chicago&#39;s finest breweries!  worst sports bar in chicago!..the lobster mac and cheese was cold, room temperature at best.a nice big mirror too is in the bathroom..outside dining was a plus!  would recommend if you are at a conference at hyatt regency.oh my yum! why does this place not have 5 stars? i&#39;m an out of towner, so maybe i&#39;m missing the memo about the &#34;hopping&#34; places to be in chicago, but sweetwater tavern is amazeballs.would definitely recommend to friends and family.we finally got a chance to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather because the last time we were here it was the middle of winter, brrrrrr..the atmosphere is bright and modern and nice in the summer for open air dining..it&#39;s definitely a tourist trap and a poor choice for a business lunch.bar was clean."
river-roast-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/river-roast-chicago-3,2,"I have been here for both dinner (multiple times) and brunch.the burger was good but did not come with any fries and for $3:50 you can have yourself a small 125ml can of coke!!! overall my bill was $43+ tip for (2) burgers (2) can pop and a side of avocado.i politely informed him of what was going on, his response was &#34;are you serious, i&#39;m going to kill them&#34; and took off for the kitchen.tempura squash blossoms were awesome!!!drinks are on point!.wow-- what a wonderful experience!we both ordered a couple rounds of beer, which were delicious.great place!.three of us shared the roast beef and the whole chicken.$$$ not $$...we felt satisfied with really nice services and good food.as for my own order i  went with the fried chicken sandwich complete with siracha pickle and spicy remoulade and it was delightful.the cooking process made the skin perfectly soft with a tad of crunch, and the meat was extremely tender.the menu has a great family-style setup and my 4 friends and i were anxious to order and eat!love the family style dining and down home cooking..there&#39;s no way to sugarcoat it.the place is a great location for a romantic evening or a larger group with friends.just the perfect bite leaving you wanting more.i think i&#39;ll have to come again during a different time of day and try something else.while the potatoes under it were super tasty and it was definitely better than a pre-cooked chicken from whole foods, it wasn&#39;t 34 dollars better by any means.it took all my patience to not eat the crust completely in the first two bites.i&#39;m usually fairly skeptical of slightly &#34;touristy&#34;-seeming places and because this restaurant was right along the water and in a pretty prime location, i expected the food to be overpriced and not great.we were a party of 11 - with a reservation at 9pm.we walked in without a reservation and was seated immediately, but a couple of groups walked in afterwards and had to wait for seating.amazing service to say the least, we ordered the roast chicken and the roast beef and tasted awesome!! thankfully the weather was fantastic too.we went with an appetizer to start, which i went with the hangover soup.i enjoyed the spicy honey that came with the appetizer..it all felt very expensive and authentic.the way the tables were set up the servers hit our chairs with doors and their bodies multiple times.great view if you manage a seat on the patio, forgettable food.the food was really tasty and many menu items are enough for two-three people depending upon how hungry you are.the outside seating is gorgeous filled with city lights..i hope they never take it off the menu! for the roasts - the grilled fish was perfectly done and plump.the service wasn&#39;t very attentive, and the food was average..customer service can be a little slow but our server was great overall.skyscraper views and  scrumptious cuisine? sounds like a tourist trap.great flavor and perfect sized portion.it looked like this one guy who was sitting next to us had a business meeting and was sweating profusely.i wanted a salad and a piece of fish, but the hotel concierge could get us last minute reservations and it was pouring rain and this did get us a nice view of the stormy river view.amazing!!!first time here! it was lovely! drinks, fabulous and tasty, food grand! we ate the fried rabbit for appetizer and had the roasted sea bass for dinner with carrots and asparagus! we ordered two drinks each total bill ran about $150 with tip for 2&#39;ppl.menue full with surprises - the service is amazimg as well.we ordered a half dozen oysters, which they happily steamed for us! they were delicious.for the sides we got carrots (amazing) and mushrooms (great) and corn (amazing).from the bartenders to the severs everything is top notch.the breading was very bland.i had a compote french toast and a side of bacon.we sat right by the window so we had a great view of the chicago river, which was beautiful even on a cold winter day.we had the pork roast and chicken, chicken was really good, but pork was a pile of fat and dried gristle..great location, great service, and food.you may ask for him; thierryi&#39;ll be back someday when returning to chicago.as of now, i&#39;ve visited twice for drinks and twice for meals.i got an ipa.(i work across the street!)there soup and sandwich special is to die for! try the pozole! so good! i&#39;ve also had the cuban and roast beef.not terribly attentive or personable.when i made the reservation, i made very clear we needed a table outdoors and we couldn&#39;t wait to be seated.river roast is phenomenal!!!!  my husband and i hosted our wedding reception at river roast last month and it was absolutely perfect.the waiter said creme fresh this and creme fresh that.seriously, the best i&#39;ve ever had.&#34;sitting by the dock of the bay..i&#39;m trying to stop eating out so much.nektar - kill all the golfers mead.the honey for the gobbets was a nice touch and they were super crispy and not greasy at all.have had the peas, steak, and asparagus but those first dishes take the cake!have always had great service and great drinks as well!."
be-leaf-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/be-leaf-chicago-2,1,"Haven&#39;t tried the whole menu, but the bravacado bowl is very fresh and great with chicken!! i tell that it&#39;s a superior choice for healthy options with good sized portions.this is by far the best place to eat in the loop.just had be leaf for the first time and it is quite tastey! while they forgot to add the chicken to my salad and i was still charged for it - i likely will be going back.you can also make your own salad, but we decided to try ones on the menu first.falafelosophy - good4.i just paid $15 for a salad because i added avocado and dates and neither of these ingredients are in my salad.best quick service salad in the loop.got the nom namaste and loved the dressing.the suggested combinations are creative and delicious, but you can make your own or substitute ingredients if you want.i also love that i can make my own salad or wrap and make it exactly what i want!  they even have great chips and sweet treats to bring back to your desk for later!  even better i get to order an extra salad and have dinner all ready for me on a busy work night!  i have also gotten delivery which is awesome for those busy days when you can&#39;t leave your desk! i would and do recommend this place to everyone! they cater too!.it&#39;s also a little on the pricey side.this restaurant is very convenient for me -- it&#39;s across the street from work! it&#39;s a much needed healthy option in a sea of tacos, burritos, and sub sandwiches.i loved the decor! i go there frequently and have never been disappointed.the sugar snap peas are beautiful and taste like they&#39;re out of a garden, and i always add those in..can&#39;t wait to go again!.can be quite pricey if you are adding a bunch to your salad.was really excited to try it..50 for that.i also got a butterscotch cookie and wasn&#39;t a big fan but the salads are fantastic! i&#39;ve literally been craving going back ever since.first time of many to come!i checked out the place because of groupon and was very satisfied.overall: great place to eat a fresh, healthy, responsible lunch in the loop! welcome to the neighborhood and best of luck as you continue to grow!.so i emailed them to let them know of the issue, but have not yet heard back.every salad nowadays has feta (or some type of cheese), cranberries, corn, quinoa, avocado, bacon, etc.a great healthy lunch option in the loop!on days i don&#39;t bring my lunch, i rotate between a few spots close to my work - be leaf is one of my favorites.its obvious that people either work here or they don&#39;t pay for the food.they not only forgot to include the bread on multiple occasions even when i said yes to bread,  they gave me a wrong soup, once my squash the beet salad didn&#39;t have any beets, another time strawberry fields salad had 3 little pieces of strawberry.i love this place and everyone and everything in it.but because it was filling, and delicious, i will definitely be back..i&#39;m pretty sure most the dressings are made in house and they&#39;re all amazing.there are so many other awesome food choices worth their price point in the area.i&#39;ve been waiting for a place like this by my office for a few years now, i&#39;ll definitely be adding this to my lunch rotation!.it wasn&#39;t busy so i was able to get my food super fast., half way around the bowl once vs..best salad ever! shared the nom nomaste and bravocado which were super fresh and delicious.i could tell that something was off (chicken shouldn&#39;t be grey, right?), and after a small bite i could immediately tell the chicken was rancid.i was excited to know they source their produce from local farms, which is important to people like me.great place for someone with dietary restrictions.it was fantastic, but they forgot the chicken (the reason i&#39;m giving them 4 stars, not 5).i had the non-namaste with tofu instead of chicken (i&#39;m vegan) and it was delicious...i needed a break from my go-to lunch at protein bar and came across be leaf..delish! i have only had the cobb salad (twice now) with the bacon dressing-highly recommended! a little pricey for salad however everything is super fresh, they don&#39;t skimp on their ingredients, and it&#39;s a good size bowl.g..coming from manhattan, where salad bars are everywhere and truly missed- i was pumped...i&#39;d try it again.the main reason it went in the trash was the chicken.was excited to check out this restaurant.that scrumptious whole grain bread on the side ;).so happy that be leaf is downtown! a quick lunch spot that&#39;s healthy and has options is scarce in this city! the staff is friendly, ingredients are fresh, space is cozy, prices are reasonable.all the ingredients were so fresh and everyone there was really helpful.stingy portions.i know salad and this place tosses it up right.this place is a little pricey, but i guess that&#39;s what it takes to use locally sourced and fresh ingredients.the only reason i wouldn&#39;t give 5 stars is because it is quite pricey, however sometimes it can be justified for a quality salad."

duck-duck-goat-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/duck-duck-goat-chicago,2,"The only note i picked up was fresh corn..i paid double the prices of what tasted like ordinary asian cuisine.i preferred the duck tongues at the girl in the goat.if having the head and tail on a fish doesn&#39;t put you off, i recommend this.for those of you that have not tried soup dumplings before they are good and you must try them, but for those of you that have had soup dumplings before these are pretty standard.sticky rice was too gooey and salty.the flavors were amazing and everything was served beautifully.they have some unique spins, such as wonton soup with a blueberries (which was tasty in case you were wondering)..the texture of the bun was impeccable.the peking duck is super delicious, and it comes beautifully served on a little tray, with perfectly thin &#34;tortilla&#34; skins.the xiao long boa was delicious, the duck fried rice and goat of the day were ok.duck duck goat served one of the best meals i&#39;ve had in recent memory.we were pretty full after we finished the noodles, but no matter how full i am i always have room for dessert, especially if it&#39;s a variation of pineapple upside cake, which the taiwanese pineapple cake most certainly was, and i must say, this was the best thing i had all night.chinese by category, but i&#39;ve never had anything like some of this stuff..so good.however the peppers they fry in were delicious and i might have liked them more than the actual duck tongue haha.it was smoky, complex, and not too sweet.and there were some really bad dishes.here is what we ordered, not all was pictured:shrimp toast- came in about 5 pieces, was really good and reminded us of a seafood flatbread.pros of eating alone: easier to get a table at popular restaurants because you can just sneak in when the place opens and snag a bar seat.the kitchen is designed like a little hut!worth getting:grilled beef &amp; broccoli - most boring and typical chinese to go dish right? wrong.i ordered the duck fat washed bourbon cocktail (tiger something) which was like a manhattan.honestly no complaints on anything we tried - they were out of the &#39;goat of the day&#39; unfortunately, but otherwise i wish we could have tried more dishes.the soup dumplings were awesome as well.the noodles were okay but the meat on this dish was very good.8/10 would fry this rice again.it was presented beautifully.h.almost had a msg taste to it but i&#39;m not positive.both dishes were successful, modern twists on traditional dishes.finally, another room looked like a more formal dining room with vintage sepia photographs crammed high along the walls and lazy susans on round tables.kind of like a time warp.the chicken chow fun with mushroom-stuffed rice noodles was super greasy and although the noodle was crisp i barely had a bite of mushroom inside it.3.egg waffles - super good! it tastes like the authentic egg waffles i had in hong kong.i&#39;ve never seen that before in eating steamed or fried dumplings which signals they weren&#39;t put together quite right..40% of why i loved this place was the detail in the décor.as this restaurant is part of a larger group with much experience, i expected that reservations would have been honored in a timely manner.stephanie izard is the name of the game.i think they still have a few kinks to work but all in all, a decent experience.it was a little too earthy for me.had to take a late reservation at 10:30, because nothing else was available.we ordered: wood fired duck hearts, char siu bao, beef slap noodles, and duck egg roll.this really didn&#39;t take away from my experience.the joys of chicago.i kept eating, and eating, and eating, and thought to myself, they really packed the dish.the slap noodles had a fantastic mixture of flavors (if only it weren&#39;t so salty!).our server got impatient though and hurried us through the entree so we decided to skip dessert.oh well, guess i&#39;ll stick to the first two goats in my life.the sock city drink was great - can&#39;t remember what was in it - just try it!the shrimp wonton in blueberry soup was absolutely the least favorite of all the dishes.the rice and the meat dish.it&#39;s room a little different."
xocoatl-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/xocoatl-chicago,2,"We ordered all the flavor and ti took a few mins for it to come out.busy main street, but plentiful street parking.the churros are amazing, super warm and soft!! if the review was strictly for the churros then yes 5 stars for sure!!buttt the reason it gets 3 stars is bc i came in on a sunday afternoon and it was super dead.i had their xoco churro (an unfilled churro covered with warm, gooey chocolate), and an abuelita hot chocolate, and both were excellent.a family walks in after and when she finishes filling she turns around and looks past us and takes the other guys order! hello i&#39;ve been standing there 5 min clearly before anyone else.i wish i could give two separate reviews one for the quality of food and the other for the service/upkeep of the place but i cant.they have coffee, milkshakes, ice cream sundaes, mini churros, funnel cakes, you name it.fresh churros, ice cream and hot chocolate served here..:).something she could have done from the beginning, when i ordered and paid.while there i saw a lady getting a couple dozen so keep this place in mind when you&#39;re trying to think of ways to impress your colleagues and don&#39;t want to bring donuts again.press a button out comes a premixed concoction.now that abuelita makes powder packets, it seems that used that instead of the tablet and used water instead of milk.i could just imagine how  dirty the kitchen is too.made as you make your order.the churros are so amazing and you can get different fillings, toppings, and dips.the place is not pristine.it&#39;s so disappointing.they could have decorate the place little bit better to give a classy look.the inside could use a little more pizazz but.nonetheless, xocoatl has great prices and available year round!i&#39;m excited for xocoatl because they have a nice parking area in the back so it makes it very convenient for their customers.mighty tasty churros.periodchocolatecreamjellycafe con leche.the churros are good if eaten right away.i recommend it to anyone one who are fans of churros and funnel cakes!(: p.i will definitely want to go back and try other things on the menu.everyone in our group fell in love and we had to drive 45 minutes to get to this place so believe we had high expectations and they were met.the funnel cake , ice cream, and churros really are amazing! the atmosphere is not great but its not horrible, now the &#34;customer service&#34; leaves a lot to be desired.the place has tables and chairs to sit but does not have a garbage can.still no answer..the manager is very nice kind person but she has the wrong employees.everything was hot and fresh.definitely drop by and give the cream cheese a chance.i never tried their other flavors of ice cream because it looks like it&#39;s been sitting for a while but i do get the vanilla because it&#39;s the most used ice cream there because of the funnel cakes.seems like this place would be great to stop by during the summer.i was expecting cinnamon sticks the thickness of my finger..i bought a dozen to bring to work for mothers day and everyone loved them, even the picky eaters.decided to come here one day and the churros were good but the funnel cake sucked."

(i am a pizza whore) we stopped in on a wednesday evening and did the prix fixe they had.we also tried the burrata cheese which is delicious but didn&#39;t come with enough bread.not bad, but not great for something that won&#39;t fill you up.our waitress told us that each pizza would be a good size for one person but we had a lot of leftovers.i ordered the fig, cheese and apple.not quite the same ambiance, but the crust and the freshness of the mushrooms makes up for it..service was attentive and the restaurant has a nice selection of beer and wine.i ordered the three mushroom pizza and it was delicious.get a ruler!!!!!!!!!!  we were served 2 huge pizzas...i think that they would have been better if they were all white, breast meat, but they were still pretty awesome.we were seated as soon as we arrived.food is consistently good and reasonably priced.the wood fired pizza had cooked the ricotta just enough so that it melted in your mouth.and, of course, the amazing super thin white pizza.it just can&#39;t be appreciated to the full extent in that manner.the bruschette was very flavorful and delicious.i loved everything about this dish.alright..great pizza and great service..i&#39;m a  new yorker and i always thought that we had the best tpie.just a great flavor over all..we tried this place before a visit to the io theater.the kitchen was not fast.i liked the innovative topping combinations and the wood fired crust was thin and crispy.service always superb..only came back at the end to plant a menu down for dessert.service: attentive and timely..okay!).here&#39;s a suggestion: use high gluten (manitoba) flour for a chewy, bread-like texture.while i was eating it i was enjoying it so much that i tuned out the company i was with and was only brought back to real world when one of my friends shook my arm and asked me if i would like to be alone in a dark room with my dessert.live music on wednesday, too!.the food was delicious, the service was spot on, and the price was pretty reasonable.lovin it!i came here on the recommendation of a fellow yelper (thanks mandy!)it was a cold and drizzly night in the big city but a bright inviting sign called to me.perhaps they need better ventilation near the oven?.quality of dishes and exceptional service brings us back often.the pizzas are delicious and the crust is dairy-free.you could go here for a date, after work drinks, or just a place to get a good thin crust pizza.i&#39;ve parked (temporarily) in both lots for free!we like the ingredients and creativity of the pizza and salads from sono.the salad we had was great, the wine list is basic but tasty options.i wouldn&#39;t mind ordering it again to try the next time because the manager was kind enough to remove it off the bill because we didn&#39;t like it and he had recommended it to us.this pizza place is not a pizzeria."

at first, we just thought it was a very cool and uniquely decorated place, but then we got their raspberry-ginger-pear pie (which they make fresh on-site) and now we are customers for life! we have been to all the other pie places in chicago and upstate ny, and this one is by far the best.the coffee here is better than the typical drip.they pie was not too sweet, the crush, refreshing and the ice cream was a great compliment to both..the quiche is pretty great too.i do dig this place!.i&#39;d go back here &#39;cause i&#39;d like to have their key lime hibiscus pie..and jesus christ! the blue cheese biscuit.the place feels like an undiscovered gem - i want to come back while i&#39;m still able to chat with the owners about their recipes! the cola is excellent - wish they bottled it!.i would totally go back if i&#39;m in the area.this place is adorably wonderful in every way...this  place is a very good addition to the neighborhood and people are courteous and likes pleasing their customers.best quiche and homemade english muffin ever.the pie is amazing, best pie in the city, everything she makes is delicious!

my only regret is that i did not get a second slice (my mother and sister devoured half my slice..soft, crumbly, peanut buttery, rich..overall, i would come back for the scones.lovely spot that echoes back to the american diner experience with bar stools at the counter, but with modern touches.the staff was friendly and attentive, even though they had a bit of a line.best advice i can give you.top notch ingredients properly prepared in an old school quality manner.i&#39;ve eaten their scones and various quiche several times now and they are divine! friendly service and good prices.this place has excellent latte and amazing pastries and snacks..good milkshakes.happy one year anniversary spinning j bakery and soda fountain! i love ordering the fresh baked pies at spinning j with the blueberry being my favorite.everything was fantastic!

this place is beyond incredible.it is just apparent that the owners and workers enjoy working at this cafe and feeding great food and drink to the neighborhood.we also got a chocolate chip cookie which is worth the hype.fun little spot to sit and enjoy the soda fountain vibe on a saturday morning.i like both exterior and interior.spinning j&#39;s pies are amazing! i went there with my friends close to 8 pm on a saturday night so most of their pie options were no longer available.the pie started with a really good crust that was still crisp and added the right amount of buttery goodness to the layer of rich chocolate filling that was more the consistency of a really good chocolate truffle than pudding and it was topped with marshmallow that had been toasted.spice, sweetness, temperature.i was in town briefly and had time to stop by.the atmosphere is really to be treasured.best breakfast sandwich ever! the english muffin was delicious! their maple pecan scone was also very tasty, and had a nice glaze on top.i think this is a huge mistake, and the servers should have, at minimum, tried a bite of everything.the chocolate was not too rich, because this is soda and not a thick milkshake..the key lime was my unexpected favorite....it was delicious! i dangerously topped it off with a peanut butter malted milkshake, which added at least five pounds to my waistline and was worth it.also the flaky buttermilk biscuit should be illegal because it put into a food high i still can&#39;t get down from.we had a bit of a wait, but they had an unexpected rush, and managed to make sure we were enjoying our treats.really good pies, as well as homemade ice cream."
rj-grunts-chicago-6,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rj-grunts-chicago-6,2,"Delicious salad bar..they were clean, but for a large footprint for a restaurant, it was way too small, practically a closet! there is one door that leads to this small hallway, which if one person is in the restroom, you have to stand there and wait with possibly one of two other people, don&#39;t dare leave, because you will lose your place in &#34;line&#34;.taking one star off because of the poor taste of food.i was famished so i got a mushroom burger which came with homemade chips.burgers typically come with cottage fries, which are essentially potato chips or you can upgrade for fries for $1 i believe.the fried chips that come along are addicting.not a big fan of the chips at all.after a day of looking at the animals in the zoo i could have eaten a horse!thank goodness the first iteration of melman lettuce empire is nearby.milk shakes definitely will bring boys to the yard cause they were tasty! the burger was spot on.it was actually delicious and hearty, but more like an appetizer size.the interior has all the makings of what might be reminiscent of the 70&#39;s, particularly of many female photos.really good place.it has a cool vibe with lots of good, 70&#39;s music along with signs and pics on the wall.our server was not very helpful in recommending anything without gluten (or anything else for that matter).it seems based in the puctures in the walls that it has been here since before the seventies..he enjoyed the patty in the bacon burger but had to ask for a side of tomatoes (he thought it needed either lettuce or tomato) so i&#39;d like to give them a half star more if i could because it wasn&#39;t awful and i might go back for the salad bar, but it just didn&#39;t add up.the booths are very small and i&#39;m not even a big man.great atmosphere! the staff is excellent very happy and friendly.the salad bar looks amazing but is right by where people are sitting.fresh battered and a ton of them.it was a healthy lunch option with the salad bar as being a visitor of chicago, i felt like i was eating meat every meal..i really hope not, this is a classic that my wife and family love and every once in a while you need a good solid dive to eat at!.some clorox wipes should have come with my meal.we started eating here 25 years ago but haven&#39;t been back since moving to california a number of years ago.the salad bar comes with multiple kinds of lettuce, lots of fresh veggies, pasta salads, tuna &amp; potato salads, fresh (ish) fruit, and then soups (veggie minestroni + the gumbo were both delicious).the brunch is disappointing, not a big selection of items and feels like a cafeteria..they really got their breading down here.you get a lot of food too.we both got the soup and salad bar which is pretty standard fare but i will say that the cream of chicken rice soup was absolutely perfect for a chilly night warm up.great food and wonderful family environment! we had the burgers and they were amazing.marvin gaye, the bee gees&#39;, the beatles and the rest of the 70&#39;s gang.the service was kinda slow but i noticed there weren&#39;t many servers and the food wasn&#39;t too fast either but it was so good we forgot about it.great selection, kid friendly, and decent prices.this was completely unacceptable.burgers are some of the best in the country.apparently the many photos on the walls are those of prior waitresses.the burgers were fantastic - really great flavor and good toppings.music at a good volume, you can talk without shouting, always a plus.the place is small, and tight, and bathrooms are small, and tight..i&#39;ve only been there for lunch so not sure how dinner service is but the lunch service has been good every time even during slightly busier times.gave (3) stars because it&#39;s descent but nothing to rave about.decor is divey-esque, with two sections, a bar and a dining area.i also enjoy their salads there big and always taste fresh.love the soup salad bar.the salad bar featured two soups and a huge assortment of salad bar items.nothing fancy, innovative, upscaled, conceptual here.when i was presented the incredible platter of ribs.there is some vanilla frosting with chocolate chips that is an absolute must.and let&#39;s not forget the music! the 1970s are alive and well, from brother marvin to the eagles with everything in between.untoasted bun.went on a monday afternoon, and the place was packed with families from the lincoln zoo.i got a chocolate peanut butter shake that was to die for..i told her we will be outside of the place.will be back again!.they did have some different greens options at least.this was our first time visiting this restaurant."
charlatan-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/charlatan-chicago,2,"Service by danielle  was awesome, with her suggestions, we had a great dinner.we had an excellent wine from tuscany that was usually $66; i can&#39;t remember the name but it was delicious! it was slightly chilled (as a good red should be).the food here is truly superb.the warm and intimate ambiance at charlatan is a welcome environment on a chilly chicago night! first stop was the bar for a pre-dinner cocktail..the choc munchkins were a little dense and flour-y, but the caramel sauce really made the dish, and yes, we ate it by the plain spoonful!i estimate the dining area seats 60 or so people.the carpaccio was outrageous though, i think i could eat that all day everyday and never get tired of it.i&#39;m sitting here now writing this review, that&#39;s how good this restaurant is! order a bunch of the half orders.three bone in chicken thighs perfectly fried over a great waffle.you won&#39;t be sorry!*recommendations*-grill octopus - best grilled octopus i&#39;ve ever had-pan fried trout-black pepper rigatoni-focaccia.the only thing i&#39;ve eaten at charlatan has been the farro salad.good drink menu as well.his attention to detail and intuition allows you to enjoy all the amenities of five star service in this charming space.sunday night is &#34;steak night&#34; and i&#39;ll definitely be back to try some more of those amazing pasta dishes!  prices a bit above average &amp; don&#39;t dare take a tinder date here-- get dat did!.for mains we ordered meatballs a la carte and the special of the night which was trout.i couldn&#39;t pick a favorite brunch entree if i tried because everything is so high quality and delicious.we had an appetizer which was lightly fried &#34;dumplings&#34; of geese and ham with a green olive purée.amazing cocktails, food, service, and presentation.it&#39;s a great place to take your family for brunch and a perfect date spot in the evening.amazing.but the pig head! it was perfect.5 stars, would give 6 if i could.i was angry i had to share this dish because the it was packed with taste and had me experiencing new flavor combinations i loved.i realize i never reviewed this place- dined here last fall and everything was super.i can&#39;t wait to come back!.we had the octopus, daily pate, daily bolognese (half order, it was a squid ink spaghetti), and the pan fried trout.great dishes all around.great experience all around.all the pastas are perfect, i&#39;ve never gone wrong with any of the food choices here, including their desserts and cocktails - all made unique and to perfection.we&#39;ve gone for drinks several times, but never sat down for dinner- wish we would have sooner! i had the cod while my fiancée had the daily bolognese and a side meatball- both were so delicious! mom got the steak with mushrooms (the mushrooms were amazing) while my fiancées best friend got the elote pasta which she said she liked a lot.i&#39;ve had brunch and dinner here -- both were excellent.all made in house, our choice was the pork belly bucatini (half portion, which is a great offering).the clams chitarra was briny, spicy, and perfectly fresh tasting.exposed brick, nice wooden bar, tables that aren&#39;t so close-set that you feel like you can&#39;t enjoy a nice romantic date.bring your adventurous-eater dining companion and order with no holds barred - they have half size portions of all their homemade pastas, which is helpful.can&#39;t wait to go back!..its definitely cozy for a winter night.this tasted like a $6 costco ready meal you take home and bake.they apparently have a pigs head you can order in the menu.will be scanning menu for romesco from now on.we got halves of a bunch of different pastas, with the wild boar rigatoni and squid ink snail pasta sticking out as the favorites!wine was delicious, as well.this entrée was hearty and meaty with a slight heat to it, but nothing too overwhelming.i hope they stick around.i enjoyed their bottomless mimosas with some friends and we&#39;ll definitely be coming back again soon!.i would give this one a 4 out of 5 because the flavor could have been deeper, but overall very good.swimming on top of a bed of sweat roasted garlic risotto i actually thought i was in heaven.i went to charlatan with a large group of friends.smoked spaghetti carbonara was nicely done with a perfect egg, though it was light on smoke, and the hunk of pork belly accompanying it was mostly unmelted fat--its flavor did not combine with the egg at all.&#34; very good.we ordered a lot of food and shared it family style!  starters including the daily foccacia with the yummy roasted garlic butter and a little on the salty side with the maldon, but still good.).my husband and i enjoyed one of our last date nights before our first baby is due; the food was delicious and the service was excellent.this is the former west town tavern.charlatan is leading the w.awesome night at charlatan with a couple girlfriends..support these folks!.came here with my wife and a friend.we&#39;ve dined at the various restaurants that have occupied this space over many years, so were curious to try charlatan.the atmosphere is super cool and the staff is always on point.serves 3-4.the beer list also looked great, even though i did not get a beer..it&#39;s on the subtle side but it has a good mix of textures and flavors so i really enjoyed it.weird thing is you walk into the bar area.i would definitely come here again!.it&#39;s cute and not over hyped like big name restaurants.then i ordered the cheese plate which very unimpressive especially since it was served with toasted white bread.i&#39;ll definitely be back!..even artsy! love this place, and i love that they know how to make food is so foreign i wouldn&#39;t really know how to cook it myself makes this place so cool.highly recommend the &#34;between the sheets&#34; and the blood orange mimosa.we started with the foccaccia of the day which came w/ 4 flavorful pieces..that being said, we really enjoyed charlatan and hope to get back before our vacation ends.a must eat.the octopus was a close second to the best i&#39;ve ever had in life - missed #1 by a hair.charlatan is a great spot if you are looking for a laid back environment to take a date for a great dining experience."
folklore-argentine-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/folklore-argentine-grill-chicago,1,"I also ordered the corn empanadas which was also excellent.candle light tables and a nice ambiance..we ordered a parrillada para dos and a vacio.my boyfriend had tortia la tortia papa which was some potato thing that was very plain.food: complementary bread that kept coming warm and crispy but soft on the inside, house salads that come before most entrees- with all this you won&#39;t leave hungry for sure! definitely get steak at this restaurant because the meat is very reasonably priced but still of good quality and flavor.the waiter never came by to serve us.very nice ambience, good drinks and great service to top it all off!.try one of the drink specials if you&#39;re in the mood for something fruity.their staff could not have more polite or attentive (making suggestions ,filling waters , checking in).this was a huge portion, but unfortunately it was not what we were hoping it was.the meats and cheeses were cut in thick chunks instead of thin slices.food was good.i accepted paulo&#39;s offer and went to folklore with my boyfriend this saturday.the food is amazing from appetizers to the main course.i enjoyed every bite of my steak and i can&#39;t wait to go back.parking can be a little hard i recommend coming 20 min early as there is only street parking.the empanadas were awesome, the steaks, chicken dishes, all of it was great..the rack of lamb was overseasoned with herbs.in conclusion, i rate this restaurant a 4.editing what they offer and concentrating on a few things would be a start.there are so many options! as a vegetarian, i appreciated that there were a plethora of options for me.i asked for a spicy red, and they brought me a glass that wasn&#39;t even on the menu; it was perfect.super cute space with very unique and cool decor, very filling meal!the candle on the table was nice but it was slightly too small for the holder.my drink and dessert were good.which would have made this a four star place.the staff is friendly, attentive, and accommodating.my husband and i stopped by here as part of the christmas crawl, it was actually our very last stop.i always come here with my girlfriend to get steaks with mashed patatoes, and let me tell you their steaks are amazing! also their salsas are delicious.el filet with spinach mashed in a red wine onion reduction.however, the owners should do some additional training with their service team if they really take the restaurant to the next level..but sometimes you also go to a place for the atmosphere.folklore gives a nice representation of argentine cuisine right here in chicago.def recommend those! i had the &#34;el che&#34; for my entree- one of the specials for the night.they also brought us complimentary salads, which was great!the second time here we carried out our meal.i had one friend say she was driving around for 20 minutes looking for a spot but i think everyone else got lucky.i obviously had to try this place at some point! we finally had one of those nights where there was so much snow and i was thrilled to have found a parking space that was already shoveled out without any pesky dibs chairs in my way.ooo la la! this place is romantic.in a good way!the menu is extensive and everything on it is amazing...it&#39;s great for alcohol newbies as well.i had the costella organica which was one of the chef&#39;s specials.we had the pineapple and pomegranate mojitos-yum! a little heavy on the sugar, but so delish.the large communal tables mixed in with tables for parties of 2-4 and the soft lighting gives folklore a real intimate feel.i have to say both were great but the true standout was the empanada, so much so that i ended up ordering another one and while my boyfriend opted to order the chicken..my first time here, staff is very attentive and engaging.the drinks are good but no draft beer.we came across this place when a place nearby we wanted to go to had an obscenely long wait..service was very good.the restaurant is very dark, but the waiters will light a little candle for you when you are seated, creating a perfect little bubble of privacy away from the three drunk nurses at the adjacent table.i ordered my steak medium, and it was cooked to perfection.i loved the food here!  the taste is like tango sur but not a duplicate of their menu.must try the mango mojito and the empanadas very delicious.decor &amp; ambiance was nice.the servers are very friendly &amp; knowledgeable.the filet was tender.he makes them the best out of everyone in the chicago area.we enjoyed it so much that we have been back several times with other friends who have also loved it! i highly recommend folklore.our server knew the menu well and answered all of our questions.empanadas, lengua, and main dish para dos all were exceptionally delicious!! i had the mango and mojoito, man not only do they taste good but the prep and presentation was fun!! definitely going back!!!.for this review, i post no stars at all.waiters, servers and bar tenders were all nice.(of course, every once in a while you get somebody who is busy..the empanadas were pretty good.we also tried their provoleta, very yummy.complete menu with all the usual staples.the food is excellent for the price."

the midnight cookie!!!how have i not written about scofflaw? great cocktails, tasty food menu, classy seating, with the sidewalk patio, they make their own gin, and most items are under $10 a piece.scofflaw is on the small side, and the doormen are pretty good at running crowd control.did not get a chance to try the food but from what i saw, it looked great.the music, amazing! classic gangsta wrap a la classical instruments, yes please!we tried the fries which were delicious and will be going back for the burger which looks just as delicious..the variety of drinks seem to change, but i had a blueberry ale that was pretty good, i think it was called &#34;dark horse&#34;.love the cookies at midnight and the cocktails are unique and taste great.all the cocktails were around $10.i&#39;m so indecisive.order a pile of fries and a charcuterie plate and literally move in and never leave.the house made tonic was also delicious..awesome bar - delicious drinks, great service, cool setting..i started out with a rum drink.it kind of tasted like it was just covered it whatever grease was still on the stove.i really don&#39;t know what took me so long other than the fact that i was too lazy to make the trek there.the only downside of this place is that it can sometimes be hard to find a seat.i don&#39;t know anywhere else in the city where i can get well-made, strong cocktails like these for only $8.obsessed.again, well thought out with the flavor profiles really working hard to make a very buttery, smooth drinksbottom line: would recommend, would return.so many varieties of gin! a lot of the food plates tend smallish but they pack mighty flavor.their waitstaff is awesome - i love dirty martinis and requested one with their house gin and the waitress actually came back with suggestion that it&#39;s not really a gin for a dirty martini and suggested a different cocktail with it.kicking myself that we even wasted our time checking that place out..gin just brings back unpleasant memories for me haha.call me a pragmatist, but there are just too many places in the city to get good food and cocktails to go to this place and be treat like shit.go to scofflaw.i&#39;ll continue going as it&#39;s usually a bit less busy than other logan square spots since it&#39;s a bit off the beaten path but not at the level of frequency i once did.it&#39;s one of those places that makes me want to move closer so i can be there more often.he happily let us sample their local gin and did not display the usual over the top flair which some cocktail bartenders often do.what can i say that already hasn&#39;t been said.&#34; the double patty with cheese and caramelized onions was a juicy, messy situation that i wasn&#39;t mad about.to the point that during our most recent brunch (we used to go weekly) we decided take a break for a while.&#34; very well, it wasn&#39;t overcooked so i&#39;ll give them that, but for the same kind of burger i can get at small cheval or even fatso&#39;s last stand, i overpaid by at least $5, and i had to scrape off imitation cheese.service has been great to me! the only thing i can think that&#39;s unlikable here is that it&#39;s such a cool place it gets crowded most normal times you might want to pop in and it gets a little weird with people hovering around you (or being the hoverer!) for a good spot, or any spot and it seems like they don&#39;t really keep a system but it&#39;s more walk in (a pro and a con!)with that being said, my best tip is to come during an unconventional time.the best part of our entire visit was the fries.didn&#39;t really order much food as we came here to try and kill some time while waiting for a table at longman and eagle.they were so helpful, thanks guys!

(and so did i) we had the halibut and the salmon and both were just ok.love the atmosphere, music and location as well.when we called, we were refunded for the food that was missing and were specifically told that they would not &#34;re-deliver&#34; the rest of our food.we went there as a big group and ordered a bunch of things and except for the beef (ropa veija) that was a little rubbery according to the hubby every one seemed pretty happy with their dishes.i met up with my bf here after work for some drinks.the rice was flavorful.yum!!! can&#39;t go wrong with cuban food and the mojitos!! so yummy..food was delicious.the yummy coconut rum flan - did not disappoint, either.the booking is super easy and everyone that attended was super impressed with the menu options.we waited a long time to pay and it seemed like there were rotating waiters.it&#39;s consistent, on my drawn out ass timeline..that&#39;s my cue to leave.wow.the place is a bit on the loud side.not a true cuban restaurant.we stuck mainly with mojito pitchers for to keep things easy..the ribs were incredibly flavorful and fall-off-the-bone tender, and the guava-infused bbq sauce was tangy and unusual.not spectacular though.had another amazing time.this was a wonderful experience for all of us."

range-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/range-chicago,2,"I wanted to leave before even sitting down.a friend of mine had her wedding shower here and it was wonderful! the small intimate room they have in the back was closed off to give us the privacy we need but also a big enough space where we didn&#39;t feel enclosed.service was good, the hostess was very friendly and accomodating on a busy friday night.menu is forgettable and all the food was good but nothing special.their creative flavour combinations and fresh, local ingredients make for outstanding meals.hit the spot!..i would definitely go back to range but i&#39;m not sure i could bring myself to order anything besides the turkey sandwich because it was that good!.i swear i had to eat it like a sloppy joe..polenta fries w/ spicy mayo - i&#39;ve had better.well range is a nice restaurant, with welcoming and modern decoration idealy placed next to the lincolm park..we sat there for a long time and even though it was crowded the server was friendly with refills etc.be back for dinner shortly!.how do you screw up a burger?! two other friends had the portobello mushroom and were sorely disappointed.buffalo cauliflower will change your life.almost don&#39;t want to post a review because i don&#39;t want this place to get busier! feels like my little secret -- sunday brunch without a wait, totally delicious.i ordered the chilaquiles (which is gf) and it was incredible! such a different style concept of brunch than normal.this place consistently has delicious food and a great selection of local booze for cocktails.menu changes with the season and inputs are locally sourced.i love the decor with the farm vibe and i appreciate that the food is organic.i look forward to my next stop at range.we decided to order the pork doughnuts (5) and buffalo butter cauliflower (5) from the bar food menu to start.my friend that was with me was pretty horrified too.today&#39;s dinner was most enjoyable and my waitress, elise, was friendly and knowledgeable.the toast is thickly cut, perfectly crispy and flaky on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside.it just seemed like such a small portion for $9 and there was barely any flavor.gluten free options at brunch allow for some fun with pancakes and granola+kefir (in addition to the &#34;savories&#34;).when we finally got them, they were just okay.if range wishes to establish itself as an upscale, sustainable spot for the neighborhood, then they better hire wait staff that know what is available on the menu.wonderful company helped, i&#39;m sure, but very nice place.i opened it up to actually see if there was any inside and found two small pieces.both were outstanding.brunch was delish.notable dishes: pumpkin pancakes (with little pieces of sweet potato!), the portobello benedict and the winter squash benedictoh and the atmosphere is excellent--really cool fixtures, a well-planned floor-plan and everything from the bathroom tiles to the booths for 2 are carefully considered.we were able to use the private room which was set up for mingling.here are a few suggestions:1..including tax and tip.i walked into range on a whim for dinner.range has an unusual menu, and it&#39;s often changing...great ambiance.the decor is adorable very farm to table esque  - great lighting , flowers- we all ordered kale salads and were in heaven! get the kale salad with chicken- so great.the quality of the food is fantastic, and i love the range (pun intended) of menu options--they go beyond your standard omelet or chilaquiles.it&#39;s usually not a great sign when you&#39;re able to get a last minute reservation on friday night for a party of 6, but we were pleasantly surprised!the menu was a little strange, but everyone was able to find something they enjoyed.i was a bit surprised they were not busy when all the other restaurants in the area were, but our experience was great.my boyfriend and i came here for brunch on a saturday around 10:30am.crispy chicken and thyme biscuit: excellent! there were plenty of incredible dishes on the menu, but the neighboring table&#39;s crispy chicken aroma lured us in the same direction.this place was excellent.what more could you ask?.finally their waitress arrived with absolutely no acknowledgment of the delay.the  1/2 chicken immediately stuck out to me on the menu, mostly because of the things it came with.great food and drinks! &nbsp;love the ambiance.a: bsolutely try the watermelon flatbread if it&#39;s still on the menu!  i was pleasantly surprised.and oh the food! so creative, and gorgeously plated! all this for a really modest bill.i can&#39;t get enough of this place!! the menu also changes seasonly so there&#39;s always something new to try.we go for brunch mostly and it is not crowded.the fries were amazing, easily the best part of the meal.wow..i had to go with the chicken sandwich; the carrot/brussel sprout slaw was an excellent addition, and the fries were hot and seasoned well.the start of the meal was rosemary lemonade, and black ice tea which was so tasty.service was friendly, too.interesting decor.plenty of healthy options.what you should not pass up is the ketchup.i went during the middle of the week where there were only two other tables occupied, but the waiter barely came over to acknowledge us."
bavettes-bar-and-boeuf-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bavettes-bar-and-boeuf-chicago,1,"The highlight of our entree, however, were the brussels sprouts and the creamed spinach.i chose the bernaise sauce, and i still have dreams about it.the seafood was on point, the steak was tender and delicious and the sides had wonderful flavor.the biggest table seats 7 and the service and menu are 5+ stars.our server was very charming and helpful, and he enhanced our experience - including recommending our table to receive a glass of wine after we shared a glass with another table (their policy is to share a glass of any wine you bring instead of charging a corkage fee).that was the first indication of attention to detail that separates in a good restaurant from a great one (in my opinion).the decor was old-school steakhouse stepped up several notches with chandeliers, dim lighting, and cozy but lavish furnishing.i&#39;ve tried to replicate it at home from a recipe i saw on serious eats, and it&#39;s definitely close, but the restaurant&#39;s still can&#39;t be beat!for main dishes, i&#39;ve tried the steaks, meatloaf, and fried chicken with gravy, and the chicken in particular is phenomenal.the ambiance of the place is great for special occasions.and the cocktails.five star experience for sure!.be smart and make reservations way ahead of time.what a great steakhouse we found while visiting chicago.i&#39;d skip the dessert and go to the bar and sample some of their cordials.i don&#39;t think you can find anywhere in the city that has fried chicken that is as crunchy and juicy as bavette&#39;s.my boyfriend took me here for my birthday and it was absolutely fantastic.wow, what a beautiful spacious restaurant with some prohibition era style and a bit of woody allen feel.there&#39;s one catch though.note to self: come back here again, but don&#39;t come drunk, you&#39;ll enjoy your steak 1000 times so much more.)  the mac and cheese was super delicious and the bacon just adds another element to it.their &#39;dry aged&#39; bone in ny strip steak is a laughable joke.i think it&#39;s a better experience going with a larger group so you can order more appetizers and sides to share (and you can try each other&#39;s entrees).it was a nice dish for someone who likes that sort of thing.the shrimp were perfectly cooked and i could&#39;ve gone swimming in the garlic sauce..maybe one of the best meals i have had in chicago.we didn&#39;t make a reservation, so we had to eat at the down stairs bar.i wouldn&#39;t hesitate to eat here again, oh and of course the service was top notch and what you would expect from such a classy joint.the room is so romantic with low lights &amp; candles, and a nice bar.to start, we had the king crab platter (worth the $$), and the mixed greens and apple salad.will be back.sublime!.the salad was just great as well.i don&#39;t know where that glass went--to another diner, or maybe into his own mouth--but i was so astonished that he would take a huge glass of our wine without even asking about its significance, i could barely order.overall a 4/5 experience! i would definitely love to come back to try the chicken everyone keeps raving about.the steaks are great and so are all the sides.we had the bone in ribeye, petite filet, smashed potatoes (omg!), brussel sprouts, and shrimp cocktail to eat.possibly the best meal of my life and an awesome atmosphere to go with it.they were delicious.chic/speakeasy-looking decor with sexy food.what more could i add to the yelp review page of a place that is clearly one of the best of its kind?let&#39;s start with the vibe- there is a line to get in at 5pm on a tuesday which means it must be good.i arrived early and had a dark and stormy at the bar while i waited for my +1.it seemed likely that our waiter just made a bad call and the manager was trying to stand by him, but doesn&#39;t make up for the fact that we were all wildly offended and weren&#39;t able to enjoy our time there.they were outstanding.delicious food and drinks, fantastic atmosphere and superb service.ambiance:  trendy, swanky and unique steakhouse vibe.they give you seasoning and a butter concoction on the side, but they are incredibly tasty without.very classy old school feel to this restaurant and bar.overall great experience!.we are called for our seats, i&#39;m so excited!we&#39;re handed our menus, and it&#39;s at this moment i realize something is very wrong.as for me, a genuine meat lover to the core, i chose to split the dry aged bone-in ribeye with my friend, medium rare, and oh so succulent! what came out was jesus himself on a sizzling hot plate whispering, &#34;eat me, eat me&#34;..our server was attentive and friendly, and provided a great experience.based on reviews, we knew we were definitely ordering a steak.the luscious terrine appeared like two thick slabs of ham but it&#39;s much more glamorous than that.the walk-in wait is usually not too bad though, ranging from 30 - 45 min usually and the time flies if you have good company and a cocktail in hand.everything about our experience at bavette&#39;s was both memorable and enjoyable.for something so basic, the meatloaf was absolutely delicious.outstanding service with even better food.i will argue the best steak house and service.we arrived a couple minutes early and were seated almost promptly.i can&#39;t even remember the drinks we got, but all the cocktails we got were so delicious and refreshing.also worth noting: restaurant remained full at all times without ever being too loud.need a wine for your beef? they have a chateauneuf du pape on the menu!.it melted in my mouth and the seasoning was spot on.all amazing and flavorful.we had to wait about a half hour to be seated so we headed to the bar downstairs for a couple of cocktails to ease the waiting time.you walk in and it&#39;s like a time warp.the atmosphere is great, perhaps the restaurant is a little dark but has a very nice vibe.she pointed out that a filet should not have inedible gristle/fat running through it..&#34; as we walked in, a table of 3 just cleared from the bar and we got super lucky with a table in the back.way overdue with this review, but i shared my experience in a post on fb in response to an article about &#34;shameful bartending: how hubris &amp; arrogance is replacing hospitality&#34;drdrinksapothecary.no reason it should&#39;ve ever taken this long and they weren&#39;t even slam packed busy.service was great but the food was below average.the service was great, the server&#39;s suggestions were very helpful..filet, mac and cheese and brussels sprouts.) thanks to the good lord, a spot opened up @ 8pm on a saturday night."
kai-zan-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kai-zan-chicago,1,"We tried the omakase menu which consisted of 10 chef selected courses.i enjoyed the green monster, but compared to the other rolls, it was my least favorite; the texture was too soft.then a torrential downpour hit and getting home from work was impossible, let alone to dinner.the staff was friendly, albeit a bit awkward, but it played into what felt like an artsy and creative atmosphere which matched the cuisine.i could have gone without the friend chicken dish we got.i want to personally thank the chefs and staff at kai zan for making our experience last night a singular, exalted journey.everything was fantastic, and service was super friendly..the private booths are fantastic.overall, kai zan was a remarkable dining experience from great service, delicious food and affordable prices..stopped in on a friday night and did the premium omakase.we originally couldn&#39;t get seated by the sushi bar but two spots opened up and our waiter very attentively informed us and reseated us..we had the pleasure of sitting directly in front of the twin (yup!) chefs and watch them hone their craft.had a incredible dinner here with friends.they are the reason i&#39;m giving kai zan 4 stars instead of 5.i have always done the omakase which is unbelievably creative, fresh, and delicious.hands down the greatest sushi i have ever had.considering its quality, kai zan is worthy to visit every time you want fresh japanese sushi.we made reservations about 3-4 days before because they apparently become booked really quickly..)my mother is japanese, so i can be a harsh critic..best sushi experience i&#39;ve had.it changed my life.i don&#39;t remember what we ordered, but every single dish that came out was outstanding.the ambiance is trendy and intimate, great for a dinner date or special occassion.diy sushi ftw!hamachi collar: omfg this was melt in your mouth food porn awesomeness! the meat was so tender and buttery and paired well with the ponzu sauce that came on the side.i am an avid sushi lover and this place met and surpassed my expectations....not the case here at kai zan.the last time we were in there a bottle of nice white wine was only $21.the tata is $28 but it&#39;s totally worthy.lightly grilled tuna with fried polenta and seaweed - the different textures and contrast of hot/cold complimented each other very well.thank you for doing such an excellent job in combining all the flavors and yet without having to resort to sweetness, something many restaurants overdo unnecessarily before dessert course.best japanese restaurant i&#39;ve been to to date.however, i understand that for a table of 2 they have a 90 minute policy to turn tables over.the fiesta maki and dynamite mussels taste average (nothing special about them).omakase!.the only courses i would not rave about were the roll and the sashimi plate.priced at $60/person, not only was it worth every penny but also a steal if you ask me.like seriously, i&#39;ve been missing out!!! i could write a book on how amazing it is, but please listen to the masses and come here pronto!let me say that they have converted me to an uni lover.the ambiance is pretty perfect for date nights the service is top notch only had bad service one time.perhaps kai zan tried a little too hard to be different that it sacrificed the dining experience for the sake uniqueness.the maguro pearls were delicious..as much of a turn off the time limit is when you make the reservations, i did not feel at all pressured during the service.the personal is also beyond knowledgable and nice.i haven&#39;t sat in the booths before now and i really enjoyed it, cozy and cute.the booths near the sushi bar are private in a way since the walls are very high.i was worried that it wasn&#39;t going to be filling enough and it ended up being plenty of food...color, shape, composition all are awesome.every flavor here at kai zan is really marked by balance that makes this one of the best meals i&#39;ve had in a very long time.of course with something like this there were things i loved, and others i could have lived with out.escolar pearlsuni toro tartareangry crabtempura madaichar siu kushimadai carpaccioblue fin martinifiesta rollspecial of the day (don&#39;t remember)and for dessert - sweet potato mochi..this made it for one non enjoyable experience.best sushi in chicago.hence the fiesta maki i got that day was also not very good.definitely worth it though.we literally left dinner and the next day booked our next dinner here.reservations are a must as the place is very small - but if you have to wait there is a cute store next door with great little gifts.our server was great.ordered couple pieces of salmon nigiri which were amazing (have to order couple more pieces to take home for snack later).they source their waygu from japan and it was cooked perfectly.he had no opinion on any of the dishes, made us feel stupid for not knowing the portion sizes, and made no efforts to make first time visitors feel welcome.some heat, nothing really over the top.the food speaks for itself.6) char siu/beef tataki: surprisingly, this meat dish was light because of the addition of yuzu.overall food was great.it was the only thing that night that didn&#39;t knock our socks off.yeah it has a bit of a hefty price tag of $60, but it&#39;s well worth it.you wouldn&#39;t expect it from its location but kai zan is such a gold mine!i took my girlfriend for a celebration dinner and was not disappointed.at kai zan one has the option of a la carte, a ten course chef&#39;s choice omakase ($60 per/person) that involves a progression of items from the a la carte menu (dessert is optional and additional) or a premium omakase (price varies, was $130 the night we dined - this involves a sequence of courses generally not on the a la carte menu and it is recommended to be requested in advance due to limited availability).thank you kai zan for making me leave a piece of my heart in chicago.their fiesta roll of sushi  ($10 six piece) was delicious, and the usage of chili oil negated the need for wasabi.the escolar was a bit icy within the fish.food is outstanding!.kai zan is a special place that makes me happy i live in chicago.the fish was just so delish)- uni and scallop shooter with ponzu and quail egg (not my fav, but my bf liked it)- angry crab and grilled scallop (unique takes on some common fish)- misc hot foods such as shrimp, char siu, takoyaki (least favorite course, but it was nice to try the hot foods they offer here)- dynamite mussel with black tobiko and negi mayo (small course, but yum!)- fiesta maki (can&#39;t go wrong with sushi rolls esp if fish is as good as this)- sashimi comes with yellowtail, tuna, escolar, salmon (soft and buttery yassssss)we also had to get the uni toro tartare for $28 because it looked amazing.! the green tea ice cream had an extremely strong green tea flavor which i loved.i have yet to find out why i am being charged another 90 dollars."
ge-pa-de-caffe-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ge-pa-de-caffe-chicago-3,2,"It was so tasty! definitely recommend checking this place out; especially if you are visiting grant park or the art institute of chicago that day!...the owner is super friendly and cares about all his customers..i knew italians love their soccer, so hubby and i came over for some coffee, food, and stayed for the game.where else can you get something that tastes great and is more than affordable?staff is personable, fun, and friendly.i also had dessert (again, i ordered before i knew how much food i&#39;d actually be receiving!).nice little cafe just a few blocks from the river for a quick bite.but i can&#39;t do this here.he had his staff bring out glasses of water for us.try the popcorn one because it&#39;s so crazy, my favorite is the almond and coconut.great food, awesome italian owner..we stopped by after our time at the art institute.they could of used another slice of ham to make it a little meatier.i haven&#39;t had their pizza but it always smells delicious.pizza is so delicious, although i originally wanted a panini but they were out of prosciutto (sad), i didn&#39;t regret the decision of switching to pizza!the gelato is good too, not so sweet but with creamy texture that melts in your mouth (pistachio flavor was sold out, another sad story, so i got hazelnut).awesome little hidden authentic italian gem! stop in for a delicious cappuccino, panini made fresh or homemade gelato, made by the owner himself..it was so good that we went back the next day for lunch and more gelato.i&#39;m going to have to go for the gelato next time!.sometimes it really is the little things that make the difference.i ordered a chicken salad sub.reasonable prices, excellent service, generous samples..they are that deliciousbonus:walking distance from the art institute and millennium park.my drink arrived on a cute board with a napkin and little cookie.people drop in before, during and after work.it was a little more casual and sandwich shop than i expected but the food was very good.all the other coffee shops that i&#39;ve tried in chicago weren&#39;t as good.i are my gelato, no espresso..loved it.the taste and freshness lives up to the beautiful presentation.love this place! they have real coffee, not that toxic, weak coffee they have at starbucks or dunkin.owner was there and made the whole experience.delicious nutella latte and gelato! great area for a snack rest before or after visiting the art institute :) we loved the pistachio gelato the best and had to get a pistachio vainly to go with it.the only improvement i can suggest is that the employees be a tad bit friendlier and keep their personal conversations in the back room and not behind the counter.went for breakfast and they were out of many items on the menu.the food and price is outstanding!.update: while we were eating a pizza and a panini, one of the proprietors brought us cookies as a gift dessert.unlike cafes and coffeehouses where coffee prices are based on the size of the drink, gpdc&#39;s price structure depends on whether you order the drink for here or to go (takeout/carry-out).gelato was also good!.i got the breakfast bagel and the ham was thinly sliced and so good with the egg and cheese..the nutella latte was sublime, and i was sad i only got two gulps of it before my partner finished the rest.she thought that the bagel must have been microwaved to warm it up since it was a bit soggy.i had the margherita pizza, and it was more than enough for me and tasted great.make this your number one desert stop in chicago!.i would definitely visit this place again if i ever return to chicago.then they scoop large scoops into glass bowls with a smile and are always happy to proudly tell you about the caffe.a wonderful surprise.the food is good, the service is fast, and the price is reasonable.the menu has a variety of things, and the food is high quality, breakfast and lunch.lovely little place : inside and out at the little cafe.first, i went here for lunch because i forgot to bring mine to work..after my last visit (see picture), domenico humbly messaged me, volunteering to refund the money i spent on a sub-par sandwich..like other reviewers have stated, it does cost a bit more to get it to go, but it&#39;s worth the money if you&#39;re in a hurry.even the milk came with these two cute cookies! i would totally recommend this place if you are looking for a fast and good snack or breakfast!.the gelato was very fresh and some of the most authentic tasting i&#39;ve had.opened up my to go box and no pasta.wrong!) i ended up getting the almond banana and pistachio ricotta when it was ready.bananas foster: gahhhh.but if you really want to be humbled, stop by for lunch when eggplant is on special.its a small place, but its cheap and quick and perfect for a small treat..comcoupon we bought.very reasonable prices for the loop.great service! we were there for having breakfast, and we were really satisfied.i really liked the place as it was not as crowded as starbucks and they served me with an amazing experience of great coffee.i took the chicken presto sandwich which was rather tasteless and unremarkable.we wanted to try the gelato but on the monday we visited there wasn&#39;t a lot of flavors available, it looked empty and sad.2 words: homemade gelato, and the best in the city it is.later on, the chief came and asked if everything was ok and he explained how they cooked the mushroom! loved how friendly and professional they are."

because i&#39;ve never been to a place that is as good as fat rice.this place is the only one in chicago that specializes in macau cuisine - which is like a fusion of malaysian/chinese with european influences.once we did, they told us our decision was improper and not fitting the culinary experience they seek to foster.we sat at the bar, great service, attentive, friendly.we have no idea how they made chicken creamy but man! to drink i had the royale (another special - not on normal menu) to drink and was great.we are asked if we have a reservation, no we didn&#39;t, they are all booked for the next week solid, i couldn&#39;t get a reservation if i tried..the bites were even impressive; go for charlie&#39;s peanuts (so much in a little legume!), sambal eggplant, and anything pickled.i stood around for like an entirnity (was really only like 5 minutes) until waitress sat me.first, it&#39;s a shared dish.i asked her if they could spare me an egg tart since i came all the way from la, and this was literally my first meal in chicago.i&#39;ve had a lot of experimental cuisine, and i always enjoyed them provided that they actually taste good..don&#39;t be like me and miss out the chance of getting the ube coconut bun.they were stuffed ever so lightly with black beans.portuguese chicken is my favorite! it&#39;s a curry type of dish with lots of ingredients in it! the chicken is really tender and the tea eggs are amazing! you should order it with their coconut rice, which is a good combination with the coconut milk based curry.went not knowing what to expect.she asked for a name and when i told her she was insistent that person was not there.we had an array of dishes and loved them all..i can&#39;t really taste the duck since it&#39;s shredded."
podhalanka-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/podhalanka-chicago,2,"Can&#39;t wait to come back next time we&#39;re through town!.pretty standard polish food and drink.never had anything here that wasn&#39;t fresh, homemade and tasty.we spent 50 dollars on a two person meal, which we ate 1/3 of.the restaurant is a bit like walking into your grandma&#39;s house so don&#39;t expect a+ decor..it was our first time here and i definitely should of read the other reviews before coming here and not just looking at the star rating.we responded that we were familiar with the menu items, but were still undecided.whoa.i couldn&#39;t wait)  i am still dreaming about that sandwich today.i asked what soups they had and he rattled them off - cabbage, barley with mushrooms, tomato, etc.we looked at the menu and i wasnt really sure what to order..slow service, but amazing, authentic food.we had the cabbage soup which thick and flavorful but there was beef barley and something else too and we had the roast beef which is your usual normal roast beef.homemade polish food, great service, and feels like being back at my grandparent&#39;s house, especially with the decor.no need to pay extra for side salads in other establishments.but the food is so good, the service is so friendly, and the food is so freakin&#39; cheap that you have to find your way into this polish hole in the wall asap..the food is the real deal.food is plain and bad quality ingredients.i felt so comfortable here, it feels like my grandma&#39;s kitchen.it was a superior imitation of itself!even an old polish man sitting at the bar, not eating, seemingly drunk but they don&#39;t have alcohol.cheap faux flowers in a vase placed on a gaudy table setting.and the restaurant has a warm and comforting feel.i don&#39;t think it has been remodeled since the 1970&#39;s, but that just adds to the great experience.push open the wooden door and enter a world of oil-cloth covered tables, stacked soda cans, and too bright lighting.he will try and hustle you into bringing what he feels like bring you.while visiting chicago we stopped here for lunch today and the owner was very welcoming and suggested a whole spread of traditional food that we try.we should have seen it coming.he took away our menus, and the next thing we knew plate after plate of traditional dishes were set in front of us.we didn&#39;t end up taking him up on his &#34;deal&#34; but the food was really delicious..beats the hell out of any chain restaurant you could name.the waiter asked us how hungry we were and then ordered for us.everything tasted perfect!.as soon as the bf and i walked in, we were greeted by a sweet woman who is basically the empitome of what i&#39;d imagine a polish grandmother to be.it isn&#39;t pretty.never noticed this place before but glad i finally checked it out.one member of our group sat down and immediately said &#34;this smells like my grandmother&#39;s kitchen&#34;.served w a generous portion of delicious rye bread &amp; butter.i just felt like home.this small restaurant serves homestyle polish food (pierogis, blintzes, latkes, soups), at very reasonable prices, and with great service.the potato pancakes are crispy thick and i have to admit much better than babcia&#39;s.overall, if you&#39;re craving basic eastern european food, it&#39;s worth a try..yes, greg is a salesman, but we wanted the experience.after class sitting at the bar mleczny eating a soup.wow, from the reviews it seems like everyone has the same experience!this was just what i was needing on a snowy chicago evening!the owner offered a sample of the most popular dishes, and we were pretty excited for a &#34;sit back and enjoy the ride&#34; sort of night.i love to try multiple things when i&#39;m at a new restaurant, but this menu did not allow that without ordering multiple dishes.the sole guest gave status reports to put me at ease.in contrast to our earlier slow and distant treatment, the retirement-age waitress quickly brought out plates, a basket of bread, my soup, and my salad.the food was also authentic and delicious.great food and a very clean and friendly place.yum!totally worth it, we waddled out of the restaurant fat, happy, and ready to explore the rest of wicker park.&#34;  fortunately we had enough cash to pay the meal (barely).what just happened here??? we flatly refused the extra food, and though the man said it&#39;s not a problem and allowed us to pay for just the soups and juice, i&#39;m afraid i may not come back here again after that horrible experience.we never got the chance to order something else because we apparently lingered too late.just remember to understand polish food is heavy.the mashed potato was somewhat lumpy, but i liked it.out of everything we were brought - and we were brought a ton, way too much to finish - my favorites were the blintzes and the white bean sausage soup.i went with a friend on a sunday afternoon, the place was empty as there were only three diners in the time we were there.if i were being knit picky, the one complaint would be that they are understaffed.went here and had the cabbage soup, cucumber salad, cheese blitzes, cheese and potato pierogi, and potato pancake.don&#39;t think i&#39;ll go back because we were cheated.i will be coming back!.i had the best polish meal ever at this nice hole in the wall place.we got tricked into getting a lot more food then we needed with a lot of leftovers we ended up throwing out."

had the bread pudding french toast + basic eggs &amp; bacon! it was all magnificent!!! will go again! only wish they had a bigger place for more tables.they somehow cut the steak with the grain on two separate orders.service was on-point: coffee/water was promptly refilled, waitress was highly knowledgeable of the intricacies of the menu, and appropriate condiments were delivered to the table before even asking for them.i had the french omelette which was just big enough to satisfy without putting me in a food coma..really great breakfast experience.i had the pajun pancake and she had the chilaquiles, we were both very satisfied.this place has very good food and good service.love trying new breakfast places and are we glad we did.total miss.the waitress was very nice.the restaurant is very nice, the wait staff was good.she had an &#34;i don&#39;t feel like working&#34; sort of attitude..everything looked delicious!.kudos to them for getting what seemed like 40 people seated withing our 20 min wait.for a local spot, came here because the menu looked interesting.the severs are all friendly and the atmosphere is very positive!

the food is so delicious and beautifully presented.i ate the whole thing, and, no lie, i had no appetite until the evening, when i had an apple.rarely a wait to be seated.food is fresh and delicious.their food is pretty good.the table was located too close to the doorway.as fellow yelper tricia d noted in 5 words: not as good as expected.excellent brunch, ample menu, great service and ambience.&#39;s review that it was beautifully presented, but the meat was chewy.well i&#39;ve come back to this breakfast place craving for their out-of-this-world bread pudding french toast! this is the best thing you can get here.but if you are able to go during the week, there is little to no wait.amazing!!it was packed and we still got our food at a pretty good time and we never felt rushed or anything.also, i parked right there on the street with no problem and didn&#39;t have to pay the meter!

i ate the guava pancakes (a special), and they were delicious but not overly sweet! great service too.my omelette was good but they were kind of skimpy on the ingredients.this place is super kid friendly because we have 3 little ones and it was no problem with them.the wait was relatively quick but i did see some people lingering, so i suspect as the morning gets later, the waits go up.once i finished the meal i had to compliment the cook (truly more like a chef) for creating such an amazing dish.so delicious! wanted a unique and innovative meal and i was not disappointed.in fact, i don&#39;t know how it&#39;s not that well-known! for me, it&#39;s better than ihop! definitely coming back here!.either tell your customers you do not serve basted eggs anymore or hire a cook that can baste an egg."

(homemade tortillas) this little hole in the wall impressed my taste buds..the service was great! the place is small but i will never come here again.and i found them! lots of variety of meats, three sauces that are great! hand made tortilla spectacular! love this place!.a normal person would have enough with 3 tortillas, they must know me, cause i get 5 with my plate, and they asked if i wanted more!!! (no extra charge, there are some places that charge u for as few as 3 extra home made tortillas).we were greeted by chips and a cup of beans, as well as a few mild and spicy salsas.the pollo and al pastor taco fillings were very delicious, however the tortilla was the clear star of the tacos..this place is plain delicious! it&#39;s small but definitely an authentic mexican spot."
the-cotton-duck-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cotton-duck-chicago,1,"The menu changes every few months in accordance with the art hanging in their gallery, which is yet another fun and unique quality of this tucked-away uk village gem.service was leisurely, actually it was pretty slow..i must say it met all expectations and everything we had was delicious..all the dishes were amazing..our husbands actually went out afterwards for ramen as they were still starving after our 3 course dinner.this was very disappointing for such a highly rated restaurant.byob awesome neighborhood, too bad patio was not open yet!.despite that, we loved the cotton duck and plan to bring more friends soon..the inside dining space is nicely appointed and the art (rotated every 3 months with a corresponding menu rotation) is a cool touch.really unique dish.we went for sunday brunch and everything that i put in my mouth was amazing..will definitely come back next summer for the new menu and to enjoy the patio.if i had to make one criticism it would be that service was slightly slow, but we were enjoying relaxing and chatting so it wasn&#39;t a worry.excellent portion size.quickly becoming one of my favorite places in the city.could not finish- lamb shoulder saffron fusili, english peas, anchovy butter - this is a pasta dish with some lamb - decent but somewhat underwhelming vs..particularly impressed by the chicken liver, duck ragu and short rib crespelle - although almost all dishes massaged the palette in just the right way.they have a small kitchen, so food does take a little longer than usual.went here for date night with the mrs and we had a phenomenal experience.we&#39;re usually one of those couples that despises going to the a place we&#39;ve already been for a nice meal, as we thrive on the new and exciting, but this one will certainly keep us coming back (gotta try the next menu in 3 months!).he explained the menu and how it integrates with the artwork, both of which change from time to time.the service was impeccable and food was super delicious.eclectic selection of food.the macaroni and cheese with oxtail was delicious!.i&#39;d also suggest looking at their menu before they go - it&#39;s a byob, so it&#39;s a good idea to figure out what you want to drink based on what they&#39;re serving.hidden gem, won&#39;t stay hidden for long.i had a very good brunch here! unique tastes and cool decor.even on a friday night, it was rather quiet.the gallery this week is very nautical, and they did a great job of creating a menu to accompany the theme.we ordered 4 plates and all were very good.great place and delicious food.i appreciate a good thing when i see it!a vote of thanks to the chef for the exquisite dishes!.which wasn&#39;t even good.we were definitely full by the end.the space was cool with the art and loft-like feel.overall, the restaurant has good food at reasonable prices for what is being served.we brought our own wine and vodka (it was byob) and the bar tender was able to mix us a few drinks.everything was outstanding! the duck scrapple and bevette are my favorite! will definitely go back for special occasion! i would say the average price for each person is from $40-$50 at least.bonus is that it&#39;s byob so you can have a wonderful meal and a bargain check.this restaurant/art gallery pays attention to details; from the design of the dishes to preparing ahead for your arrival, they set the stage for a memorable night.i had the aged burger and it was amazing..while the concept was intriguing and the food and service were solid, the art itself didn&#39;t add that much to make the experience unique.get your act together cotton duck!  get a cat or two! it&#39;s not like your guests can&#39;t see the rats! three tables asked to be re-seated.ordered duck scrapple and sunchokes with whil boar sausages for starter and that thing was like orgasm of the mouth.i really enjoyed this place decor was really calming and food was on point.enjoy!.it&#39;s always a delicious blend of my favorite comfort ingredients with a touch of fine dining all wrapped up at your neighborhood dinner spot..could have easily ordered another round of either..cecelia was very friendly and took time to have a decent phone conversation..the customer service is also great!.walking past the colorful mural outside, through the courtyard, and into the gallery/restaurant gives an initial feeling of stumbling upon a hidden gem.my only complaint was that our busser basically grunted at us and the server seemed like it was his 1st day.vegetarian options could be a bit more expansive.food and ambience were fantastic!  it wasn&#39;t very crowded for a friday night which i enjoy but hope they have enough patrons to keep this place in business.the roasted beets are amazing, do not even hesitate to order it a sweet, salty, crispy, smooth dish that will make you wish you just ordered beets for appetizer, main, and dessert.what a wonderful restaurant that checks all the boxes:  delicious and interesting food, friendly and attentive staff, amazing room.the best dining experience i&#39;ve had in chicago in ages and as a hosp pro i have super high expectations.aaron made amazing suggestions and made us all feel so comfortable and happy to be ringing in the new year there.we did not get the chance to eat outside, but, if the weather is great, they have a great outdoor eating space.you&#39;d be surprised.plus there&#39;s a cork fee.beyond fantastic!! decanter for byob wine, simple elegance in the décor, exceptional service and phenomenal food (esp.the staff was warm and pleasant..we cannot wait to go back for brunch or dinner.kudos.this resulted in us playing musical chairs and i&#39;m sure irritating the crap out of the staff."
fat-willys-rib-shack-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fat-willys-rib-shack-chicago,2,"Honestly one of the best meals of my life.the baguette did not seem to have much of a crispy outer layer and the brisket did not pack much flavor at all...i&#39;ve eaten here a few times over the years, and the bbq has been disappointing overall.with the meats i expected smoke heaven.4 stars for the food 1 star for the service.service was great but the food isn&#39;t anything i would ever come back and spend that kind of money on...also, apparently the bbq is amazing from what i&#39;ve been told by people we take there.best comfort food to date.just, holy crap.i liked them both but, i have to say, the onion rings were some of the best i&#39;ve ever had.i have been here twice so i figured i should write a review!if you love bbq you will love this place! both times i ordered the baby back ribs, mac&amp;cheese and sweet potato fries.my sister lives down the block from here and we finally tried it, it was great!the service was good, very friendly and super helpful when ordering food.my husband and i typically get the brisket dinner to share with an extra side and that is plenty for us!  we (and i think a lot of other people, though when i pass by they don&#39;t seem to be hurting for customers) would come here a lot more often if the prices dropped a bit.happy to see them doing well and am a regular after the movies..so far service and the brisket are thumbs down.and fat willie&#39;s will comfort your soul with good cookin&#39;!the gumbo is spicy, the shrimp truly jumbo and bbq sauce tangy!.it was approximately $30 per person.large portions, good sauce, yummy ribs.overall, pricey (90 for two) for mediocre food.the staff is great..i&#39;m going to go cough up some more bones now.baked beans are another bbq joint staple that i use to judge a place..this is like a piece of heaven! i have to say its a tad bit difficult to find a good bbq place in the city.great pulled pork sandwich.00 for a slice of take out peanut butter pie.thankfully i was hungry because the portions are huge! they have a vinegary bbq sauce and 2 ketchup based sauces - i was a fan of the spicy ketchup based sauce.lots of food for the price! i got the mac and cheese and the corn.i have nothing but good things to say about fat willy&#39;s and am happy to have found another option for delicious barbecue in my own &#39;hood.furthermore, the mac and cheese and other offerings are not the usual (penne in mac and cheese).amazing food, great service and atmosphere.i think it will be quite some time before we&#39;ll be back, not because their food isn&#39;t tasty, just can&#39;t afford their over the top pricing.i ordered the full slab of baby back ribs with baked beans and sweet potato tots! my gf had the pulled chicken sandwich with cole slaw and sweet potato tots as well.last time we were here we ordered their bbq wings which were amazingly delicious.service here was good...still a little sore about not being able to be one and a half persons, but will definitely come here for a quick dinner and drinks before movies!.the food is so amazing.conveniet with a movie.i now dream about the wings &amp; homemade dipping sauce which is currently not available on grubhub, but i see the rib tips are on there, but not on the in-restaurant menu cause that&#39;s what i wanted :) we will definitely go back.awesome service.placed order for delivery and waited 2 hours with confirmation text messages that delivery was on its way.just sort of bland run of the mill bbq.had baby backs.bring your appetite you&#39;ll need it.a bit more expensive than, say, smoque or rub&#39;s backcountry smokehouse, for sure, but tables and service that is a little more price-appropriate.i have enjoyed this bbq for years! the food is always amazing and the service is always good.you can&#39;t go wrong with trying this place.good place to visit if you&#39;re close by and craving bbq, just not too memorable."
tre-soldi-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tre-soldi-chicago,1,"Fantastic italian restaurant.we had arrived just as the place opened so we had plenty of tables to choose from.i would rate tre soldi gnocchi as a 10.perfectly cooked.it&#39;s got a great atmosphere, looks nicer but still has a casual feel.it&#39;s very nicely decorated outside which makes it very inviting.we ordered the fried calamari to share and it was realllllllly good! my mom ordered the arrabbiata (penne, spicy tomato sauce, garlic) and that was super yummy.it was on point!  sauce and crust was amazing!.the environment is good and the servers are very attentive.had a simple spaghetti and a pizza and enjoyed every bite..nothing exceptional so that is why only 4 stars.never coming back, and you should either.the atmosphere was nice and prices were reasonable.ordered two of the salads which were amazing (kale/apple and the beet salad) and a fresh pasta special.i&#39;ve been back multiple times! always delicious! the staff is very friendly and the service was excellent! the first time i came it was rather late and i wasn&#39;t rushed at all and i had impeccable service by the bartender.easy convenient place to go for good italian..surprised this is not on many lists for a really good meal in the magnificent mile area.5 hour wait.00 and we will both be happy! this is the future everyone...if you want to eat a pasta and don&#39;t spend a lot of money that is the right place..the fettuccini noodles were perfectly cooked and the mushroom ragu fit it perfectly..we stumbled upon this place and liked the menu.the other waiters are nice too.he thought it was perfectly cooked.version and it was more of the alfredo cream sauce version.i feel confident bringing clients here for meals and marco the owner always takes care of us! i have never once had a negative experience.they appears to cater primarily to tourists, suburbanites in town for the day and those catching a quick bite before/after a movie or between shopping, which is perfect for its location..in summary, we found the situation dishonest although the manager acted accordingly.we got the check around 8:35 and we had a great time.the food options and drink menu were both large enough to satisfy everyone&#39;s taste buds but small enough to not be overwhelming.the restaurant is slightly above street level on ohio so it&#39;s pretttty nice people lurking from a slightly different angle.i tried the al capone, but i hear the old fashioned is pretty good too.we love how the entire staff works together to improve your experience no matter if they&#39;re your waiter/waitress or not; true teamwork for the greater good of the restaurant and thr customer&#39;s experience.a waitress brought over my food and the bill.we started with the octopus and then had the carbonara and amatriciana pastas.the spaghetti had a bit of bite--we liked that.i highly recommend this place!.popped in to get out of the rain and grab a bite.excellent! i&#39;ve had their margarita pizza, kale pizza, salads, and gnocchi.it comes served in a small crock pot so it&#39;s like your own personal lasagne not cut from a larger batch.they definitely value their customers and want to make sure you have a pleasant experience.we had the gnocchi and lasagna.belly is officially ready to burst!  bon a&#39;petite.service was also excellent.both were good, although i was not blown away; i have definitely had better tasting pasta in the city.i asked for a recommendation since we were a large group.good food and good service.nice guy from rome cooking homemade favorites..i have don&#39;t have any complaints with the staff at all.i&#39;ve eaten at tre soldi probably a hundred times, and i&#39;ve never had a bad experience..a nice white wine was recommended for me (one day, i will learn a thing or two about italian wines), then a few dishes, but i ended up going with the caccio e pepe..the food was great.i had the butternut squash filled ravioli with a butter cream sauce, toasted pine nuts, and crispy sage.i also ordered the carbonara which provided an experience that i haven&#39;t had since i was last in italy.also, its possible to order everything as tapas and it looks like fun.having said that, our food, when it finally arrived, was amazing! our whole table loved their meals..desert was brought out as requested for special occasion.the place is always busy, but not chaotic.perfectly cooked, seasoned right, and using the freshest ingredients.while food is fine service is rushed.cappuccino was delicious and capped off a lovely meal., delicious! order risotto, pasta specials appetizer portions and preen cotta! yummy.they source ingredients locally, any pizza with sausage is fantastic, along with  their pasta ragu which is delicious..wandering in with a t-shirt and tennis shoes i felt underdressed.also, try the kale salad.my only regret is that the portion was huge and i couldn&#39;t finish all of it.service: more often than not it is pretty slow and non-responsive."

flo-and-santos-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/flo-and-santos-chicago-3,1,"Flo&#39;s polish pizza is always a group favorite and the buffalo bill&#39;s chicken pizza is definitely on the spicy side but still oh so good!  i love recommending this place to people as there is something for everyone on the menu!  the patio is great for families and larger groups too.i walked into the restaurant 20 min later and sure enough, the pizza was boxed and waiting for me.some of the best pizza i have had in chicago and an impressive beer list.great place to hang with friends and watch sport games, the  best place to just chill with friends.the vibe is just really nice at flo &amp; santos..delivery might want to stick to somewhere else.we ordered italian beef pizza, buffalo chicken pizza and hot dig from kids menu.the place is definitely riding the line between bar and restaurant, kind of tough to capture the atmosphere.i think that&#39;s where my problem came in.you can tell they put time into crafting their pizza that every slice is as good as the last.i have brought countless friends and family members in, hosted parties here and suggested this restaurant to vvvip clients of mine.the waitress was nice and service was good..the idealist in me would have expected some form of inquiry about the quality of our experience, but maybe they preferred not to hear about it and we were at the point where we just wanted to leave this experience behind.they were clearly understaffed..just dab.very casual chill bar/restaurant with solid food.they wouldn&#39;t let us pay for a carry out order over the phone, which was weird.the order is prepared and ready in a timely fashion with attention to detail.i tried the polish platter and holy smokes, the sausage was as long as my arm.i had to be up early for work so i didn&#39;t have the energy to go back to the restaurant and complain.seems like they understaff, especially on weekends and on nice days.it&#39;s not a type i normally eat so i can only imagine that the pepperoni is even better.that &#34;policy&#34; will keep me away permanently - so i&#39;m done with f&amp;s.2 large pizzas and a round of beers was about $20 each including tip.quaint little spot i stumbled upon while smelling the delicious scents downtown chicago has to offer.they get it right.we went on a saturday night with friends and were seated outside right away..they were giving out free beer, which i don&#39;t like so i&#39;ll skip right to the  food.place is nice, reminds me of a standard pizza joint in nyc.no customer service skills at all..i was under the impression that pierogi were like potstickers, but these were lightly fried after boiled, i guess i was wrong, but all good anyway.patio is great and so live music occasionally.sauerkraut can be tasty! we also ordered the marco&#39;s italian beef (shaved beef, giardiniera, caramelized onion, fire roasted tomatoes) and am having trouble trying to decide which one was better.i don&#39;t like sauerkraut at all, and i never would have thought it&#39;d be good on a pizza, but it was amazing.you could still taste the raw dough toward the center of the pizza.so salty, you could taste the salt on your tongue even after a sip of water.we went with a thin crust sausage pizza, which was absolutely legitimate.very extensive wine list.my favorite is the flo&#39;s polish with the kielbasa, bacon &amp; sauerkraut.the flo&#39;s special pizza - (with polish sausage and kapusta) was great - i always ask for crispy crust - all the pizza is the best here.good food &amp; very friendly service...there was a man with a clipboard in front.the roasted brussel sprouts were thick pieces and also pretty good, but i think my pizza brain couldn&#39;t wrap its head around the concept of a brussel sprout pizza, so i didn&#39;t end up eating the whole piece.too many other places in town that are better.i don&#39;t know what else to say.great pizza, fantastic sandwiches, and a very well thought out beer list.wings - average good but nothing spectacular.awesome outdoor area when weather is nice and hopefully they bring the music back again! love f and s!.the noise level inside was pretty loud and it seemed rather hectic so not sure i would have enjoyed it as much if we&#39;d been inside, but we had a wonderful time and i&#39;d definitely go back to enjoy the patio.love it! took my girls from colorado here for some good chicago food and this place hit the spot.great service and great atmosphere! our server is blonde with some blue in her hair and she gives the best customer service.how do you expect a customer to have a good 1st time experience when your pizza was delivered in such a non-caring, nonchalant manner? if i do order here again, it definitely won&#39;t be via delivery so chances are, i&#39;ll be less likely to take the walk from printer&#39;s row when i have other choices like lou malnatis where i can pick up a pizza and make sure the pizza doesn&#39;t slide over in the pizza box.i had to leave our table twice to go in and request our check from the host, because our waitress was nowhere in sight.still loving flo&#39;s.service is always quick, and those pizzas really do show up on time.- tip:  the polish beer (zywiec) is a great deal at just $6 for a massive 22oz glass.the pizza had more flavor than i was expecting and i liked that it was relatively light.loved the fling pork wings and calimari was spot on.nice variety of beers on tap and unique menu items, if i were in the area, i could see this being my favorite local bar."
zaytune-mediterranean-grill-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/zaytune-mediterranean-grill-chicago-4,1,"You know what.portions were not very big and the falafels i ordered were all burt, look like little black balls.they always seem to be out of lamb.don&#39;t sleep on zaytune.steak wrap - i was a bit confused when i got the wrap one because i only paid $7 for it, and two because it was literally twice the size of a normal burrito.after eating here walk down a half block south and grab a coffee at the corner coffeehouse bridgeport coffee.my only complaint is that i wish i could get over there more often..i&#39;ve ordered from here a couple times, but today me and my dad went and ate out on there patio.honestly what could be better than yummy, affordably priced food at a convenient location?! i got the braised lamb salad, and really enjoyed it.overall, i had a really positive experience here.food is really good.herb fries are great!  i crave them with the dipping sauce all the time.it&#39;s done right...i&#39;ve never had any of the meat dishes.falafels are salty as fuck.been coming here for years and find time once a week to make the drive from northside to southside to eat here..only negative i can think of are the rice and salad that come with the platter isn&#39;t great, so i usually go for the wrap and a veggie skewer.so i&#39;ve worked in the area for nearly 2 years and can&#39;t believe i haven&#39;t written a review of zaytunes until now.very tender chicken.i knocked them one star because their location isn&#39;t the easiest to get to if u don&#39;t have a car and i&#39;ve had their hummus and wasn&#39;t impressed.5 stars.i really liked it, the wraps are really big and have a lot of meat.the least you could have done is inform me of being out of the sauce, i would have not ordered the fries.only a few other people inside.very good steak shawarma platter with rice and a couple of dipping sauces..the food was surprisingly delicious.quantities are huge but they&#39;re tasty.steak and falafel wraps were delicious, hummus could use some work, fresh bread was fantastic..like really go to a dollar store and buy one the water didn&#39;t even have bubbles.herb fries - very well seasoned.solid, reliable shawarma shack with great herb fries, hole-in-the-wall atmosphere..we found a hidden gem instead..tried zaytune on a tuesday night...it&#39;s two years later and where did all the friendly people go? last few times in i&#39;ve found the employees downright cranky at you for walking in.my favorite meal is grilled chicken platter.i can&#39;t believe i haven&#39;t written a review of this amazing place..i had a really great middle eastern dinner in bridgeport..had the salad bowl with braised lamb, delicious! good portion size, but wish the salad came with more of the crisp flat bread.the food was great and so was the service but the chef was blaring hip hop while the restaurant was playing rock.i haven&#39;t tried them yet though.i guess i didn&#39;t realize this was a chain when i was there, but i&#39;d totally go back!  portions seemed generous, flatbread was very fresh, and the fries w/kalamata sauce and hummus were delectable.lesson learned not going back!  beware check your food before you leave at get all the way home to find its wrong and they just do not care!.definately one of my favorite places in bridgeport :) keep up the good work guys :d.my god!! can&#39;t wait to come back and try other items on the menu.great portions, the best flavors.the black entrance material door is also a death trap.the bread is excellent.a nice place to get mediterranean food.the workers were more focused on ogling certain customers than helping all.but i can&#39;t even finish their salad sometimes because it&#39;s filled with meat.the chicken was flavorful and soft..their delivery person doesn&#39;t carry a lot of cash, so always good to have those extra singles for a decent tip.hummus is to die for! very creamy with true olive oil.they&#39;re crazy busy and it takes a while to get your food.decor is mediocre.so much food, but they were delicious.so i got a chicken shwarma wrap and fountain drink."
falafel-island-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/falafel-island-chicago,1,"Definitely 5 stars from me!.portions are large and staff is very accommodating in adding what you&#39;d like to plate.the falafel is amazing and the pita is great.good food, but i&#39;m not sure i like their service.the preparation technique was fine (grilling the meat, the pita, etc.the falafel is perfection and so is the hummus.it was as beautiful as it was delicious.very disappointing to say the least!.hell all of it!i could barely finish it, they are not afraid to give you a more than fair portion.great portion size for the money.i had to eat in since i was on my way to an appointment, so i just sat there in total silence eating my food..typical mural on the wall and plenty of seating.more cold falafels.falafel was good!lentil soup tasted good, but wasn&#39;t much in there..the veggie combination plate is hands down one of my favorites on the menu..bummer, not the friendliest folks either...great food at really cheap prices, the portions are really generous.it fill me up.recommend to eat there.friendlier service &amp; it&#39;s an easy 5.ate here for the first time this afternoon with my eldest daughter.good portions.we were told to go to max&#39;s next door, but we wanted a place to sit down.falafal was really good, and their hot sauce was really hot.a very good place for a quick bite, falafel is great fresh and crunchy, the best falafel i&#39;ve had in years and remind me with home in the middle east, nothing fancy about this place but food especially falafel is awesome.portions are generous, pricing is good, restaurant is clean, and most importantly the shawarma is fresh.last week i was looking for a place to grab a bite with my boyfriend, we saw this place (had a long line of people which is always a good indication) and decided to give it a try, we shared a beef shawerma plate with a side of falafel and tabouli and baklava for dessert, the food was superior but what caught my attention is that despite the big pressure everyone was conducting their job with a friendly manner and fast rythm, the 2 chefs were nice (one gave us a free falafel piece to eat while we wait) and the girl on the cash register was amazingly efficient and friendly (we had baklava based on her recommendation which was as she said a good balance of sweetness and crispness! she also told us bon appetite in arabic :-))all in all this is an amazing experience i will do again for sure.could not eat beef kebab.the white tahini was very watered down that it tasted like water.food was awesome.i ordered the kafka plate and noticed while one guy assembled it, the other kept on adding extra stuff on it.having been there several times, i&#39;ve not once been let down.ownership and help is still attentive and friendly.so from my samplings, i&#39;m pretty impressed.i really like their kafta sandwich.it is very dried and tasteless.this brought back memories of that day.this place is incredible.good food size and good portions.i&#39;m always in awe of the quantity and variety of foods in the veggie platter: 3 falafel, 2 dolmas, roasted cauliflower, roasted red peppers, potatoes, banana peppers, hummus, baba ghanoush, rice, pita, and two kinds of salad.the meat is always semi-cooked, the pita is always torn down when eating and you have to eat by hand.shawerma sandwich was served cold and not fresh at all, the condiments on the shawerma belonged to the falafel.we enjoyed finding this random mediterranean restaurant on my sister&#39;s last afternoon in the city.the falafel and fries definitely need more flavor, my fries weren&#39;t even salted..i enjoyed the chicken shawarma with a side of hot sauce along with 3 stuffed grape leaves.the kifta was a little dry, although not bothersomely so.not a good mediterranean spot.lastly, i ordered hummus and it&#39;s not good.musky taste4.but cheap and easy if gluten is an issue.would not go back every day.i will say i really liked their lentil soup and the veggie combo plate esp the cauliflowers in it.very authentic and quiet restaurant..for what it istiny  no frills establishmentgreat lentil soupgood tabouleh and wonderful pitathe cook could crack a smile one in a while but other than sullen faces behind the counter.i know i&#39;ll definitely be back if i&#39;m in the area.would highly recommend.i arrived at 11:50 and wondered why it was so empty."

everything that my boyfriend and i ordered for dinner was tasty (even his french fries!).i&#39;m from dubai.the lahmacun (turkish pizza) as well as all the kebabs/salads are very tasty.if you are looking for a german style doner this place has it!!thank you and i will return with friends.baba ghannoush, doner, lahmacun, and the eggplant purée with lamb are all great.really 3.the lebanese bread it was served on was to die for.will be going back!..18: tried more and decided to update my rating.the best restaurant in the area! if the menu looks like your type of food, you will be grateful you visited zizi&#39;s.amazing mediterranean standards, but also some great turkish specialties.the homemade bread is so good, you will feel a profound pity for the gluten-intolerant.cigar borek with feta cheese was amazing.my only complaint was the dressing was a tad too acidic for me.and the bread.don&#39;t forget to try ezme( pretty delish ) in appetizers section..this place always slays my tastebuds and leaves me satisfied without killing my wallet.tasty and fast! the only thing i was not a fan of was the interior, but i would not mind going back here.it&#39;s always good to get the opinion of someone from the heartland of the cuisine, i always say.bread: 4/5 -- solid, warm bread fresh off the oven and served with cool carrot spread.i will be back for sure, and i&#39;m bringing company.still i will absolutely be back!.great food, big portions and fabulous service.they have a chicken and beef gyro sandwich also the one of their signature dishes.the falafel were really dry and bland, the hummus was a complete disappointment.a man who loves his food,  loves his people,  and is always good for a chuckle.i was in istanbul earlier this year and the adana kabab comes pretty darn close to the real thing! get it now.the entrée stated that it includedveggies as well."

 we enjoyed the fact that you could order ahead and then pick it up.one of the best deep dish options in chicago!.both were excellent, but the classic had the most delicious sausage i&#39;ve ever had on a pizza! this was definitely worth the trip!.i was peeved at first but it was so amazing i didn&#39;t care!!  we took home the leftovers and had them the next night for dinner.score!* order your pizza at the cashier while waiting for a table* the wait app shows your place on the wait list.i&#39;ve had deep dish at another place, and i just liked it better.lou malnati&#39;s was my first de.we could barely finish a small pizza (9 inches) between the two of us.that cheese and crust!!! to die for! i highly recommend this, it&#39;s called the malnati chicago classic for a reason!also, there most likely will be a wait so plan accordingly.loud, crowded, and the perfect atmosphere to sit around a couple of pitchers and delicious pies.i never know how decadent pizza could be.i took a day trip to chicago and wanted to maximize my experience of chicago and what better way to do that than with some deep dish pizza? i decided on lou malnati&#39;s due to suggestions from friends as well as raving reviews on yelp and i was not disappointed!ended up ordering the spinach bread and the malnati chicago classic and both were amazing! the spinach bread is a smaller sized loaf of bread filled with cheesy goodness and a little bit of spinach as well.we shared a personal sized pizza and side salad.lou&#39;s contacted me several times to speak about my experience and they have went above and beyond to listen to my concerns and rectify whatever happened during my visit.after asking around town, we decided on lou malnati&#39;s.definitely worth trying..i personally chose lou malnati&#39;s for my first chicago deep dish experience and it did not disappoint!walked in and the wait was 30 minutes, luckily i spotted 2 seats at the bar so we opted to sit there.not sure anything else after that and was wishing there was something more i could say about it.prices are good and excellent service, friendly people.a browned buttery crust that really handles that rest of the flavors well.for appetizers, i had the calamari and spinach stuffed bread.big shout to server hector.there&#39;s a reason lou mal&#39;s is synonymous with chicago pizza.visited chicago for the first time a couple weeks ago, we were told lou malnati&#39;s was the best place to go in the area we stayed.well, it was good but i won&#39;t wait 2 hours for  deep dish pizza.we checked out 3 deep dish pizza places during our visit to chicago for the weekend.65 prior to tax, serves 2-3 people).the pizza wasn&#39;t memorable.it was overwhelmingly deep for me: lots of red sauce and lots of cheese.it had spinach, onions, garlic, mushrooms, and we added sausage.the pizza was good but not great.verdict? worth traveling 2,000 miles for.like me, they&#39;re not fans of deep dish and prefer thin crust.i&#39;m a crust lover and boy did their buttercrust make me happy."
cafecito-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafecito-chicago-2,1,"Probably the best coffee in the south loop.the other day i really wanted it but the line was on the sidewalk.i&#39;m not a huge fan of milk or lattes, but will get the cafe con leche if i&#39;m in the mood to sip on something delicious for a couple hours.skip the crappy, corporate fast food that one finds in the loop and go for this locally owned cafe that makes one hell of a cuban sandwich.i shamelessly scarfed it down as i navigated the loop lunch crowd.oh..the prices were also really great.wait, what? where&#39;s the menu? where&#39;s the, you know, options? excuse me while i try to decide on food that i can&#39;t even see what&#39;s listed..extra points if you grab a groupon, which turns their very affordable sandwiches($5-7) each, into incredibly affordable sandwiches(basically 40%) off...i was working nearby so i decided to give it a try.cafecito has some of the best food in the loop.that being said, even if it&#39;s not food poisoning, it still wasn&#39;t that good of a dish.thank you for being close to my work and apartment.this place feels like miami, great for when i feel homesick and need some cuban food and cafecito..ravenously stalked cafecito&#39;s reviews and pictures while on the purple line to work, and was unabashedly glad it started to rain because that gave me an excuse to be late to work (and instead drop in cafecito right next to the washington/wells stop i was supposed to get off of).the bread was toasted just right.highly recommend it.the pressed bread was very nice, but again.the sandwich tasted very flavorful and not fishy.we will be making another stop here while visiting chicago!.we were overblown why the amount of flavor both their coffee and food has coming out of this place.service could have been a bit more pleasant.amazing cuban food! i had the ropa vieja which was among st the best in chicago.one of the best cubano sandwiches i&#39;ve ever had, cooked perfectly, each ingredient was proportioned perfectly so as not to overpower the other.i&#39;ve had a tostada with eggs and the pallomilla sandwich and both were great and comparable to what you can get in sofla.n0 bathrooms-does the staff have to go to arbies too?be prepared to wait for a place to sit (seats 20?), or be ready to head out.it&#39;s an explosion of great  savory flavors.the flavor and seasoning are excellent and the press bread is delicious..this place however made me understand the whole cuban sandwich craze.with its prices, portions, and delicious flavors, cafecito does pretty well in living up to the hype; it&#39;s easily one of the best places i&#39;ve stopped by for lunch in the loop.yum!!!!had the black bean soup which was perfectly spiced -- along with the jardin sandwich -- beyond delicious and flavorful!!it was crowded but moved quickly - everything made fresh..i am officially addicted to their cafe con leche, i go at least once a week.the cubano was amazing.the place is not that big, so be prepared for long lines during lunch hour 12pm-1pm.i had paired my sandwich with a large cafe con leche, which i thought was reasonably priced.never been disappointed.one downfall is their breakfast which in my opinion is lacking.located right in the loop area this place should not go untried if you are visiting chicago like i was or even better work a few blocks away!cafecito is known for their incredible sandwiches (lechon, bistec, cubano, etc).great spot for coffee and sandwiches! it was my first time in chicago and it is always nice to find a caribbean restaurant to support in any new city.but holy moly it is so worth it!! and if coffee is your thing, the cafe con leche is also great!!.they are very fast and friendly too..and this isn&#39;t even for the cubano, which they are famous for, but the elvees, which was maduro with peanut butter and guava jam.not much room to wait once you order.excellent little cubano sandwich shop.the cuban was so good that i almost ate my fingers trying to ensure i consumed every bite..i really miss having a good cubano and double cafecito..however, the nice variety of sandwiches almost makes up for this fatal flaw.i&#39;ve been there twice around 12:45 and end up waiting about 15 minutes.we&#39;ll be back again, maybe at the larger location along congress next time.i promise.they offer larger plates of food and side dishes, although i haven&#39;t tried these options.had the el padre this week which was a special, wow, amazing.tip #4: unwrap your sandwich and enjoy the best (insert food item, in my case, the cubano) and wish you ordered two.we frequent this spot for lunch often, typically aiming to arrive around 10:45 am so that you don&#39;t have to wait too long.nothing really to go on about.they make great cafe con leche, hence the 8am line.would definitely come back if i&#39;m ever in chicago again!.no nonsense but yet friendly people.it&#39;s incredibly savory and has the perfect amount of cheese/mayo so you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re clogging up your arteries.cafecito&#39;s lechon doesn&#39;t have the crunchy pig skin of the filipino version, but at four very good tasting ingredients, it&#39;s the best sandwich i&#39;ve had in chicago.ordered the steak chumichurri but when i got on the train ready to indulge in the first bite, it turned out to be the turkey.just leave the backcountry pack at home! buen provecho!.just spicy enough to add a little zing and open the palate!!! i&#39;ll definitely make this little gem on wells in the loop a regular stop when i&#39;m in chicago!!.counter service was really nice too.typical for the loop, bad service, so i guess i can&#39;t complain, seeing as i&#39;m just another number..decent variety.my favorites are the cubano and the ropa vieja.got the choripan sandwich with a side of the black bean soup - so good!!the black bean soup was a tad too salty but i get that black beans absorb flavor really well and it won&#39;t deter me from ordering it again."
kates-thai-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kates-thai-kitchen-chicago,2,"Very friendly staff and a clearly marked gluten free menu.good food and deals, and wonderful service..we had also ordered the tom yum ramen but they got the order wrong and only gave us a tom yum soup but i&#39;m pretty glad.so glad to have a great thai option in the neighborhood.the pad keemoa was good but and different than other thai restaurants nearby but for some reason this place charges $4-5 more.similar to another customer, my service was a little slow the first time i went, but it seems they have corrected that.what more do you need to know?.love..also great service!  will definitely be back!..the girl mumbled: &#34;i am sorry&#34; without looking up at me.the chicken was really good.kate&#39;s kitchen is a lovely neighborhood gem with authentic thai food..went for dinner a few nights ago! the service started a little slow but once the cooking started , we got our food rather quickly.the crispy noodles were way too over-fried; more like noodle chips.unfortunately we never got the food.we have ordered for delivery several times.honestly the best thai food i have had in years.i drank a thai ice tea while i waited, and there was too much milk or half and half, and i prefer a stronger tea flavor."
the-halal-guys-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-chicago,2,"I had the chicken sandwich and it was delicious.get that on the side.and be nice to the people holding up the line with their questions and decision-making pauses.i love you halal guys!.my bowels were in for a burning treat as i conquered the platter solo - though it was hard, it was a labor of love.*********update********** went back this weekend for a redo and made sure they got it right this time, and they did! the workers were very nice and polite.or more honestly, fulfill your drunchie munchies.everything goes perfectly together.after you order you pick it up and they put white sauce and hot sauce on if you ask.chicago has better lamb and chicken.although they don&#39;t let you freely add the sauce, they give you a generous amount already..it&#39;s a gyro stand.the portions are big.great food for a good price.the veggies are also very fresh!a few locations opened up nearby where i live so i&#39;ll definitely be stopping by soon!.i&#39;ve recently discovered a love for middle eastern food and this gem happened to plop down right next to my office - how convenient!huge portions and reasonable price compared to other places in the city.welcome to the age of the internet (and better food anywhere else).there really is no place to sit and eat inside so it&#39;s more of a carry out joint.the white sauce is amazing.look.it was one billion degrees inside.in buzzed state, 4 stars.but given that finally i don&#39;t have to wait till my next trip to new york to get it, i guess i should be grateful and not complain too much.i went with the gyros and a side of fries.wow, the heat!.i would not advise you to pour it on your platter because i was in agony trying to eat it..four other locations are supposed to open in the near future so hopefully it becomes more convenient and less congested.the white sauce is one of the most wonderful sauces invented.there might be a line when you go, but it moves fast..my bad for coming in sober on a saturday night at 1am.the hubs ordered the large platter with chicken and a gyro sandwich, i had the chicken and falafel platter and a side of hummus.s p a r i n g l y.they ran out of chicken, denied people at the door, and forced their dry falafel on customers because they didn&#39;t want to be &#34;inconvenienced&#34; by making more chicken.i had the falafel platter i had leftovers the next day so i added okra and croutons.i was beyond stoked.love this place.because we were tourists and did not know a spot we can go eat nor can just take it to go, we were lucky the window table was available.rice was incredibly dry.the rice was hard and the gyro--- well it&#39;s just not the same..."

i&#39;ll take it.i may come back and try their dinner food but not sure i&#39;d come back for brunch.for main entrees we had the quiche of the day and the omelette of the day.they have a &#34;chic&#34; appearance that blends with a gastropub..great for small groups, though!.so delish!i highly recommend sip, whether it be for a large gathering of friends and family or a date night.the game was great sip not so much.this was such a perfect sunday brunch spot! we started with mimosas and some delicious beignets with a caramel sauce!i had a hard time choosing an entree because there were so many great options! i went for he quiche of the day and loved it..service was average at best..more veg options please!.came here with some friends from out of town for drinks and dinner..overall it was just okay but definitely not worth the price we our for brunch.the staff were kind, greeted us with smiles, checked in with just the right amount of anecdotes/jokes, recommendations, and pleasant conversation.not very filling.definitely try the lobster grits! the riesling was great! my boyfriend ordered a beer and they put it in an adorable glass shaped like a beer can!hopefully you enjoy this place too! i&#39;m a fannn!.the food was amazing--i ordered the 2x2x2 which incised two eggs, two pancakes, and two jalapeño sausage patties--yum!  my friends all enjoyed their dishes as well, which ranged from classic bacon and eggs to eggs benedict, to quiche.until then, 2/5 stars for the nice waitress and welcoming decor..very well made cocktail!for dinner we got the cheese board and i ordered the chimichuri hanger steak..towards the end of our meal, a large group of college aged young men were seated next to us and it got really, really loud, so much so, we couldn&#39;t hear each other.i love the thriving brunch culture in our fair city but hate the inevitable wait for a table on a weekend morning.went for sunday brunch with friends visiting from out of town.fantastic food and beverage program! do yourself a favor and visit sip..we all got some of their specialty cocktails.the medium rare steak was raw in the middle.for less than $15 i can flag down the server every time they walk by to refill my glass with some bubbly.big mistake.sticky ooey gooey goodness, and the dough is a perfect balance between a heavier yeasty dough and the buttery flakiness of a croissant..the chicken, gravy, and waffles did not disappoint.when i arrived at 10:45 i was told the wait without a reservation was about an hour and a half.highly recommend giving sip a try for breakfast or brunch.for my brunch entree i ordered their buttermilk biscuit and gravy with side of eggs.the charming cocktail glasses seemed to have made their way from back in the day when everything was just more grand and fanciful.my bff&#39;s and i came here on a sunday, my birthday, 11-29 and we sat from 11:29am until 3:30pm, the bottomless mimosa&#39;s had taken over our bodies and would not let us go, lol.the food was spectacular as well.i think the server misunderstood me when i said i wanted to have sides to share as opposed to having them as appetizers.come here for drinks.certainly we will be back!.the  lobster and grits was good..i&#39;ll definitely be back to try the wine bar and dinner.we recently hosted a dinner for my wife&#39;s birthday at sip.when we were seated at that two top, i was asked to mind my step over a stack of magazines which was there to cover an exposed vent right next to the stool, that, had the table not been slanted, a few mimosas later i would have definitely forgotten the hole was there and stepped in it.the most apt description i can come up with is an american brasserie or upscale bistro with lively jazz music on certain nights.got the &#34;american&#34; (2 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 silver dollar pancakes) for $14.i&#39;ve never been let down by the beignets!!! ever always delicious and always freshly made..finally at my wit&#39;s end, and had to get her attention.the live mucus is amazing! we loved listening to janvier and tim, the food and drink offerings are good too..i would definitely recommend this place for a date night and i&#39;d be willing to try late night brunch, for sure.i think sip is a bit of a hidden gem, especially for brunch."

crisp-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/crisp-chicago,1,"You&#39;ll thank me later! :).and they could a been crisper.honestly, i think the wings are del seoul are better!however, the sandwiches here come with a piece of their fried chicken smothered in their sauces and was delicious!they didn&#39;t have whole chicken the night i came and i would go back again to try the whole chicken!.i feel like this is a place that relies upon their large portions, cheap prices, and easy going vibe to make up for their relatively tame flavors.it was essentially boolgogi on top of rice that was marinated well without being too salty.tip:  pre-order your meal and park for a minute with flashers to run in and pick it up.most of the seating consists of large picnic style tables (the rest is stool seating across wall/window) so don&#39;t be surprised if you&#39;re getting cozy with some strangers.soooo good! they come in many delicious flavor.pair this with their amazing wings and sauce, and we have a winner on our hands.if you want boneless chicken go check out this place in assi plaza in niles - called do re hodoo doore chicken.if i lived in town, crisp would be my regular spot.i was only visiting chicago for a bit, but i&#39;m glad i made it out to this area just for crisp!.i only had to wait 5 minutes for my order of fries, and there were a ton! i actually wasn&#39;t able to finish all my food i was so full.i don&#39;t usually eat wings but i am always down to have crisp&#39;s wings..the seoul sassy was pretty awesome with the combination of sweet and salty.the sauces are tasty, the chicken is extremely crisp, and the size of the wings are larger than average brining good value to your dollar.and they are all mostly communal tables.thank you, crisp! we tried the seoul sassy (no heat, sweeter) &amp; bbq (mild heat)..one of the most memorable meals i&#39;ve had near belmont was the korean fried chicken from crisp..their sauces also compliment the wings well along with rice.small, cute little shop with limited seating, but great chicken wings! their atomic sauce is reason enough to make the trip!they have a great deal that&#39;s enough food to feed at least 3-4 people that has a whole chicken (you can choose two sauces), a side and two drinks.i kind of wish i would have added some meat to it.atomic sauce all the things.goodluck there!the restaurants space is small, w/a few communal tables.really tries to emulate korean fried chicken but i found it to be a little far from the og than i would have liked.this doesn&#39;t compare to the korean fried chicken you can get in nyc, but it&#39;s about the best chicago has to offer.the wings were extra crisp/crunchy and flavorful.this place is amazing.not even salt lol.the orders are all wings and no drumsticks - but they include an extra piece of the wing that most places don&#39;t.the chicken is definitely delicious and the have a variety of different types of korean fried chicken.i&#39;ve only had the chi-town chicken bowl from crisp, but it is both excellent and huge, especially for the price!  although my appetite is on the smaller side, it is certainly at least two meals&#39; worth of food.5 stars!.yum, this place is amazing.the place is always packed.my friend loved this place so much, she insisted we lyft from river north to this spot in lakeview by lincoln park..this place has been on my list of places to try for over a year now because of all of the goods things i&#39;ve heard and the great reviews i&#39;ve read.best korean chicken wings in my opinion.it was mild i would say.great flavors, but the bowls seem more rice than veg.we would order in the store, wait, take it home and never have an issue (except for the one time my friend got raw wings, but the staff did a great job at remediating the issue.the wings are very greasy, but that&#39;s not a bad thing.their sauces are bomb great tastycome here you will enjoy.shared it with 4 other peopletime waiting for food: about 10 minutesfood ordered: 10 seoul sassy 10 bbq wings 1 order of fries and a bulgogi platebest dish: seoul sassy wingswing size: hugebathroom factor: 9/10 aka i almost pooped my pants on the way homeprice out the door: $56!!atmosphere: fast foodcould you bring a date here: i mean you could but i wouldn&#39;t recommend it.tried the seoul sassy wings and i was in love -- perfect slightly sweet flavoring with a hint of a peppery kick.i always have left overs which still taste great the next day..i would recommend both sauces..crisp was alright.we hardly touched our bowl of rice and veggies.i am now officially torn between crisp and kyochon in la when it comes to korean wings.be warned though, space is small and it&#39;s communal seating.staff was great,  service was prompt..i don&#39;t think the description on the menu fits the actual sauce.sure, the tables are kinda dirty, sure the music isn&#39;t that good and yeah the service could be a tad better - but the dudes at register are probably mad stressed out seeing how they deal with 24/7 rushes.the not so common crisp chicken sandwich was very hard and burnt..i will be coming back for more food..seoul sassy, baby! order anything here (as long as it includes meat) and just ask for it seoul sassy.on to the wings! crispy skin, perfectly seasoned, moist and juicy.order the crisp bbq wings if you enjoy spicy food! the spice isn&#39;t uncomfortably strong but the flavors are much bolder.still not as good as the wings i had in korea, but beggars can&#39;t be choosers.crisp probably serves the best korean fried chicken i&#39;ve ever had! we ordered 5 wings in the seoul sassy and a foodie&#39;s choice crisp sandwich.i would definitely come back enough to try everything on their menu - it&#39;s a small but great selection.this place is definitely non stop busy, and the communal dining tables do make it hard to sit and enjoy the food.but fine..this place is the shit!.constantly packed through out the day and for good reason! their portions are great for the price and quality and perfect for sharing to try many different menu items!my boyfriend and i ordered the 5 wings with the seoul sassy sauce and the baby buddha bowl."

imperial-lamian-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/imperial-lamian-chicago,2,"Atmosphere: the space looks cool when you walk in, but it has a lot to be desired as a fun place to get together.separate bar area along the hubbard street side.we went to imperial lamian on saturday 2/27.i&#39;ll be returning soon to try the other menu items i simply had not room to eat.cant wait to go back there again and try the wok dishes.youtube it! these were very good and loved them.decided to try this one out on a friday night.ordered the tasty colorful dumplings that were a variety of different stuffings (crab, duck, pork etc).i hope i&#39;ll be able to go here one more time before leaving chicago.she presented other unpleasant qualities, but i&#39;ve ranted enough.a test of a great chinese restaurant is hot and sour soup by my book.only few cons are the portion of the food is quite small, lack of attentive service, and the lamian dishes are plain..there is also a guy who is pulling and making the noodles right in the restaurant (they have a big window so you can see him)..i would admit that the service was better and it felt cleaner than some of the grittier restaurants in chinatown but alas, i do not recommend paying that price for mediocrity.i also have to say that the beef brisket was extremely tender.i&#39;ve been twice now and there&#39;s a lot to love.the venue is quite beautiful and you can tell a lot of attention to detail was paid on the decor...i would highly recommend that people do some research before trying this place.dish were awesome..i actually loved every single one of the dumplings..very smooth tasting.however, the quality of the food we ordered was just average.very intrigued by their photogenic jasmine tea smoked ribs though.lastly, drinks.aside from the shoddy service i had most recently (this was the second time i&#39;d eaten there in about 3 months) i think this place is great! it&#39;s lively, with good ambiance and a visual into the kitchen where you can hear them smacking noodle dough onto the counter.will be back again w friends and family.while on a trip to chicago, my concierge recommended this restaurant.i get this is river north which has a different price range, but it really doesn&#39;t add anything new or exciting for diners that are familiar with authentic asian food and not afraid to venture out to the neighborhoods..lesson learned.&#34; what is even worse, we felt we were forgotten by the waiters, even though they were busy walking around.food is not the greatest.the food was good but not exceptional.consistency on the food is lacking and consistency on the poor drink is sadly consistent.i, however, happened to enjoy their beef brisket ramen--it definitely doesn&#39;t give you the flavor from a japanese ramen place, but the beef brisket is well cooked, and the noodles is okay too.as a proud foodie, i learned to shake off any stereotypes- i will happily pay premium for uniquely prepared dishes with exotic ingredients! this is exactly what you get in this place!i must say our experience was greatly improved by our amazing, passionate about the food waitress, maria! she didn&#39;t just know all the dishes on the menu she had her favorites and made us feel at ease about some of the ingredients we didn&#39;t know! maria shared with us that she celebrated her own birthday at imperial.lamian mixed mushroom noodles were my favorite.try to get a table next to the kitchen so you can watch them.this restaurant is another addition the increasingly more saturated upscale chinese restaurants in chicago, but i must say it is my favorite (in comparison to duck duck goat and shanghai terrace).in fact everything we had including several varieties of soup dumplings (dumplings with a brothy filling if you are not familiar), several dim sum selections, jasmine tea ribs, seafood fried rice and car siu wonton noodles were excellent.the broth was nice and complimented the fresh noodles nicely.we also had the pumpkin puff dim sum - filled with butternut squash.amazing! pure and simple.truffle dumplings were outstanding, pumpkin shaped dim sum were adorable and filled with a rich duck flavor bomb.for a restaurant of this quality and location i was surprised how reasonable it was.the ambience and decor made you feel you want to sit and keep eating..my only comment would be that i wish they had some better dessert options but besides that, will be back soon for sure!.we had the pork belly bao, stuffed wings to start and ordered the shanghai,  szechuan, and truffle soup dumplings, pork pot stickers, mushroom dumplings, pork shrimp dumplings, shrimp in passion fruit sauce, pepper steak, and brisket noodles.great ambiance and wonderful service...décor: the vibe is asian, which shouldn&#39;t surprise you, but it&#39;s very nicely done with a modern feel to it.it&#39;s jumbo chicken wing stuffed with tiger shrimp and fried to perfection.massively overpriced place with good food.i had heard about the hand pulled lamian here and the soup dumplings so we tried one of each."
belly-up-smokehouse-and-saloon-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/belly-up-smokehouse-and-saloon-chicago,2,"Quite possibly the best i&#39;ve had.well i am glad we waited and went here.the atmosphere is got to very fun.don&#39;t see how they can even serve that.i&#39;d say the biggest plus for this restaurant, however, is the customer service.definitely coming back.this place is an all around dining pleasure.nothing to write home about, standard fare for anyone with a grill and a dream.the brisket had a good flavor but was dry and tough.can&#39;t really complain about toast or hard fried eggs..my wife&#39;s side of mac and cheese looked like pasta with melted kraft cheese; we could have made this better at home!the service was slow; they were definitely under staffed.both cooked perfectly and their side of mac &amp; cheese beat any other bbq spots i&#39;ve tried in chicago.great addition to the south loop! casual atmosphere, good drink list and unique menu offerings.terrible brisket....we asked the server to warm it up for us and he acknowledged this has been happening all the time.danni is the best server! she&#39;s friendly and knowledgeable about recommendations..had the brisket plate.after the kitchen dropped off our meals, he walked by our table no less that 10 times and didn&#39;t say a single word.other than that, i loved this place.my one main complaint is i don&#39;t love the kind of family friendly vibes the place gives off, as i feel like it&#39;s a bit of a mood kill if you&#39;re looking for a more chic/trendy spot!.it was penne pasta, with processed cheese.absolutely no reason not to go back.meh.our server was nice enough.recommend!.the bartender luis was wonderful! he remembered the name of me and my wife and every single detail (beer we drank, food we ate) of our previuos visit at the bar several weeks ago....i was crazy about the corn.the brisket comes with coleslaw, your choice of side and corn bread.had a pulled chicken sandwich and it was delicious.we made our way down to the restaurant and were greeted immediately..so happy this establishment opened in the south loop.our dinner came with a side of cole slaw and mac and cheese.we had the platter.chatted with the manager really cool guy.we had raquel for our waitress and she was very polite and seemed very sweet.as it is new and i&#39;m sure has some kinks to work out, there was plenty to like here but also enough to be disappointed in that at this point, it is a 3-star restaurant.he said his brisket by itself had no flavor, no smoke, etc.the coleslaw &amp; kale were phenomenal though.they make their own sauces in-house.sitting at the bar, you really get to see what the service is all about.however it did seem odd that this place was practically empty on a friday night at 7pm.the food that we had was good, but like i said, i&#39;d like to come back for the bbq to give this joint a proper rating.apparently they fry the fish and the chicken in the same oil because it had a catfish kind of vibe, good thing i like eating fish also.the service was great and so fast.just had dinner at the belly up smokehouse with my husband and everything was delicious.could be fattier, but still quite good.their strawberry concoction was outstanding..i will return to try the brisket.the brisket was so dry i couldn&#39;t eat it without smothering a ton of bbq sauce on the sandwich.pricing was very good as well.pulled pork sandwich was not pulled."

 not as sure.can&#39;t wait to have another meal here again soon!.isn&#39;t a side supposed to go with the main?steak tartare was delicious.we were very polite and tried to be respectful but very disappointed on how she treated us..a nice and diverse menu for carnivores and vegetarians alike; important as many of my friends are vegetarians and like to have something for them to try.check presidio off the list.then order any of the delicious cocktails on or off menu, and profusely thank me..we opted to share the burrata, polenta, scallops and black cod (fish of the day).can&#39;t wait to come back on our next trip!..i mentioned my engagement plans and they comped us a bottle of champagne! it was perfect..i was hoping for more of a cool neighborhood spot where you could chill, grab a few drinks and call it a night.service was good - you could tell the staff is still learning the ropes but overall a pleasant experience.crispy broccoli with soy, walnuts, and blueberries surprised all of us by being amazing and i would 100% recommend..of course, the food.my boyfriends pasta (appetizer)  which he ordered as his entree along with the broccoli side were by far the best.i liked this place! i think at the price point you could probably find something better (especially in west loop) but the location and ambiance is great.i went for chicago restaurant week with a couple of friends, so we got to try everything on the menu! i personally ordered the burrata, it comes with honeycomb and fig sauce! we also had the cavatelli (amazing pasta, tastes a little truffley - highly recomend), and the creme brulee.she also gave us a fun little lesson on fernet, which apparently i had been pronouncing wrong for 23 years.ambiance is intimate yet fun.not a bad place, came in here for a drink while waiting for a reservation.if you get one thing, get the side of broccoli..the polenta took me back to europe- and it was full of so much great flavor.how does that happen? streak tartar..i had a chardonnay, which was buttery as heaven.the presidio is a fun, trendy bar with great staff.we live in the neighborhood so i&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back, but i&#39;m still holding out for the &#34;five star&#34; experience.service was extremely slow, table wasn&#39;t cleared properly, dishes left on the table from apps all the way through  the check.i&#39;ll definitely be a regular patron (when i can afford it)!cocktails are interesting and solid.wow! the food and atmosphere were amazing.i&#39;m not sure i would run back here for brunch, but i would definitely come sit at the bar for cocktails and appetizers for happy hour.both were very good.food was great too.it was first time for me trying venison it only comes as rare and it was phenomenal, cooked to perfection.she then gave my friend and i a preview of their extensive fernet menu."

:).unfortunately we left after our appetizer.*old fashioned - excellent, they have an exclusive barrel of four roses they use, finishes well*oxtail croquette - fantastic, great flavor, cooked just right and a great portion*suckling pig - also very very good, wonderful presentation and beautiful flavor, not fried like          you would imagine*duck - excellent preparation of the confit leg, tender with great flavor*mussels - delicious base, healthy portion overall very good*drumstick - come on, its a drumstick, of course it was goodoverall, the experience was very good.it was good, but i only ate half until i couldn&#39;t take the texture/flavor anymore.every time i&#39;m in town, i&#39;m sure to eat at homestead on the roof.no hellos on the way in, no goodbyes on the way out, and definitely no smiles.we had the homemade bread basket and ox tail croquettes to start and shared a plethora of small plates for our main meal! i highly encourage sharing, the portions are good for it and then you get to try a bit of everything, and believe me you will want to try a bit of everything on this diverse and delicious menu! the rooftop is so cute and intimate! the seasonal cocktails were also unique and delicious! only complaint: the waiter didn&#39;t check back very often regarding ordering more cocktails or drinks.but we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and time here.i have celiac disease and can&#39;t have gluten and even though the menu does not indicate what is gluten free our server was very knowledgeable and could tell us what was gf and went to the chef and asked on anything he didn&#39;t know.we had some special dietary needs, specially gluten free, and my daughter had called three times to make sure they were willing to accommodate our issues..eh.had most of the menu and it was glorious.and you get to dine up on the roof in our beautiful city and it&#39;s just unbeatable.i would actually just come back here for cocktails if the occasion ever presented itself.not ideal but it was a busy saturday night so i&#39;m sure he had a lot going on..just the piece of fish.while this is billed as a small plates restaurant, i thought portion sizes were quite generous overall.drinks here are superb..it&#39;s a bit strange to get into and you have to walk through a pizza place, but then once you walk up the stairs you arrive on the rooftop/porch where they have several tables and heaters.the food is so incredibly tasty, unique, and varied....we couldn&#39;t finish any of the salads though we were quite hungry.absolutely fantastic.there are some issues with presentation..the rooftop has a beautiful ambiance and the farm to table style will make your mouth water.homestead sort of feels like one of those &#34;in the know&#34; chicago spots.he couldn&#39;t stop raving even a couple of weeks after about his drink.ha!  i ordered us a couple of salads and bread to start.luckily, we didn&#39;t have to wait too long, but there was a weird 15 minute hiatus in the middle of our meal because of this.my husband and i first came in the winter time, and fell in love with the delicious food, cocktails and impeccable service.in case you were not aware, and this has nothing to do with homestead, but chicago can be windy.i found the food to be very ordinary; unfortunately the prices are not.the squash marmalade resembled gelee cubes, which added some whimsy to the look of the dish, but wow! taken together made for major happy in my mouth!for the main course, we both went with the duck.&#34;medium&#34; sized orecchiette is a normally-sized entree full of delicious flavors (maitake mushrooms, shaved beets, turnips, smoked goat cheese) &amp; &#34;large&#34; size grilled lamb entree is truly large.menu, food and drinks:although the menu consisted of one page, the food presentation and flavor came out brilliantly.i&#39;ve been here five times in the last 18 months and, considering there are many restaurants to try and always limited funds to do them all, a return rate like that should say enough about how much i love homestead.our server coursed our meals really well and always kept an eye on us without being intrusive.it&#39;s a really special place that you have to experience to fully appreciate!.a few of our dishes had pomegranate seeds on them- i love pomegranates but when you have a menu of small plates, it just seemed odd to include them on more than 1 dish.the food was great.this is the place to go for those special occasions.the tables were full when we went and no issues at all.it really made for a wonderful dining experience.but when someone orders their hanger steak to be cooked medium.just come here for drinks and desert after dinner!.finally made a reservation for chicago&#39;s restaurant week.over 30 minutes after our scheduled reservation we finally had drinks.it was a great experience and the food was fantastic.we also ordered two desserts- the citrus and the adult hot chocolate.lethally good.however the girls and boys in plead and skinny jeans are very attentive!the dishes are all very interesting, (everything comes out served in casual pottery plates in muted colors) and presentation is outstanding beautiful and unique."

ramen-misoya-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ramen-misoya-chicago,1,"The golden miso was more salt and then rich but the tonkotsu was the right balance between rich and salty.we went there at 2pm sat, waiting for 10 minutes to get the seats.i added extra veggies and that&#39;s it.i&#39;ve definitely had bad ramen before and amazing ramen and this place was amazing.overall, three stars for the brand name only.i usually can&#39;t finish a whole bowl of ramen, but this time, i ate the whole thing! come to ramen misoya if you&#39;re in the neighborhood and looking for some great ramen in a casual setting.staff is quite friendly and efficient.the ramen maybe lacked some veggies but also typical of the curry kind.ate here the other day..enjoyed the gold ramen, with pork and fried shrimp.absolutely delicious ramen.i felt compelled to write a positive review here because i went to several disappointing so-called ramen places after this one.not too salty, and just the right amount of flavor.went for lunch with my bro.the ramen is too salty to eat.their dishes could use some bok choy, scallions, parsley, or some other greenery to add some color and fiber to their all brown dishes.i&#39;d like to try one of these fried chicken appetizers next time and maybe their new curry ramen.duh!.broth was extremely salty, pork slices were tough, egg was overcooked, and the potato wedges are a very strange addition to any ramen bowl.generous portion size, and broth was very hearty if a little too salty, which i always find is an issue in ramen.if you like ground pork, it&#39;s not a problem..overall, a good lunch spot with a 10% off discount with yelp check in!.be attentive, take responsibility and take action when something goes wrong.i ordered chicken (kara-age) and they brought out pork (cha-shu) ramen and after a long long wait, they brought pieces of chicken on the side instead.would definitely go again.if you&#39;re near this hidden gem and are looking to be adventurous then i highly recommend.i won&#39;t get the cha-su again.small space, became busy and loud very fast.salt is cheap, but not free!.i was on lunch break around noon.same multi-location ramen joint, but actually different menu from santa clara.i&#39;ll give the ramen-nod to oiistar and takeya though.it was very doughy, and all of the sauces on top was a bit overwhelming as well as all the bonito flakes on top created a little hill.my friend didn&#39;t like the chicken one as much though...it was a great meal!.chasu ramen was pretty sub-par, looked nothing like the picture on their menu and they wanted to charge me $1..i was excited to get some ramen in chicago, but sadly i was very disappointed with my experience at misoya.the broth was very strong and salty.fast and easy..i know ramen broth are typically on the salty side but this place&#39;s ramen was a bit too salty and i could it without all the fried shallot.after seeing reviews from the mt.their staff was quite friendly tho, if that was not the case, i am not sure if this place even deserves a 2 star.i&#39;ll give them the benefit of the doubt."
park-tavern-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/park-tavern-chicago,2,"I thought it was a bit to loud but given that it is a sports bar that&#39;s to be expected..i was pleased to see that they had happy hour and other specials going on event though there was a game at the uc..other than that it was my first time visiting, the music was decent and the food was good.i would definitely recommend getting a reservation because it gets packed! my friends had tacos, i had the chicken sandwich and my other friend got the pizza.also note that the shuttle stops 25 minutes after gametime..it did seem that they were understaffed for the crowd that was there, however the bartenders did a great job..i would be there all the time, getting my eat and/or drink on.our favorites are the pretzel sticks..should be the mantra of this place..they were just small upscale burgers but they were tiny and delicious and not at all like white castle or a typical bar.i decided to be spontaneous as i am always and try to get last minute tix at the box office or online.we dined here before the barbra streisand concert.i had the bbq glazed salmon, which was also quite delicious.outstanding food and very reasonable prices! lots of beers on tap and the perk of having a shuttle bus that goes to the united center just adds to the experience.good selection of food,  good service,  and the atmosphere is nice and clean.other than that, it&#39;s still my go to place before seeing the hawks.deviled eggs and outdoor summer games like cornhole? count me in! no seriously, i am very glad i happened to have found this place on yelp and it truly lived up to it&#39;s reputation etc.great beer selection.they have a complimentary shuttle service to the united center, so we used that to get to the bulls game! 5/5.both were good..thank god for yelp.$ 0.we mke types love to share.the night we went on (a friday, non-event night) the place was pretty empty, except for a big party happening outside.i ordere.sat there for awhile drink empty.heaven, right?eh.there&#39;s an outdoor patio area, main area with bar and upstairs.good food, good beer selection, decent prices for the area.don&#39;t miss a ride on the shuttle to (and back) the stadium with jerrry.they also offer a free shuttle to the united center which is a nice option in cold weather months.this is a mixed review.they are bacon, cheese and potatoes.they definitely have better pricing for their drinks here compare to the stadium.another 30 minutes passes, and we&#39;re still standing in the exact same spot with no text message.we didn&#39;t like the chorizo deviled eggs, left 4 out of 6 on the plate and he didn&#39;t bat an eye and there was no question about why we didn&#39;t like them or whether we wanted something else.my friend&#39;s with their busy hands also stopped eating the fries because they couldn&#39;t handle more than one or two fries.it&#39;s right on the way, and they even offer a free shuttle too and from the united center.the space is very open, which is a plus, but be cautious if you&#39;re coming before a bulls or hawks game-it gets absolutely packed.she said, &#34;we are understaffed.my meal was done in a half hour.not the worst and not the best.good place to go before bulls games, great place to meet people before the game, and psst they have free parking and a shuttle!  food is typical grill food, but not bad, and beer selection is very good, with a variety of microbrews.it&#39;s probably the best located bar for the united center crowd but as much as i wanted to try their famed animal tots, i walked in, took one look at their sorry draft beer list (bud, bud light, coors, etc) and made a bee line out of there.park tavern was a great spot and environment to grab a bite before heading to the united center.this area is carpeted complete with large round tables, tall boys, and a mini bar.get some competent bartenders.we also ordered the bacon and jalapeno mac and cheese.the best time to go is when they have  a late evening event at the united center."
rosals-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rosals-chicago-3,1,"Will definitely be coming back!.they take care in not packing the place so is not super loud and is a comfortable place to have a romantic dinner or with the family.he got the owner who said that her pasta and vegetable dish should have cost 40 bucks because &#34;mushrooms and roasted red peppers are expensive&#34; and he was giving me a deal at $33.plenty of food and could definitely share.so the mood was already set!  the food was average and the dessert disappointing, but the tone and setting of the restaurant lends itself to a leisurely, romantic evening.great service knowledgeable waiter made spot on suggestions.it was good but nothing to get all worked up over.we liked the lunch buffet, but the buffet table was stolen so now a waitress brings your food for you and you can&#39;t choose for yourself..(only no one pushes me to clean my plate.while not necessary, those personal touches were missing on this visit..wine list was weak.the wine&#39;s ok though.this place tastes like olive garden but 2 times more expensive.great food! came here with the 2 pickiest men on the planet.valet or street parking nearby.visiting from out of town...their sausage and lasagna were great too.our waiter was efficient but had the personality of a dead fish.don&#39;t miss this hidden gem!.it&#39;s a quaint little italian restaurant that is dim lit and cozy.the atmosphere is everything you&#39;d expect from a traditional &#34;red-sauce&#34; establishment in little italy.when we got our main courses (rigatoni diablo and shrimp alla anival), we were even more amazed.i&#39;ve taken a lot of friends and family here too who always enjoy it, and we usually go on fridays then head over to beviamo for live music night.loved it.it was truly an adult sized portion) and pasta w/pesto..the caprese lacked any character (and used some really tasteless tomatoes) but we were willing to overlook it.food was pretty good but not best i&#39;ve had in chicago.our server was phenomenal.classic family-style italian but more authentic and cozier atmosphere than those restaurants that try hard but come up short; we will absolutely go back..even if it takes us 17 hours to get there.or maybe not have open reservations when you can&#39;t accommodate them?  as the clock ticked down- we had to have our dinners boxed and sprinted down the street to make it to our car before our meter was up.having spent a lot of money there for very underwhelming food and only decent service left a poor taste in our mouth.looking forward to returning to chicago and eating here again.we highly recommend this place if you&#39;re looking for great food and a family experience..other people had veal parm (so good) one had a special of the day with sausage and chicken (sausage had the best homemade taste and 2 gnocchi with different sauces, everyone was so happy with their entrees.dinner date..great service, what more can a girl ask for?.i would definitely recommend a reservation because although there is an upstairs dining room, the restaurant is small, and you don&#39;t want to miss out!.when my lasagna arrived the waitress began with &#34;this is smaller than our normal portion&#34;, yet it was still a decent portion for 1 person.but my favorite is the ravioli a appetizer- hot damn that&#39;s good shit!.it&#39;s a small place so make sure you make a reservation!.what a wonderful meal.i&#39;ve tried the fresh green salad, gnocchi, simple penne with marinara, chocolate cake and many others but my absolute favorite is their spumoni which is a molded italian ice cream made with layers of different colors and flavors.i ordered the chicken alla ramon.tender chicken and delicious veg and potatoes..the perch dish on the menu was fantastic as was the chicken marsala.fried ravioli is unreal.the fried ravioli appetizer was delicious and so was the rigatoni with artichokes.very small dining area.fried raviolis were pretty good but the gnocchi with bret vodka sauce was awful! it was tree d like gnocchi with a water sauce.i agree..so the 3* is exactly what the &#39;a-ok&#39; description should be: not fancy, but reliable, a place to go and meet old friends where the focus will be the conversation rather than the food but you&#39;ll leave full and happy.(and they have a sizable menu)i did finally discover a great dish that all italian restaurants should have- steak with marinara!  omg it was great, now most italian places have steak on the menu and its not badly done, but why o why in such a small little italian-on the lake recreation such as chicago has no one thought of putting prosciutto with filet with marinara and topping it of with a little mozz??? its big, 12 ozs, it is great sauce, and i order light on the cheese and it was still plenty so be ware and be hungry!we had the fried ravioli to start but its lightly pan fried so don&#39;t expect crispy critters, and the chicken dish my date had was a very tasty lemon spinach dish, and we had tartufo for dessert but it was rolled with cchips which was a little unusual for me to see it that way but still chocolate gelato with more chocolate is not against the law anywhere i know.tiny place with a big heart and huge flavor.the service was so so friendly.it was still good, but several factors such as the waiter accidentally throwing away my leftovers and some seemingly lack of interest in our party kept our experience from being perfect.great ambiance and a great waitress, gina, who seemed to handle our craziness very well.the only place that i might enjoy just a little bit more is sabatino&#39;s.stick to the other restaurants on taylor street, we were sorely let down by the experience at rosals.there are so many places that promise you something and don&#39;t really deliver on it.it is my favorite italian restaurant in the chicagoland area.i&#39;ll be back when in chicago."
paulie-gees-logan-square-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/paulie-gees-logan-square-chicago,1,"We were then given a greenpointer, which has uncooked arugula and a pleasant lemon juice flavor.menu says &#34;substitutions will kindly be declined.i get that chicago is a tricky place to open a pizza joint because people expect a lot, but i left paulie gee&#39;s feeling underwhelmed.service not so much.the logan square is and cream of some fungi was fun to order.will likely get even better as they continue to refine their menu, etc (the server told us they were adding salads starting on august 8).really loved that these delicious wood fired pizzas were more personal size.it was also very noisy and very very dark.super cool! the pizza comes out well done, piping hot, with some of the tastiest mozzarella i have had on a pizza.a nice addition to logan square!.my friends and i went on saturday night, just a week into being open so i&#39;m a bit more lenient for any of their faults.so many reasons to say fuck it to the gym and pile out with your tongue out.he was so unassuming and natural during our conversation i had totally assumed he was another patron...couldn&#39;t recommend it more.very cool wood and brick vibe here..we tried things like honey, maple syrup and pickled pineapple.good pizza for this ny pizza lover-service was good, pies came out faster than i expected.the lights are less dim, the staff is on top of it (especially here at the bar where i&#39;m sitting tonight).other notes:  the lighting is really dim, making reading the menu a little difficult.if you love good, fresh pizza, don&#39;t sleep on paulie gee&#39;s!.seems that they&#39;ve smoothed a lot out since my last visit.fun place, great selection (vegan, vegetarian, and meat-lovers), fast service.good pizza, excellent crust with fresh ingredients.delicious pizza and friendly service.bar staff was super friendly and served us a few minutes prior to the official opening hour.the service was good! a lot of these negative service reviews came in the first week of it being open, which is kind of unfair.all foodies and elites out there know damn well that when a new restaurant opens, service in the first week may not be streamlined as well as it should.finally a pizza place that leaves me satisfied.don&#39;t miss the salted caramel root beer float for dessert..came here around the grand opening (my bad, didn&#39;t realize it until we got there).that was embarrassing.i am looking forward to coming back!.got the hell boy and my girlfriend got the greenpointer with prosciutto, and would recommend both and look forward to trying more styles.i really wanted to love this place, but couldn&#39;t get around a few things.i had the vegan ricotta pizza and it was outstanding.reclaimed wood, hand-typed menus, mediocre pizza they won&#39;t modify at all because, &#34;you know paulie and all&#34; and uber &#34;hip&#34; waitstaff.it&#39;s a life changing pizza.pizza is about the crust, if you serve a minimalist ny style pizza you better make a hell of a crust, this place is bland, loud, and service is disconnected.trying to find two without any &#34;modifications&#34; was annoying..after about 15 min we tracked down a server."

please stop by this place, your taste buds will thank you!!.everything that we chose was delicious..there really is a reason as to why this place garners 4/5 stars."
belly-shack-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/belly-shack-chicago-2,2,"Hats off to the passion fruit lemonade - ah-mazing.everything is very flavorful and spicy..people beside us left without eating all their pork steamed buns and we almost snatched them before the table was bussed.boss bowl filing and looks nice, pork and beef are well flavored but the chicken isn&#39;t as good.but it is amazing).expense doesn&#39;t seem like a issue after eating here.went in on a tuesday evening at about 7pm.great idea.place.i have also had the lemongrass gyro which was recommended by an employee, good call.juicy, extremely well marinated and the korean bbq flavour will coat the inside of your mouth well after you&#39;re done swallowing.other than that the actual food was great.ever..the meat to bread ratio was ridiculous.i&#39;ve been to belly shack a few times now.the bun didn&#39;t seem to make sense on the belly dog.for this alone i will keep coming back here! i like&#39;d the tostones (i&#39;m a fan of chimichurri), but my friends were not the biggest fans, mostly because ours came out quite greasy.it&#39;s kind of crappy that they&#39;re closed on mondays, but i can forgive them.can&#39;t wait to come back for more!.the brussels sprouts were heavy on the bacon which is always a great thing..i can sum this up in one word: yum.be warned that portions are probably small for men of all shapes and sizes.everything was delicious-- from the hot and sour tortilla soup to the pho-sole to the bbq belly bowl.and it was $30 for all of it.perhaps an aioli would have made a better pairing.you just have to go and order at the cashier first..again, not my taste.the pork meatball sandwich didn&#39;t do it for me ( i detected fish sauce, which doesn&#39;t work for my palate).just do it, you will walk out with a happy belly! staff is so attentive &amp; friendly! awesome place all around!.so simple, but when it&#39;s juuuuuuuust right, it&#39;s out of this world.tostones - you could put chimichurri on just about anything for me to eat it, but these plantain creations were great on their own and amazing with the chimichurri sprinkled onquinoa bibimbap - so filling and yummy with the fried egg on top; i should have asked for more spicy sauce, but i couldn&#39;t leave the tostones for fear my friend would eat them all while i was getting spicy sauce and i didn&#39;t want to over power the already delicious flavor of the dishmy friend had the cheeseburger and that was the one &#34;could have been better&#34; dish because the bun was over toasted and hard.the tacos come deconstructed (w/ 5 tortillas), so you can make your tacos as big or as small as you&#39;d like.i remember when this place first opened and i recall bookmarking it way back then thinking i would go sometime soon..the good (great):the &#34;tograshi fries&#34; were spot on! if i go back, it&#39;ll be for these (and to try the belly dog).try the togarashi fries!.staff was auper friendly.the belly dog is something that needs to be tried.urban shack was outstanding.the fries were thin and crispy(exactly how i like it)...it&#39;s east coast styled bun - where you lop off half of loaf of bread and slice it down the middle to make a bun.and amazing curried mayo.obviously i couldn&#39;t enjoy a meal after that...they have their ups and downs with their entrees, but i would return just for another belly dog.best french fries in chicago.my fave combo are jibarito sandwich and fries with dipping sauce.didn&#39;t love that i had to make my own little sandwhich using tiny little pita pockets and the beef was a super chewy.i can&#39;t believe i waited so long to eat here.so much so that it was difficult to eat without dripping and much of it fell apart by the end of the meal.the orange peel garnish tasted really good in the drink as well.i was just expecting to get a glass of it, so good on them.the staff wasn&#39;t very attentive either.overall, an enjoyable lunch and i hope to go back to try out some other other dishes.good for me.had the phozole (soup special: pho + pozole) and it was wonderful.i had the bowl, with korean beef, and shared the roasted vegetable appetizer, and the donut sundae.others reported very good tacos and other items (i want to say a sort of fusion gyro? i&#39;m forgetting already) and everyone was satisfied for not a crazy amount of cash.it was $9 but it also came with an order of their togarashi fries with a curry mayo.perfect for sharing!plus was the music was awesome...0 stars.the to stones are unique.highly recommended if you are hungry and just got off the l.).i&#39;m a big fan of fusion and innovation, however, so i&#39;m glad i stopped by.it&#39;s aight.seriously love this place."
tapas-valencia-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tapas-valencia-chicago,2,"Valet parking! miro-esque murals on the walls.so disappointed.super fun restaurant - great food and delicious sangria.items that really stood out for me: gambas ajillo, queso de cabra, crepe rellena, and chorizo y morcilla (was so excited that morcilla was on the menu! i haven&#39;t had it in years and the last time i had it was in madrid!)...clearly i keep coming back!most of the servers are incredible.this happy hour is very affordable and the tapas are delicious! my favorites were the crostini with avocado and crab and the bacon wrapped dates! i&#39;ll certainly plan to come back.we don&#39;t live anywhere near south loop, but will be making the effort to return!.i also feel like 3/5 dishes ordered came with the same roasted red pepper sauce.from the friendly and prompt service, to the lovely and warm space, to the top notch food, a wonderful experience!   francisco was great, and the red sangria he suggested was delicious.having had such a great experience just a few weeks ago, we couldn&#39;t wait to come back! we came in around 9 on a friday night and the place was pretty empty, which seemed odd but we were hungry so we sat at the bar.i&#39;d go back for sure.i came here on a friday for the start of a girls night out and thoroughly enjoyed myself! the atmosphere is pleasantly and lively and the food was delish!! we had the scallops and coucous, shrimp with lemon butter, tiger shrimp with spinach, the king crab and avocado over toast, and the stuffed mushrooms, the pomegranate and regular red sangria and everything was good.this is definitely a crisis..drinks: sangria was a little bit of a let down compared to some others that i&#39;ve had, but the food really makes up for it..the beef tenderloin were tender, scallops were fresh, crepes were thin and crispy..drinks are ok, i would just get one drink at the bar if i was going to come back to this place.tapas valencia is the best kept secret in the south loop! the food is exquisite and unique, the staff is friendly (especially sergio and jose) and they even have authentic spanish dancing on saturdays.place is always crowded.i have not gone for brunch yet.anyway, i&#39;ll be back if i&#39;m in the neighborhood and i don&#39;t have any place better to go, but won&#39;t be going out of my way to eat here any time soon.very cool, laid back, and fun atmosphere.they had some live music and flamenco dancing that night, which was entertaining when you could see them.the roasted bacon wrapped dates are fantastic.we felt so special! the tarta de pera was amazing! it was an almond pound cake with pears and was by far the best! we also had profiteroles del pirineo, tarta de chocolate y caramel, tart de pecans, and cazuelita de chocolate..i think the dessert was my fav part!..hard to find decent tapas outside spain but they did a good job..all were delightful and had a deep savoriness that i associate with spanish food..this was the hit of the evening from a flavor standpoint..my party enjoyed the live music, however it was a bit too loud at times.the decor and ambiance is very cool and the server we had was outstanding.the dining room environment, menu options and price is worth another look.i think the restaurant should consider dimmer lighting in the restaurant..the south side has really changed, love the area, loved the service, the decor was exciting, the staff seemed to be having a great time, laughing, playing and making sure we all were well provided for..getting the check was excruciating, and the music for the flamenco dancer was too loud.i would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and the outdoor patio is a perfect little area to sit and relax and enjoy a meal.i will definitely be back!.every dish is unique in flavoring and delicious to eat.awesome food, drinks and staff.the food is delicious, and the wine list is good, considering the overall affordable price.i came in to pass time during happy hour and it was the best! i got a 5$ mojito.everything was amazing, i especially liked all of the seafood dishes that we got.the tilapia and goat cheese were the best: the tilapia was thin and crispy and nicely flavorful; the goat cheese/ bread dish was so tomatoey and super savory..this is the most amazing tapas i&#39;ve ever had in my life.everything was good.they have a wide variety of tapas..the bar area with tvs were lively.great food, great service, helped make an impression with my guest.all in all, a great dining experience!.the different tapas have great presentation.prices and serving sizes are on point..but the seafood and steak dishes more than makes up for it.absolutely impressed me, reminded me of being in barcelona again! coming all the way from texas this place did not disappointment.i&#39;ve been here a few times now and it&#39;s always fantastic.upbeat and picasso-esque atmosphere!.everything tasted really good.a friend and i went here last night after her arguing against dimsum.:-/...if you wanted a lighter dessert, this is a very refreshing dessert..the only downside is that being on south state, its a little more out of the way and not as central to the rest of the city."
brightwok-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brightwok-kitchen-chicago,1,"Price: barely noticed the charge in my account.don&#39;t expect to be wow&#39;d by the flavors but you can always beef it up with a little sriracha ;)i really really like the decor, it&#39;s very clean and the space is open with lots of seating.this is the place for high-quality, fast, delicious stir-fry.i decided to &#34;make it fancy&#34; by adding a crispy egg.it&#39;s all gluten free and doesn&#39;t taste like cardboard!! order now and hey a free drink refill even if you want it to go after eating in the restaurant.i had the citrus ginger green tea, very tasty!try it out!.it&#39;s the chipotle concept but with kale, beets, broccoli, etc..the food ended up being bland and more of a soup than a stir fry - all the sauce ended up at the bottom of the bowl! we ended up paying more than we would have at chipotle, or a similar restaurant, for less, more tasteless food.m.with a line that reached the back of the restaurant, i was in and out within ten minutes.btw, everything on the menu is gluten-free..the prices are reasonable until you get drawn into choosing steak as a protein, adding on both mushrooms (which should just be a vegetable) and a fried egg (which is worth it).plenty of options in all columns and what really made it were the sauces..i liked how they have a fair amount of sauces available.the location is modern and clean, and the staff is super friendly and outgoing..i just wasn&#39;t a total fan and will be in no rush to go back..i&#39;m glad i found bright wok.staff is super kind and helpful.brightwok is busy at lunch, but the line moves fast.i order the chicken bowl with white rice, chili coconut curry, and varying vegetables.i don&#39;t see it as being significantly better than a place like flatwok, but i may give it another try with one of the more unique sauces..my total was $9.this place is awesome!!! i got 6-veggies over mixed greens which sounded super healthy and not enough food but turned out to be really filling.i have a gluten allergy and found this on yelp when visiting chicago.for a (relatively) healthy and filling meal downtown, that&#39;s a great price.who would&#39;ve thunk it, this turned out to be my favorite meal while vacationing in chicago! i&#39;m not kidding, favorite food i ate there.upon finally receiving our food, i could swear i received white rice (the worker claims it was brown, though i&#39;ve never seen brown rice turn white upon cooking.incredible! i recently discovered i amallergic to gluten and dairy and have had a difficult time finding great restraints that serve great food with my restrictions..can&#39;t go much better than that!.try the hibiscus one, it takes some getting used to, but it is unlike anything i have tasted before.ordering process was straightforward, staff was cheerful despite being at the later end of the lunch rush, and food was fresh and substantial while still being pretty healthy.i really like this place! the food is fresh and the ordering process is pretty simple.really disappointed.favorite lunch spot in the loop.a solid lunch spot offering good bang for your buck.lessons learned: adding extras can get exponentially expensive, and get here by noon or you might wait in a very long line to order..modest prices for a heaping bowl of stir fry that&#39;s relatively healthy.all in all, it&#39;s a very good spot if you want a healthy meal with lots of veggies!!.i really enjoyed my meal..refreshing to see a local restaurant doing everything so right...i&#39;ve hit it up a few times with co-workers, my son, and everyone seems to enjoy it.the vegetables were very fresh and there wasn&#39;t a long wait until our food was done.you pick either noodle, white, or brown rice.you can make some really yummy combinations but you run a real risk of getting something bland.brightwok was a very solid lunch experience (fresh, fast, and filling)..omg! i wish it hadn&#39;t taken me this long to discover this place.you know this is a very smart concept.food was ok.1.it&#39;s kind of mongolian wok meets asian chipotle in a good way! they have no gluten, wheat, shellfish, peanuts or fish on the premises fyi.brightwok is the best lunch place near my office.staff is very courteous and came over to ask how our food was.i am a fan of these pick your own stir fry places.this place looks healthy, but they us way too much oil during cooking and that&#39;s not good for those who wait a weight lose diet.i would for sure come here again if i lived in chicago or was there to visit!.my food was fairly tasty, and cooked well, i&#39;ll give them that.i thought it is a chinese place before my visit.it&#39;s simple: pick a base, a protein and a sauce from the menu and add up to four vegetables plus an egg or mushrooms for an upcharge.i opted for the a bed of greens as the base.what you do get, however, is a peek at asian food made cool.my fav thing to get is a stir fry bowl with rice noodles, the lemon sauce, tofu, cabbage, sprouts, kale, onion, carrots and broccoli.the spice was perfect (i like spicy) and my coworkers were happy as well.so when i was greeted with a &#34;happy stir-friday&#34; walking in here i knew i was gonna love it."
small-cheval-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/small-cheval-chicago-2,1,"The burger that most people wait three hours for is available here with little to no wait...the price is heavy but i&#39;ll pay for it with these burgers! they are a five star place if the cost was a bit lower.so simple, so good.and the smoothie was pretty good - i got the vanilla one.there were a couple tables inside and a pretty large patio outside with plenty of seating, which is a huge plus over the cramped inside of au cheval.i know those who swear it&#39;s the bacon that makes the burger at au cheval.i&#39;ve heard good things about small cheval!  if my sister, who is not a big burger person, said their burgers are good then you know they&#39;re good!!even though its so simple, the ingredients are so fresh and everything just works so well together! the burger patties are thin so there are two patties and the cheese is delicious and if you get bacon, its a thick, perfect slice of bacon.it&#39;s awesome.knowing i was going to pay $10 for a burger and being spoiled with in-n-out, i was expecting a lot.i ordered the hamburger house style ($8.the overwhelming strong presence of salt was the primary flavor, which unfortunately didn&#39;t let the beef shine.just order, grab a seat, and wait for them to call your number.i do like the options to add booze to my shake, drink a shot with my beer, and sit at a giant picnic table with the sexy-dirty foodie hipsters of the city..walked in, walked right out..how was this yelp elite going to please everyone?  and just like that!  it was as if the stars aligned and the yelp gods shone their light of grace on me and directed me to small cheval!  there was some hesitation about the menu, the heat and the distance from our airbnb.the cheese is gooey, the pickle is refreshing, the dijonaisse is unique.last time i went, au cheval was an hour wait so being able to walk in small cheval and get my food within 10 minutes was awesome!  my cheeseburger and fries came to just under $15, which isn&#39;t much cheaper, but the speed and convenience is great.the burgers come with 2 patties, i would have been pretty happy to have only 1 patty as the burger was pretty big with 2.i think they knew the masses would come no matter what the space looked like, but hey, the space needs a little more love.one large room, with the kitchen open to the dining area.my burger fix was more than satisfied so i would recommend coming here when you have an au cheval craving as it will hold you down..95 for a cheeseburger) but the taste and portion doesn&#39;t disappoint!my friend and i split a cheeseburger and fries and sat outside to enjoy the gorgeous afternoon.fries were great.if you like grilled meat with toppings and bread on either side, you will like this.the bun is fresh, the beef patties have a good melt-in-your-mouth texture, but the flavor profile is that of a typical fast-food burger..plus tip, this cost me about $20.nothing special, but is good with the burger.i can&#39;t imagine it would be as good as take out if you&#39;re going very far..parking:there&#39;s meter parking around the restaurant..it is a little pricier than other &#34;casual&#34; burger joints, but you do get an amazing burger...now that i&#39;ve had both burgers within a week of each other, i can confidently say the small burger is superior to the au burger.when there&#39;s no outside seating (closed during winter), the interior seating can be a bit odd: bar seating along 2 walls and a huge center table that occupies 75% of the floor space, but wastes about 25% of it.not to get all goldilocks-y but i think the hamburger benefits from the cheese, the bacon is gilding the lily too much and so: the cheeseburger reigns supreme here.great burgers! the burgers here are mouth watering, melt in your mouth good..over priced for burger king sized burgers.come here now.it&#39;s kinda like five guys taste wise but much better and fresher tasting..finally got to this place last night, and i&#39;m so glad i did.all i can say after eating here is, wow! the burgers were cooked to perfection and the fries were fresh and crispy (not overdone).and just a word of advice: please if you wake up early enough, get there before 12:30 pm, because this small place fills up pretty rapidly..my opinion.a good example of this is burger belly (previously lead belly).something is missing..it&#39;s an ok burger average at best.can&#39;t wait to come back, and next time, a milkshake will be in order!.if this place were more affordable on my tight college budget, i&#39;d be here more often but i&#39;ve eaten here 4 times this past year and each time was phenomenal..what i like:- if you just want a less sophisticated version of the au cheval special, you can get that burger with a lot less fuss! (maybe minus some of the fancier ingredients like the egg, but i can&#39;t remember)- i also like the casual, communal vibe of small cheval- it&#39;s in wicker park, so duh, i like thaton the other hand:- if you want anything other than beer, burger and fries, you&#39;re pretty much out of luckoverall, i think au cheval is okay and likewise, small cheval is too.should you want to splurge, go get a bacon add-on.i haven&#39;t been to au cheval but this was a good start.also, there&#39;s garlic aioli by the pump...i&#39;ll be waiting for those words of affirmation.i wouldn&#39;t come back and would say if you didn&#39;t make it you didn&#39;t miss anything.garlic aioli sauce and house ketchup were the best food items.you&#39;ve been here for hours!.i would, however, come back here to try their burger and see how it compares to au cheval.."

hash-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hash-chicago,2,"It&#39;s ok! a bit pricey for so little meat, cute place and nice staff is the reason for the 2stars..you order up in the front then they give you a number so then they&#39;ll bring the food to you.the food, however, was very good and very filling.very good breakfast! the only reason i am giving 4 stars is because the place is very small and can feel crowed/cramped.the hash is delicious..service is good and prices are reasonable.needed a casual place for some breakfast and oj.first time visit to hash today! this place is such a terrific brunch spot find..i had baby cakes eggs and bacon everything a la carte...the only issue was no one ever stopped to see if you needed anything else.you have to know what you want fairly quickly and get in line to order.it&#39;s a very small joint on the street corner of the puerto rican area of chicago and very much worth it.we ordered, she was rude, we got our food, it was delicious.i will go back here for sure due to the large menu and general yummy smell of the place but will probably try other brunch places first.i like their food (i&#39;ve had the humboldt hash), but it did make me feel a bit sick for a few hours afterwards.i ordered the juan denver hash and my husband ordered the italian benedict.i&#39;m totally piggy-backing off what another yelper states about the horrible service here and &#34;teenage-esque&#34; vibe.it&#39;s a small place and it fills up fast.further, they only offer water in plastic cups and also have white paper napkins.that&#39;s my only complaint.there were people walking over to the back area to be seated, people walking to their tables from the waiting area, people walking to/from the ordering counter, food runners bringing food/taking away plates.they start with potatoes and eggs and from there it gets interesting with combinations like corned beef, brown carrots and kraut or spicy chick peas, yogurt, and crispy kale.the cooks are so considerate.the french toast was amazing, possibly the best i&#39;ve ever had! there butter creme and syrup mixed together taste like heaven.seating was quick and spacious! the place has a simple menu with specials on the wall at the counter.my friends all had food envy so i agreed (quite generously, i thought) to share breakfasts with one of them who ordered flapjacks with strawberries and maple syrup.this place has breakfast and serving down!not only does the ambience and classy style give you a welcoming feel but the staff are fabulous and always smiling...i decided to order the elotes hash special and all of my previous frustrations with this place faded into the background as i took my first bite.both were really good, though i did like mine more.plus they have awesome coffee!.the bad news is our servers looked like they hadn&#39;t showered in a while either.i&#39;d rather go to mcdonald&#39;s than order from this place ever again..safe to say we will be returning.as i&#39;m writing this maggie&#39;s customer service just keeps getting better and better with each and every customer i love her hospitality and not to mention she&#39;s absolutely adorable...new favorite neighborhood brunch spot! i got the pork bubble and squeak with 1 egg and it was a tasty choice! i only got one scrambled egg on top which was more than enough and the portions including 1 pc of toast are definitely enough to feed two people.we ended up refunding 2 of the items.pork bubble and squeak hash is killer, especially smothered in that delicious mustard cream sauce.for me, it&#39;s only a convenience thing that hash is nearby.the inside is a pretty small space, so it can feel a little crammed.i ordered the breakfast tacos.truffle is by far the way to go, but people tend to miss it because a pendent light partially blocks its place on the board.the only not so good part is that i received my food last :( and i was looking at my friends eat for a bit.a little heat, mild green chili, perfectly  cooked egg  and crispy yet wet tortillas.great breakfast stop if you want a heavy meal.love that they serve dark matter coffee but i hate that my omelette was okay.the whole staff (like all 4-5 of them) were very nice and helpful..i&#39;ve been four times in the past month, and each time has been very tasty.luckily, the line was quite dense, so i had time to change my mind multiple times.woo!.quaint little spot- order up front and sit.i had the italian eggs benedict, and my friend had waffles with pecan butter (both from the specials board).super cute, but small place for brunch! ladies working are really sweet and nice.great hashbrowns and ketchup though..they do serve lunch as well - the greek salad is delicious.i wish i could give you five star but unfortunately i had a really bad experience! i found rat droppings in the bathroom."

three-aces-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/three-aces-chicago,1,"The sweet corn pizzetta was an unexciting, literally, corn on flatbread..i want so much to review this place better but it&#39;s hard to based on the owners behavior.they have a good beer selection and some other drinks but we did not order any.the ambience is a cool laid back atmosphere, dimly lit with cool jams at a decent volume..it was ordered mid-rare and came out perfect.lovely beergarden in summer.i really liked the bacon jam..during the summer the patio is the place to be.had the ace burger, again, which is never a let down, the margarita pizza which is super thin and crispy, just how i like it.the prices are a little high for what is (or should be) a neighborhood pub, but they&#39;re worth it, for brunch, lunch, or dinner.i thought mine was a bit too sweet, but my husband enjoyed his.get some short rib pizza.service is good and the food is great!the food can be heavy on the gut.they have some good drinks there and some nice beers on draft.our order of some draughts and an old style can for me was filled slowly on a very packed saturday night as expected.enough said.the burger is one of the best in the city, and the bolognese fries are the exclamation point.i was enthusiastic to try three aces because it was close and the reviews were mostly positive.they have a pool table room which is cool for a small group.not the food..the menu changes up at 4 on fridays, so we got to order too.it really is.nothing remarkable about it at all.they did change the menu.which you think if there was only one ingredient missing they would let us know and decide for ourselves if we would be fine with it.i&#39;ve seen these signs in the past, usually accompanied by signs like &#34;no baggy pants&#34; &amp; &#34;no jerseys&#34;..-comfortable bar (they had coat hooks beneath it to hang your jacket).their staff is really knowledgable and attentive!.only complaint is that the chocolate cake was nothing special and tasted dry.every time we go i feel as though i&#39;m made to feel out of place.there is plenty of outdoor seating, which was wonderful for a nice summer night, and we were seated and served right away.this was very delicious and has an awesome outside sitting area.place had great food! had some great beer, outside enjoying great chicago weather!  recommend you come and try the ace burger and chicken sandwich.nice spot with a great patio for brunch/lunch or dinner, and while the food was decently priced and delicious (especially the poutine) we will not return on account of their bloody mary&#39;sdon&#39;t get me wrong, the bloody mary was tasty, but after paying an extra $8 (more like $11 after tax/tip) for their house made, pickled vegetables with our two bloodys - we were severely disappointed with the four itty bitty bites consisting of (half) a cocktail onion, and three dime sized chunks of pickle, carrot and celery that accompanied a mediocre (at best) olive.however the flavor overall was just decent.the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful.but it is a pretty big bar with lots of space and they take reservations too, and it is clear that for this area there are not many options around, so the fact that this is a full bar with a decent selection of beer is good.this is essentially a bar that serves food.it was our second time going there, and we won&#39;t ever go back.my boyfriend and i came for dinner one night at his suggestion because he had dined there before and really liked the food.it was a little chilly but we opted to sit outside in the patio at one of the many picnic benches.i love the pizza and the bar snacks.the hostess was cheerful and the waitress whose name i don&#39;t recall was efficient and knowledgeable.but i&#39;ll be back for a beer on the patio before eating dinner somewhere else in the future!.love this place! it&#39;s remarkably similar to my favorite local restaurant/watering hole, the black sparrow in lafayette, in.food was a little bit rich/heavy, but great if you are going to be drinking.the dish is a heaping plate of fries, topped with an almost tomato-creamy bolognese and parmesan.(okay so actually the definition is a place with great food and great beers..i was a bit taken aback by this behavior.i&#39;d suggest you do the same.though it doesn&#39;t look the best when you first walk in we got seated and was presented with a huge beer list tried a new beer, can&#39;t remember what it was called.should i ever end up on death row, the bolognese fries here would be part of my last meal.hey party people&#39;s! i&#39;m here at three aces again, just enjoying my bolognese fries and ace burger.very pleased with my selection here.they were alright, but nothing special.while my allergy is certainly not the fault of the waitress or restaurant, the common allergens were not listed by the dish and i was disappointed that i still had to pay full price for the meal that left me with a hefty hospital bill."
3-arts-club-cafe-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/3-arts-club-cafe-chicago-2,2,"And my where they delicious! with some of my hunger appeased and happy that the food would be good.the fish was wonderfully prepared and flavorful, and the skin was especially crisp and delicious.i tried the pear - with pineapple, ginger and thyme.i&#39;ve been here three times within the past month and have not been disappointed by their food or the atmosphere.i ordered the chicken breast that comes with some dressed greens or fries and my friend had the burger.the menu is simple and elegant..they don&#39;t take reservations, but part of the fun is putting your name in and walking around the store (with a coffee or glass of wine).i highly recommend coming to 3 arts club cafe for the ambiance - the interior consists of an indoor courtyard, greenery, and a huge fountain.you can also wander around the four floors of furniture- it&#39;s just so relaxing and pleasing to the eye! also a great place to get some interior decor inspo!.not only does this place have incredible food in a beautiful setting (do yourself a favor and try the carrots) you can grab yourself a drink and explore the floors and even go on the patio weather permitting.this place won&#39;t make me a regular, but its a nice treat once in a blue moon.the menu is very small, but what&#39;s on there is very good for the most part.anyhoo, not only was the service on point, the setting was quaint and comfortable..my dining partner and i had the cappuccino, arugula salad with fennel, grapes, almonds, goat cheese with a citrus vinaigrette.when i list it all out like that, it sounds kinda plain, i realize.the top floor had a nice outdoor garden that was closed when i went because of the weather.it was by charles d&#39;orleans about winter changing into spring, the english tranlsation can be found here:frenchtoday.due to its popularity, reservations are made only in person and expect the wait for a table to average between 30-90 minutes.however, the cafe is located in this beautifully designed building that makes everything very homey.you come for the ambiance.the burger, inspired by au cheval, burrata and beets are my favorite.2) it is a great value for the ambience of the place and the retail location (restoration hardware) that it is located in.thanks to reviews like this the wait to get a seat will keep going up.the food is okay, it&#39;s not amazing or anything special i just love the ambiance of this place and that&#39;s why i continue to come.it turned out to be almost a 2 hour wait.this is one of my favorite restaurants in chi town!..it&#39;s so beautiful here.it has 5 floors and each floors have a different categories of furniture.it was without a doubt the yummiest blt of my life!for celebrating birthdays, we received a scoop of chocolate ice cream in a lovely steel candelabra, with a birthday candle on top -- really cute touch!.we ordered ours with a side of bacon.all are awesome.honestly, i would recommend coming in a group larger than two so you can snag seating in the main area.i wish my friend ordered some wine, because that would have paired beautifully with this board.everything my wife and i ordered, we enjoyed.i gave four stars instead of five because i brought my husband here and he decided that we should do dinner somewhere else.what people might not know: there is free valet parking !the latte is the best in town !! it is so smooth and not acidic at all.in addition to that the food and drinks are top notch.it is amazing!!!! mimosas were good but they were $13 each :( beers are better priced.please just trust me and go check it out.its goals for brunch/life/home.they don&#39;t have a huge beer selection but a trumer pils was just $5 for a pint so pricing wasn&#39;t too terrible.the environment (restoration hardware store) provides a really wonderful conversation topic.there are a couple sandwich options and shared plates.the food was fantastic, i had smoked salmon plate $20 and bacon club $15 with a side salad ( or you can do fries for more calories if you are that hungry) the girls had a few different kinds for main course and we all really enjoyed the food and a fabulous atmosphere.but overall everything was really nice in the cafe area.i have always been a huge fan of rh and was bummed when they closed their location in lincoln park until i finally made the trip to their showroom and what a showroom it is! absolutely five floors of beauty and class.i&#39;m a huge brunch person and i&#39;ve been to many nice brunch places not just in chicago but worldwide, and i gotta say, this place is my favorite!!!first, the ambiance is just amazing! we sat in an indoor courtyard with a beautiful fountain in the middle.i arrived early and asked if we could be seated at one of the booths.we went there on sunday for brunch and arrived 10 minutes before it opens, and there was already a huge line out.this place is all about the decor, vibe, and atmosphere..not worth the wait  or money.the perfect place to come back to any season!.i had the rh scramble and beets here it&#39;s great but i wish they have more variety in their menu.after waiting over an hour, i decided to ask the hostess how much longer we would have to wait.my friend ordered the basil ice cream, which had a nice creaminess to it but strong basil flavor that shortly kicked in, which i didn&#39;t like.there is ample natural light coming in which is the biggest draw for me.it&#39;s just that impressive.very colorful..the menu is very small so check it out online and make sure you like what&#39;s offered because you will wait for a long time to sit.this place is absolutely worth coming and bringing out of towners to!the food is also delicious!!!..and afterwards, you can walk around and shop or in my case window shop for furniture!.5 starsfirst off, this place is fairly new.it almost feels like you are in a different country...i love everything about walking into this place from the rh store to the beautiful indoor/ outdoor atrium.if you are open to dining on a sofa, you will be seated faster.and nice furniture.afterwards you can wander around the beautiful showroom.the setting is just stunning and is really what you pay for as the food is fine but nothing special.their tagline states &#34;shopping reimagined&#34; and that it is in that it is a destination and an experience rather than a furniture store with a cafe.beautiful furnishings, upstairs rooftop garden! awesome..."

slurp-slurp-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/slurp-slurp-chicago,2,"Nice atmosphere and good service with great servers.i gave the place one star because the food was not great.i ordered a bowl of beef rib noodles and it was very flavorful and extremely delicious! only slight downside is that it&#39;s a small menu, so we went down the block for dessert afterwards.never been to this place before, and today i give it a try.i only wish the window to the kitchen was more on display.it&#39;s pretty evident that they rushed the dishes, but it was okay..noodles came out quickly, broth was very flavorful, solid amount of meat inside, and i love that they leave sauces and these pickled veggies on each table so you can add it into your noodles if you&#39;d like.but crazy good.this place is not just your average noodle soup bowl.they also had a container of pickled veggies on the side of the table as a condiment and i ate that with my dumplings.but the experience today is soooo horrible!  thinking i&#39;ll never go there again.the price point for hand-pull noodles is around $8-10.the broth was ok though but not great.it&#39;s great for people who like to take pictures of themselves and their food.the soup was complex and has umami, but i prefer a more spicy, chongqing style soup.it&#39;s made with a unique kind of peppercorn that sort of numbs your mouth.can&#39;t ask for more at $9.the food and service was good but i won&#39;t be back.95), vegetable stir fry noodle (7.it was sliced thin and not cooked long enough, nor did it have that gelatinous richness typical oxtail has.there are some appetizers available, but the pork and chive dumplings are a must try.beef brisket, tripe and shank..overall,  i am glad i gave this a try!."
urbanbelly-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urbanbelly-chicago,1,"I just couldn&#39;t wrap my head around eating a bowl of ramen that had lemongrass and cilantro in it.two of us visited this place on a rainy saturday afternoon.i ordered the urbanbelly ramen (ramen noodles with braised pork belly, mushrooms &amp; egg) and chilled vietnamese coffee.toppings wise - the bowel was definitely lacking in decorations.i would visit again if i was in the area.the chicken katsu was well cooked.it&#39;s casual dining - you order at a counter and it&#39;s communal seating, and this location also has a nice patio to enjoy during the warmer months.when our food came, it was pipping hot and ready to warm our stomaches.the phat rice was sort of a disappointment.pork belly was oh-so tender and dat broth tho! ahmazing..the service was good and friendly.$7 for 4 very small dumplings is nuts..came here for the first time after living in chicago for 3 years and i&#39;m sad that i won&#39;t be back for awhile since i&#39;ve recently moved out of chicago.this is the most disappointing dish.it was nice, but really hot especially since i was sitting out in the sun.good beer too.the only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the pricing..doh.came here for a quick lunch with a friend, thought it was delicious and will definitely be coming back..words cannot explain how much i love their lemongrass chicken rice.i really like this place a lot and would definitely come back here.highly recommend it.good price for the quality and size as well.i am so happy to have enjoyed two dishes and two appetizers from urbanbelly and will quickly do so again..50),  lastly the pineapple-guava macaroon was 90% coconut shavings, and there wasn&#39;t enough of the pineapple-guava mixture in the middle to taste any.dishes were comforting and flavorful.although i may question the authenticity of the dish,  it was really good.love the living wall too!.nothing good nor bad about them.perfect go-to restaurant quick eats.i saw it a few months ago and i&#39;m kicking myself i didn&#39;t grab one.so close to my job, i&#39;ll def be a regular!!!!.i really liked the setup of the restaurant--very casual but very unique decor and thought the service was fantastic, especially for a more cafe-style restaurant.the ramen was well balanced, the broth spicy but not overbearing.love this place and will comeback next time for sure....will try the wicker park location next! :)..had the phat noodles and sweet potatoe dumpling..a little bit oily so i had to rinse it off a little, but the flavors were great.i can&#39;t wait to go back and try more things from the menu.we have 2 under 2 and there is not too many place where you can actually relax and eat.i had the phat rice.the urbanbelly ramen never disappoints.i was basically robbed while eating at urbanbelly.but.beef, chicken and pork lol.this place has very good food and they do not pretend.i ordered the phat rice and i&#39;m a huge fan of how the fat just seeps into the rice...new favorite lunch spot! the menu is simple and delicious, with options for dumplings, fried rice, ramen, and more! craft beer &amp; specialty items are also available for sale.friendly staff, awesome food.overall, average experience.all hot food so a little difficult for summer.drinks ($11) were 5 star quality..so here&#39;s the dilemma - the food is astounding.and mind you, i&#39;m one of those people for whom cilantro can be a little overwhelming.thank you to the staff for allowed us to seat on the couches in the very back just for the guys to watch their football game.urban belly is incredible, the staff is super friendly, the dumplings are delicious ( go duck or wagyu beef fo sho) they have some really inventive noodle dishes that look as wonderful as they taste.such a way to keep their customer."

(unlike others that give you warm water, urgh)i must say, although portions were large, they were not heavy in your tummy, which is surprisingly good.well known to any fan of super late night dining or exceedingly early breakfasts, valois is a hyde park institution.disgusting!.just go along with it...very much a cafeteria experience.great food and great prices!.if you want a big meal, fast and hot and served by real people then this is your spot.folks in my party enjoy the french toast and pancakes too!.great cooks..it&#39;s everything everyone says it is.not gooey with cheese as one would expect.), and can be had for a mere $4..everything omelets with hash browns are sooo good!service was quick, too.on a sunday morning they had a lot of staff and the service was great.large portions! great tasting food! fair prices!nothing more needs to be said.not wowed..this is the kind of place you go for a breakfast/brunch/lunch after a really late night out..the wait for the food was about 25 minutes.will be back next time i&#39;m in town.they&#39;re so streamline your order almost instantly comes out the second you order!it&#39;s really really cheap to eat here and you get a discount with a uchicago id.lots of food for the money.that is really no frills.we will have to come for the famous breakfast..the service is so fast and reliable that a seemingly terrible wait gets handled very quickly.the portions are large and the service is speedy!.if you&#39;re looking for a regular tasty meal with a good price, this is the place to go.the hashbrowns that came with it were really burnt.i ordered #5 off obama&#39;s favorites menu and it was quite a bit of food and tasty.come on feel valois! girls, rock your boys! a consistently excellent hangover-breakfast spot, cheap with large portions, and delivered with stern efficiency.tried the baked chicken and it was good, the breast was a little dry.i had the steak omelette; so delicious! the coffee here is great as well! will definitely come here again!.&#34; the guys running the line are always very friendly and funny, too.i can see why obama makes it his favorite place.i really like the midwest cafeteria concept (i&#39;ve only ever seen it here in chicago and in indianapolis at places like manny&#39;s and shapiro&#39;s).for saturday or sunday morning/noontide for breakfast/brunch/what not have you, there will be a wait, although not excessive.it will be busy and with good reason, it is always fantastic.they&#39;re so good!  the biscuits were a tad dry, though.ordered mediterranean omelet.simple as.the portions are large and the prices are reasonable.it offers delicious, generous breakfast, lunch, and dinner offerings quickly and cheaply.i&#39;d recommend the french toast and hashbrowns.really most of the stuff is pretty much sorta-above-average diner food, made pretty fresh (not the sliced meats, sometimes those can be cold - my corned beef sandwich was pretty cold).my little guys had pancakes and sausage.dinner food is prepared cafeteria style.it&#39;s a must have in hyde park! just moved here and i love it!.my mediterranean omelet was quite tasty, as were the potatoes, but i&#39;ll be a happier man if i never eat that biscuit again.or just a snack on a sunday afternoon.95 for massive portions of food,  and rather pleasant servers is not bad at all.the seating area is pretty much old styled and old schooled."
yan-bang-cai-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yan-bang-cai-chicago,1,"What a great and original sichuan cuisine restaurant! yan bang cai sichuan restaurant is my favorite sichuan restaurant in chinatown.steamed buns are not the best, but definitely enjoyable.stopped in for lunch today, and i was the only customer.for someone grew up in sichuan, this is my new favorite sichuan food place...food is very authentic just like we had back in chengdu.the chairman mao pork is outstanding.the seven step duck is my favorite, spicy and crispy.remember to get 15% off if u pay by cash..the food hails from zigong in the sichuan province, which is known for their salt mines.the food is greasy and some dishes does not taste fresh at all.excellent service and the food was even better.delicious food, been a regular customer for the longest.on my next visit, if their pork is anything like that shrimp dish, i&#39;m done.there seemed to be lot of chili oil, but other than that, it didn&#39;t have much of a flavor.the perfect amount of heat and flavor came together to make this dish amazing.we asked why it was so salty and if it was by design.i was here twice and both times waitress tried very hard to sell &#34;american&#34; chinese food (there is a separate menu - make sure you&#39;re not looking at that once - ask for the regular menu), and then up-sell whole duck for the two of us..apparently, the boy had picked up take out here before (i didn&#39;t know where it came from) and it was completely unremarkable..always hit with everyone i bring here...hopefully i&#39;m not on the naughty food list.have tried all the szechuan places in the city, this one is the best by far.all of us were very familiar with sichuan food, and we all agreed that the food was great and authentic.i don&#39;t think i would order it again.we ordered the mouthwatering chicken, spicy fish fillet in broth, mapo tofu, and a pork dish with wood ear and peppers--varying degrees of spiciness, cooked to the same high standard of epicure.very fast normally other places take forever to serve but they where good with time.authentic chinese food..the pickled veggie fish stew had flavor in the soup but not the most important thing, the fish..the only main downside is that it&#39;s a bit more expensive than chinese restaurants i&#39;m used to as the portions are rather small, but the flavor makes up for it.the yushiang eggplant was texturally not too squishy but could udr some deep fried crunchy edges.this is my favorite restaurant in chinatown.amazing food, especially the fried eggplant and the lamb with sweet potato.i am not even hungry any more.great job yan bang cai!.thank god, because surprisingly they were the best ive had in chinatown thus far.kind of rude, i know, but i really was too traumatized to eat there after that, no matter how good the food is rumored to be..we had to get up and leave after being then totally ignored for over 20 minutes., and it has better service.food was in small portions for the price.a little on the sweeter side but not excessively so.so, in my humble opinion, if you like spicy food and are a little bit adventurous about eating, this is a place in chicago that you have to try."

ēma-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/%C4%93ma-chicago-2,2,"Haven&#39;t tried the falafels yet but i&#39;ve yet to have falafels as good as tel aviv&#39;s.two reasons for docking a star: though there were a few other tables open throughout our meal, we ended up at an awkward table, right next to the kitchen..i&#39;ll be back.took them here.it&#39;s not my place to tell you what to do in this situation, you&#39;re the expert here.i also think that this approach to cuisine really does lend itself well to varied mediterranean fare (spreads, hummus, and lamb just to name some examples).came here for a business lunch.everything was great - definitely would come back and order the stracciatella and octopus again! the atmosphere was nice and classy without being pretentious.$16+ for a few pieces of undercooked salmon on not great rice was too steep in my opinion.the staff was nice.i love their lebanese selection of wine.apps were good, falafel and chicken just okay though..favorites were the risotto and the broccoli.there is no value here.ema is a tapas place - something my husband despises b/c he feels we get little food for a bigger price..will probably be on my must visit again list.the server was very personable, helpful, and attentive.mike took charge of ordering on my behalf.the one  playing usher looked sad and expressionless.they are still training the bartenders on the cocktail list, which is interesting, and if you&#39;re into &#34;celebrity&#34; chefs, top chef alum cj could be seen expediting all night long.tapas style means you&#39;ll be ordering 3 dishes per person.i&#39;ve been here twice and both times i left with a big smile! i would recommend trying to spicy hummus - it was really good! the falafel was great too.it is difficult to please those of us who experienced the true flavors of the mediterranean during our travels around greece, italy, marocco, egypt and the likes.the front of house staff was really rude - i had a 715 reservation and was seated at 740.spicy hummus is delicious and the pita could be had every day.he was also able to assist me in picking out a wine, which ended up being perfect.take it off the menu and we will come after you! this dish was amazing!!!!! : )everything from dips to entrees were fabulous.everything was amazing from the lamb hummus, charred eggplant spread, chicken kefta, grilled octopus, market salmon special, falafel, and cauliflower.my one gripe about this place is the portion sizes -- they really are very small, even for a small plates restaurant.service was very good, atmosphere was awesome definitely would recommend it.i&#39;ve been horizontal since i got home 3 hours ago and i still feel uncomfortable.i don&#39;t want to be a stalker lol.good service, nice ambiance and decent menu selection.phenomenal head waiter who was very friendly and accommodating.the guy is tall, you can&#39;t miss him.i haven&#39;t made it in to ema yet, but i made sure to get lunch from rotisserie ema as soon as it opened..i will definitely be back!.also, the deconstructed baklava was literally terrible.a friend and i dined here recently and absolutely loved it! we met after work so were able to snag some seats at the back bar without a reso which was great! the decor and atmosphere were fantastic.i&#39;m so sorry to leave a negative review, but i just reflected my own experience.i am obsessed!!!! this place was amazing! went tonight for the 1st time and sat at the front bar.yum, yum, yum!..none of the items are &#34;oh my god&#34; delicious, but it&#39;s all better than average.it was sweet and spicy, as it had what appeared to be pickled jalapeño in it.telling everyone i know to run do not walk to ema--my new favorite restaurant in the city!!.such a shame for such a beauty.i really enjoyed the calimari salad and we also ordered the tenderloin kabob as well as the chicken kabob which was remarkably juicy.here are the dishes i&#39;ve tried:* avocado &amp; sweet pea spread - 5/5* house made stracciatella - 5/5* pan roasted cauliflower - 4/5* salmon - 4/5* halibut - 5/5* beef tenderloin kabab - 4/5the service was excellent and i would bring guests back here again if they were looking for this type of cuisine.if you&#39;re more than two people, you definitely need more than one plate of each dish!my only issue was at the end of our meal, i asked the wait if he could split the cheque between the two of us equally, with the cocktail on my friend&#39;s bill.michael, our waiter, gave us many great suggestions!  to start, they offer spreads.the dips are delicious but a must try is the frozen greek yogurt.absolutely fantastic.we probably wouldn&#39;t return unless we have friends that suggest it.i thoroughly enjoyed the light, mediterranean cuisine.i loved sitting up at the bar, the service was wonderful and the food was delicious.every though the place is very busy, there is a full service bar - first come first serve.however, the charred eggplant &#34;spread&#34; was particularly upsetting as this celebrated mediterranean dish was reduced to a bland puree that had the texture of californian baby food.definitely try a hummus or spread with their house bread.we had the crispy potatoes, broccoli, salmon, and a little rosé for dinner.expensive small plate offerings.the wait staff was extremely helpful and the chef stopped by our table to welcome us! i normally don&#39;t love the idea of eating at a restaurant inside a hotel in the neighborhood, but ema has a warm atmosphere that is not an average hotel restaurant!.ema appealed to us because it was described as a cali light take on mediterranean fare..helped us with the menu.everything we tried was delish!  mediterranean tapas greek-turkish california style..food was good but the menu is meant for sharing and they didn&#39;t course anything out so all of our food was brought out at the same time."

the chickpea kale salad was huge and shareable.the oatmeal definitely stands out as a little different to try (pricey but good).com! the hubby and i split cheesy hash browns and the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes.it was totally worth it.the french toast was a little dry for my liking, and the crispy chicken was crispy cold.5*, love how stringy and crispy these are!

lucky i was by myself this trip and got seating right at the bar! the service here was great and i was greeted promptly, recommended the little goat coffee drink (their own hand made salted caramel with goats milk latte.how can you go wrong with bacon and maple syrup?for lunch, i tried their reuben.the spicy and sour flavors of the kimchi just didn&#39;t jive with the traditional reuben for me..i&#39;d want to come back to try the other things though.despite making a reservation, we  had a long wait that our waiter made up to us in the form of a free appetiser.chili pepper sauce ."
tanta-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tanta-chicago,1,"The drinks were also very unique and delicious.first of all, i&#39;ve heard amazing things about this place through word of mouth.so good..seriously the best cocktails around.fresh, tasty and clean scallops with fish and an awesome slightly tangy sauce.* pulpo (octopus, chimichurri, crispy garlic, olive sauce) - one of my favorite dishes, very flavorful!we continued with the &#34;causitas&#34; section (whipped peruvian potatoes and aji)* clásica (crab, red tobiko, avocado, tomato, egg, huancaina) - another one of my favorites! very light and fresh tasting.we really enjoyed the creative food &amp; drinks, the good service, and the atmosphere.can&#39;t go wrong with the classic pisco sour, or any of the drinks, really.in the past i believe they were more of a weekend brunch and dinner spot.whatever you do.pure delightful wonderful authentic peruvian food.great atmosphere in this trendy place, but it&#39;s a little difficult to book a table, and expect to wait to get seated if you go there on a weekend - just relax and enjoy some pre-dinner drinks! totally worth it.it was like purchasing raw chicken wings from a grocery store and dropping the uncooked chicken into a cooked rice dish.they start you off with plantain chips and polleria sauce, which were really good considering i&#39;m not even a big fan of plantains.however, the flavors and dishes we tried were all phenomenal and unique.awesome date place.entree portion size was good enough.start your meal with causita anticuchera and ceviche criollo.mix that with everything else i got and i call it heaven.people:hostess was pleasant!waiter was genuinely nice and knew the menu well.absolutely get the causa and the anticucho plate for brunch.tanta has become a favorite of mine in chicago&#39;s river north area.-- 3/5lomo saltado: very tender meat..somewhere between dressy and casual.i got the estofado de cordero (lamb leg, picture coming soon i hope) and it was amazing.the girls and i always have a blast.i can&#39;t get enough of this place.the quail egg bite is delicious and the pisco sour drink is tart but smooth.service was on point! i&#39;ll definitely be back!.it had so much acidity i couldn&#39;t taste the different ingredients.the service was amazing.the calamari was delicious..there&#39;s an interesting list of cocktails, topped by a fragrant take on the classic pisco sour.its a unique array of food (peruvian/japanese) and everything is delicious.food wise, everything we ordered came highly recommended by the waiter, except the ceviche.upscale dining that is both visually appealing and mouth-watering..i will get you the quantity you need for each small plate.the downside is that each one was $5, which is kind of ridiculous.the fresh fish and tart flavors of the marinade get your tastebuds ready for the main entrees.seemed rookie to me.the waitstaff are incredibly friendly and the el chingon is the best spicy margarita in chicago..if you were going to skip something, it should be the ceviche.amazing!! cannot believe it took us this long to finally get here and try out tanta.again, no.tanta has a small, but strong, cocktail list.the shortbread in desert plate is soft and crumbly.i went to tanta recently with a good friend of mine  from the bay area while i was in town for a job interview and she was in town for a work conference.this rating is based on our overall experience at tanta.i have never tried peruvian food before but this is great! it has an asian fusion| food+ the sashimi platterthe sashimi was fresh and i like the freshness of lemon juice in it.newly added to my list of favorite chicago restaurants!  we came for restaurant week and were able to order off both the regular menu and the special restaurant menu, which was convenient for trying a little bit of everything.when you come here, please try the mousse de chocolate fortunato (chocolate mousse) or the tarta de manza (apple pie).the seasonings and flavors are mixed to perfection in every single dish..this corn cake was sweet and creamy on the inside and had the perfect golden color and hint of crunchiness on the outside.everything we had was exquisitely well made and just simply amazing.i was very pleased with every single thing i tasted.it was my first time a couple of months ago and it was an amazing experience! then i went back last week with some friends, we had the same feeling and experience than last time.the service was on point and just as we were finishing the last bit of one dish, the next dish would arrive as if on cue.food was creative and actually very good- the nikei cebiche and chaufa aeropuerto were standouts.we ordered the tanta  ceviche, octopus anticuchos, causita rellena and arroz con mariscos aeropuerto and for dessert i had the mazamorra.so tanta basically takes raw fish, scallops, shrimp, and other seafood (sashimi style) and infuses it with bold latin flare! the result is a delightful mix of freshness and strong flavors..i can&#39;t blame it on them being busy, because there were many open tables.food: we started with a ceviche tasting that was a great combination of fresh fish, punchy heat, and strong acid notes across the three types.the service was subpar with an impatient server who was terrible at listening.it&#39;s really between 3.addictive.i don&#39;t usually write a review but the food and service was so good that i can&#39;t help myself! this place is a must try!!!! my only regret is that i am leaving early tomorrow that i won&#39;t be able to come back.a drink was about $14 and two chicken skewers were about $10.i ordered the pisco punch and it was delicious it&#39;s nice to go to a  place that has great drinks.it is huge, tasty, the best potatoes and rice to accompany.food is a 3.so good, i ended up ordering two.both cocktails were good and came out in a timely fashion.then i tried the &#34;la rusa&#34; pisco, st germaine, orange, lemon, campari ice and thyme.i will definitely be coming back here.you will not be disappointed in the food.our server, carolina was super friendly."

 she&#39;s the best, very professional and keeps the bottomless mimosas coming.the french toast is what sticks out though!!! :)i look forward to going back and sampling more of the menu and taking advantage of the unlimited bloody mary&#39;s for $12 during brunch!.service varies, i&#39;ve had two good bartenders and two just so-so.for a side had the grilled polenta marinara which was good.however, what made up for my complaints was the food.i go every weekend.for water.the bloody bar is.after being there for around 20 minutes she finally took our order.what a nice surprise zia&#39;s lago vista was! only a surprise because i had never heard of it before..our server approached our table without any kind of greet.bigger group of us and we sat outside on the front patio.even if i didn&#39;t eat at zia&#39;s (i of course, did) i would still give this place 5 stars based on the solid fact that they have unlimited mimosas (and bloody mary&#39;s) to $10!! let&#39;s just say my gal pals and i had quite the festive sunday when we were there.i was recommended here by a work colleague.went with good friends for a great brunch!!! don&#39;t know how we didn&#39;t hear about this sooner! if you go , ask for brian, great and friendly server.tasty desserts too: tiramasu was good but the apple gallette (spelled wrong, sorry)  was absolutely delicious; flakey tender crust surrounding sliced baked apples with ice cream on top..food-wise, i got the make your own omelette (mushrooms and provolone) with potatoes.ordered poached eggs and it was over cooked.girl orders the pizza with veggies, i ask if i can get like waffles with fruit..my friend ordered two appetizers (i use that term loosely as they were huge and one could have sufficed and this is for a grown man)  he had the eggplant parmesan and the pumpkin stuffed ravioli and both were delicious.she was attentive and the food was delicious! had a caesar salad for starters, and the rigatoni piedmontese as my entree.the pizzas have a nice thin, almost cracker like crust which worked for me.got &#34;the squad&#34; together for brunch here on a sunday and i don&#39;t think there was a single thing about zia&#39;s we didn&#39;t just love.but i do enjoy the bottomless mimosa/bloody bar deal..waiters need to settle their checkouts away from bar counter and let patrons enjoy what we pay for.i really enjoyed my dish so maybe next time.decided to get some meatballs to give them a try.they always have a $20 white and red bottle special.i will definitely be going back here!.seriously, the whole place will remind you of an italian villa..great atmosphere, delicious food.we occasionally like to eat at the bar and this place has a big u-shaped bar that can sit like 40 people.at least the service was friendly.i do not recommend this place at all.i really love this place -- the food is marvelous -- service is outstanding (thanks george and hugo).i went here for brunch for my birthday and everything was great! the bottomless mimosas were delicious and the servers were constantly refilling our glasses, which isn&#39;t the norm for many places with this deal.it&#39;s not hard to see why - zlv turned out to be a really beautiful space that, while only a few years old, felt like it could&#39;ve been around for decades with it&#39;s gigantic front door, high ceilings and great decor.when i got home later that evening, i opened my togo box to find they had given me someone else&#39;s togo box.we sat outside on a beautiful day so that helped.-bloody mary &#34;bar&#34;: they make the bloody mary for you, you add the spice and you skewer of accouterments...i have complaints about the service.i&#39;m not sure, but i believe they deep fried these? otherwise, i have no explanation as to how they were so infused with grease.big mistake.service was great! portions were huge and food was delicious.i went here for brunch recently and it was amazing..i thought it was pretty cool to see a self service bloody mary bar.--be ready for the doors when you walk in.let me start by saying brunch in chicago is everywhere so what makes this place so awesome? well.and i&#39;m really sad they don&#39;t serve pancakes!.perfect al dente!!! i had the rigatoni which was excellent; everyone else at the table seemed delighted with their dishes as well.zia&#39;s is so much fun for brunch! the bottomless mimosa deal is wonderful and they are awesome at refilling for your class is empty..especially our last visit, we had a really sweet waiter i believe his name was jake?the food has never been a miss, the bread and spreads that come out are delicious, they give u cheese with the olive oil- they get it! another all time favorite of ours that we typically share is the butternut squash raviolis- yuuuum! the meatballs are also really great a must try.the waiter we had was very attentive and definitely knew the food and wine/beer menu well.we had an hour and a half wait (no problem, we didn&#39;t have a reservation) but we went to the bar, ordered mimosas, watched as the bartender filled everyone else&#39;s mimosas for 20 minutes before i had to remind him twice that we were waiting."

3-greens-market-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/3-greens-market-chicago-3,2,"If it didnt cost me 25 dollars for lunch i would be back more often.great place to chill, work, or meet friends...the ambience is cool, i&#39;ll give it that.was really excited to have options for a salad and hot bar combined with a small cheval burger!!! the burger did not disappoint, but we went for dinner at 6pm (they close at 8) and the hot bar was completely empty and salad bar was down to a very, very sad set of selections.stay opened until 9pm on the weekdays and i will give the final star.the salad bar is solid, though i&#39;ve seen more expansive salad options before.will return during what i guess is their peak hours(lunch) and hopefully update with more stars!.amazing neighborhood joint.everything was good as they had just opened when we came in.they serve  tomato paste as ketchup !!   reallydesert is a oatmeal cookie ! really.anyway, when i saw that they&#39;d spun off a smaller operation called small cheval, i resolved to try the burger that way, but somehow never managed to get there.definitely coming back to check out other parts of the market and looking forward to them being open on the weekends.most hot/salad bar options are usually just ok, but at this place, that is not the case.i absolutely love 3 greens.the ordering &amp; paying process is a little off, but doable.replenished frequently, and very clean.the cashier was nice.the brioche bun is superb.this review is based on the soft opening and sodikoff changed his mind so often god knows what you will find on your visit...i didn&#39;t try the au cheval burger or the dillamans burger because i didn&#39;t want to be dissapointed.lots of people in line as well.i find myself doing lunch or dinner here a few times a month.but they have it!unfortunately the burger was nowhere near as good as au cheval or small cheval.their prices are higher than wf, but the taste is better.this is a great lunch break spot.if that persists, i won&#39;t be able to daytime it as often as i&#39;d want to because the food and atmosphere is a win.the food is first come first served since they make everything from scratch and once it&#39;s gone, it&#39;s gone.their salad looked decent as did their soup bar.definitely would understand when times are busy, but not during slower times..the kitchen seems tiny and throngs of people wait for their food.i think i&#39;ll stick to jewel osco for my salad bar needs (due to price alone), but this will definitely be my go to for random food cravings and a burger during the week.they need more seating, but i&#39;d be back for lunch if was nearby..the toppings (chopped onions, dijonaise, pickles, cheese) paired amazingly with the two thin, freshly grilled patties and perfect brioche bun.if you want the perfect burger, you still gotta pay your dues.so good.why would i tip a cashier when i did all the work."

han-202-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/han-202-chicago,2,"Food was excellent.food was delicious with many options for each course.appetizers were our favorite course as all 3 of them were very good..$25 for the best prix fixe i&#39;ve had in a really long time..we asked for a table, and they refused to seat us because we didn&#39;t have a reservation.we started around 6:30 and were not done until 9.will definitely go back.they sort of just get everything right.the food is also very delicious.the default offering is the 4 course menu for $35, which is an amazing price - the portions are not huge, but unless you have a huge appetite (or are a glutton), by the time you have finished the main course, you will have just enough room for dessert, and you will not leave hungry.at the price point, i expected a little more from hans 202 (better prepared food, bigger rice portions?).the shrimp toast its like a symphony in your mouth.its located in the heart of the bridgeport neighborhood.ambience is amazing.nonetheless, i will definitely go back.great find :)..service was very slow.we had been once before and i thought it was good.we had the green apple and steak salad along with the red beet salad for the first course.grace l...the room was small and understated with an easy noise level so we were able to converse freely.well that and better service to warrant the perfect 5 stars.the atmosphere was cute although the restaurant, and subsequently the kitchen, were very small.reservations can be made on line through their website- you will be called back to confirm that you are still coming the day before...the duck breast was probably the best duck i have ever had.who&#39;s that tall, really? short girls take note: bring your own little mirror.can&#39;t help wondering why some residents in bridgeport or any where else would even think the food here is anything but mediocre.when we didn&#39;t finish it the waitress said if we wanted she would bring another dish, which was a nice gesture.:)  i sat by the window up front with a friend as your table was wrapping up..i mean, i get the impression that employees earnestly try to please guests; however, some very real language barriers have kept that from coming to fruition 100% of the time.and though i&#39;m keeping them at a steady five sexy stars i wish we could have gotten the rock star treatment from our first visit where our beer and wine were kept cold and brought out as needed.recently met a few friends here for dinner and had a blast.from my salad to to desert was an experience that i will not forget.food and service were awesome.i love coming here and have brought many family and friends for different occasions.they messed up two orders but it&#39;s hard to be mad with food this good.honest review: amaizin really affordable! only 35 bucks u can get a coupon by taking a business card at the front desk do it! no corkage fee! its byob so pop some bottles lol best things are the lobster for a first course/ second course crab cake or foie gras/ third course: lamb chop or pork loin/ last course walnut tartletfree course: egg custard im sad its not the salmon macaroon noo!!! this was so good though the texture of it was amaizing supper fluffy and and soft picture a temperpedic pillow n the flavor was out of this world supper rich n the pastry itself was supper crispy this was the best egg custard ive ever had everybody in the table loved itcrispy quail: omg i have never had better quail in my life the skin was so crunchy like picture the best fried chicken n this is a 100 times better its not deep fried its pan fried so its not greasy n the flavor was perfect wasnt bland at all n there was lemon on the side which i was skeptical n it made the quail taste so much better! made it really pop only thing is if i had a complaint is i like a sauce i dont like things without a sauceshrimp toast: omg i love shrimp toast n this was by far the best rendition it was so crunchy!!! n the taste of the bread was nice and buttery but without being greasy the addition of the sesame seeds really adds another dimension of flavor n there was a good shrimp flavor sometimes theres not alot of shrimp in it not the case here n the sauce was sweet so it went perfect with the saltiness of the shrimp toast it was sweet n salty the best combinationlobster fried rice: this was done differently it has a rich buttery taste to it it had alot of lobster like alot alot n it was cooked perfectly it was a pretty high quality fried rice not the cheap ones people are use to the only problem is it didnt have soy sauce n it needed that extra salty note to it but besides that really goodshrimp and scallop: this was really good it was sweet salty n spicy n the vegetables were cooked perfectly really crunchy the shrimp and the scallops were cooked perfectly it wasnt the best thing here but it was good i would order again over other things herefrench pork chop: omg this is so good!!!!! n the portion is huge! i never had a pork chop like this it was cooked perfectly the sauce is a really rich black pepper sauce n its covered in onions omg so good i usually dont like a bunch of onions n garlic but this was a home run so rich n the sharpness of all the onions really paired well with the pork chop i will always order this from now on!!lemon cheesecake: i dont really like cheese cake its not really my thing like i dont even like the cheese cake factory but this was really delicious like the texture of it was perfect meaning not overly frozen i hate that n it was lemony so the sour note so it cut through the sweetness of the cheese cake then it had a strawberry sorbet which was outstanding u could really taste the strawberry n it paired well with the cheese cakecrab salad: homerun.i wouldn&#39;t object if friends wanted to come back here again, but for $50+ that i spend after tax and tip i might venture elsewhere.her fish was flaky, delicate, and seasoned with ginger and fresh scallions.we found the food to be outstanding although if you are looking for large portions this is not the place for you.the sea bass, general tso chicken, vegetables, dumplings, salad were all fresh tasting and beautifully presented.we will definitely go back!.all this, with two bottles of san pelligrino for the table was only $65.it&#39;s a byob which is good.the old system was ten dollars less but had many extra charges for items such as rice.i wish there was more of it.no fortune cookies!!! how are we supposed to know what lotto numbers to play tomorrow?5.not sure what dish it was, either the miso soup, the lamb entree or the shrimp and scallop dish my friend had.$25 a person, and you get a soup, salad, appetizer, entree, and a dessert.but it just wasn&#39;t filling.overall a really great experience.cute cutlery, fancy wine glasses (byob!), modern plates, linen napkins.i love the food, and the customer service.a great deal for a delicious dinner.when we got to dessert i ordered the chocolate soufflé but when i tasted it, i though it was nasty and wanted to swap it out for the crem brûlée instead.my friend took me to han 202, and i was just blown away by the experience.overall, han 202 is very well worth the trip to bridgeport..blueberry tart.the snow fell as giant crystals, as i parked on a side street and walked over..the experience was a home run at every point.it&#39;s unfortunate when an otherwise good restaurant has horrible customer service skills..this is definitely not your run-of-the-mill chinese restaurant.the king crab miso soup was decent, tasted kind of like the end of a bowl of instant ramen with a piece of crab.the tea itself smelled strongly of what seemed to be perfume, and the smell and taste were so disagreeable that i drank one sip of it and pushed it far away from me.i wanted just 1 more bite which intensified my desire for the next course."
pub-royale-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pub-royale-chicago,1,"The venue itself is really cute and a great summer time hangout; there&#39;s a patio outside the restaurant or you can sit inside with wide open entrances.try the fried cauliflower and the garlic naan! really everything we tried was fantastic, can&#39;t wait to visit again soon.best cauliflower ever...served with rice and some crunchy bits.we both liked the samosas, too!to drink, he got the mango lassi (very strong!), and i got the #1 (gin, strawberry, cucumber) - it was mostly ice..she said it takes awhile for the pie.they did have other dishes that are surprising and delicious, like their homemade paneer.in both cases, i just want a little more clarity.i ordered a shirley temple and asked for a big cup.friends i was with had the hot chicken (well breaded and came with some fresh naan to soak up all the spicy sauce leftovers) and the pub royale burger with cheese - which was described as a top 5 burger from a chicago guy who knows his stuff..i&#39;ll be back here for sure to try more!..i relly enjoyed their mango lassi, and riyale cup #1.we tried the lamb dumplings, the salt cod samosa, the fries and the gobi manchurian.the people that ordered palak paneer got their food way early, and folks that ordered the burgers got them later.the food here is delicious.yum.they bring said, still really enjoyed my meal!.)i&#39;ve always had a good time when i&#39;ve come here and have also always felt compelled to compliment the chef(s).much different from the joints around it..i went in knowing it was supposed to be a british-indian place, and i get it with one of the things being a pot-pie with indian flavors inside but the things my husband and i ordered fell flat.not the biggest fan of indian food but this place turned me around.it was a freezing cold, blustery night and we were seated in the front of the restaurant.the portions were kind of small for most things...they have a great list of selections and also have daily specials as well! we also had exceptional service and are in love with the patio area..the samosas were bomb.the service was remarkably good, it was unbelievable how knowledgable our server jolene was.it wasn&#39;t overly creamy, and perfect with naan.most importantly, the atmosphere hits the nail on the head.it looked like a lot of other tables also ordered it.) if we would&#39;ve stayed longer post-dinner, i would&#39;ve tried yet another number.the buttered paneer (more similar to a paneer tikka masala) was one of the most flavorful paneer dishes i&#39;ve ever had.it wasn&#39;t crowded yet at that time and we got seated right away.for the entrees, the indian hot chicken and the rabbit pie are good on their own.to drink i had the #1 royale cup - delicious.today we decided to stop by for brunch and were equally impressed.i have to say, i regularly have cravings for their buttery naan.we went during brunch so the options were not much.my date and i enjoyed a delicious brunch: gobi manchurian, peanut noodle, and kedgeree--we loved them all and i&#39;d be hard-pressed to pick a favorite: possibly the peanut noodle--i have a soft spot for peanut sauce.i will chalk the meh service up to the fact that they were pretty damn busy which is a good thing for them.we tried:-royale with cheese burger - excellent!-garlic naan - yes-samosa - simple but good-chicken tikka roll - basically spicy indian burrito, it was ok-gobi manchuria - fried cauliflower, too much breading-royale cup cocktail - well balanced, refreshing.we ordered a ton on the menu.we went over to fat pour for some drinks, and came back at 9:45 and still had a 20 minute wait for a table.went here after seeing them on the bon appétit top 50 reataurants in america list and it did not disappoint.great service and food was delicious and served hot.we ordered a frozen mango lassi, samosas, keema paratha, and the mussels with naan.letherbee royale cup #2it is like a snow cone for getting fucked up!this place is great, could be pretentious but is 100% not, bartenders are great and knowledgable, only to be outdone by their friendly engaging nature.if you like fish and chips, you are gonna love these samosas.really good food, even better beer list.looking forward to trying some of the other iterations.that allowed us to jump into the great beer list as well.my favorites here are : gobi manchurian,royale w/ cheese, combination # 2, and fries.the mussels were absolutely delightful! the broth was light and airy with just the right hint of lime.consumed:royals cups #4mango lassiindia hot chickenlamb dunpling.the eton mess was a pretty glass of thick, buttery whipped cream interlaced with fun meringue crumbs and layered with a well-balanced apple compote.really developed flavors, wonderful textures, and great execution.i would have liked to have had a beer but their current draft list is a good representation of the brewing season.from least fave (which doesn&#39;t mean bad) to favorite:lamb dumplings - good, but i&#39;m also partial to lamb.stopped in just going for a walk one time, and i&#39;ve been back every time i&#39;ve been visiting and i&#39;m in the wicker park area.come back earlier when it&#39;s not so busy, maybe the servers will be more attentive.we found a table right away, and the server came very quickly..we ordered gobi manchurian and paneer dish.next: food.tasty fried cauliflower was a standout, as was the fried chicken dish.service: overall it was good, but slow service..i ordered the butter paneer and the samosas.would highly recommend.it seemed greasier than other times, less tasteful, and where they used to give full condiment cups of the sauces they now give about one teaspoon of sauce."

what? yes!for our entrée we shared the prosciutto fig spiced pistachio, taleggio, local honey..willing to wait the full hour and half estimate at the bar, we were disappointed to find out our name was dropped from the list for no apparent reason.when you first read the menu before going in, you think it is just basic italian food, but everything has a twist.we love this place.we also ordered the sweet corn ravioli.finally returned for lunch on  a sunday afternoon with my husband and some friends.then came the scotch egg which was covered in an amazing prosciutto sausage and served over truffle polenta (i love truffle and i love polenta!!).recommend:-mushroom white pizza-kale salad with green apple and cheesedo not recommend:-carpaccio - too small and arugula purée on top threw me off, it completely over powered any taste of the beef-oysters - warning that they come pre-garnished with raw onion and a spicy aioli, did not like it as onion over powered all flavorstaff was friendly and apologetic that they were slammed with tables.also the maine lobster agnolotti is rich and soooo yummy.it was pretty  late, around 10ish! for drinks, i ordered the number 12 and loved it.didnt really care for it.when i got it, my friends asked, &#34;are you sure you don&#39;t want to order something else?&#34; luckily, with the amount of food that we ordered (plus dessert), i did end up being full.as we wrapped up at 6:30, there were at least 5-6 tables all empty around us.accessibility (5 stars)bar siena is in the heart of west loop on randolph street! &#39;nough said!.prosciutto fig pizza - lacked flavorburrata and grilled eggplant pizza- lacked flavorsweet corn ravioli - lacked flavor -- which is surprising because everyone i was with loved thisshort rib lasagna - this was awesomemaine lobster agnolotti - this was good.probably a 3.i could sit here and write a novel about all the things i loved about bar siena but i am going to keep this short.a couple my order items would be the bread and ricotta, this is seriously crave worthy, i get it everytime.the meatballs are very good, as was our flatbread, but chopped salads with chicken, not even up to portillos standards, or maggianos.i know why.i was initially skeptical about all the positive reviews, but this pizza really is the perfect balance of sweet &amp; savory.it didn&#39;t scream &#34;sports!&#34; and i loved the comfy, half-moon shaped booth with a view of the bar.definitely was not impressed with the food presented."

 so, read on if you want one man&#39;s impressions of a legend.we got tickets to the gallery and had a fantastic, and importantly, really fun meal.service - friendly, but expected better from a 3 star michelin restaurant:i had to ask for a water refill, my date had her sparkling water refilled with still water, and at one point the server introduced a dish to us and then realized that part of it was missing.what an incredibly special (and generous once in a lifetime!) treat.go for the experience and brilliant service.the focus is now the food and its one of the best meals i&#39;ve had.delicious.so my reservation was at 8:30-- apparently they had tables at 8:20, 8:40, &amp; 8:50 as well cuz i could see all the damn dishes that were gonna come after the one i was eating cuz the tables across from us were getting them already!! goddammit, i thought the surprise was part of the whole fucking point!! no surprises!! one silver lining with a table behind us in the line-up meant i could listen again to the description of the food cuz they just kept blowing through them all-no directions.this place was mindblowingly (is that a word?) amazing..drinks are extra, and they now have a small liquor list to go along with wines by the glass, bottle, beer, cider &amp; the matching wine option.2000 krug &#34;clos du mesnil&#34; champagne, france 100/100cucumber, feta, caper leafgin, green tomato, chartreusescallop, corn, buttershio kombu, nori2012 domaine laroche &#34;les clos&#34; chablis grand cru100/100sweet potato curry yolkscollet demi-sec champagne, france (nv)95/100white asparagus - lychee - lily bulbour bowl filled with citrus was set to release a great quantity of smoky mist, as solid carbon dioxide sublimated to vapor and poured out onto the table, then down to the floor..will be returning with my boyfriend, and highly recommend this restaurant.once you get to your table the wait staff is much friendlier..first, the new decoration completely blow our mind.different time slots have different ticket values, this one was one of the cheaper ones, but i think it worked to our benefit as none of the surprises were ruined since we were presented our dishes before everyone else.note: i was here for a business dinner, meaning i&#39;m reviewing the food and the experience with a minor consideration for the $270 price tag.weird but interesting decoration..it makes me wonder if i&#39;m going under.i would definitely recommend it to anyone who could afford it and really experience the magic.very friendly and not at all stuck up like i would expect them to be at one of the top restaurants in the world.and that&#39;s all i have to say about that..awesome!!!!!!!!!.i appreciate that they tried to make a vegan version of their dishes but their meat and dairy substitute choices seemed very bland.what&#39;s worse is we could hear servers at other tables explaining the courses with details that were never provided to us which would have made it a much better experience.what are they going to do next?!?!the menu card stated &#34;ice&#34; would be the first course.the most incredible dining experience i have ever had, shared in the great company of like-minded yet slightly insane colleagues and foodies who enjoyed this delectable 3-michelin star dining experience with me in one of the world&#39;s best restaurants..i had always had an interest in molecular gastronomy so i knew i had to try it and of course it did not disappoint.i expected one of two things: either stuffy and pretentious, or hipster and unapproachable..i can&#39;t say enough about the service.it&#39;s worth going at least once.reservations pretty easy to procure for dining on wednesday to friday nights..how do you even decide what to wear to such a culinary event?

bottlefork-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bottlefork-chicago,2,"I had the sope and she had the burger.um yes.both of us ordered the wagyu steak salad.we asked what the sweetbread was, and after our water describing it decided to give it a try, along with the tots.until then..we also ordered the &#34;tots&#34;, which were more like giant tots with cheese sauce all over them.sounds good, but the chips were super salty though.i was really hankering for the squash flatbread but it was towards the end of the night and half the menu options were off the table.despite a packed house on a friday night at 9pm, seating at the bartop was plentiful so we grabbed a couple chairs at the end and began perusing the lengthy menu.great setting and nice location.it really wasn&#39;t drinkable but my server swapped it out with no problem.best brunch in chicago.she brought us room temperature water in a decanter that would only fill one glass at a time.burger has just a hint of bacon flavor but is super juicyrich mans po boy is a must order item, not as much foie gras as you&#39;d like, but the fried oyster explodes with flavor in your mouth.brussels ok.came for lunch.p.we started with the &#34;bag of crisps and eggs&#34; - yum!  it was warm potato chips where they tossed in an egg - tableside and shook it up.a warm gooey cheesecake mixed with graham crackers and strawberry jam.the service was fine.the meatball flatbread wasn&#39;t my favorite and the pasta with chicken sausage was pretty good especially if you like red pepper flakes.i cannot speak highly enough for this dining experience.i would like to go back for brunch if i had more time.the cocktails are inventive, the names are cute, and the presentation is fun and tropical.2.highlight of the meal was the milk and cookies for dessert.i cannot wait to come back here to try other items on the menu!.the chips were evenly coated with the egg and pretty good tasting.the gravy was pretty bland and the cheese wasn&#39;t exactly curd, and both were pretty scarce.we were able to get a table here fairly early on a saturday night, but that doesn&#39;t say anything about the quality of the meal you will receive.in terms of the drinks and apps, i&#39;d say this os a nice place to come to start off your night.i had the corned beef and i was in heaven.woooooooooow.a very good, strong old fashioned in a goblet containing an ice cube with a pinup playing card in the middle.drinks rock, as do the homemade soft serve ice cream fashioned into a chocolate mint sundae.had some appetizers but since this was a while back i can&#39;t remember what they were, so not memorable..a great spot for dinner, and i do recommend sharing several dishes.if you have an adventurous spirit and palette, bottlefork is a must! sit at the kitchen seats and ask for eddie, he won&#39;t steer you wrong with his excellent recommendations.the tater tots were great.the atmosphere and lighting were great, and the employees were knowledgable and conversational.it was absolutely divine.call ahead option is a plus in my book and they were able to seat us as soon as we arrived! a restaurant that knows how to make their patrons happy will always keep me coming back for seconds!.the meatballs in it were salty and paired well with the sauce and pasta! the strawberry shortbread ice cream was also not overly sweet and just refreshed me after such a fantastic meal!the decor inside is beautiful as well and just made our experience here so amazing.sat outside and inside felt very dark and &#39;bar&#39; like.i don&#39;t know how eddie was able to give us so much personal attention with a packed restaurant/bar on a friday night but he truly made my friend and i feel like celebrities.booked a table but when we got there instead of waiting we were asked if we wanted to sit in the window by the kitchen, best decision possible.food was delicious and not our norm but glad we ventured out the box.great spot for a saturday night out with friends or a date.can&#39;t miss dishes: ensalada latina, brussel sprouts, tots, crisps and eggs, ground bacon burger, kale caesar salad, baked french toast, 2 farm eggs any stylecan&#39;t miss drinks: i hope there&#39;s always snow in your driveway, for the allocation, not mescaline either, bottlefork bloody marythe atmosphere is dark and cozy, and it doesn&#39;t have a ton of seating.same as the donut holes..we both ordered beers and i got the dopplebock, which i&#39;d never tried before, but turned out to be pretty good.i saw someone else with it and wondered why you would order that - after a few sips of the bloody mary, i totally got it.ok, didn&#39;t make things better.great drink options and great service.i couldn&#39;t get enough.everything is just a few dollars too high.the fries were also pretty good and the homemade balsamic ketchup is amazing.the whole thing was bland.throughout the night i felt that i was bothering the wait staff when asking for a simple request (asking for more water/requesting a menu).we were stuffed.knocked off one star bc they were out of bacon! bacon!but we got the bag of crisps (a must), burger, mexican sope and a side of tots.cocktails are 5 star and a couple you can get infused with drippings from their meat smoker.i had the greek omelet which was largely flavorless.my coworkers liked their food and the atmosphere.and the bartender made me a special spicy margarita which was very good.this place, though delicious, seems just a tad expensive for brunch.also a bit gimmicky though interestingdoughnut holes: they are the size of a full donut actually.if you want something lighter, the mediterranean salad has grilled saganaki cheese and eggplant hummus for a unique spin on a salad!for dessert after dinner, the cheesecake is a must.love, love, love this place! this is my second time here and i will keep coming back.the mediterranean salad withgrilled romaine was fantastic, i wanted to lick the bowl clean.the decor was great and the service was good."

plus, if your wait is over an hour, you can go for a nice walk in millennium park.the hashbrowns were good and i was glad that it wasn&#39;t too salty.service was great, he was attentive and answered questions i had.we upgraded the pancakes to the signature berry bliss (+$1.fast food to table after ordering and it exceeded our hopes.delicious benedicts, omelettes, pancakes.the skillet choices are basically a flat pan the size of a dinner plate filled to the brim with whatever you choose (vegetables in my case), hashbrowns, cheese and topped with two eggs done to your liking..they have the best pancakes i&#39;ve ever tasted.i have absolutely nothing negative to say about this place.they have these &#34;light&#34; milkshakes on the menu, but i ordered the oreo shake, which is only so light as you can imagine.the food is outstanding overall (the skillet with eggs and hash on another table looked sooooo good), but as i said before i&#39;m not sure the wait is worth it for me even on a weekday, and definitely not for me on a weekend.it shows you what position you are in line &amp; it counts down.there wildberry pancakes are light and fluffly and so good.the food from this place was delicious.the food was definitely decent and edible, but probably not worth the thousands of great reviews.out of towner here, who only eats breakfast about 30 times a year, much more of a lunch / dinner eater (i&#39;ll eat lunch at 10am sometimes).everything we ate here was exquisite! we order the napa valley fig omelette and &#34;signature&#34; bliss pancakes..i&#39;m going to chalk this up as a tourist trap since it&#39;s right next to the millennium park.i didn&#39;t actually eat any of their signature pancakes, but i got their napa valley fig omelette b/c i love trying unique dishes when i go out.not special.you have to try their pancakes.50 for the speciality pancakes with the omelets or skillets.....chicago.an hour later, we walked down to wildberry and were sat within 15 minutes..signature berry bliss pancake/french toast: my friend and i got a side portion of each with the eggs dish and were floored by how good these were!  i am not a fan of super sweet things and so this did a good job of balancing between the sweetness of the french toast/pancake and the tartness of the berries.i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever been close to finishing it.almost non existent.we went on tueaday right before closing (around 1,45pm) and had no problem getting in.delicious.i have no problem with food, service, quality, would just like to see a few more balanced options.location is located conveniently next to millennium park.price: fairly well for city.basically, i have never gone wrong with an order and always leave feeling full and can&#39;t imagine eating lunch.by the time we left at 9:30 the wait was up to 75-90 minutes so go early if you don&#39;t want to spend as long waiting!   there is a little coffee bar up front so you can get coffee or tea while you wait.m.i would recommend their pancakes over the skillet.my bf opted for 2 eggs combo and we decided to upgrade to the banana cream pie pancake and wow, after we had our share we wanted more!  pancakes were fluffy and the cream was not overly sweet and overwhelming.the omelet was delectable with figs and applewood bacon, making for a perfect flavor combination.stayed at the hyatt regency nearby and came here for a brunch on a sunny day.happy anniversary.followed the reviews and wasn&#39;t let down! i ate alone and ordered a garden skillet with two eggs over easy - simply amazing.the pancake was so fluffy i wanted to die.i do not exaggerate.it was good breakfast food and they really do have a great selection of pancakes.my friends and i actually came for breakfast two days in a row to be able to get in without waiting in line for two hours.5-2 hours for a saturday 1030-1100 table).nevermind!we went back wednesday morning at 8 am and were seated immediately.we ordered the mexican skillet and berries and cream pancakes.if you aren&#39;t in the mood for pancakes, you can also get many of the flavors in the form of french toast or crepes!.we waited since we were visiting chicago and it had a lot of reviews on yelp.people were packed inside and against the building trying to get inside..convenient to all bus lines on michigan avenue."
farmers-fridge-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/farmers-fridge-chicago,2,"I was skeptical about the idea of salads in a vending machine.but &#34;the cheater&#34; i got tasted great, and the handy jar it came in was portioned perfectly! it had turkey bacon, cherry tomatoes, hard-boiled egg, cucumber, lettuce and it just hit the spot.kale is really good in the salad, nice touch with the berries and pineapple!  good for lunch or a snack.the honey mustard was a good blend of tangy and sweet....it tasted fresh and hat the option to add chicken..yum! skip the veggies/hummus..i&#39;d rather just go to a place that will make my salad to order.thank you farmer&#39;s fridge for providing a super quick, delicious and healthy meal option!  the anti-oxidant salad was incredibly delicious!!! i&#39;ll be back for many more..it made the salad super easy and convenient to eat.i order from grubhub, and they have a low minimum and delivery fee, and are always on time-- plus, whenever there&#39;s been an issue, like they&#39;ve run out of what i ordered, they show up with genuine apologies and awesome replacement snacks, and more than make up for it.also, we should probably be friends..these salads, you guys.you&#39;re welcome..take this off the list for others.my coworkers and i all washed them out and brought them home!.for close to same money you could go to soprafina or cafe bacci and get a made to order salad.i normally hate the taste of kale, but with all the other goodies they put in, it was dang delicious!..the carrot salad was great and so was the tea! might come back to try again for a salad so i dont get the bread.love this idea and how well they execute! this is the best salad place in the loop, hands-down.farmer&#39;s fridge is such a gem in chicago! it&#39;s so difficult to find healthy fare that&#39;s also delicious, beautiful, and interesting, but these salads feel hedonistic to eat, not virtuous.it&#39;s hard to justify spending $10 for a salad in a plastic jar on daily basis.this is a vending machine, not a restaurant.going over today to get one!..they have locations all over the city.this is quickly becoming my favorite place for a quick lunch!.when is ff planning on doing that?  thanks, tim.the greens are pretty good though.the vegetables and everything are really fresh however the salads themselves don&#39;t have much flavor, even using the dressing.it is the freshest salad downtown.today i tried the cauliflower fried rice.perfect for a light lunch or a mid-day snack.absolutely delicious! i loved the dressing, and all the salad and vegetables were super fresh.stays fresh and adds even more variety.first.it would be nice to have some kind of rewards program and for the machines to take cash in addition to credit cards.i had the napa cabbage and it was fantastic!  the southwest was sold out as well as a few others and i went at 12:00!!  are folks stalking the delivery guy! lol  if so, i&#39;ll be joining them ;).i work in the former cabrini green area so there are not very many healthy lunch options around here so it was great to finally see the farmer&#39;s fridge in the grocery store below our office.everything i&#39;ve had is delicious, favorites are the high protein and the napa.the salads are low-calorie but also are packed with nutrients and protein so i don&#39;t feel hungry a couple hours later.i like the idea..basil yogurt? it wasn&#39;t very flavorful.it was a little difficult to find, but that was probably my fault as i should have noted how the other reviews mention that it&#39;s located down by where the cta trains are.the napa was delicious!.i absolutely love farmer&#39;s fridge- it essentially is the healthiest meal choice you can get on the go! restaurant quality salads.i found it hilarious the salad kiosk was right next to the normal vending machine.the container is convenient, the ingredients are extremely fresh, and the serving is really generous."

&#34;i have an epi-pen but i&#39;d rather not use it,&#34; my colleague replied.i am not a desert  person but i like afternoon tea tradition so i chose to come here.the tea service itself was one of my favorite experiences.the tower of food was gorgeous!! i thought everything was delicious except for the lemon tart.the food: we had the 29$ package that came with cream puffs, chocolate cake, fruit tart, macaroons red velvet cupcakes, salmon and ham finger sandwiches, and my favorite = scone with clotted cream.seated right away and had wonderful service.both were prepared well.went here for breakfast, i spent 15 including tax and tip for toast with avocado, chilli flakes, and an egg - i was starving after..our waiter took forever to bring us anything and had to come back to ask what we ordered.regardless, the big chunks of avocado with basil was very impressive, the basil really added to the flavor and gave it a fresh taste.i went to the allis for lunch and was delighted by how charming the space was and how delicious the food was.the best scone in chicago!tea ($3 per pot) -- all tea selections are great with balanced flavors.we came hungry on empty stomachs and felt the amount of food was just right - not too much to feel like we overate but enough to last us into the evening.my girl friends and i came to have dessert, which was amazing! we ordered the banana bread, red velvet cupcakes, and the chocolate chip cookie.the chandeliers, couches, tables, and decor are all spot on.decor and atmosphere is fun! this place is great!if you plan on stopping by for tea, make sure to call ahead and make a reservation.but my most recent experience was pretty awful.sometimes the cakes can be a bit dry, but they are beautiful and seeing all of the treats together in a tea tower is worth it!  afternoon tea is $34 and it fills you up.they might break them down somehow, but they all start hard boiled.classy but casual and unpretentious.the salad was very nice as well.maybe because of the ambiance?service is the worst.i highly recommend the allis soho mule...the table was perfect for the two of us and the chairs were super lux which added to the rich ambiance of allis.the brunch menu is small but has a variety of options.this is so great for little get togethers and i plan on taking my mom here as well.the sweet bread and the scones were my least fave.the ambiance was even better when my afternoon tea set came out.drinks were good, very artisinal and chic.i made a reservation the night before (i made it on a weekday).will go again!!..all are a great selection.it feels comfortable and not pretentious.the egg white sandwich is good, light, and delicious.the allis was a great stop for day drinks.i wish there had been more savory offerings..soho house usually gets two extreme reactions - the phony, privileged yuppies brag about being on its exclusive membership like they do anything with it besides rub shoulders and judge other privileged, out-of-touch empty heads, while those who think its edgier to mock what&#39;s popular, scorn at the thought of joining such an establishment like they don&#39;t conform in their non-conformism."

i want to go back!..great lunch.brussels sprouts and kale salad! amazing! and i don&#39;t eat kale unless it&#39;s in a smoothie.however, on the past three times i&#39;ve gone here, each time something the staff does makes me a little turned off to the place.the salad was delicious, i love shaved brussels sprouts, and there was a good proportion of sprouts, kale, nuts, and cheese.also, the kitchen also lost my order so i had to wait at least 5 minutes for my food after my friend got hers.overall it&#39;s a good place but won&#39;t last imo if service doesn&#39;t improve.blue door serves great food but their service lacks a little and is very pricy.gross.one orders at the counter and they give you a number (a very cute wooden block with the number on it) to set down on the table.loved it.order the grilled cheese and bask in that country glory.it was thebomb.the room is a little small and it is open seating so you might have to be patient.the other ingredients were tasty but not mind-blowing.the brussels and kale salad is incredible.i went with a group so we tried a number of items.amazing!!! if i lived in chicago, i would eat here every single day.the tuna was like what you would find on most gourmet tuna sandwiches, however it was the fresh red peppers and artichoke hearts along with the green beans that really sealed the deal..try any grilled cheese because they are amazing..it&#39;s not a huge menu but each dish is interesting (and sound delish).not too sweet at all, just right.blue door&#39;s menu has a plethora of very appealing sounding items.nice food, but it felt like i should have been wearing suspenders and blasting the decembrists while snapping a pic of my sandwich with a polaroid.do realize that some of this place (not all) is a communal seating concept, so if they are busy, you will very possibly end up sitting with strangers.cutesy.i had the kale and shaved brussels sprouts salad; my wife opted for the farro and arugula salad.the space itself is cute -- something you would find on pinterest.it was the best sandwich he&#39;d had.the atmosphere is something special in that it feels a little slower than the city outside.im not really a salad type of girl, but if you are looking into eating something healthy, this is the place.it&#39;s very expensive.they certainly do not short you on take out salads! a little too much bleu cheese for my liking, but all i had to do was pick the large chunks out.i don&#39;t blame them and it was silly of me to be disappointed by that.the turkey was fresh, the cheese, apple and bell pepper preserve were really good and the lightly grilled multigrain bread was awesome (ok - it&#39;s out there - i&#39;m a bread man.but, not quite enough to make me wait that long again.the brussels &amp; kale salad is a standout.you can tell everything here is very fresh and farm to table as their name says.great place for healthy eating!.any sandwish or salads are good.$9.the prices are pretty high for the quality.i so look forward to seeing the new menu as the seasons change!.the neighborhood really needed something that was affordable, healthy, and quick.i think that their juice is way over priced (9 to 11$) but what can you do.i&#39;ve been a few times for lunch/brunch, and i&#39;ve been impressed with the quality of food and the overall selection.good, nutritious breakfasts &amp; lunches.it was as bug as my head and was one serving.adorable! such a gem.fresh ingredients, delicious mix of tastes, generous portions.blue door farm stand is such a cute little spot and a great place to grab lunch with a friend.staff were friendly and food was good but felt like few items on the menu were little pricey.can&#39;t wait to get more!.i could have gone to this place daily!almond milk lattes? fresh chocolate chip cookies? gourmet tomato soup and fantastic grilled cheese sandwiches??i admittedly over ordered and still managed to eat it all.it is a bit pricey for the amount of food you get, but quality is top notch so i guess you are paying for that.i hope this changes because i enjoy the grown up grilled cheese and their sesame chicken salad.love the asian chicken salad and really good french dip.very cool and simple atmosphere.if i lived or worked closeby i would be here everyday.you drink out of mason jars and eat on cutting boards.sandwiches were pretty good, but think there are betters options here, in which we would like to try.environment - the seating is open, with several community tables.excited to come back and try breakfast items.i don&#39;t like brussel sprouts, but the brussels and kale salad was amazing, w/e dressing they put in it was awesome.you know what grinds my gears?  walking over to a restaurant that appears open on yelp, on their website, and has a working phone number, only to find that they are not open for business - on a day when the temperatures hit 90 degrees.they have awesome bloody mary&#39;s on the weekends."

short rib pizza and gnocchi was good.nice selection of drinks and food for your taste buds!!.the lobster ravioli was outstanding.the size of the dish was very small; it looked more like an appetizer than an entree.our food came out after about 10-15 min.nestled right off of division and dearborn, it&#39;s the perfect place to drop by anytime.check it out! food krank gives it full stomach rating!!.the icing on the cake: their prices are extremely reasonable so you can get that dessert or second glass of wine without breaking the bank..i would recommend heading here for a quiet, weeknight dinner.i was hoping for more.dishes are large enough to eat solo yet are best when shared.i&#39;ve always enjoyed my visit when i have been.go here and enjoy it.eduardo&#39;s is a charming little place with excellent wine and service - small plates, charcuterie, artisan piazzas, pastas and salads.there is plenty in there.freddy always get my order right! even when i order 30 different pizzas for take out..i ordered the black ink pasta, which was delicious! even though the portions are pretty small it was ok because you can see the quality in the ingredients.i hope they expand! go for the eggplant pizza or the prosciutto pizza.the place is small, but very adorable.while we can&#39;t ignore the simple beauty behind each plate&#39;s artful flavor indulgence, it is the people behind this small restaurant that complete the cozy rustic atmosphere.our service was excellent, but the atmosphere really makes this place, it&#39;s cozy, intimate and romantic.so glad we stopped!....a great neighborhood spot that is charming and intimate.check it out!.maybe a dozen tables inside and a lovely quiet outdoor street patio,  eduardo&#39;s cuisine is on trend with a decent selection of small plates, artisan pizzas, pastas and salads.we gave this place a try and really enjoyed it..it&#39;s always great going to a wine bar and having the staff actually be knowledgable of the wine offerings.but overall, good food and great atmosphere.we&#39;ve been living in the area for a while and have tried all the other brunch spots, and nothing can compare! i usually stick with one of their delicious omelettes (you have to try their potatoes! fantastic!) but i also love the apple pancetta pancakes and the breakfast sandwiches.i thought it was nice.a couple of friends and i ordered from here through grubhub.enjoy..had a fish dish (seasonal) that was perfectly crisped, like the brussel sprouts with very balanced and light flavors.amazing food &amp; variety...staff is great, cozy place, great music, great vibes!it gets better!!  carry out eduardo&#39;s traditional pizza from the back area.we tried cheeses and meats as well as a pizza.great portion for two to share.overall, definitely worth checking out - the interior looked nice and the patio is a nice option on a warm sunny day - i guess i just left feeling like my experience was not anything to write home about.the ingredients in the dishes were very simple very on purpose thoughtful and  the wine pairings were excellent and the service is perfect.all in all a great summer night meal enjoyed on the patio.we had margarita pizza - excellent.the cocktails are fabulous as well.excellent pork tenderloin!  perfectly done and with a little kick.service, atmosphere, are superb.highly recommend this place!.i have been there 3 times now, all since may!  yummy!!i have never had to wait for a table (although it has always been  a party of 2 or 3).we just wish they could deliver across the river!.bone marrow ice cream."
friends-sushi-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/friends-sushi-chicago,2,",,.love this place! the environment is cozy but the food is amazing..only suggestion about the food:the portion of rice with ama ebi could be 20-30% less and maybe without the batter when frying the shrimp head.&#34; it was amazing.(i probably wouldn&#39;t recommend it to a group of more than four--there weren&#39;t too many tables)..the sushi was warm, like room temperature.some very different and unique items on the menu that i don&#39;t usually see, such as wasabi dumplings.if you&#39;re not picky though and just want something quick for lunch, this is an okay option.we ordered the edamame and seaweed salad to start, and both were good.cute sushi place in the heart of the mag mile area.&#34;definitely the kind of place that could be your local sushi place if you lived nearby.the food was priced really well and delicious! white tuna roll and summer roll are delicious!!.looks like i have a new &#34;friend&#34;!.i&#39;ve been to several sushi restaurants and i felt the ingredient combinations of their rolls are very unique.great atmosphere, friendly staff and the sushi was delicious!!! don&#39;t let the curbside appearance deter you from trying this place out.we came in around 5:30 on a weeknight and we were able to get seated right away.five star all the way :).parties four or more, be prepared to feel cramped..the seats were surprisingly comfortable and almost felt like you were at a modern home.amazing sushi!! absolutely incredible.pretty good sushi with a vegetarian menu, which was a bonus for me.the hubs loves this place.either this place doesn&#39;t have ac or doesn&#39;t know when to use it because we were very uncomfortable.each was unique, and they went together well.hard to truly enjoy eating sushi when it was so hot and sticky.the seaweed on my rolls was chewy and stretchy aka stale.i also had chicken soup and my friend had miso soup.the food was absolutely delicious, fresh, and very fulfilling.very westernized, not suitable if you are looking for more authentic jap food..i ordered takeout tonight - a tuna roll ($7) and the firecracker ($11).i will definitely be back!.the ambiance was lovely -- simple and clean look with comfy chairs...my friend got the deluxe sashimi platter and the pieces of fish were a really good size.all great although the nigiri had a tad too much rice but was correct temp, it also lost a star as they rush a  bit and although i didn&#39;t need it, when ordering a chef&#39;s choice platter i expect to be told what each piece is.the sauce was too runny and just an all around disappointment.we came to chicago for the weekend and yelped for japanese food.great little sushi joint..the sushi rolls we ordered were delicious and large! i cannot remember the exact names but i love that this place used fresh and quality ingredients.the tables were so small, as well.the quality of the sushi seems to have decreased.most have too crazy of rolls, are too fancy/expensive, or just not good.we like the fire wing, jazz, and an assortment of nigiri.maybe the other rolls are better here but friends sushi was definitely underwhelming..i ate the fish off the top and left the sappy sweet rice on the plate.three stars at best.this place deserves all these stars and more! i came in to get sushi only and decided to try their spicy miso ramen! omg!!now i love seafood noodle dishes, i typically eat thai noodles with seafood.this place rocks! delicious food and gracious hosts make for a great experience.intimate seating.feels like you&#39;re in a lounge bar, white small tables, dim light, dancy music, it&#39;s different and nice..i really liked this place, and the food tastes great..i would suggest that you eat the larger rolls the appropriate way.the food was good, but nothing stood out as great.amazing! we travel all over and had a couple special requests.good happy hour.this place is absurd.our last night in chicago with nine girls, and we were looking for something on the healthy side near our hotel for our last meal."
lowcountry-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lowcountry-chicago-2,1,"I ordered snow crab, crawfish (huge mistake), corn, sausage and potatoes, seasoned with the &#34;everythang&#34; seasonings.it was sunday night and we didn&#39;t have to wait for a table which was great.such an amazing time and great atmosphere!!! food was incredible and the services was just as great.there&#39;s a communal sink on the side, there&#39;s communal seating, get your shit wrapped in a bag to go if you don&#39;t finish, not sure if there&#39;s hype about this place, but i&#39;m not crazy about their food.i love it here!!.great ambience, delicious food, and quick service.mind you there were a bunch of half empty tables in this place.not much else like it in the city so wasn&#39;t too sure what to expect.the shrimp was fresh and super flavorful.but this place is a definite must try if you are craving seafood boil.our waitress was ann and she was on it.this place is great..mike.they were missing legs on the clusters and didn&#39;t seem to have the typical qualify as per usual.i think i&#39;m gonna go back tomorrow.all the flavors worked well together and textures were great..every seafood boil place&#39;s sauce is just slightly different..it&#39;s so consistent every time i go and they are fast! i always sit at the bar because on sunday&#39;s their cocktails and certain beers are half off.covered in dry seasoning kind of crawfish!we also tried and loved the garlic beignets, calamari, and jalapeño cornbread..what happened is, my wife hates shrimp, and i feel cajun seasoning has no business being on a cold-water crab like snow crab.also the cornbread side is another reason to pick this place.we also got the salt and pepper calamari and honey jalapeño cornbread.all i can say is when the snow is falling and the temps are dipping, sneak away to lowcountry to get your hands dirty but your tummy happy.and you could always order more!the spice levels.courteous staff and food comes out pretty quickly.lowcountry completely exceeded my expectations! my husband had been trying to get me to go for awhile as we recently moved in to the neighborhood, but i was hesitant about &#34;eating with my hands out of a bag&#34;.coffee was weak and the beignets were delicious, too much powdered sugar but just scraped it off.3 of those and later i was feeling very warm and happy.very, very impressed with lowcountry!for someone who knows absolutely nothing about seafood/boils/etc i was a little intimidated.it&#39;s your typical expensive seafood price, so nothing too surprising there.my friend ordered shrimp and mussels in the everything sauce and her bag of food was literally dry.it&#39;s fun once.they also have private karaoke rooms in the basement.sinks at the ready in case you need to rinse between devours..this was insanely good! our server ann was so friendly, she guided us as to what to order..beerpong in any restaurant is a great idea!the staff was super friendly and explained everything to us in detail.so happy i came across this place!we will be back.grab everything and anything it&#39;s all delicious!!! i have came here so many times and it never disappoints! crab legs, mussels, head off shrimp are always our to go to and make sure to get the &#34;everything&#34; sauce with a level 2-3 spicy (2=moderate spicy 3=spicy spicy)! and don&#39;t forget your jalapeño corn bread and cajun fries on the side!!!p.i&#39;ve been here a time or two when i couldn&#39;t get into the angry crab..perfectly cooked quality shrimp in amazing flavorful red sauce.we got shrimp and clams, which were cooked and seasoned to perfection.the food was piping hot and we were so ready to chow down.i love really spicy food and the 4 still burns me up.great seafood, closest i&#39;ve been to a seafood boil.i am in love with the dirty, messy, laid back feel lowcountry provides.all of these are part of the lowcountry experience.if you like cajun + quality seafood, lowcountry is a must.this place is a little pricey but it&#39;s because you are paying per the pound.even the beignets were perfectly done! we will be back every time we come to the area!.that was a seafood overload.the food came out very quickly..we had shrimp, snow crab, garlic pillows and for dessert.i messed up a few crawfish before i finally asked the waitress for help.probably because they just recently opened and not everyone knows about it yet.i actually liked lowcountry better than angry crab taste, space is larger, not as far and they serve alcohol.i must say spicy level 2 is enough for regular dudes and dudettes out there, unless your lip is thick like an encyclopedia and your stomach is made of iron.it was very packed on a friday night, but they had an extra room downstairs.the menu was quite simple.i remember this restaurant as blokes and birds and wonder why it has since changed?.such a great addition to lakeview!.i stayed in chicago for two weeks for training for my work and this was my top 2-3 meals when i was here.we got the cajun and garlic mixed medium style.normally, you wouldn&#39;t come here for anything other than the boil but i ordered the calamari banh mi sandwich and it is so good!! the calamari was fresh and extremely flavorful with the right amount of crunch to it.this place is ideal for dining with friends who can go down and dirty with enjoying great food.there&#39;s this really convenient sink trough in the middle of the restaurant, which came in very handy because the boil was very messy.more power to you if you like a challenges.we had to wait a bit to be seated but were able to grab a beer at the bar..no one wants to drive 30min while they&#39;re starving and have to wait another 30+ minutes in line.definitely order their cornbread.i&#39;m telling you and all my friends about this place..it tasted like the salt and pepper squid you could order when you go to chinese restaurants but in this case, you have a way smaller portion.first stop on my next visit to chicago.highly recommend this cute and friendly environment.it came out in a steaming plastic bag which was bizarre but what can i say, it was delicious! definitely get something spicy and pair it with an order of the jalepeno cornbread."

i also love their tom kha soup, basil fried rice, green curry and spicy crazy noodles!.talay is a byob which is always a bonus, but if you forget wine they sell it there at a very reasonable price.the staff was quick and friendly.i&#39;ve had the crab rangoon (lots of cream cheese and light, crispy wontons), various sushi, panang and green curry (don&#39;t usually care for curry but loved loved it here), cashew chicken (not slathered in sauce and lots of veggies), mia soup (the small is still large with lots of tofu and miso) and i can&#39;t remember the rest but it was good too.we had:fish patty and mini egg rolls appetizers, a signature roll and a few maki rolls, orange chicken entre and tofu panang curry entre.nice sushi and thai spot.3.it&#39;s convenient, but i like butterfly down the street better.i have been here more times than i can count.that&#39;s insane.first time here and had a great experience! their spicy crunch salmon was delicious..great pad thai, summer rolls, and mini-egg rolls.i get excited whenever i see yum woon sen on the menu, so i had to try theirs.a great inexpensive gem in an otherwise overpriced neighborhood.i like it sweet and not bitter..whats up with that?mix the red sauce on the table with the soy sauce..the chicken container had a hole cut into the top to allow the steam to escape in order to keep the chicken crisp.talay keeps the authentic taste.typically i expect a $13 roll to have 6 pieces but this one was huge so good value but average tasting roll..so not only is it delicious, it&#39;s presented like artwork so it&#39;s a double win!i left stuffed and my portion of the bill was only $20!..they get the rice right! not over cooked and it is always fresh.tally does sushi right! not only did the food taste good but the presentation was awesome! we ordered the idaho (sweet potato tempura, cream cheese, spicy mayo, and avocado topped with tempura crumbs and sweet soy sauce), black pearl (shrimp tempura, avocado, cilantro and jalapeño rolled in tempura crumbs and topped with spicy tuna, sweet soy sauce and black tobiko), and talay crunch (shrimp tempura, crunchy calamari, cucumber, masago, cream cheese and avocado topped with spicy mayo, tempura crumbs and sweet soy sauce).i have been to this restaurant at least 5 times in the last 6 months and never once had any issues with the food or the service.the servers at talay are very friendly and the restaurant itself is quaint and serene.everything else we tried was okay.the breading stayed crunchy even though this was a pickup order.the food and service here is top notch!.it&#39;s going to take some people to probably have a few nights of low attendance but if you can get over that you&#39;ll really enjoy yourself.the service is great and its byob!.we got carry out food the other day.the sushi here is awesome! they have interesting and creative rolls.the noodles were cooked fine, but again, it was bland, lacked spiciness and it was sweet.we talked about the relationship between the federation and its member or affiliate or partner groups.great thai spot in our new neighborhood..i thought, &#34;hmmmmm, thai, why not?&#34; the decor inside wasn&#39;t bad.the pad see eiw was also good!.carry out review - we have never actually dined at the restaurant since its across the street so this review is just for the food quality.great food and very affordable, but for the love of all things awkward they really need to do something about the ambiance.a rare gem!  i was expecting simple sushi and thai, and pleasantly left with some extraordinary taste.see photos for selections..always awkward.who knows.bland.but, after a take out order delivered was short and improper we have changed our minds.a good, standard thai restaurant.delicious sushi!   i can&#39;t speak for the entire menu, but my husband and i visited for the first time this weekend and ordered several sushi rolls (each of which were excellent).consistency is key.i enjoyed my garlic noodle and was garlicky enough for my asian self to be satisfied.servers are very nice and attentive as well.seemed grainy and perhaps old? they may want to add some better dessert options or check on the mochi&#39;s expiration date.food-crab wontons- yum but slightly to cheesy and oilyfresh spring rolls- very tasty and freshmiso soup- extremely tasty and flavourfulkao soy- extremely tasty and yummy..it was also huge..for the price, it some of the freshest and flavorful sushi around! now add in the food presentation, the fact that it&#39;s byob and there&#39;s never a wait, and we were quickly wondering why we&#39;ve never dined in before! my absolute favorites are the hot sea roll and the tuna lovers rollsyou have me hooked talay! you have solidified yourself as my go-to chicago sushi restaurant!.unfortunately the fish was spoiled in my dish twice upon delivery, and when i mentioned it to the person on the phone, they put the manager on and the manager got upset at me!

joy-yee-noodle-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joy-yee-noodle-chicago-2,1,"That being said, considering the wait time and quality of the tea, we probably will choose another place next time.i am not sure if i am going there again.food was ok, service not so good.it&#39;s priced higher than what most chinese establishments charge but think of it as a bogo deal as 90% of the portions are well enough for at least two people.having been in years past to the evanston and naperville locations, but never to this one, i have to say i think they have the biggest menu i&#39;ve ever seen at a restaurant.would&#39;ve been much easier to eat off a large flat plate but i guess it&#39;s meant to be shared? the rice tasted more like a sweet fried rice than tomato rice and i would&#39;ve preferred more of a fried crispy pork chop, but either way it was still quite tasty.you are able to feed many people with one or two dishes.my girlfriend got the sea-salt milk tea and that was unique and tasty.i liked the colors and lighting.i ordered orange chicken and chow mein with beef and both tasted horrible..i got the rose flavor...every time i&#39;m chicago, i always come here for milktea, sometimes twice a day.the smoothies are fresh and refreshing!  there are sooo many different ones to try.as you can see in the photo, the cup is filled with mostly ice, and even before the ice melted, it taste more water than milk tea.- wonton and beef brisket noodle soup - they brought out a chicken soup by accident, and when we clarified they brought out brisket and told me to add it to the soup.i was so hungry that i didn&#39;t get a chance to snap our food..i wonder if they offer non-dairy milk for their smoothies and milk teas.holy moses what a pleasurable combo..this place is the real reason why i go to chicago.the drinks only come in one size - huge - but it was so tasty i was able to finish it..i loved it! i would definitely recommend this dish.i love joy yee.the menu at joy yee has a variety of asian dishes, so you&#39;ll definitely find something that will fulfill your taste buds.i think someone else in the comments have mentioned this, if your there for the smoothies then this place would get 4-5 stars.i though it tasted great! their serving is huge and it&#39;s priced moderately.my favorite one to get is the mango berry freeze.i&#39;m pretty picky about my pho but it was good and the portion was sooo big! the place is nice and clean, service was wonderful.a trip to chinatown isn&#39;t complete without a lychee-watermelon bubble tea with tapioca pearls.很清淡。.their beef cubes are amazing though!.delivery guy is at the wrong address.the food is always fresh.i must say there are hundreds of asian choices..because i am old and behind the times, i just picked something at random for the most part and i really liked it.i think it has a huge name association with it and so it&#39;s pretty &#34;famous&#34; and i kept coming here cause everyone else likes it and knows of it.within minutes we received a second call stating that we were out of the delivery radius (did the building get up and move?) and that we would need to pay an extra $6 fee.i didn&#39;t try the food because my friends and i came by after dim sum.on the edge of the restaurant, there&#39;s a kitchen that serves bubble tea to people walking by.yugeeeee menu ranging from pho to fried rice to seafood.we come here only for mango and lychee smoothies or boba tea.i think that the incredibly large amount of items on the menu is more appealing/interesting than the actual food itself.say hello to geeky good awesome bubble tea.holla atchyo gurl.people just love the bubble tea and the smoothies.70 for one fresh fruit freeze (w/ tapioca &amp; pudding) and one flavored tea.wish there was a joy yees in other cities!.i got the bibimbap and the taro shake- i would have just got the taro pudding but the waiter recommended i didnt.i parked across the street in the parking lot, where you pay $2 for 3 hours, and there restaurant was on the parking lot list for parking validation.one of my favorites restaurant to go when i&#39;m in town! love love their boba &amp; food!i would give a four star because sometimes the wait can be a while but it&#39;s worth it.it was basically 5 restaurants fused into one with a boba shop too! the menu is arranged with all pictures in the first half of the menu and the lists of prices and items are all in the back half of the menu."

el-che-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-che-bar-chicago,2,"However the dishes i came for and expect from a restraint that claims to be an homage to argentina, like morcilla and beef did not live up to expectation.the food was too oily and caused severe abdominal pain and diarrhea for one of us.i personally was very keen on the glazed quail with peaches and escarole as the flavor profile was on point for the summer.john manion is an amazing asset to the chicago restaurant scene.came highly recommended but ended up being disappointing.my friend and i came here for a dinner to celebrate her birthday.we ate at el che last night and we&#39;re excited for a date night in a hot hip new restaurant.everything looked unique.i won&#39;t be going back just because of the price-to-portion mismatch, and the extremely loud ambiance (had to scream conversation at my 2 table mates).not one fair or even average dish - i&#39;d order each again and recommend all of them.big fail -- really looking forward to drinks and mains.la sirena clandestina is so consistently good.the lamb ribs were great and had a bit of crispy char on them however the $35 beef short ribs were underwhelming - would describe as more of a flat, thin, chewy cut of beef rather than a braised tender fall-off-the-bone style that i thought i was going to get.the swordfish was fine, nothing special but cooked well.it just melts in your mouth, and the sauces added a nice kick).our waiter could not have been nicer.drinks- its not south american without pisco- so we had to go for the pisco sour.the gnocchi was by far our favorite dish.for dessert we sampled the tamarind filled cake roll with horchata ice cream and cajeta.meh.we then had the pork chop with onions which were fantastic- the pork was crispy and had complex flavors with the mustard while the onions were acidic.very nice restaurant in this area.pretty much everything was worth it.shuck, waiter is stupi, no talk no communication nothing , the busboy is better."

home-style-taste-chinese-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/home-style-taste-chinese-chicago,2,"There&#39;s one really good waitress that is a little more proficient in english and can give good recommendations.i might go back for their cold noodle and skewer.love the ja jar mein  (spelling?)..cumin flavor lamb with bone was fork tender and immensely flavorful on our first visit but we overheard complaints about chewiness on our second visit.cold noodle was delicious: tangy, slightly sweet and spicynoodle soup with beef was hearty and hit the spotbamboo shoots with beancurd: savory and fillingpork cakes: kind of dry.i would come more often if i lived closer.my stomach and heart didn&#39;t feel so well the next day.crab rangoon is really good and there was no line so i recommendthere is also plenty of space for parking.not pretentious, interesting decor with bamboo theme..very tasty food, reasonably priced.however, the scallion pancakes were so dense, unlike the flaky pancakes i&#39;ve had at other places.most real authentic chinese food in chicago no doubt.i&#39;m going to try to come by for their lunch specials which are only about $5-6 each, great deals for us penny pinching foodies.perhaps my expectations were set very high after reading the yelp reviews, but i actually found several of the entrees to be too sweet and loaded with sauce..(fried rice, dark soy, etc.it&#39;s sooooo good..the best crab rangoon i&#39;ve had in my life, seriously..i liked the bean curd a lot but you have to be prepared for the spice that comes with sichuan food.the cold noodle (五彩大拉皮） has wasabi and peanut sauce.some of the prices do baffle me though, like i saw on the wall that stir fried chives and eggs - one of the most ubiquitous and easy chinese dishes - $9.i got 8 roasted lamb and iron pot stewed duck.went for a group-dinner with friends.homestyle is an oasis south of the chinatown wasteland..crisp, hot, juicy, tender, you name it.my boyfriend and i like to think this is &#34;our place.meatball cabbage tofu soup - if you&#39;re feeling under the weather, this is the dish to get.this is exactly the kind of place i love to discover when i&#39;m traveling - major shout out to my yelp peeps.really really good.all 4 lunch special dishes were good and nice portion for us.the hot pot was seemingly endless, filled with chunks of tender duck, marinated tofu, a shredded soybean &#34;pasta&#34;, thin white mushrooms, and potato chunks.the colorful cold noodle dish seems to be a crowd favorite.- long shape pot sticker - best i&#39;ve had in the area..shredded chicken with basil 九層塔雞柳: a very strong basil flavor comes through in this dish.smoked pork rollstir fried lamb with cuminszechuan stir fried string beans (yeah, you find this elsewhere too but it is especially good here)the cucumber pickled dish (forget the name)not your standard chinatown faire.overall okay place for chinese food.great northern chinese food.our favorite, oddly enough, was the simple chicken stir fried with noodles that our daughter ordered..don&#39;t know what happened here, the first time we came the food was excellent, but this visit was a huge disappointment and tongue sore.the filling was almost raw! the lamb w cumin was just ok, with the lamb not cooked well either.most of the places in chinatown are either very mediocre and i can make better dishes myself, or are decent but too commercialized that they don&#39;t feel homely.the atmosphere was uncomfortable, bright lights, stark quietness expect for the tv was on- not a restaurant atmosphere that i want.he also does not seem to be very familiar with the menu when one diner asked for suggestions for a dish with pea pods.the people work there really make me upset，first off,when i came in ，they gotta really busy，i totally understand that part so my mood didn&#39;t change even though i just sit there and nobody give me a menu for a few mins，when i order i thought appetizer is supposed to come before meal ，but it comes after meal，i don&#39;t wanna be a pain in the ass ,so i didn&#39;t say anything until the worker there take me as invisible ，i finished my food like ten mins ,i put the plates away to try to get attention，nobody ask me anything like &#34;is everything ok？&#34;finally i ask them to get my check ，if it is busy i understand,but at that time they just sit around and do nothing ，i give two stars is for the food,the food there is really good,i found it out in the morning so i came back at night ，probably because my tip ,i tip four dollers on eight doller bill in the morning，probably they think i am too cheap ，anyway，at night i tip three on sixteen bills  ,i really don&#39;t wanna tip at all this time but i think u shouldn&#39;t be mean as those people being mean ，i am so disappointed in the customer service.and miss the food greatly.i had to ask 3 times just to get some water! however, as long as the food continues to be this good, i&#39;m definitely going to be back.one plate will easily feed 2 adults..really does taste like homestyle comfort food! :) good prices too!.also, my fiancee and i noticed that a lot of people tended to order the mapo tofu, which looked good, and the stirfried eggplant, which seemed typical.great service, and great food.i wish i would have been there with more people so i could have tried more.it&#39;s a small restaurant and they were busy when my mom and i walked in.it had a great portion of sauce and the fried rice was very flavorful.the dish that really was the most memorable was the pork, cabbage, and fungus (like mushrooms) which was to die for!  especially the fungus had a smooth taste, that is so far my favorite dish from here.beef and lamb dishes will be loaded with veggies although they are significantly priced higher than chicken dishes.lol we liked it so much that we are planning on coming back and dining in.my wife and i went to eat at this chinese restaurant several times.this restaurant is located off the beaten path south of chinatown @ 3205 s halsted street..can&#39;t believe how many amazing chinese restaurants there are in bridgeport, it&#39;s really something to appreciate about the neighborhood.sounded a bit much for the first time so i got:celery &amp; pork dumplings: this was on the special new years menu, way good and tasty, loved the dipping hoisin sauce.staffs are very helpful, although they are better at speaking chinese.very good..the potato and beef stew was delicious and so was the beef scallion pancake.this is one of the top if not the best chinese restaurant in chicago.they also don&#39;t speak very good english, i asked about certain dishes and they couldn&#39;t give me any answers about how it was prepared or the components.i&#39;m glad i&#39;ve found one in chicago.service is traditional chinese, they try to accommodate our stuffy habits, but it is more fun when they just start moving all your stuff around using a steaming hot plate of food as a bulldozer..the dishes were ace!

ciao-amore-ristorante-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ciao-amore-ristorante-chicago-3,2,"I highly recommend this restaurant! wonderful all around.service is great and super nice.hope to see you soon :).i&#39;m baffled at what just happened.love love love!!! i can&#39;t say enough good things about ciao amore from the staff to the food! my valentine&#39;s dinner and dessert yum!!! plus since i was craving their food i was just there again last week! my favorite dish is gnocci ripieno spinaci - homemade gnocchi stuffed with asiago, pesto and ricotta served in a creamy spinach and parmigiano sauce..afterward we got to meet the chef and owner, he was super cool and personable.it may read like a wild combination, but after having gnocchi prepared this way, i wonder why the hell it isn&#39;t served more often in other restaurants because i&#39;ve not had it taste better! there&#39;s a smooth, buttery envelope around the fat noodles that hold a pocket of spinach and cheesy goodness that has to be the perfect, bitterly-cold winter comfort dish.we had the lobster ravioli, bruschetta, bread with olive oil and parmesan cheese.one star is a generous rating..i could have split this with 3 people!!!!.just not very good for customer service.the brascole was flavorful, and frankly, we didn&#39;t do it justice because we stuffed ourselves with all the other entrees!when our patient and cheerful waitress brought out tiramisu, we all stared at it with fearful eyes because we were so full, but since we never waste dessert, we finished that off as well, and it was, of course, excellent..we ordered some appetizers, the green bean salad was fantastic.the food was exquisite.the fruiti demare is excellent.byob.the waiter hand totaled our check twice and twice it was wrong.a few notes:1) yes, byob and boy did we bring plenty of bottles.we live in the neighborhood and it is just not what it was and will not go back.it seemed like a good idea to visit the cute little italian spot in pilsen.additionally we got the spumoni and tiramisu for desert which were tasty.it&#39;s also a beautiful space, decorated with artwork by the talented server esperanza.ciao amroe ristoranteis one of chicago&#39;s little secrets.byobhuge portionseverything is made from a pound of butterthe mussels appetizer!!!!!!! we literally licked the plate clean with our bread.3 strikes or was that 4.i loved the green bean salad, the goat cheese appetizer, and the killer lasagne.yelpers talk about the green beans.the bean salad was drowned in balsamic vinegar on a plate with a huge chip in it.best home cooked meal i&#39;ve ever had.the staff is very welcoming.it&#39;s also great that it&#39;s a byob..it&#39;s byob which is great  (conveniently there&#39;s a liquor store right across the street)  the atmosphere is simple, warm and beautiful.the next day, i was interchanging bites between cioppino and gnocchi and it was delicious..it&#39;s definitely worth giving it a try based on the friendliness of staff.the gnocchi were made in heaven! i cannot get enough, despite the generous portion, i always end up with the feeling of wanting more and more - just because they are that good.the look on her face looked so upset.we encountered the same issue with the main course.excellent italian food..i love chicago, but i would come here specifically for the food at ciao amore.i hope we just hit them on slow nights and their business is going well, because they will be a required stop on all our future chicago trips.would definitely go back.dont waste your time dining there take your food to go.espresso and the usual coffees are also available.the salad was a joy; perfectly cooked asparagus mixed with the freshest mozzarella balls you can imagine with beet slices, flavorful vine rip tomatoes and a divine balsamic vinegar reduction.pilsen is such a cool place and ciao amore is a gem in the heart of it.unfortunately, it proved to be a bad choice, for multiple reasons.no one took any home because we weren&#39;t asked to have it boxed up it was just taken off the table.the whole atmosphere was cozy, intimate, but classy.the owner was super kind and the portions were enormous.big.wanted italian; found this on yelp.other reviews that have been answered by a manager or owner explain that since they don&#39;t serve alcohol, they basically have to gouge customers everywhere else.when i mentioned this to our waiter, ricky, he indicated that this is how the chef makes his marinara and that he &#34;throws everything in there&#34;.we had a groupon-type deal, so we went on a weekday night."
arturo-express-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/arturo-express-chicago,2,"Just a solid lunch place where you won&#39;t be disappointed.there needs to be better signage because no one is sure where to pick what up and and who waits on what section.facts is, if you know italian and have high standards for quality ingredients, steer clear.the service is okay, and depending on what you want (pasta, sandwich, soup) you order at different places in the line.if you work in the west loop, you need to try this place for lunch!!.potbelly and jimmy johns have good sandwiches but you can only have so much of the same.instead, i gave the pasta with broccoli and chicken a go...his suggestion so i didn&#39;t know what to expect.i think arturo&#39;s does a great job.for what it is, just this place you go up to the counter and order, there is ample seating, nice decorating, and always friendly service.great breakfast and lunch place right by the train station.jim and the whole arturo&#39;s team is the best.with drink, my meal was $10...last but not least, they have great service! i&#39;m always greeted by a smiling employee and they&#39;re very quick getting people through the line.great place close to union station.i&#39;ve been working near arturo express for several years now and i had listened to two of my co-workers chat about when they were going again to eat at arturo (they each had a frequent diner punch card)..also that much lasagna can be a bit heavy and would probably make me sleepy if i ate the whole thing!they also serve breakfast which is quite reasonably priced.they&#39;re really quick and convenient so if you live in the building it&#39;s not a bad option, but like my bro said..i just got back from having lunch here, and lets just be serious.nom.it&#39;s close to my office, so i end up going here at least 3-4 times a month.this place is great..i had initially contemplated getting pizza, but it looked pretty unappetizing.i called them five minutes before closing and managed to get them to take my order.i had the italian beef with hot peppers, chips and drink and it came to a few dollars more.definitely not a bad option for the area for the price.service is quick and friendly and the food is good..i&#39;d probably avoid the pastas they have sitting on the hot plates; while the portions are large, they&#39;re kind of meh...the brownies and other desserts are particularly expensive for a fast-dining / take-out place.the absolute best sandwich shop in the area! i keep coming back for the napoli (almost every week!) everything tastes so fresh and you can tell they put a lot of care into everything they do.great service, fast prep, &amp; authentic italian at less than $10/person.the cashier seemed annoyed when i asked for a cup for water.breakfast is decent and a bit more homemade then the other usual suspects in the area.cheese was amazing..didn&#39;t even look at you and he doesn&#39;t even say thank you.as many have mentioned, walking distance from union station, arturos is a cute little italian joint located near the cvs on the corner of canal.oh my god, the bacon.the giant homeade blueberry muffins and jalepeno cheddar bagels are to die for!..great food and service..&nbsp;friendly service.i give them a 5 on the bread and everything else goes downhill from there."
the-radler-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-radler-chicago,2,"I also really enjoyed the biscuit and kraut.we sat at the bar as we walked in on a weekend night without a reservation.you can find me one more towel, since i&#39;m still drooling.the rye bread was the most fantastic home made rye bread i have ever eaten.jeff, our waiter, was super helpful and recommended a great locally brewed sour beer that i fell in love with.one nice surprise was the fried chicken, which had a unique crispy crust.i would love for a family-style plate of food (sides potatoes, sauerkraut, etc.loved this place for a group dinner.i am sure it was a combination of their fair pricing and portions, the living wage ethos, and the previous chefs who made my experiences great dining experiences.you&#39;re welcome.perfect citrusy warm weather beer cocktail.there are so many other places that won&#39;t run out of sparkling wine during bottomless sunday brunch.what happened to this place? stopped in last night looking for their &#34;german street food&#34; counter i had read about a while ago and not only did we not find that, but the restaurant now resembles a bennigans?? i asked if ownership had changed and was told it hadn&#39;t, but the head chef had left and they had decided to go with a more casual dining vibe.the pretzel was delicious but the mustard side was also overpriced for what it was.loved this place!no wait on a saturday night for a party of 6 (doesn&#39;t take reservations)- done!everything was great, especially the creativity of each dish&#39;s accompaniments, often combining savory and sweet..&#34;this place used to be cool&#34;.the décor is that of a german bierhaus; cavernous but homey.the food came and was decent but nothing spectacular.we walked here from our place and will now make it a favorite.we just seemed like a bother for him.i liked the vibe.everything was delicious and the atmosphere is also great.loved the place! went with two friends in sunday for a brunch.my favorites were the ruben and the potato salad for sure.great service! jennifer was extremely knowledgeable about all the beers and let us try everything until we found exactly what we wanted.i finally tried and am glad i kept it on the list.smaller tables are available, too, but you could end up seated to others you don&#39;t know.other young couples were playing board games at the tables - yelling and squealing with glee.there was awesome grafiti on the wall, an open kitchen which had a super interesting real mural made out of bike parts..i&#39;ve got to say, one of my favorite things about the radler is the fact that it includes the taxes and tip in the bill.highly recommend the brussel sprouts appetizer and the the pretzel and mustard.i&#39;ve also tried brunch and dinner here..there&#39;s nothing wrong with a revolution or goose island beer, but i appreciate being able to try something new.however i had the brisket sandwich, lame.i can&#39;t say that i am up on what currants are supposed to taste like on their own, but this cider had a unique twist, setting it apart from the others..but also, they need to post signs at the bar stating that considering most people do not look in a menu to order a beer..it was ok.tried the knockwurst (good) and the reuben (not good).the poutine was extremely heavy.i enjoyed the braised beef sauerbraten (their version of a pot roast) - i just wish there was more on the dish! the pork schnitzel is good and you get a huge portion..on a bustling logan square street (milwaukee avenue) filled with bars to the brim, finding a place like the radler is far from the expected.but i think the days of heading to the radler for us may be done.the decor makes you think of a german beer hall but with a more sophisticated vibe.i kind of prefer their setup at the logan square farmers market, so i think we&#39;ll spare the cost of a full dinner and do that instead in the future.2.the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is casual yet sophisticated.so whatever you&#39;ve been doing recently.it really has a warm, inviting atmosphere, especially with some creative street art up on the walls.who ruins a pretzel? what kind of sick sociopath takes something as beautiful as a pretzel and decides to make it junk? i will say: the radler looks good, smells good, and seems good..we were quickly seated and i proceeded to order up a bloody mary with a &#34;back&#34; of kummerling, for only $2 extra bucks i might add.initially, however, it missed the bierhall mark a little bit by serving mostly small plates of expensive foods that did not always have the muster to match 1l of cold german beer.went in for a late lunch/early dinner on a gloomy saturday afternoon a few weeks ago..the wait for two people was estimated to be about 20 minutes, however the hostess did let us know if we wanted to snag a couple spots at a communal table near the host stand, we were more than welcome to pop a squat right away.there&#39;s a good selection of beers with an emphasis on german styles and, well, radlers, which are all fine and delicious.this food is billed as upscale, modern german food.i found the $6 radler selections to be very reasonable, i chose the blood orange which good."
naf-naf-grill-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/naf-naf-grill-chicago-3,1,"The fries are kinda like potato chips.the meat was a little tough, and i recommend not getting the tahini if you&#39;re getting your sandwich to go because the pita just breaks apart from the moisture, leaving you with a mess of a sandwich!.this naf naf location is clean and service is fast, but the food is lackluster.bleh.i am a little obsessed with the hummus bowl concept they have.props to her!..you don&#39;t get stuck with the basic rice / greens at the bottom and small dollop of hummus and sauce at top.not bad, i had the chicken shawarma pita.get their chips and use the garlic sauce to dip them in- oh my gosh this was sooooo good- who cares if you smell like garlic the rest of the day!.good food , fast and deliciousthe only reason i give 4 stars the service was litter crippy.also, their chips are great..it&#39;s  a family owned and owner always there not employees that do not care.food was good but not very authentic and lacking in spices.we&#39;ve had the falafel sandwiches and beef and chicken shawarma in a hummus bowl.alternately, place your order online!the only big turn off here is the one employee who is literally yelling.the steak in my hummus bowl was cold and the rest of the bowl was lacking that special seasoning that usually made a bowl here delicious.the pita is very good.great tasting food that almost rivals the döner i ate on the streets of istanbul.when your competing for our hearts remember that you are in chicago.while they don&#39;t follow the dearborn style i&#39;m used to, i can&#39;t deny how absolutely delicious everything is.he was very proud that we liked the pita bread because he makes them every morning! they also have a rice bowl (akin to that of chipotle) which i also suggest..i try to eat here at least once a week.it&#39;s worth trying out the new taste of the city.the menu did not list the different options for toppings and sauce so ordering was a bit confusing..the biggest problem i have is with the online ordering which has been not ready a few times when i showed up.i walked in and was the only one in line.my wife ordered the baba ganoush and this batch had a extremely smoky ashy taste.think chipotle only mediterranean.it was delicious!the staff was very friendly and took the time to explain what everything was, as well as gave me samples.you may feel acidic the next day, but it&#39;s definitely worth it! :denjoy!..i was curious because of the ridiculous name and it happens to be by my work...towards the end of my meal, i realized that a pita was included in a sleeve under the hummus, which improved the experience of eating the hummus.clean and friendly.you order at the counter vs a sit down restaurant.best food ever!!the place is extremely clean,they have the best pitas ever(i think it&#39;s well known already),u can defiantly tell that they using only fresh ingredients..i was confused since i ordered the bowl but still got a pita, carbs galore.highly recommended if you&#39;re in the area..also this particular location always looks so sad with the meh decor and lack of people dining in..i love their spicy green sauce, nice kick!.excellent food and very accommodating service.amazing food for the price.extra for hummus on a falafal pita? this place is way overpriced.good.beef schwarma hit that sweet balance between slightly crispy, greasy edges but juicy and easy to chew meat.place is nice."

i love that they offer half orders because a full order would have been too much for us to eat.even the same dish.excellent, the food the atmosphere and the service.the half portion was the perfect size, after starting with a small salad..drinks and dessert were okay with the tiramisu standing out.i really enjoyed the tenderness and texture of the seafoods.the food was delicious..another winning choice!overall - hands down one of the best classics ever.i appreciate that type of thing, so major brownie points for nick.i just feel like the clientele brings down an otherwise elegant place, but that is in no means an affront to the restaurant itself.it&#39;s crispy and served hot out of the oven!  you can get a half or a full size of the pasta dishes so i&#39;d definitely recommend mixing and matching so you can try more dishes!.the pasta here is awesome.compare to price/portions is a great deal.very good! and yet again, i enjoyed other people&#39;s dishes more than my own.very traditional italian restaurant that was fantastic.gotta dock a star for my server.&#34; good like the hill..very disappointing.it is super noisy and the tables are close together but if you want a great italian meal, you can&#39;t go wrong here.due to the stellar reviews here on my fave app, my boyfriend and i chose to try volare instead of going to one of our usual italian spots..the ravioli weren&#39;t as filled with ricotta as i would&#39;ve liked but still had great flavor.this is my first time here and from the looks of the kitchen patio in the restaurant the managers on duty everything is top notch.my friend didn&#39;t enjoy her lasagna either.i found this place through yelp, made a reservation, and brought my mom here.the chicken was good...i&#39;ve give it a 10.service was greatperson who ordered the veal and meatballs really enjoyed their mealgnocchi need a little more flavor but not badchicken was tender the spaghetti was lacking flavorlasagna i was told was delicious..the food was good- i got the lasagna, which tasted great, although the massive amount of cheese topping it made it feel a bit pizza-y, and i wish there was more tomato sauce inside it.what i do know - it&#39;s damn good food.i got a lasagna entree which was delicious.you can&#39;t go wrong with your choice on the menu.the focaccia bread taste sooooo good in the olive oil yum!okay, soooo since i have never been to this place i decided i would play it safe and order the chicken parm.ambience was average and very, very noisy.the desserts are wonderful and they have an excellent selection of wines, beers and cocktails.this is old-school italian, not the type of modern, dainty italian we chicagoans have been introduced to with all the new italian places popping up in the city.coworkers enjoyed the pasta they ordered..absolutely phenomenal italian restaurant, definitely check it out if your in downtown chicago and craving italian!.we had a reservation for 8:30 and were not seated until around 9pm.for the main, we ordered the special pasta which was a seafood linguine with clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp and calamari in a spicy tomato sauce."
windy-city-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/windy-city-cafe-chicago,1,"I just have to write another review.the portions were smaller than expected, but not small enough to elicite a complaints.tried also their caesar salad with chicken breast, the taste was okay.i was very impressed with this place.also they serve big shoulders coffee which is the best!.disappointing.all the other entrées i saw looked delicious and few plates had anything left for taking home.however my boyfriend ordered a breakfast skillet and that was the bomb! those potatoes that came in his skillet were made to perfection and that ham was marvelous! i wanted to almost exchange my dish.i also never felt rushed, despite the line out the door.lo and behold, the wait was approximately 5 minutes.filling.both were good dishes and both were warmly received by our toddler daughter.super friendly service, delicious food (and a massive menu), cosy and bright atmosphere.they serve big shoulders coffee here, which is a little strong and bitter for my taste, but i can doctor it up with cream and sugar.huge, huge menu, very friendly hipster-ish staff, eclectic clientele (big table of cops, neighborhood guys, families with kids), low prices, quality diner food (as someone else mentioned, fresh-squeezed juice at low prices was really nice surprise!), large portions.one of my favorites in the city.my only suggestion is to stay away from the sunday church rush.very little wait for a sunday brunch.i&#39;ve been coming to windy city cafe for breakfast and lunch for a couple years now and it never dissapoints! all of their soups are made from scratch and are all absolutely delicious! everything from the french dip to the biscuits and gravy is excellent.i&#39;ve tried just about everything on the menu but my favorites are the frittatas, hangover burger, and the salmon eggs benedict.thanks windy city!.this is my favorite hidden gem in chicago.i ordered the special, banana split pancakes, but requested no pecans.every time i go in to get the food she&#39;s also not so friendly.nice and fluffy and not greasy..you can also get there right off the blue line chicago stop.simply astounding food! a great menu with so much good stuff to pick from.everything i&#39;ve ordered has been wonderful and the service is always excellent (coffees and waters always filled).yesss, i would definitely recommend them!.loved it! it&#39;s such a neighborhood-y place, packed with locals and super friendly waitstaff.this was a win.no lattes, cappuccinos.i tend to be picky about my ingredients and many times ask for substitutions.if you like spicy, get the south of border skillet..great food for a great price and friendly service.so glad i came here.very good breakfast, you&#39;re set for about 7-12 dollar per person for a (very) large breakfast!service is great too, the coffee was free refill and the pancakes were the best american pancakes i&#39;ve ever had.i decided to try windy city cafe this morning for breakfast and was not disappointed.the apple cider was a pleasant surprised and kept up warm during a cold, fall, snowy day.i have been coming here for fifteen years and have a great meal every time.everything from the healthy to the decadent is covered..polite yet somewhat indifferent wait staff doling out insipid, boring, lackluster food.we ordered two omelets and neither one of us left a single bite on our plates.the prices were reasonable and the portions were generous..great portion size for the money.best huevos rancheros i&#39;ve ever had: great green salsa on top, just hot enough; no rice so i get more refried beans (yay) and a chopped salsa of tomatoes-red onion-cilantro.amazing.there was a nice assortment and it was all fresh.the food is delicious, the service is top notch and the prices are reasonable.i have done carryout a few times and it has always been great as well.i love this place.all pretty tasty, but personally i go with their huevos rancheros.the beef wasn&#39;t particularly fresh or flavorful..really solid meal with fresh ingredients..i told our waiter i had to pay for parking on the street, cause the cafe is located on one of those weird 6 corners of chicago.would have been nice to be informed though..the coffee was so weak i felt i was drinking water.it was very very very fresh, i actually ate all the vegetables.i live in river west and this is definitely my go to spot whether by myself, or if i have family/friends visiting.thank you for not doing that.food very well cooked.the food is always spot on and the friendliness can&#39;t be beat..salmon eggs benedict, cinnoman french toast , and fries are amazing! not to mention orange juice that will make you realize that any other juice is just not worth drinking..bonus: they serve big shoulders coffee.but hey, i&#39;m not there to make new friends; i&#39;m there to eat, so i wont&#39; hold that against her..the smoked salmon omelette was so good! it&#39;s a simple cafe not too much decor with good service and good food for a decent price, i will be coming back again.great breakfast and lunch diner.hands down the most incredible breakfast! the coffee is great and comes from big shoulders coffee from across the street! the staff is wonderful! we are traveling and had several bags but they took care of us! fantastic service! awesome food at a great price! you will leave with a doggy bag and very stuffed!now we have returned from our trip and we are passing through chicago on fathers day and this place was my choice to eat! again we have several suit cases and they helped us out.great staff, great food and great price (for two breakfast entrees, 2 coffees and a mexican hot chocolate it was just under $25 without tip).our waitress was so sweet and very pleasant to talk to! i order the burrito and a bagel.their biscuits and gravy are some of the best i have ever had.terrible line management upon entering paired with a member of the wait staff lecturing us about the inner door being opened as if she was our parent wasn&#39;t a great experience."
red-hot-ranch-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hot-ranch-chicago-3,2,"Pro: super affordable, fresh food, friendly staff, and clean facilities.with a minimalist menu focusing on hot dogs, burgers, and fries, there&#39;s a little taste for everyone.the fries were extremely greasy - a mushy wetness to them and definitely not as fried french fries should be..the only issue is that they&#39;re cash only, but you&#39;ll be able to look past this once you try the food.when i unwrapped the hot dog, the fries were packed on top of it, and i had to pull them off just to discover that the hot dog was super skinny, there was 1 tiny hot pepper, and barely any relish, mustard or onions..it&#39;s exciting when someone you patronize understands exactly what you want to eat.wow, cooked to perfection..will give those another try and see what happens..try the homemade fried shrimp!!.02:53: so good..the fries are very good too and the service is quick and friendly.burger was great..they use the smash technique with their burgers, which has become popular around town.pretty good, but i can&#39;t say it was so memorable that i&#39;d cross town for it.the burger is tasty and the rhr sauce/toppings are a good addition to the flavor..red hot ranch is the epitome of what a chicago hot dog stand should be.they rival goose island without a doubt.5 dollars total with tax!this is the best cheap meal deal in chicago.fries are freshly cut! nice and greasy! good customer service the only drawback is they are cash only.their burgers are awesome and always come out crispy, juicy and delicious.one of the better burgers i&#39;ve had in chicago.the whole cash only thing irks me, but with plenty of well-lit clean indoor seating, two tv&#39;s to watch the playoffs, free wifi, a small parking lot, ample street parking, being next door to art of pizza, and open until 4am, the confluence of positives cover that small annoyance.the fries are super seasoned.not much to review..it was really really good and is an amazing value for $5-$6.atm located inside.double cheeseburger and fries for $5.it&#39;s vienna apparently but it would spot on if the other &#34;greener&#34; relish was used.and it really is open that late...the first time i went, i had a cheeseburger which was absolutely delicious and the fries were crisp! next time i went, i ordered a couple of hot dogs and was pretty disappointed - the dogs were on the &#34;cold&#34; end and the fries were soggy; to top it all off, they used sliced pickles on a chicago style hot dog.hands down the best fast food burger and fries i&#39;ve ever had.for a burger similar to in n out this is probably the best spot in chicago.where can you get food cheaper than mcdonald&#39;s with amazing fries, hot dogs, and burgers.&#34;;7  ------ drunk me10 minutes later and i&#39;m throwing down a $5 like bond at blackjack, don&#39;t give a fahhhk.but it was well worth it.service is usually just transactional, and once was rude (although i had misunderstood that &#34;do you want the special?&#34; meant a sauce on the burger not fries and drink).unique burgers due to their signature sauce,theyre similar to culver&#39;s.red hot ranch has its own special place in my heart.ordered the cheeseburger and fries- special sauce! delish! place wasn&#39;t super busy so may impact quality of cooking but tonight..so, i went back and got the burger this time.don&#39;t bother.so five stars for the value..best burger in chicago.open till 4am most days.they have the same ingredients of lettuce, tomato, beef patties, and even their own version of a secret sauce.i add a little ketchup &amp; mustard to mine.cash only place.super rude owner/employee.but i&#39;m telling you, the burgers here are even better than the original!  better quality ingredients, prepared with great care and consistency.their fries are also very good and crispy.with wonderful hand cut fries and a drink, $6.very excellent hand cut fries.i thought the hot dog was bland and boring tasting and the fries, though hand cut as advertised, weren&#39;t crispy like i like them.75 (after tax)!! fries are fresh cut and amazing.overall, great experience, super cheap, good food.add in parking and sit-down space (the original location doesn&#39;t have that), and you are all good in the hood!.their red hot ranch special burger hits the spot every.minus one star for lack of a pickle slice, celery salt and a poppy seed bun, so technically not a &#34;chicago hot dog&#34;.the burger patties are so tiny.open amazingly late.in my opinion it&#39;s a little pricy for this style of dog and fries are &#34;included&#34; so if you want 2 dogs, you&#39;re getting, and paying for, 2 orders of fries whether you like it or not..i was so expecting a frozen patty that this absolutely blew my mind."
uptons-breakroom-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/uptons-breakroom-chicago,1,"-funny thing the mashed pot and gravy were very peppery, i kept wishing i could swap the herby sage flavor of the pastrami into the gravy and some of the pepper bite into the pastrami.try the bacon mac!!.i love this place and i&#39;m not sure why ben w would be so disrespectful and condescending in his review and feel it necessary to use such crude language.outdoor &amp; indoor seating.i&#39;m obsessed with the togarashi bowl.oh! the guys at the counter with both super friendly.also had the bacon mac &amp; cheese.i was so excited to finally eat at the breakroom.we felt, after we were done, &#34;that&#39;s it?? all that was like an appetizer!&#34; first of all, just to be clear, we are not a fat, overeating family.update: i mentioned in my review that the food was great but the service was lacking - and the response from the owner was so fast and so positive that i&#39;m giving back the star i took off for service.as soon as i left i seriously considered putting on a disguise and going straight back.it has been my experience delivery is actually the fastest way to go.great spot! find this place while my vegan buddy was in town.i felt like we&#39;d come to the mothership.the vegan ice cream was delicious! highly recommend.absolutely delicious food, friendly staff.tl;dr: i would eat here all the time.amazing!.trendy and clean with parking in the rear.definitely try it if you drop by.all were yummy.we shared sides of flash fried kale and mac and cheese.it&#39;s not your typical, run-of-the-mill vegan mac...i would suggest re-thinking some of the menu items (mac and cheese, tempeh and italian sandwich), even if that just means rotating out stuff on a seasonal basis or something.i was sooo disappointed in upton&#39;s.inside you&#39;ll find a counter to order and where the food is prepared and a few small tables for dining in.the fried bacon mac is amazing.clean shop, friendly staff, ice cream, stumptown cold brew and a completely vegan menu.i ordered the italian seitan sandwich, and requested the bacon mac and a rosemary peach scone &#34;to go&#34; for the next day.it&#39;s a real novel idea and i&#39;m glad upton&#39;s has followed through with it.the baked tofu in the salad was pretty good!.i really recommend it but it is very very small and can get quite crowded, so take-out might be a better way to experience their unique cuisine..my taste buds and i truly appreciate it!.updatechanging my review because i went back for a second visit.i think the sauce on this one could have used a bit more seasoning, but it was still quite tasty as-is.i had the korean tacos and the bahn mi which were both delicious.kale.tried the korean tacos.might i recommend uptons purchase a plant or two? or put up a chalkboard with the menu above the register?.my sister had the breakfast tacos and they were divine.it took me a minute to find it but once i did (the moustache dude on the wall helps) i was so happy and yet sad at the same time.the staff was super nice and the place was very clean.super excited about this restaurant!! i had the breakfast sandwich and it was really good!! the fried bacon and mac and is different but kinda tasty.the location is the northeast corner of hoyne and grand..the cheesy sauce on the sandwich was pretty good and the tofu was fine too.came here for the first time a couple of months ago and had the pastrami sandwich-fab.the bacon cheeseburger is unmatched in the city of chicago.worth the stop.food comes out fairly fast too.i loved everything i tasted with exception to the tofu scramble which was wet, which is a big texture no no for me.i would probably return to try the nachos.a hidden gem in west town.portions were decent (we were pretty road-hungry), but you&#39;ll probably want to get the mac and cheese as a side with any sandwich..the bacon was great and my only complaint is i want more of it! the breakfast sandwich was superb and a good value.a-ok i suppose.the workers have to do so much and they are all wonderfully pleasant.will definitely be coming back!.my husband got the bacon mac and cheese and mashed potato with gravy - it&#39;s always nice to find vegetarian versions of foods that are never vegetarian.they added vegan soft serve and now brunch all day saturday and sunday (waffles, scramble, everything you love about brunch)...we wanted some hot sauce and pepper for the table, but the only hot sauce we got was from the kitchen, and it tasted a lot like tabasco.and always plenty of free parking all around!.what else can i say except i&#39;ll be back.there are only a few tables.i didn&#39;t like that the cookie was $4.-chocolate chip cookie: they are massive and amazing!all vegan, all fantastic.and all of it is vegan!i will disclose that i have gotten to know the owner and his partner over the years and they came to say hello while i was there.."

thai-aree-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-aree-house-chicago,1,"Finally writing a review after several delicious dinners at thai aree house, which still holds the title of best thai in my opinion.final verdict:the panag curry was delicious and a must order!.also, the food is pure thai and he brings watermelon at the end as a digestive.i really enjoy this restaurant a lot.are excellent!  the char beef salad, yum nue or nue num tok is savory, spicy and exquisite (i have the menu in front of me).also, the egg rolls and steamed wontons were spot on.everything is fresh and delicious.the food is great (some of the better thai carry out in the city).this place has amazing wonderful delicious knock your socks off good food! the owner is so sweet and is very attentive and the sauces he provided were homemade.the owners are the nicest people and seriously you can&#39;t get a bad thing here..i ordered the noodle kee mow with chicken and my friend ordered the shrimp pad thai.we&#39;ll definitely be ordering from there again.absolutely delicious authentic thai food.i am cheap so i will probably just make food at home and order take out on occasion, but worth trying..the waiter (or owner?) asked how spicy we wanted it, and they accurately captured our requests (even for one dish that we requested mild-medium spicy).haven&#39;t dined in but definitely one of my new fav lunch spots!.on top of their great service, their food was delicious.nice and intimate..can&#39;t wait to go back again and again!..the owner certainly takes pride in the food they serve.the beef could have been beef jerky, since it was so tough!  i also tried the pad thai which was tasteless in a bad way!there are so many good thai food restaurants, don&#39;t waste your time or money here!.the panang curry was delicious.fresh ingredients with distinct flavors, as opposed to the &#34;gloppy&#34; stuff i&#39;ve come to expect from run of the mill asian places.we drive from the burbs for good thai and this filled the bll.the pad thai is on point, and i don&#39;t have words for the tom yum soup- it&#39;s delicious!be warned- the spice level of this place is intense- the mild/medium dishes are hot enough for me, and definitely considered hot at other thai joints.it is hard for me to eat thai these days, with a little one at home with a peanut allergy.best service in chicago!!!the food is outstanding, but what makes this place extra special is the amazing hospitality.i got green curry, mild, and it was a little spicy but i didn&#39;t finish it and used a bunch of rice so it was good.but if you want authentic, reasonably-priced and amazing thai food with wonderful service, look no further..loved the green curry and basil chicken.95, the portion was just right and plenty filling for one meal..usually do pick-up from here but have also dined in.this place has good food, but be aware of the spicy levels! we were warned before ordering even medium spice level, but went for it anyway.have to take tom yum sea food, for two to share it n try one or two of their fishes.i tried thai aree house after my huaband and i have tried several other thai restaurants..have always been happy with the food and service, unfortunately when some people smoke too much and get old they loose their taste buds, so they need to have their food over seasoned to be able to taste anything.i only wish they were open for lunch.you get your moneys worth with the size portions you given.there were also four house-made sauces on the table that the owner explained in detail.this place is the real deal..she was so busy.flavors are not complex and perhaps a bit rough compared with higher end thai places but they are authentically based and have not taken on that overly sweetened taste of much american thai food.we get takeout a lot from this place because the restaurant is kind of a hole in the wall, but definitely eat in your first or second time - the owner is amazing at recommending and coaching your order to be fabulous.i&#39;m looking forward on taking some friends, so they can have a great time there as i did..just kidding.new update.awesome flavor.its full of vibrant lemongrass and galangal flavors, punchy saltiness from fish sauce and however spicy you would like it.beware ordering it hot!  whooo weeee.all of the selections were very tasty and our group had a wonderful time.??

this is tricky because i have so many items to recommend, between the soups, sandwiches, burgers, lobster ravioli, salmon and eggs benedict (breakfast)the portion sizes here are rather large and the prices are extremely reasonable.one thing i will say is that the service is awesome, the staff are really nice and friendly which can be rare in the city!!!.the other really bright spots for this neo-diner are the burgers.will return again.as far as food/drink, i got a latte and the veggie hash.delicious.great service, great food, can&#39;t go wrong at this neighborhood spot.my go to take out spot!.hidden gem in gold coast.it has a cute and cozy atmosphere though.shocker..seats are way too close together.but for me it&#39;s all about the cheese and bread.i&#39;m notorious for dining alone, but also need somewhere to take my daughter, or god forbid a date these days.great for breakfast, lunch and dinneri really like this place  :)).it was like eating a special dessert and they serve it with whipped cream =) for $3.the texture itself is amazing- the clubs are good- the desserts are generous- cajun penne pasta - yes.it&#39;s inside the hotel entrance to the side.yeah, he was the only server and he had a couple other tables to take care of, but i still don&#39;t think that&#39;s an excuse for rude behavior.i loved the soup- mild spice, loaded with beans and barley.cozy environment except the annoying machine that makes this sound like someone is closing down one of those folding metal door each time it is used.very close to where i work so i figured i&#39;d check it out because they had a good selection of salads.can get pretty crowded for brunch so don&#39;t mind a wait.the cajun chicken pasta is single handedly at fault for the fact that i can&#39;t seem to lose those last five pounds.i got the smoked turkey and brie with spinach ceaser salad.today it was a saturday brunch so it was less busy and there was no wait for a table.the hash browns were a little greasy for my liking but you can&#39;t beat the price for the area, i&#39;d definitely come back.the best key lime pie ever!!! they make it homemade.burger, turkey &amp; brie sandwich and salad were some of the best we have had in a long time!  great food, ambience, and service!  will definitely return again.the two times i have gone here as a walk in and it took about 10 - 15 minutes to be seated because this place gets packed..i really wish nobody knew about this place, because i want it to myself.what a find!  we were looking for a quiet spot on a friday night for a glass of wine, without having to get all dressed up.the greatest diner-ish spot in the gold coast; forever the go-to.lately i go here many a tuesday night, because there is a group that meets to practice speaking spanish.great breakfast, great burgers, great coffee.they had nice drink specials on sunday morning, but i didn&#39;t try them this time, i had blueberry pancakes and hash browns- no major complaints.what makes this restaurant so dynamic is the owner - she is a kind and caring individual, always ensuring that her guests are happy and satisfied.the sauce was surprisingly good and everything had good flavor.i don&#39;t like hard ceilings that reflect the noise and raise the volume level in a restaurant.also note that they do not have their full regular cafe menu during brunch hours.upon learning that we weren&#39;t ordering food, the waiter huffed up and practically yanked the menus out of our hands.i had the house omelette with ham and cheese and peppers and it was very tasty.the food was excellent.the food was excellent and portioned just right, and came out pretty quickly fresh and ready.the food is always top notch in quality and is served promptly after ordering..your presence in the neighborhood helps retain its integrity and not lose hold of reality.for all of these reasons, the 3rd coast is fine dining that you&#39;ll want to experience again and again.try a flavored latte-the hazelnut one was delicious!! i got the banana pecan pancakes and hash browns and they were delicious.bloody mary&#39;s come with a ghost cheese that&#39;s deliciously spicy and for $5 above avg.you do not feel terrible about hanging out and having that long heart to heart with that buddy you are attempting to make up with-- no dirty looks or furious glimpses from workers.good food and great service.it was only a few blocks away so we decided to give it a try.the menu features all the breakfast staples, burgers, chicken, soups, salads, tacos and bakery items ."

big-star-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/big-star-chicago,1,"I got an alambre, pescado (fish), chorizo, and pastor.i can also definitely see the appeal if you&#39;ve had a few too many!maybe things have changed.the third time i went at the end of this summer, i had a great food experience but terrible service.the service here was a little disorganized as we dined at the bar.the tacos were kinda one note and nothing special.she said it in a way that implied we couldn&#39;t possibly be missing anything and was very arrogant and sarcastic..i would absolutely come back even though i really hate crowds - i&#39;ll fight through it for that zanahorias taco!.but for a chicago joint they do a hell&#39; of a good job on taste!!!very delicious and drinks have never been watered down yet (knock on wood)!love it every time!.i felt as if i was in a public bathroom( like the ones by the beaches of chicago.brown lettuce throughout.a popular spot near one of the busiest intersections.there&#39;s a hostess up front, but if you&#39;re not willing to wait, you can usually get a spot in the large bar out back.trendy,  fun, hip.i&#39;m hoping this was just a bad day for them.based on this experience, i&#39;d skip this place and just order from the window next door.just landed tonight and decided wicker park would be my first venture out into the city.thus was our first meal while in chicago for a long weekend.get it to go or go straight to the bar.there&#39;s also a line for this, but much shorter than waiting for a table.this place was just straight up cool.the tacos here are definitely not tiny so you are getting your money&#39;s worth.for dinner, i think 3 tacos is a good option, though a bigger guy might want more.sometimes you are super fun.we sat outside, some it seemed that was the only place to sit.i do have to say service was pretty good, we were seated on the outdoor patio within a few minutes of putting our names down even though the place was packed on a saturday afternoon.between the four of us, i think we tried every taco on the menu, plus salsas and gauc.the fish and pork belly tacos were as good as advertised.i loved big star!!!our neighbors hyped it up so we definitely had to go.all i all, can&#39;t go wrong with big star...so many people have recommended big star since the move to chicago, finally got to try it this past weekend picking up some grub before the panic/ weezer concert.the tacos? right int he sweet spot.there&#39;s a patio area for the summer but alas, it&#39;s super cold.however, they were of good quality.the outdoor seating is super fresh and fun.usually 3 tacos makes a decent meal.always a good time.i had a chicken taco and a margarita at the bar.it&#39;s a taco place; although it&#39;s in wicker park which used to be super edgy and awesome, the neighborhood is now kid-filled, so we thought we could grab a quick taco and a beer w/ our kids at 2 on a wednesday.if i have one complaint, the waitress was so soft spoken! it was difficult to hear her and i felt like i shouted in responding to her to overcompensate for her quietness!overall, big star is a must..to my disappointment i got a water down drink that looked like non-fat milk.the tacos are pretty good but you will find tastier ones in less-noisy spaces in chicago..."

so found this small cozy cafe on yelp and it is worth the 4.the best sandwiches i&#39;ve ever tasted.that says a lot for someone who lives in an atlanta suburb of high vietnamese population.i will likely try the honey grilled pork next time.they are still fast with their service without losing quality.it is probalby the best vietnamese spot for people live in the loop.also, lotus items can be a little expensive; sandwiches run around $7, and the rice bowl cost around $10.also got the spring rolls which were amazing even though i don&#39;t really eat tofu! definitely recommend trying this place out!! their strawberry banana smoothie was also made with fresh fruit and was absolutely delish.the bread was perfect and it had just the right amount of chewiness and flakiness.the wings were some of the best i&#39;ve ever had.solid banh mi spot!great food, crusty bread, quick service.ymi le was the cashier at the time and she was so lovely and friendly.quick and friendly service.the free parking is a nice feature and it will hopefully help all of the businesses around this area by bringing in customers.i&#39;ve only been here twice, but it&#39;s my new favorite banh mi spot! i&#39;ve had the sunny-side beef and the honey grilled pork, and both were delicious.my boss has gone here 3 times in the same week and has said nothing but great things about this place.pleasant, quiet, and free wifi: lotus is the perfect place to cool off on a hot summer&#39;s day.easily the best banh mi sandwich i&#39;ve ever had.quick and inexpensive lunch menu.the only reason i didn&#39;t give this place 5 stars is because it&#39;s not authentically vietnamese.one more time for effect, &#34;they have the best chicken wings i have eaten in chicago&#34;!.i love this place, it is close to my place, and it&#39;s delicious..i&#39;ve now had the sunny side beef bah mi twice, and i do recommend it..the portion was great.i&#39;ve ordered the honey grilled pork for my first sandwich, and that was classic! the bun was nicely toasted and portions were great.location is convenient and service is quick so its an overall winner - will definitely be back.i needed a fork!.experience was fine.sometimes it&#39;s a little spicy but still good, just pull off the hot stuff.absolutely delicious! had the ginger chicken and honey chicken..thank you, lotus, for being awesome.everyone on yelp goes bonkers for the sunny-side beef and i don&#39;t get why.all the sandwiches typically come with jalapeno, mayo, cucumber, cilantro, daikon, and jalapeno; i just chose to have only the mayo and cilantro as my toppings, i&#39;m odd, i know! you also have the option to add egg or avocado to any banh mi too.a big plus was free and very convenient parking a few steps from the place, although the parking assistant told us, they would start charging back again from july 13th.had the chicken wings for an app and they were so tasty.bummer.pricey viet sandwich.they also made my viet coffee perfectly with the less condensed milk i have requested.my favorite are the 1) sunny side and 2) honey grilled pork.i&#39;m guessing that these sandwiches have been americanized to fit the local pallette, but this is disappointing because authentic banh mi sandwiches are so delicious and don&#39;t need modification.the biggest difference will be that the sandwiches are warm and toasty compared to some other sandwich places (ba le comes to mind) where the sandwiches are more similar to cold cuts.ginger chicken banh mi was super flavorful and the fresh toppings just make the sandwich special.sounds like this must have been some really out-of-this-world pho! :-)truthfully, i was disappointed that we weren&#39;t able to order pho but the sunny side beef bahn mi sandwich completely made up for it! the bahn mi sandwich was both fresh filled with cilantro, peppers and sweet potato and hearty filled with beef and a sunny side up egg.i came here because i was told they have tasty smoothies and yes, yes they do.i would definitely come here again and more bring friends!!.the sandwiches are worth the price.and the mushroom banh mi was fantastic: the grilled mushrooms were seasoned very well.well worth the stop.popped in here for a quick lunch while in town and the sandwiches were delicious..you get pretty full off one 1 banh mi..i&#39;m also vietnamese and have had my fair share of vietnamese food.we will definitely be back.the banh mi sandwiches here were pretty good! i would definitely give them both four stars.the yolk was cooked to perfection, just enough so that it was runny throughout the sandwich but did not drip anywhere outside or get on my hands.we tried their sunny side beef and the ginger chicken..the sunny side egg is an awesome addition to any banh mi sandwich that u can add on.i would order this again in a heart beat as well!.smoothies are never a bad choice but i usually always get the iced jasmine milk tea, which always has a strong jasmine tea flavor but is light and refreshing as well.fyi, parking is free for 2.that being said, this place has some seriously amazing food!visited this gem inside the uic food court and was intrigued by all of their menu options.the veggiecado is soooo fresh and delicious.i love this place! been ordering it delivery for the past year or so but didn&#39;t really understand how good it was until i popped in there and had it served fresh.i have tried the mushroom, chicken, pork, steak banmis and they are all very good!  their grilled chicken vermicelli salad and fried spring rolls are delicious.the bread was nice and crunchy.all sandwiches are top notch..definitely a must for anyone who is a fan of banh mi.this was a let down for me.they also serve an iced jasmine milk tea that&#39;s pretty amazing, although a little sweet.."

noodles-in-the-pot-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/noodles-in-the-pot-chicago,1,"Other than that, food was great (especially the chicken pad khe mao!) , but i would prefer to order carry out or delivered after my experience dining in.chicago -- of all the wonderful things you have, thai food is not your strong suit, but yet there&#39;s so much of it to offer.their outside patio is great in the summer.overall, things are ok to good.street parking.i&#39;ve been on a massamun curry lately even though panang or yellow curry are my favorites.apps were good.this place is a hidden gem..they put cream cheese in it, didn&#39;t use the usual rice paper to roll the roll, and it had a gravy-like sauce (tamarind sauce, a really sweet tangy fruit) which i think is supposed to be their spin on the usual peanut sauce that goes on spring rolls..thats all i keep going back for at that place.everything on the menu that we have tried has been great, especially the crab rangoon, the beef and broccoli, and the spicy pad khee mao (which we usually get with chicken)..bright and fun atmosphere, plus it&#39;s byob! definitely will be going back there!.i ordered the coconut curry expecting to have my mind blown.it is safe to say i&#39;ll be coming here more often!.it doesn&#39;t come with rice.another thanks to fellow yelpers for finding an awesome place for dinner., not rude, but not friendly, either..it is inexpensive and delicious, so you really can&#39;t go wrong with that.with the two curries we got one small box of rice.normally by the time beef dishes are delivered, the meat is more like jerky than an actual nice cut of meat.probably won&#39;t go back.they kindly arranged the patio tables for us 4 adults and 4 kids..whenever you need affordable and unpretentious thai food, this is your spot!.delicious, affordable, and great location.this place has quickly become a staple of mine both for dining in and carry-out.the food was delicious, the patio is so nice, the service as fast, and it&#39;s byob.enough said.everything else i&#39;ve ordered though - has been not as great.ordered the chicken pad thai and crab ragoon and the total came to $18 with delivery (eh)..one of the best thai food i&#39;ve eaten! the portions are generous.prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get, i only spent $20 for an app, entree, tax, and tip.however the service is a whole different story.i ordered a a spicy basil tofu dish that was so good, we actually went back the following week, and i ordered the same thing for take-out.super affordable, i think our whole meal for 2 people was like $22..i love the string lights hanging over the courtyard..we had the noodle soup, tom yum soup, some sort of garlic shrimp dish, and another beef vegetable dish.i went to check out this place to see whats the hype about since it located near my school.it&#39;s byob, has a very cozy/cute outdoor patio and the food was excellent.the food is good.we sat outside and it was a pleasant day.often thai and chinese places have plain or dingy dining areas, if they have a dining area at all.bring your appetite because it&#39;s a good sized portion.we had pot stickers and crab rangoon as appetizers.quick, simple, and well worth the money.wow.i like to leave enough sauce, after i eat the chicken, to pour on my rice..byob without a cork fee, which is virtually unheard of these days! friendly, fast service when eating at the restaurant as well as for deliveries..lastly, the service was weird: they kept trying to take away our dishes before we were done eating.mahbe it&#39;s cuz we went 30mins before close? regardless i expected better based on reviews and pricing.would of liked to know that beforehand or bern better accommodated when i called back.all in all, not bad, but i don&#39;t think i would go out of my way to come here again.is it the best or a destination restaurant? probably not."

yum! now to start i need to admit that i&#39;d never heard of italian beef until marrying a midwest man from il.the onion rings were great too.came here to do the must-try&#39;s of chicago.i don&#39;t regret at all eating hotdogs for breakfast.i had a good time while i was here and i&#39;m sad i didn&#39;t get to try their famous chocolate cake made with mayonnaise! yum.will be back during my next chicago visit!.to drink i went for the daisy cutter by half acre, again something i cannot frequently enjoy in my hometown of denver.you just get used to slamming chili cheese dogs with fries and a coke from the same place, you&#39;re gonna like it.yes! i can&#39;t believe i just described a hotdog sandwich being refreshing (^^the italian beef is a bit heavier but it&#39;s still yummy! i would definitely have it again!.i understand why there isn&#39;t a parking lot, but i still wish there was!the drive thru is crazyyy impressive.staff always seems to be pleasant with the constant flow of visitors rolling in and out of the spot.requested a little extra gravy sauce on the side to dip it in, wanted to do the dipping myself :).super busy..i come here for their chocolate cake shakes.we were given a number and picked a table.very rich.you know it&#39;s good when the locals list it as their fav&#39; as well!!!.all in all, it took about 25 minutes in line   and then it took a while for  the food to be ready, but still fast considering how many orders they had to prepare.really solid taste of chicago.if you want beer you have to go to a separate counter to order that..weird.make sure you also order the cheese fries and if your bold, the &#34;chocolate cake shake&#34;.the italian sausage and maxwell street style polish were slight letdowns.on my most recent trip to chicago, i also tried the &#34;famous&#34; chocolate cake.the line will probably be long when you come unless you come at a really off time.it was not to busy when we stopped here to grab a chicago dog it was pretty good nice service.the cashier wrote down my order on a red&amp;white striped paper bag.the only saving grace was the cheese sauce that came with the fries.lol.when you&#39;re in chicago you must eat at portillo&#39;s! i went around lunch time and the wait time was minimal a 10 minute wait.we luckily stumbled upon this restaurant without even looking for it.sure, i&#39;m glad i got to say that i got a chance to try chicago&#39;s italian beef, but i would prefer that i wasn&#39;t using 20 napkins to sop up all the excess oil.there are two lines to order your food and after you&#39;ve sold whatever dignity you had after you walked in, you wait for someone to slap together your dog and yell out your number like a prisoner awaiting sentencing.we got in line and ordered at one station, walked up to another to tell them what we ordered and then waited elsewhere for the order to be called.absolutely delicious.this is probably what heaven&#39;s like or pretty darn close at least..i even went on the location menu and it does not tell me about how much it is to buy in bulk..i liked the wrinkle cut fries and would like to try the italian sausage next time.i would definitely come back to this restaurant.if i return to chicago, this would be the first restaurant i hit up for a nice and affordable meal for lunch.i&#39;ve come to realize that &#34;satisfying&#34; is often at times higher praise than &#34;delicious&#34; when it comes to food.wonderfully moist and decadent, it will leave you with a suger high as you leave this throwback era amusement park.there are different vendors right next to each other so i thought you&#39;d just pick one and go stand in line.the dog and sandwich were really good but left us with no room for the cake.the entire meal cost ~$8 (although i could have probably done without the garlic bread)..the cake was so good.i faced a seemingly long line during lunchtime, but it moved quickly, which i was happy about on my way to the airport.loved every bite!.perfectly crispy.the portion is a monstrosity you will pretty much scarf this down and be in immediate food coma..i was in town looking for a taste of chicago.i have lots of respect for a person who began in a small trailer and has morphed his business into multiple locations.all in all a good experience..otherservice was quick and easy.it can be a bit hectic at the pick up station.one recommendation for the management team, please have a sign for the portillo&#39;s order line and the sign for the barnelli&#39;s line.everyone that comes to chicago just raves about it! i was pleased to see they were right around the corner from our hotel.everything&#39;s good and servings are satisfying.i&#39;ll start by saying that portillo&#39;s has been my staple for years and years, and i&#39;ve always thought it was one of the better places in chicago to eat.i thought i was ordering portello&#39;s and  end up ordering a sandwich from a nother restaurant.a must place to eat when visiting chicago.he&#39;s also tried the beef and cheddar and loved it as well.hugely busy, and therefore i guess, hugely popular.one bite was a wonderful combination of different textures and flavors that blended together very well.you wait to pick up your order.high fives all round portillo&#39;s!.."

gather-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/gather-chicago,2,"Staff is especially caring and interested in making customers happy!.overall: 4..we started with the ricotta &amp; honey toast, not only was it so good but they gave you many pieces of toast.had the family style dinner yesterday.my partner really enjoyed his carbonara.it&#39;s been a very long time since i&#39;ve been to a highly-rated yelp restaurant where i completely agreed with the high rating after dinner, no disappointments at all.my friend who likes them &#34;okay&#34; couldn&#39;t stop raving about these!  they were amazing.we didn&#39;t know they had a beautiful back patio, but maybe one day, i can snag a table and sit out there.i went here with a party of 4 last year for a birthday party.if i had a do-over, i would probably go for the pan seared cod or diver scallops as my entrée instead.i have had dinner, brunch, and drinks here so far after moving to ravenswood about two months ago.10 minutes after we were seated, two opened up and new patrons were offered outside dining..i had dinner here recently with my son, it was wonderful!  it was the best dinning experience that i have had in awhile.this place won my heart over by creating exceptional food and top-notch service in a comfortable, understated atmosphere..yum!.the bacon was perfectly smoked.i know we had three things.we ordered a sticky bun to start with (delicious) but it didn&#39;t come until our entrees did, which i thought the waiter should have mentioned..my friends got the steak and eggs, and the ramp scramble both were delicious and we all had to go boxes...this is my new favorite restaurant..it was my least favorite but still solid.the chefs and owners here definitely are a cut above and the attention to detail in exciting..great wines and cocktails.we should have listened to our server and stopped at four dishes to share, but we couldn&#39;t decide, so we went for five.light and fluffy and creamy, i joked that i could have eaten the whole mini mason jar of it myself.but it was a little overkill.the fried chicken, spaghetti and meatballs, and polenta are particular stand outs that are so comforting to have on sunday night.the food, the staff, and the ambiance make it worth a visit!..the menu is set up for sharing and gives a great opportunity to try different dishes.different, mentally i didn&#39;t like it.we just grabbed a couple plates to share before a show- the gather board was delicious.my girlfriend and i had a reservation for a table but decided to switch to the chefs table (which id highly suggest).average food and awfully slow service, mostly at that price range.is fantastic, and i highly recommend ordering when it is available.on another note, if you get a chance to sit at the chef window, do it.not a single person in the restaurant even bothered acknowledging how late the food was..i tried the daydream believer which is a gin based drink - if you like gin you will love it - so light and refreshing.overall, i had a good experience at gather and would definitely come here again.they promptly responded and were very accommodating.both bathrooms are pretty clean!.the cauliflower plate was asian inspired.it was 7 p.i was debating between a couple options and chose the burger, which was suggested.i love that there are plenty of vegetarian options for my husband.i want to eat here every night.you&#39;re greeted by the owner, and he is both kind and welcoming.i was so happy i drove to gather for a wonderful experience on excellent cuisine.like i said the ambiance is nice, the drinks were great, but when it comes to the food don&#39;t expect to be wowed.our group of four adults and two babies had brunch on a sunday morning.proximity to the western brown line makes it that much better.the menu changes with the season, and the bartenders are high quality who make well balanced cocktails.their fried brussel sprouts or whatever they are called are beyond amazing.a few had the biscuits and gravy so delicious.came here on a sunny saturday and was shocked to find the place not totally crowded.we&#39;ve had members of our party with strict dietary restrictions and their food was delicious and without error.hands down favorite restaurant in lincoln square! very romantic, fun with friends too, and great shareable plates! love the brussels sprouts and meat &amp; cheese board.it is so loud - even on the patio.we really enjoyed our visit, and gather certainly earns its 4.the food was delicious!  steak tar tar is a must!  i&#39;ll definitely go back.i love food and flavors however, this was completely unusual..for entrees we ordered the chicken and rainbow trout.perfect for special occasions or any other time when you want to eat food crafted for a king and service to match!.the sticky bun was everything you want: an ooey glaze on top of a warm bun.oh my.great wine list, delicious &amp; creative food and the sweetest staff! we&#39;ve been 8 times over 1..this place scored me points with both a date and friends from out of town.each plate had one ingredient too many.can&#39;t go wrong with anything you order."
en-hakkore-2-0-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/en-hakkore-2-0-chicago,1,"So happy we found this restaurant.there were only two other preoccupied tables and the waiter was very friendly and helpful.i kind of hate the fact that i live so close, because now i&#39;ll be forced to go here at least once a week.a few weeks ago i tried my first ever sushi burrito , the guy at the front was super charming and helpful and recommended &#34;fire..staff was super friendly...but there&#39;s fork/chopstick on the side to wrap up the end bits, as well as the danky gochujang hot sauce!.they did a good job with the rice portion since a lot of other places have really thick layer of rice in their burrito.this place is a gem in wicker park.fantastic sushi burrito and poke salad! very filling!however, tables and bathroom aren&#39;t checked for cleanliness too often (when we were there) hopefully this is just that hour of that day.0 has set the benchmark.stopped in with friends after having some drinks and feeling like a sushirito.now we can actually say chi-town does have sushi burritos.they are both pretty different from each other so people shouldn&#39;t come in having the same expectations.got the tofu bibimbop and the special which was tofu tacos with an amazing spicy mayo on it.the fire is pretty spicy but not too much where you can&#39;t it it.this place is amazing..the fish was fresh and stuffed with fresh veggies and flavor.makes it a creamier consistency!.i would highly recommend both.those aren&#39;t on this menu.got the crunch and fire burritos, both were great.the garlic honey wings here are the crispest and some of the best i&#39;ve had! the kimchi fries are also a great match..spicy tuna sushirrito was super fresh and  yummy! will be back to try the shrimp tempura one and fried chicken wings.sushi burrito at it&#39;s finest! wholesome portions and fresh ingredients.0 is definitely worth checking out! of note to us were the kimchi and chorizo fried rice and the crunch sushi burrito.i always only get the fire sushi burrito and the spicy gochujang wings because i know i&#39;ll love them.the kimchi fries were amazing.first time trying sushi burrito! was there with a friend at 12 noon! first customer there, people started coming in later.the food is spicy, crunchy, soft, chewy, sweet, and savory all at the same time.check this place out!.sushi burritos in general are messy to eat though so wouldn&#39;t recommend this for a date or someone you&#39;re not super comfortable with.fusion restaurants are always fun to try.my friend and i also got the kimchi fries which were a disappointment..also it is imo not as good.i ordered the fire sushi burrito, and i highly recommend it if you like a little kick!  i plan on trying their fried chicken on my next visit!.and i wish there was a higher fish to everything else ratio.i stole a bite..the burrito was awesome, wings were great, would have liked them a little crispier vs soggy for korean wings but overall really awesome.i was stuffed, but so satisfied! can&#39;t wait to go back already..i also split the poke salad.highly recommend!.we had the spicy tuna sushirito, bulgogi burrito, and kimchi fries.the soft shell crab one is by far my favorite one thus far.$13 a little pricey, but pretty good overall..they serve large portions and it was all delicious.i would recommend to try korean wings! they were really good.this place is exactly what wicker park needed to fill the void of asian influenced, quick food with fresh ingredients.i also ordered waffle fries and that may be the only thing that&#39;s not korean.it&#39;s also in a place with lots of shopping and bars so there&#39;s plenty to do before/after.they offer a few drinks and i loved the kimchi!sitting by the window is excellent for people watching and the waiter was very friendly.0 has a decent selection of sushiritos that will appease sushi noobs and pros alike.i&#39;ve also had the spicy wings, which may just be my favorite wings non-buffalo wings in the area...the ceviche was my favorite, the fire a close second.although they are lacking in options for sides, this has become one of my favorite places to get a quick bite in the form of a delicious sushi burrito.they totally didn&#39;t have to but made me a whole new roll free of charge.definitely seems more filling than a regular burrito.super happy with this addition to wicker park, i&#39;ll definitely be returning!.i visit again, there are  a lot of customersbut they service really quick and nice.ice been here a couple times and always enjoy my meal.flavor is just amazing!! the only disappointment is that it isn&#39;t as big as a burrito, more like a wrap.the tuna quality was questionable as well.the tuna was also superb quality and super velvety in texture.it had a perfect texture and crunch to it.awesome sushi burritos!! chicken wings were good as well..highly suggest.i just had the fire burrito and it was wonderfully delicious.i came during saturday lunch and it wasn&#39;t too packed or loud.the kimchi fries had an amazing white sauce! but the kimchi itself was a little slimy for us.if you don&#39;t like raw fish, they also have bibimbap burrito or fried rice that you could try."

uprising-pizza-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/uprising-pizza-chicago,1,"Now one of my top 5 resturants.they do offer beer and wine options, as well as cookies or ice cream for dessert..would go back.).i&#39;m on a bit of a kick at this place, i get their salads all the time because they&#39;re super delish and reasonable for what you&#39;re getting.love the speed.thank goodness for uprising..go for it, you have nothing to lose and likely to find a new favorite spot..looks delicious.all around good spot and i&#39;d definitely come back...living and working in for over a decade now, really excited to have uprising in the neighborhood, quality joint!.wood fired not deep dish, so it&#39;s lighter, and of course a different style.the bad: bland pizza and way too thin of pizza.the place is pretty small, as i think it caters more to people who are getting takeout, but the seating has an industrial feel to it, which i particularly enjoy.my bf and i stopped in for a quick dinner after work and ended up ordering two pizza&#39;s and ice cream because it was so good and so fast.holy goodness it was so good.my only criticism was the white pizza had too much arugula on it - but if that&#39;s my only criticism, i think this is a damn good place.the food comes quickly which is always a plus when you&#39;re eating out with little kids.very nice employees, i plan to try some of the sandwiches, salads and kimmer&#39;s ice cream soon.i will definitely be back!!.i was very delighted to see this type of place go in.take that, deep dish cookie cutters!.i came in just as the store was about to close (not intentionally, i typically would never do that to a restaurant / kitchen!), but the owner was cool enough to offer to make one last pizza, just for me.the combo of the decor alongside ordering at the counter keeps uprising at just chill enough to be a great place to pop in and grab a pizza with friends or a chic neighborhood place to take your favorite guy/gal out for good food and conversation.swung by friday evening and the place was pretty occupied but turnover is somewhat high since they do spin out food quick.i was loving every bite of that fresh dough bread with their italian sausage, onions, sliced pepperoncinis, mozzerella all smothered in a hot tomato sauce.wood fired pizza yessssss."

little-lamb-hot-pot-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-lamb-hot-pot-chicago-2,2,"This was okay.it was fine, great experience to try out chicago hot pot.but i was pleasantly surprised by the standard of the soup bases here.scallion pancake was really lackluster, stay away.it&#39;s totally lost without even say a sorry.i also tried tripe for the first time and i was so pleasantly surprised! very rubbery, but the taste was quite nice.but here you know for sure that they have much better quality food than mandarin kitchen.while it is not all you can eat, the food does taste better.there were dipping sauces for an extra charge that helped add some flavor and cut some of the spiciness.the price is very affordable! i&#39;m very recommend this place.but overall, it just wasn&#39;t anything memorable.kinda along the lines of an asian melting pot or fondue.great flavor but pricy..we added mushrooms, dumplings, beef, watercress and bok choi..you never want go back there, you can even make this kind food at home, taste no good at all! if this place open in china it will be close after few days.i also really like how they have awesome bbq lamb items available.love that there are vegetarian options for the broth.this is one of my favorite spots in chicago! we make it a tradition every year to go at least once.in addition, there&#39;re plenty of sauces to select that you can mix-and-match depending on your mood-of-the-day.this one was by far the worst because of the broth.we ended up ordering from their bar menu.glad we did the waiter was super nice and never rushed us.their sauces are the best i&#39;ve ever had in chinatown though.their meat and vegetable selection is varied and generally pretty fresh and seasoned well..i really enjoyed this place the first time, but there are so many other places to get hot pot where we&#39;ll actually get served.the ingredient quality is much better than places like mandarin kitchen and there is a wide selection of meats, veggies, mushrooms, and other ingredients..even though it&#39;s twice the cost of the lamb leg and both have the same amount of meat, the shoulder is much more tender while the leg is tough.first of all, this is not 100% mongolian restaurant.there are only two of us, so we ordered supreme beef slices, premium lamb slices, tong ho, napa cabbage, mushroom platter, and tofu platter.i like how they have a wide assortment of condiments and even cheatsheets on how to make your own sauce.little spendy ($15-20 per person before tip) but if you can afford that, you&#39;ve got to go here.i never hard about hot pot til last chinese new year when i experienced at native friends home..it&#39;s a lot of fun..i am pretty sure the owner paid someone for that review..just plan on being there for a while, the food takes time to make and eat..food was ok and they have some good sauces; however it&#39;d just be my one time spot since 1) i can make all that in less than 1/3 of the price home 2) before they have a waitlist and more organized service i won&#39;t be there again.szechuan spicy hotpot is another system though.once again, the meat presentation was nice and the quality is still there.the herbs gave combinations of smell, which is not bad at all,  but i&#39;m not used to it.the fatty beef was delicious as was the sweet corn.food quality is solid every time.we ordered the spicy broth, frozen tofu, fish tofu, napa cabbage, chinese broccoli, enoki mushrooms, and glass noodles, which ended up being the perfect amount of food for the two of us.my favorite of favorites! i&#39;m a big hotpot enthusiast and can say that this is as good as it gets in chicago.for drinks we each did a 2 buck shot of the red star, 35%  tastes like wine and goes down easy.a+ in my book.the food here is everything and affordable.overall, the hot pot food and/or experience was okay.told there was a 30mins minute wait.the food here does come in good portion.he left before i could ask for glasses for the beer or sake.the restaurant had a decent selection of broths and ended up ordering the mongolian herbal plus the chinese pickled cabbage.huge but balanced cumin flavor that was delicious.their wide variety of soup base is what made this restaurant so compelling!.this place is a gem that we stumbled upon."

momotaro-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/momotaro-chicago-3,2,"Still ate my share though..from other yelp reviews, i read that sometimes having a reservation doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;l be seated near that time.while the ambiance / decor is great, i didn&#39;t love the actual layout of the sushi bar- the fact that the sushi bar is a high wooden structure makes it difficult to see the chef&#39;s practicing their craft.after a crazy long day, and sick of making decisions, i put culinary fate into the hands of our server.additionally, water glasses were kept filled and dirty plates removed expeditiously.eating delicious and fresh sushi can run you a pretty penny and at momotaro it&#39;s worth every dime!all i&#39;ve thought and dreamed about since i&#39;ve visit momotaro is the otoro (fatty bluefin belly) and it&#39;s melt in your mouth, foodgasmic deliciousness.our waitress was great! offered some great suggestions..if there were a special occasion, i&#39;d go back just for that.our table was touched frequently throughout the evening and we were well taken care of.really everything was fantastic, so you can&#39;t go wrong with whatever you order.this is my forth visit to momotaro and i took my siblings from out of town to momotaro.i heard the chef is allegedly too cool to care about customer / non professional criticism.our waitress was so knowledgeable about the drinks, their history and the food.and the oyster.very impressive restaurant.in fact, by 7pm most of the tables in the restaurant were filled with people enjoying fabulous cocktails and food.the food per usual was good, but the service was abysmal..it was delicate and decadent.this place has amazing sushi! great for date night - it&#39;s a really trendy place with perfect dim lighting.she took the time to explain the dishes listed on the menu, pointing out those dishes that were her favorite, the spiciness level, and which dishes were already vegetarian on the main menu and which could be made as such.wow!we also had the king crab (a large portion for the $26 price and it comes on a little hibachi grill as did the kuro buta pork chop (bone in and sliced another one of my favs).not good.a really cool spot that is hitting all the right notes.at first i thought i won&#39;t be full from it but don&#39;t underestimate the portion! the price is also very reasonable! this amazing dish is only $18, the service is also very pleasant, will definitely come back more.i know this is a japanese restaurant, but the chicken here was literally the best chicken i ever had!!!! i also had a rice bowl with uni, tuna and ikura that was incredible.so much promise, such poor execution.boisterous, fun, and delicious.the self appointed god of all sushi (at least of white men) and i proclaim this good.our waiter was fine, but he got annoyed with us when we asked about the details on the chef&#39;s sushi selection.(ok a little exaggeration here, but you get what i mean.since my original review, i&#39;ve been to the izakaya lounge about ten times.still need to check out the bars up/downstairs.the interior design of the restaurant is beautiful, and reasonable pricing makes it a place i will return to often.he was able to breakdown the menu into digestible nuggets for us!the ambiance and decor really sealed the description for us! avroko did a really cool job on the details! check out the walls by the restroom..the shitake skewers were also outstanding in depth of flavor.yes, that deserved all caps.food is so delicious.every table had a gorgeous little flower pot..i wanted more!uni chorizo toast - this was the wildcard item of the order.you feel instantly cooler the second you walk in here (at least i did!).izakaya is downstairs and has more casual food and drinks if you&#39;re not in the mood for a &#34;fancy&#34; dinner.was able to get a table within 45min for 4 late at night.the food was quite good (not excellent), but the bar lacked polish.i had a monks journey to drink.my least favorite from what we ordered was probably the duck, it was a little chewy and difficult to eat.the food was good but was too expensive for what it was.unfortunately, the majority of what we got was cooked -- including two kinds of meatloaf kebabs, lame fried rice and an awful crab dip.high 5 for a5!  the a5 beef was the best beef that i have ever eaten.indeed their omakase nigiri was very creative and satisfying.and everything, i mean every single thing, from the momotaro tartare to the smoking mackerel to the salmon belly to the washugyu, and on and on, was fantastic..the alaskan king crab was simple and delicious.momo tartare- light and refreshingwasabi salmon roll- very basic, we were told this was the most popular roll.however, this time, the chef was less flexible.bf and i&#39;ve been craving good sushi for the last 2 years (love colorado but sucks living in a landlocked state).portions are pretty small (especially the the king crab!).will definitely be returning.i&#39;m as surprised as you are that we had this experience in chicago.the sushi omakase flight, i recommend, should start from the least fatty to the most fatty.the menu is large, but our waitress took the time to walk us through it, addressing any questions we had.friendly staff, good service..i&#39;m not taking about freebies, but the attentiveness of the staff and quality of food for the price point.from the sushi, to the nigiri, to the creamed crab, to the whitefish in orange gazpacho to the unagi don, everything is absolutely delicious.let&#39;s name a few things that truly stood out such as the momomaki roll with had big eye tuna, spicy squid inside topped with lotus root.the food is absolutely unreal.the sweetness of the matcha green tea blends nicely with the cold dark bitter wafer."

 awesomeness!.good food, especially the chicken shawarma, but i gave it two stars because the price is expensive for a sandwich that does not include a side, and has to be extra for the side.ate here today after reading the great reviews..the fries are double-fried or something.i ordered the falafel bowl..the cool part is that everything was like a fast production line and even with a line, it didn&#39;t take too long to get my sandwich.the end result was a ton of very fresh and tasty food at a good price.i prefer the toppings at falafill but whatever, the chicken is good.you walk in, you don&#39;t know what&#39;s up, but you stay cool, ice cold, real man shit, check shit out, admire the decor and realize, &#34;this feels good, feels right, real easy on the eyes, smells intoxicating, god damn i can&#39;t wait to dive in.i was determined to satiate my craving and i had gained a sense of accomplishment when i finally found it (passed it twice), so i decided to stay...i ate about ten and gave up- they were as hard as walnut shells.tried the lunch box: half chicken, half steak, half rice and half romaine.the steak is really nicely flavored and all the &#34;accouterments&#34; they add to the box are delish too.the chicken and steak are delicious though!.however, only certain ones are actually good.the service is fast (almost too fast), and the food is just enough to make me full (and while small, i am not a simpy eater).the services is fast too.good fries too, with merkt&#39;s cheddar for dipping.the food is mildly spiced - their hot sauce is excellent so add it to your heart&#39;s content..decent spot..i recommend take out at either location and dining in only at van buren.i didn&#39;t get the fries but i am impressed they come in 1lb orders.everything was delicious and the portion size was nice a big! in fact, i did get &#34;double meat&#34; but i honestly think i would be good with a single serving.idea place for a quick bite.not so much.i don&#39;t even get all of the available toppings either.for those who get middle eastern sandwiches - make sure you get them from places that make laffas, because that means you&#39;re getting a huge, huge sandwich.the food was great.i&#39;m really upset it took me more than a year to come here.00, it&#39;s a tasty, more than filling lunch.i got bored and quit..falafel is cheaper.the combo boxes are great for lunch, mix everything up and you have a feast! fireball falafil friday is great, add a little zip to your life!.anyways i like the food here a lot.if you that you want a specific pita/laffa/box (bed of rice or romaine) you can top it with an insane amount of offerings (hummus, babaganoush, carrot/cabbage/corn salad, tehini sauce, their signature hot sauce, and more)."
batter-and-berries-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/batter-and-berries-chicago,2,"The server was friendly and knowledgeable offering images for all food.00 -$12.we&#39;ll be back!.the only reason i give it 4 stars is the horrible coordination and wait times.luckily they moved things along quickly and we only had to wait less than 20 minutes.i was overly impressed..however, once i had batter &amp; berries version, i can conclude that it is better.the staff is lively and entertaining.we ate here twice..there&#39;s usually a long wait on weekends, but if you come right at 8 am on weekends or on a weekday there&#39;s almost no wait at all.i thought scallops and cheese might be odd together, but that&#39;s certainly not so.worth it..great spot and i definitely recommend to others!.easily...we were greeted warmly at the door and shortly after sitting down our drink order was taken and our server explained all of the specials and her personal favorites.i get, food is outstanding and lines are long so it must be torture to wait but it makes for an uncomfortable dining experience.best brunch place in the city hands down! i highly recommend chicken waffles...service:- i was greeted by the hostesses right once i entered in and placed on the center table (came solo).- the maple butter was the &#34;sweetest&#34; trap!  for some reason, it worked flawlessly with the fried chicken.the restaurant definitely did not disappoint.i came here for brunch on a sunday via stellar reviews and a blogger recommendation.next time i am in chicago i will 100% be back!!!.homemade sausage is good, both pork and chicken.amazing food.omg soooo good.once we were seated the service was fast and friendly...totally not worth it.if you are confused what to order, just ask the servers - they are super friendly!p.wait time to get in on a friday at 1030 am -25 min.we traveled about 1..i must say breakfast was amazing! it was well worth the wait.i&#39;d dare to say this beats any breakfast place i&#39;ve eaten at in new york, la, sf, vegas, etc.i saw this restaurant on a travel show and put it on my todo list for my visit this weekend.to share, and what brings this place to the coveted 5-star area, is the french toast flight.not well organized.when i absolutely amazing experience! the food was gourmet spectacular! we had the seafood omelette, platter of assorted french  toast, and the executive omelette.will recommend their french toast.one bad thing though.hands down the best brunch in the city.the space is pretty bustling and cozy, not a place for intimate conversation but who is interested in that when there is delicious breakfast to consume.i couldn&#39;t really enjoy the food because my feet were cold inside of the restaurant.i am in love with batter and berries.added the final star because the last time i visited alone, i was given my own table.i&#39;m from atlanta but my wife is from chicago.definitely coming back again soon!.my party arrived early to beat the rush and we were seated in about 20 minutes.when our server finally came to the table, she explained what the specials of the week were.they do a french toast flight here that people really need to stop blabbing about otherwise it&#39;ll take even longer to get a seat than it already does.the specials are amazing.for my main course, i had the lobster and shrimp benny(highly recommend if you did stop by)..disappointed they don&#39;t offer pure maple syrup or house made whipped cream.crazy enough, i&#39;ve had the same server both times i went.this is me and the hubz go to place when we&#39;re both off and the kids are in school.no one wants to walk in a restaurant and feel rushed and like they&#39;re being chased out.service at this place is great as well as the food!only issue is they are very crowded and we had to wait over an hour and a half..for a couple of us it was our first trip here..i also liked the blueberry french toast but i am glad that i only ordered a half order because while it was great, the other two meals were much better.best breakfast place in lincoln park by far!.either way, i will be back!.i am not a big sweets person so that&#39;s why i did not get the french toast but my buddy said it was one of the best things he&#39;s eaten.this place has become my favorite breakfast/brunch spot in the city.i ordered the french toast platter and was not disappointed.a+ all the way!this place is amazing..no tea, no shade.the waitress had an ipad for sending orders to the kitchen and was able to give us a lot of extra attention..the staff here was amazing, we were sat down quickly, although i think we got lucky and there was an available table for us right away.on top of this amazing food they had the nerve to have a super awesome server."

(ok, the wine wasn&#39;t bad either)this pinstripes has two huge levels- the top is darker and more sexy, while the lower level had white lights and felt more romantic.tasty food, nice option of outdoor seating, would come here again.all so good.i had ordered the loaded mac n&#39; cheese (i tend to judge a restaurant on this item).so find me in the bar area.and it took another 10 minutes for them to fix.they only have 11 lanes and countless eating area, downstairs, patio and upfront.my first time here was for a yelp elite event.this is a culinary work of art! mouth watering juicy, perfectly seasoned and cooked.we stumbled into pinstripes after we did the architecture river tour and we are so happy we did..staff/service: was very friendly, engaging and informative when i asked about pinstripe.we had a great time bowling, eating and drinking.staff was attentive and friendly.we went during the day when games are cheaper than at night.enjoyed the dinner! waiters are good and the menu is very reasonably priced..it took about 45 minutes for the soup to come out, but when it did, another waiter stood awkwardly at the other patio table for a few minutes with our soups.after bringing us some bread, our waiter never appeared again (i&#39;m not sure the person who brought our bread was actually a waiter, as he never introduced himself).what a great back patio! friendly service, and with a nice view of the fireworks on the pier.the food good and the service was top-notch.service was friendly and the location was handy after strolling around the pier.i held a non-traditional &#34;rehearsal dinner&#34; for my wedding here and we all had sooo much fun.lighting could have been better outside.i loved the sauce that came on the bun.my direct contact was julia and she was friendly, professional, and knew what she was doing."

the service was supér, the staff was very attentive a+.basically we were having an existential taco crisis..i never felt the urge to complain until now as i just received my order through caviar and it came with literally two, absolutely tiny pieces of chicken on the sandwich (and not much filling overall).so, yes, i got back in line.vegetarians you will go there twice as well! not that the portions are small! there is ample choice and tasty options!.i love the concept - fresh mexican (street eats) that lean towards the more casual tortas, guac, soups, etc, all made quickly and perfect for takeaway.the meat inside was really tender really flavorful the soup was really good a lil to salty and acidic but still really really good only problem was there was hardly any meat in it!

must go.sampled another rick bayless restaurant, and ordered the following (back in 2013):- watermelon seafood coctel- side salad- agua del dia (cantaloupe + lime)- churros y chocolateall of it was delicious, but i prefer frontera.my friends also ordered the almost naked guacamole which came with chips and salsa.try this place.if they threw some more short rib and veggies into this meal i would easily give 4 stars.that being said, i saw them putting out some delicious looking food and sandwiches.don&#39;t order seafood soup.pretty awesome concept with uniquely delicious food and hospitality..check it out - soon!.you order first and are told to take a seat.....the bests part was the sauce that really made the sandwich come together.table seating is weird, they seat you and place numbers at the table after you order at the counter.i like just about everything that i&#39;ve had here but my fave is the ahogada.we had some confusion going in as we thought it was just sit down..i ordered medium spice, but must have been over seasoned.very well made loaded guacamole with crispy chips.we decided to head here for a lunch and we weren&#39;t there for the rush, we went around 1pm, so that helped a ton.i can handle a little spicy at i was skeptical coming here but curiosity won out and my taste buds are thankful..i live in orange county, ca and come to chicago for work once a year and i always come to xoco.we were handed menus and honestly, there was like 5 things i could have ordered and loved.in the words of rick&#39;s daughter on his pbs show mexico - one plate at a time:&#34;speaking of hot, let&#39;s go check on my dad!&#34;:).the bread i&#39;m used to being more crusty and toasted more than it was..highly recommend, if your in the area definitely try it out..we did sit outside.the place itself is nice but small.00i liked it but thought it was too salty.needless to say, i wasn&#39;t exactly sober..not to mention inconvenient.the sandwiches are to drool for.can&#39;t complain about churros here! came by twice on my 4 day trip here for churros only.mmm i had to try this place out while i was in town - yum! i got myself a shrimp and egg torta - their friday special.+ churro with chocolate: undercooked, boring, and lacked flavor in both the churro and sauce.to paraphrase a quote from lloyd bentsen, &#34;rick, i have served tortas.the so-called torta (pepito) was unpleasantly reminiscent of those frozen &#34;pizzas&#34; warmed for throngs of hungry schoolkids during the 1990s.in this case i don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a corporation or if it&#39;s rick bayless&#39;s restaurant it&#39;s spot on.to begin i had an appetizer of chicharrones..i went here about a month ago when my friend from cali was visiting and wanted to try some good food, and based on the reviews we decided to go here.churros made me want to cry.i&#39;d love to go back and try all of the other things on the menu.xoco was so crowded, even during off hours on a saturday, but there is order to it all.hazelnut was my favorite.great tortas from the genius that is rick bayless...it&#39;s a solid sandwich but i like the ones from cafecito way more.atmosphere was good, decor i don&#39;t really remember."
canton-regio-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/canton-regio-chicago,1,"We can&#39;t wait to come back and bring our friends.the presentation was great and we loved the ambiance!.free appetizer and chips and three salsas..ive been there once and will probably not go back because of the limited menu.everything else is pretty meh, except for the flavorless guacamole, which was subpar..you get chips and 4 different salsas, yes 4! ordered the arranchera por kilo (steak by pound), chicken skewers (they were out of shrimp, will be returning) and grilled cactus (nopalitos yummm)lemonade freshly squeezed.the truth is that i liked this place so much that i actually signed up for yelp just to post a review!!!do try it.food is good you can have a great meal and drink for $20 location is great and also parking.both were super tasty and well seasoned.i decided on the huevos rancheros with steak.when we got our menus, we realized it was so limited.the prices are amazing (well, the steak is expensive, but steak is always expensive).sitting with the window view of a day gone by era this generation offers a new style of mexican offerings.the entire experience is phenomenal.it was so disappointing!  we couldn&#39;t hear ourselves talk because the singer and music they had was soooo loud that we had to literally scream at each other to somewhat hear each other!! i&#39;m not at all exaggerating!! we had to ask for water, the food was alright nothing to brag about, if u decide on the carne arranchera make sure to order the whole steak not the arranchera by the kilo which comes cut up into pieces which was extremely dry, not juicy at all (quite a difference from our all time favorite nuevo león food, which we hope and pray they reopen, soon!!!) definitely would not recommend this place!.the home made tortillas were delicious and the frijoles charros were some of the best i&#39;ve ever had! will definitely be back.ya know.glad we did! charming atmosphere with lots of friendly faces.i can get similar tasting tacos at el milagro without the wait and cheaper prices.i had to flag someone down and ask if we had a waiter.i was just there this past weekend and it&#39;s alright.it&#39;s worth a visit but just waiting until neuvo león comes back!.the burnt steak tips are tremendous.will definitely come back to try the new menu items :).i like this place for breakfast, a great combination of low prices and good atmosphere.i love the atmosphere.i read other reviews on yelp and based on the good reviews.the waiters speak spanish to you and, i guess that if you don&#39;t understand, they will switch to english.this place does not serve americanized mexican food.we were immediately seated and brought chips and three types of home made salsas.i couldn&#39;t hear the person next to me..terrible service, very loud music, i couldn&#39;t even ask the waiter any questions about the menu..great spot right on pilsen.their service was outstanding.you hopefully did not, as we did, decide to overrule the waiter and order 2 kilos of arrachera, two vegetable skewers (which are really six of them, each roughly a foot long), and a mountain of guacamole for 5 adults.we only went after being told it was opened by the owners of our beloved nueva leon.good food.the prices are decent and we even had leftovers.lol.-prices are actually very reasonable.my only issue was towards my waiter, he put the arracherra set up towards the (corner) of the table so towards by the end of my meal, i was serving my self some meat and the entire set up fell to the floor with a lot of left over food.love this new place right across the street from nuevo leon! same owners too! very friendly service.service is superb, waiters and busboys were great, friendly and helpful..the temperature outside was 1 degree and it was not much warmer inside, we ate with our coats on.well this winner had half the sauce out of the box and in the plastic bag.steak was good.when we first arrived, there were a number of people waiting for tables, but we were quickly seated in the back where we could watch the action in the open kitchen.salsas were tasty not spicy.we were so full that we barely touched the salad, and had leftovers to bring home.the other hand the bistec a la mexicana with fideo was great.my friend and i came here on whim, which turned out to be the best decision of the day.no extra charge for this at all.my family and i travel a lot, my husband is mexican, and i feel pretty confident to say this is the best mexican restaurant that we ever been to, staff extremely friendly, service was top notch, food excellent, loved the vibe and the music.for a party of 4, we all left stuffed and only spent $50."

we ordered sunnyside up eggs on the side, to top off our burger.i left genuinely upset because i rushed to make it here before it closed to surprise my fiance with a pie.check.great place as alternative to au cheval when resto is full.the bbq picnic is the burger i went with, had a good little bite to it, perfectly offset with the fried avocado.overall:if you love burgers, you must try this place!.overrated.i happened upon grange hall when a few people from work wanted to go for lunch and i decided to try something new.i ended up having a few of them because it was so tasty, a few coworkers even changed their order after tasting my drink.absolutely amazing! a must check out.i would prefer this burger to au cheval&#39;s anyday, and especially when the waits at au cheval are long.came with bananas on top, enough to pretend it&#39;s healthy.top 3 burger spots in all of chicago.went for lunch on a saturday - great atmosphere - friendly staff.berry collins- nice and refreshing on a hot day.i love how grange hall has a large variety options, varying from the traditional burger to a more eclectic, unique mix of ingredients.i had the ultimate burger w/ spicy avocado aioli instead of the horseradish.the batter on the onion rings was super thick and didn&#39;t flake off like a more typical onion ring that falls apart before you get it in your mouth.onion rings are very bready but fresh.liked it -- but wasn&#39;t blown away by it.i just new it was going to be burger perfection if the street fair version was that good, right?i&#39;m a sucker for all things summer berries, and i also have an unhealthy relationship with soft cheeses, so the berries and brie selection was a shoe in.the only thing i have to saw is the slaw was on the bottom, which made the bottom bun soggy fast so it was kind of messy to eat.hubs and i came by friday afternoon for a quick after work drink &amp; dinner..come one, come all.the burger and mushrooms were not a marrying pair and the avocado felt like a throw away.tommy told me that although they normally didn&#39;t take same day reservations he would take a look and see what he could do.we had a couple of craft beers and the fries at the bar.we were craving a apple pie.loved the cinnamon stick addition.while we were waiting, i almost tripped at the front door because of this weird gap at the entrance - so watch your steps!grange hall burger bar mainly serves the grass-fed beef burgers, but other brunch options are also available (e.the veggie burger was amazing, best my sister in law has had and i had the burger with berry compote and brie cheese, outstanding, combination of sweet and salty was on point.plenty of quality craft beers available to pair with their stellar food lineup.awesome and unique place !! it&#39;s a different kind of burger spot.the food here is pretty good.grange is a solid option for burgers made with quality ingredients and without the extended wait time..my &#34;bbq picnic&#34; burger had jalapeno slaw, bbq sauce, two fried avocado slices, and was cooked perfectly to order.pricing is comparable to other places in the area and totally worth every penny.so i ate it, all of it.the wait is not long and the food is amazing!!! good beer, great onion rings and a perfect hamburger!! the best combination ever!! price is fare.they offer punch cards as well, so once you reach 10 burgers you get a free pie!there is also the faint remains of a graffiti piece by the illustrious banksy on the side of the joint! too bad that banksy guy sucks and is a nerd!now i am hungry for more grange hall burgers.either way, the burgers were delicious.thecheese sauce.this is one of my my favorite places to eat in chicago.a nice, casual respite from the typical crowds on randolph in the west loop..once we walked in, the space opened up to a small dining area.overall..the quest continues on for a burger as good as vortex in atl..the meat tasted fresh and it crumbled when you took a bite of the burger - that says it all.yum yum yum!can&#39;t wait to go back.it also is a nice bar which is very relaxing.food: we arrived ready to have lunch and were sad to discover that the lunch menu does not start until 1p.food 5/5: the $8 apps are well worth the money and can be split between 4-5 people.i had the ultimate burger and was totally disappointed! my burger was really greasy and didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor.instead we sat at the bar immediately, which was a great decision.burger-wise we tried the ultimate burger (bacon, horseradish aioli, caramelized onions, and munster cheese) and the berry and brie burger (berry compote with lots of while berries in it and a nice slab of brie).breading was crispy, flavorful, chicken was juicy and tender, the toppings and sauce were excellent and worked well together.grange hall burger bar is a bit of a misnomer since they serve an excellent brunch.prices are fair, especially on randolph.very yummy burger.it was packed on a saturday night.the sides are a-la-cart, but reasonably priced."
dim-sum-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-house-chicago,1,"Love their sui loong bows.great place to pick up frozen dimsum for the house!  prices are decent.i did it again but this time for 3 minutes and then added my favorite ramen noodle and had wonton noodle soup..the potstickers are good.it&#39;s makes those days where you have a craving for your favorite dish super easy since it&#39;s in your freezer..the worst bao i ever tried! i heard they do wholesale too, but are they licensed to do wholesale? and the picture they&#39;re posting i recognised is from somewhere else, lol.i like the dim sum house, because if you want dim sum catered at you party they get it done for you, at a reasonable price."
woodhaven-bar-and-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woodhaven-bar-and-kitchen-chicago,2,"I love this place!! the environment is fun and open! not your typical shoulder to shoulder obnoxiously loud chicago bar.this place is pretty large and has space for larger groups at a table in the front.the staff was friendly and the service was good.thank you woodhaven, you were the perfect place for this special night.the staff working at woodhaven was friendly and the owner even stopped over and chatted with us.&#34; but woodhaven markets itself as a &#34;bar and kitchen&#34; -- kitchen being in the title.the list of beers is awesome, and cocktails are good too.came by on a saturday eve around 9pm, it was decently full of people and the music was popping.i&#39;m sad to say i&#39;m definitely not going back and there&#39;s a good reason why no one talks about this place..it was hypoalergenic!! a skillet cookie with an ice cream on top! i don&#39;t know of any other place that has something like that, and it tasted amazing.if we had been in a rush it would have been a huge problem, but we had no where to be so we didn&#39;t mind too much.awesome staff.fortunately, my experience at woodhaven was a far cry from that..and we liked the relaxed atmosphere.i also really enjoyed the drink of the night which was a mix of iced tea and vodka.they have many beers for you to choose from and the burgers were excellent.had a wonderful evening at woodhaven..my first impression was the place is a lot smaller than i expected.just went here for the first time for some cocktails and late night food.perfect to catch up with friends.i am so glad i did.food: 4/5service: 3/5venue - 4/5.about 1/4 full..i am giving wood haven 5 stars and more! this is a hidden gem in river north! the staff, drinks and food is on point! from start to finish nothing went unnoticed! the bison bites  wrapped with bacon are a must they are joined with house made onion rings with a jalapeño peppercorn aioli! this place is on my new top five and can&#39;t wait to get back to wood haven!p.it was clean, their signature drinks were on the creative side,and they carry local beers, though not on tap."
cafe-monsivais-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-monsivais-chicago,2,"I was expecting your typical mexican food but this place is so far from ordinary.food was great!.they serve bridgeport coffee, of which i inevitably end up drinking multiple cups.it&#39;s a small place, but great place for families, dates, whatever.the green house style chilaquiles were like a warm salad.the menu is inventive and mostly inspired by latin american dishes.super fresh and beautiful food! my boyfriend and i came here for the first time a few days back and will most definitely become regulars!.the coffee rubbed chicken was tender, juicy with hidden surprises of peaches and eggplant..we had our first v-day dinner in here, and didn&#39;t make it back until the following year and she still remembered what we had ordered that first time.also had estilo sinaloa - the homemade tamale sinaloa style.the food was delicious and the staff greeted us warmly when we came in.the place has a european/modern atmosphere.i chose the quiche of the day and a side kale salad.it&#39;s great to have a vegetarian friendly restaurant in the area, and the food is very creative and fresh.will i come back? nope.the service is adorably uneven, but the food is fresh, ever-changing and delicious.my girlfriends and i went here prior to an art show.she even went off menu to make a bowl of chicken noodle soup for my daughter (she&#39;s a picky eater and wouldn&#39;t eat other items).a must go!.you will love it.the chef knows what she&#39;s doing.the space is so cute and cozy..and bottomless coffee! come on!.a hidden gem in pilsen.and it&#39;s byob!.this spot is new and had some incredibly intricate flavors on the menus.this is a must if you&#39;re looking for the cultural side of chicago.we brought a couple bottles of wine, which made it a full meal.also, try the desserts, they are amazing (take it to go if you need to)!.plus it&#39;s byob.everything was delicious and presented in a cute, homey way.was pleasantly surprised when we were each treated to a sample of a fresh corn salad with cherry tomatoes and queso fresco in a vinaigrette.see for yourself.i&#39;m excited to revisit and try other delicious entrées.simple, but elegant space.the tea was delicious and our vegan bean soup and molletes were good!they served mine with vegan cheese which was delightful.food is so good! specials are always delish.because of my time around food, im very particular and choose to eat at home mostly.it was a little creepy."
salero-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/salero-chicago,1,"Save room for dessert-the churros comes with three, so definitely also a great size to share!.salero offers a combination of spanish entrees and small plates.but i didn&#39;t want to be rude either and say how salty they were so the respectful answer was okay.after great excitement to have churros i was very unhappy that the fried dough tasted just like that, fried dough.many others, also waiting for their tables, congregating out of the cold and close to the booze made it difficult to order a glass of wine while we waited, and there was nowhere to stand without getting in the way of restaurant staff delivering delicious looking plates to tables seated around us..we each ordered our own entree and i opted for the roasted venison.a highlight.stop in..the bill came out to be $120 before tip.the service was a real letdown..the presentation of the paella was awesome it looked great, both were excellent.ok, the food here was truly wonderful.the sausage pepper dish was good but not as good as i expected (not a fan of soggy peppers).do not miss the baked alaska - mind blowing!!!.for dessert, we enjoyed the olive oil panna cotta and the best churros i&#39;ve ever tasted.that&#39;ll be a liquefied krispy kreme donut in a shot glass), nor will there be the laboriousness of eighteen courses.we went on a recent week night and were impressed with the service, food and ambiance.i had the confit potatoes and my husband had the sea bass.for myself, i had ordered the grilled pork jowl and it may have taken the spotlight from even the entrees.seriously????  i get it is a sat.at the end he arranged for a dessert with a candle to celebrate the occasion.finally, the cocktails are amazing - but be careful, they are strong! i had the autumn sangria last time i was here and it was delicious, and the old fashioned is legit.the bread was warm and fresh with plenty of olive oil.it was also really loud considering that it was a weeknight.seeing as there&#39;s lots of other places within walking distance i probably won&#39;t be coming back for a second chance.word to the wise: do not skip the queso fresco flan.the menu showcases a great assortment of spanish style meats, fish and poultry.delicately flavored with sherry on a bed of tender grits.we passed by salero a few times on a recent visit to chicago and stopped one night to check the menu..this review has been edited to include the restaurant owner&#39;s feedback to my post.i really can recommend everything we ordered including the marcona almonds, jamon croquetas (loved the smokey romesco sauce), and scallops a la plancha.love this place! have been here at least five times the thing i could never forget is the scallop crudo.cocktails and gintonics are good as well.out of these 6 dishes, i thought the crab and the flan was okay.our waiter was also very helpful and answered our questions on the dishes and provided his opinions/recommendations.the food, service, coffee, wine and ambience was amazing! i have no idea why this place has 3 1/2 stars.2.we had a myriad of dishes and everything that came out was delightful.the entrees we choose were the duck breast and the zarzuela.the small plates were terrific and i really loved the scallops.drew did a great job of explaining our meal and made good suggestions.the octopus was fresh and grilled perfectly and the croquetas had a great crunch with creamy hazelnut romesco sauce!we then both had sea bass a la plancha for our dinner, which came with a fresh summer squash and more delicious crunchy croquettes..i&#39;ve been a few times and never had sub par dish.i am a small person, but i eat a lot of food.a bit on the high end though.this is the kind of place where the entire experience fits the bill.this is an overdue review, so here we go.we had the tasting menu ($65pp) and they brought us plenty of food, appetizers, seafood course, beef course, dessert.it was a vegetarian meal that surpassed expectations for intensity of flavor.octopus, lovely.it&#39;s intimate, but not dark.we ordered:-chorizo stuffed quail and crab for the appetizer (explosions of flavor)-hangar steak and duck for our entrees (cooked to perfection with wonderful vegetables and sauces to accompany them)-flan for dessert (fresh and flavorful)*hubby had an epa and ipa to drink with dinner while i had the still rose and coffee with baileys (to accompany dessert).we went for dinner and ending up leaving after a few starters even though the food was delicious!the service was friendly but lacked training.didn&#39;t complain and was actually too hungry to really care, so i ate it anyway.the food we ordered was nicely prepared, and beautifully served.this is my wife&#39;s favorite restaurant..after 10-15 minutes we had three more of our party arrive, asked for three more wines plus our original drinks.we shared the jambon with tomato garlic bread, it was delicate yet full of flavor.cabeza croqueta - deliciousburrata - great combination w/sweet blood orange preserves, buttery endive, &amp; morcilla- just wish it wasn&#39;t on toast - the bread was too crusty, biting through the incredibly soft toppings and creating a mess/ripping apart your upper palate is undesirable.helped me discover sherry, which is a bit more fortified wine but not quite port.i was so intrigued by the meal and the various options available on the tasting menu."
pacos-tacos-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pacos-tacos-chicago,2,"So glad i stopped here as chicago has great food options.i&#39;ve just had the worst burrito!i ordered carne asada burrito with everything, it looked pretty good when i got it opened, but when i bit into the burrito, it was the toughest meat i&#39;ve ever eaten.very friendly people working there and i would totally recommend it to anybody who knows about real mexican food.the place looks a bit dirty, there is not alot of seats and the local patrons sitting around the grill will turn their heads to see who walked in.good quality steak, don&#39;t go there for the decor or ambience..it&#39;s also not expensive, you will get full with 2-3 tacos and a drink.the green salsa is spicy and its great that they give extra sour cream and salsa for free.best carnitas tacos in town..they are pretty generous with the meat without sacrificing taste..legit street style tacos.upon arriving, the place is kinda older and hard to find, but the inside is surprisingly clean.the pastor was also excellent; seasoned well and topped with fresh cilantro and onions..really good food, great atmosphere and good service.my ben franklin costume snapped a couple of buttons to be more precise.definetly the best tacos in the southside.not only does she give mean looks, but she also makes faces when you ask her for something.this place has good moist tortillas for their tacos.the smell of the cooked meat is just the beginning..this is a good carry out place, i wouldn&#39;t really want to sit and eat inside.and the green sauce gets your mouth oh fiyah!.only some of the most authentic mexican fast food.you can&#39;t go wrong ordering anything..will i ever go back? not likely..: (..also, tip for the ladies, hold it if you can, the bathrooms are sooo nasty!.tacos tacos tacos.best tacos around! i highly recommend this place for mexican food.i always find it funny when people ask me, &#34;who do you think has the best tacos in chicago!?&#34; i mean, c&#39;mon dawg, i&#39;m half mexican so you already knowwwww the best tacos in the chi are at my momma&#39;s crib! no, but really.plenty of juicy meat on every taco.i will note there is counter seating only.the chicken tacos are piled high with well-marinated chicken that has a lot of kick and spice.my boyfriend took me here and hands down they are the best tacos i&#39;ve ever had.my friend recommended we come to pacos and let me tell you that was the worst idea ever!!! i don&#39;t know how people gave it more than 1 star!!! to me this place is horrible the best steak tacos???? hell nooooo!!!!! you must not go out much if you think this place is good.not fancy, family-style &amp; damn was my belly full when i left!.i do agree with other reviews that comment on being nickel and dime&#39;d.tacos are good and stuffed with a lot of meat and all of your fixins..(good for breakfast? hope your cardiologist is on speed dial.the place is well kept, staff is friendly and offers an intimate environment where you can watch them prepare your tacos.best taco joint in all of the midwest! i was surprised to see a large mexican community and love the authentic food that comes with it.but they were filling and delicious, and about $12 for 4 tacos, not too bad i suppose.i highly recommend paco&#39;s tacos to anyone who actually knows about tacos..their tacos are amazing!!!!!! i&#39;ve tried many other mexican restaurants and always return to pacos.my favorites are the carne asada, barbacoa and al pastore.$2.good tacos yum.will try them one more time and see what happens.top my tacos with cilantro, onion and green sauce.chicagos best was horribly wrong about this place.very pleasant experience and have been going there for over 15yrs..&#34; and thats pacos tacos for you.i think i even started to tear up from the strong taste of the onions.also, don&#39;t be afraid of the guy basically blocking the doorway playing his guitar.the carnitas, el pastor and steak tacos were delicious arriving on a el milgaro brand double corn tortilla with onions and cilantro.had three steak tacos with onion &amp; cilantro the only way to eat tacos...try a taco de chicharron (chicharron in a red salsa) or barbacoa, very tasty as well."
steadfast-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/steadfast-chicago-2,2,"Favorite was the bread basket, grilled kale salad, and the cioppino.a nice added touch was the palate cleanser we received as well as the little plate of dessert morsels that came at the end of the meal.the location is ideal for a business meal or a great meet up close to the office...shared plates sit-down with creative breads and fresh ingredients!the menu is all meant to be shared, but you have the option of ordering your own dish too and the kitchen will time it out for you.we much prefer cochon volant (right next door)..the waiter helped us pick our courses and assured us we ordered &#34;pllleeeeennnty&#34; of food for the table.this is a  nice addition to a part of the loop that can use more upscale dining options.if you&#39;re looking for a comfortable vibe, clean food and attention to detail in a modern setting, then steadfast should be considered.after dessert, we were give a plate of that day&#39;s petit fours..this is not a review of the food.the butterscotch, chocolate and crunch profile was solid.overall, i&#39;ll probably be back with some frequency as the cocktails here rival those from many great mixology/cocktail bars in the city and the menu looked fantastic, but i hope they staff up or otherwise improve the service..my husband and i can&#39;t believe anyone would give this place a less than glowing review."
galata-turkish-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/galata-turkish-restaurant-chicago,2,"Highly recommend grilled turkish meatball platter.highly recommend the turkish meatball platter..they were so sweet and offered to put my flowers on the bar since there wasn&#39;t room for them on the table, and gave me a free drink for my birthday..don&#39;t forget the doner!.the food was fresh and delicious and our server huseyin was friendly and attentive.service was attentive and the food was really very good.we&#39;ll definitely be back..i ordered the doner kebab platter and wings.the place is awesome! my bf and i eventually decided to try the place yesterday..i love this place.the hummos was gresh, the grape leaves delicious, and the roasted red pepper dish fantastic....for lunch i had beef/lamb shawarma wrap with rice and hummas.the mezze platter was awesome (especially the spicy esme and the warm pita bread).we went at 10:00.i did enjoy the donner plate, though it could have had a more generous portion of meat.this place is amazing.the green salad that came on the side was very good, i really liked the lemon dressing that they used, pita bread was very good, fresh and warm.cozy and laid back atmosphere.besides good food they have nice prices, good ambiance (the music is pleasant and not too loud), tv&#39;s and pleasant staff.the interior is so cute and the staff makes you feel like family.i am very excited to have a new destination for mediterranean/turkish food.looking forward to them getting their liquor license.the service was very attentive."
shawarma-garden-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shawarma-garden-chicago,2,"Chicken shawarma was delicious.i rarely if ever salt my food, but had to in order to taste the other spices.ordered at 10:30 and got a call at 11:00 saying it was too late.great and easy shoarma place.i&#39;m here at 1:58 on a friday and have no idea where everyone else is..however, they have the best beef shawarma i think i&#39;ve ever had.so, it&#39;s really only natural that i&#39;m a fan of shawarma garden..the meat options look delicious but i aspire to be a vegetarian so i&#39;ve, as you see, been avoiding the meat thus far.tangy, not too salty.quite the feast!the only thing that is disappointing to me is the lack of french fries.while the sandwich looked to be huge once i bit into it i found that it was a lot of romaine lettuce with my one little link of kefta and one purple-hued pickle seemingly placed in the middle so i could see it was there when cut in half.i had the chicken kabob entree which comes with rice, jerusalem salad, hummus &amp; pita bread while my coworker had the gryos plate..the &#34;tomatoes&#34; consist of 2 tiny chunks..so important!!.have been several times and is always excellent.a good place to stop for a reasonably healthy lunch or grab takeout.it&#39;s pretty affordable since it&#39;s more casual, but not low quality...the service was friendly but not quite up to takeout now speed.chicken shawarma was probably my favorite of all time, or at least for a very long time (hamido out in dearborn makes phenomenal chicken shawarma too:yelp.legit coming out of yelp retirement for this.really friendly staff and delicious chicken shawarma and hummus.definitely a new to go place in my future!.that creeper.the guys are friendly and the atmosphere is perfect.i stopped in here while walking around in the area and i&#39;m glad i did.truly disappointing, especially considering the other positive reviews.i&#39;ve had the gyros as well as the combo dinner and both were great.really excited i ordered, was told 20 minutes, and now it&#39;s been over an hour..so tasty and so cheap.i recently moved into the area and i&#39;ve been here several times and it&#39;s always reliable! personally, i&#39;d rate this place closer to a 3..i&#39;ve tried the gyros and the greek salad with gyro meat.well worth the $10 - $15 bucks for a full meal, plus it taste just as savory the next day for some leftover lunch.love the gyro platter when i want some leftovers for the next day as you get gyro meat with sauce, basmati rice, salad, hummus, and pita...my husbands loves this place and i think its just m&#39;eh.so happy this place opened up! perfect place for my mediterranean fix.i think that shawarma garden exceeds the others because it is much cleaner and slightly cheaper.i really like that they warm the pitas for you.i don&#39;t know if i&#39;ve had better food.best mediterranean food in the area.stopped by after having a meal at smallbar since we weren&#39;t quite satisfied and didn&#39;t care to spend even more for a super small dish.we called to let the owner know and he said he made it today which sucks because after eating tons of these, we know when tahini is bad.would rather hit falafel and grill.shawarma was messy and not very good.one of my favorite stops on division.the blend of spices, and the perfect crunch, all dipped in a tahini sauce..i ordered a chicken kabob meal with rice and i&#39;m extremely disappointed because i specifically asked for garlic with my meal and guess what i didn&#39;t get!??.all the best versions i have eaten have a lovely roasted flavor and a silky mouthfeel..from their shawarma to their falafel to their kabobs.by the way, the owners are so nice and they are obviously happy people who are proud of there food.i am so happy to have this place in the neighborhood..really nice staff and good food.these parts.just some dam good food!! and really nice people.this review is just for the baklava.lentil soup was flavorless and unappealing looking.patience ain&#39;t my virtue."
gyu-kaku-japanese-bbq-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/gyu-kaku-japanese-bbq-chicago-3,2,"The manager quickly spoke to us and apologized and even comped her meal.all of them are delicious..the concept is fun,  and it&#39;s a great way to ensure a  constant conversation stream- perhaps a nice place for a first date?  though,  the atmosphere is rather casual (some ppl were in joggers), it&#39;s not a place i would frequent because of the high costs..this time around, i only ordered their bibimbop &amp; was kind of disappointed in how little meat there was.the marinade on the meat toppings is delicious, especially the short rib.you don&#39;t have to worry about just staring at each other and having nothing to talk about, there is a built in activity! i&#39;ve been to both spots: one in west loop and the other in river north..i love the interior design at this place - the green walls and the open patio doors made for a wonderful lunch.super cute for date night! just go in expecting the fact, you will probably smell like grilled meats since that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing at the table.will try to avoid.affordable lunches, incredible really.we ordered the samurai course and it was the perfect amount for 3 people.we got a set combo and it was more than enough for two people.filthy restaurant (spent half the meal waving off flies at our table), glacially paced service, and really mediocre food.we told our server this when we first arrived, ordered one of the pre-selected multi-course combos and our server sped everything along, making sure we never had a moment of downtime while still making our visit very enjoyable.oh.amazing food and great service! best lunch combo menu on randolph!i highly recommend the sausage fried rice bowl and their lunch combos.the restaurant has 4 tables full - all other tables are empty.can&#39;t go wrong at either one!.this was fun for a &#34;different&#34; dining experience in that you grill at your table.we were able to get 2 lunch combos (with 4 meats and included rice, salad &amp; soup), garlic noodles, and vegetables...i wish that the value option for 4 included more shrimp and chicken options, as opposed to the duck and more beef.very delicious food and clean.now they give me another good reason to coma back --- the lady m!only thing didn&#39;t make it 5 stars is the price little big more than what it is!still love it!.let&#39;s talk about pricing, it is on the higher end for bbq; but i guess since there&#39;s really not that many japanese bbq around, they can over charge for stuff..it&#39;s a popular restaurant so i recommend securing a reservation prior to arrival..i was told there would be a 40 minute wait and ended up waiting well over a hour and a half.best of all, free parking!.great new location.their servers were very helpful and explained everything throughly.we came here on wednesday afternoon.definitely enjoyed our impromptu date night here.the experience was awesome, however, and the service was on point.the waitress name was helen.so all-you-can-eat is the way to go.my favorite is the skirt steak and the smores.if you&#39;ve been to any korean restaurant/bbq the meat was flavorful.the seaweed soup was very good, and the miso looked great as well.appetizers, rice, and salad fantastic!  even the dessert was scrumptious!.the service was great also.very well put together place, greatly enjoyed the meal and service.when i arrived home i opened my container to see this.i enjoyed the food thoroughly and will be returning!.homemade.it&#39;s only a minor concern for now, as long as i don&#39;t have any trouble getting reservations.i was confused - should i open the mushroom and vegetable packets to grill them directly or leave them in their foil.all i know is that i was almost ready to have, as joey from &#34;friends&#34; would say, the meat sweats.even their rice is one of the best i&#39;ve eaten!our server and the assistant manager were very attentive and friendly.this place is starting to become one of my favorite place to eat.great food and excellent service.we always ask for recommendations and he always gives great advice.we were excited to check this place out, but we will not be back.same amazing service and food! always a treat!!.excellent food, excellent service, reasonably priced, what more can you ask for.lastly, we ended up with the lady m cake.i am very picky with red meat cuz i don&#39;t know how to appreciate red meat, and the short ribs, beef tongue were both very chewy.i really enjoyed the kobe beef and overall the experience was very good.once the grill was heated the chicken was brought out (it was already cut up but it didn&#39;t even amount to a whole chicken breast) the girl didn&#39;t wipe enough oil on the grill so the chicken was sticking badly.good enough to replace my need for ohio street (read expensive and rare parking, and long waits for a table)!the food is good as usual - fresh and tasty.i can guarantee that you&#39;ll be full and happy.japanese business is all about customer services, so please do not carry the gyukaku name if your service is so bad.it consisted of apps: edamame, fried dumplings , gyu kaku saladentree:hanger steak, basil chicken, pork belly, filet mignon.it was so good!!! the food was delicious and they had $1 beer.terrible service.thats not even the best part, they allow you to cook the meat at your own table which is such a fun activity for the group!.we waited about 5 minutes before we got seated."

seoul-taco-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/seoul-taco-chicago-2,1,"I dont know if i would visit this place again, if i do i would definitely try just the tacos.tigah has mixed feelings about this one but based on the price and taste of the tacos alone, tigah decided to be more forgiving.food is great, tables and floor not so clean inside (stools stick to the ground and some counters were dirty).the staff were super friendly and welcoming, the food came out relatively quick (10 min), and the food was alright.ordered via uber eats on saturday and couldn&#39;t have been more pleased.i&#39;m happy to see a new korean place in river north with great food and speedy service.the place was kinda dirty.the gm casey and his staff were very friendly with describing the menu.i think del seoul blows this place out of the water.there aren&#39;t many options on their menu but the things offered are all decent.after swiping my card, he did not say anything about whether i needed to sign a receipt or not.atmosphere is amazing..$2.there are ample tables and not too many people.at first i thought asian fusion/mexican would be good but this place was gross.liked the korean hot sauce on there and the meat is marinated well too.don&#39;t tell your friends about this place and redirect them to del seoul because i don&#39;t wanna be waitin&#39; in line for the best korean tacos the city has to offer!damn this place is good! my friends from st louis rave about this place and i understand why now.you order from a counter and prices are incredibly reasonable.tacos, burritos, or bowls - and you pick your protein.seoul taco may fill you up, but it&#39;s lacking soul.my favorite is definitely the taco and the quesadilla.i just wanted to say thanks to david choi (seoul taco owner) and the representative from 4 hands brewery for an epic event (he might be the owner too, sorry i didn&#39;t catch his name).hidden in the rice were maybe three or four pieces of spicy pork but, honestly, they might as well not have been: the pieces were neither spicy nor well cooked.the other entrees are larger, but i thought the taco was just right.i&#39;ve been here a few times now, and the food is really the highlight of this spot.i also wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the amount of seoul sauce that drenched the taco, so perhaps consider ordering that on side.whatever &#34;seoul sauce&#34; is, i&#39;m on board.liked seoul taco, didn&#39;t love it, but need to dine in for the full k-taco experience!..thumbs down for seoul taco and the customer service.the stake was super flavorful and delicious, the cheese sauce was out of this world and the spicy kimchee was the perfect balance..worth dining in at some point as the space is really cool and the staff is really friendly.seoul taco elevates the steak (bulgogi) and chicken tacos..but the place itself felt very sterile and lacked charm..i&#39;m a new da..the nacos weren&#39;t far behind but i&#39;d would get the bulgogi ones instead of pork.we will be back.did not get a chance to try everything from the list (yet!) however the quesadillas &amp; taco were just delicious.overall for price point and taste in food i was more than satisfied with most of my options.cons- no shrimp tacos :(would go back n try burrito ;).normal service as fast food.the food itself is ok..the sauce they use is really good!!!.i think (and hope!) this place is different! it has a unique menu of korean/mexican fusion with just enough &#34;late night munchie&#34; style food to satisfy the river north drinkers.yes it sounds strange but it works! tacos are amazing.favorites were definitely the chicken and bulgogi; the chicken had a bit of spice to it but good heat.thirdly, the bowl has a glob of sauce (is this the seoul sauce?) that just kinda hides in a corner of the bowl.basic menu that doesn&#39;t leave you flabberghasted with options but broad enough to leave you enough options.seoul taco is a trendy restaurant, serving korean-mexican fusion food, with a hip environment to match.bop n grill has kimchee fries and bulgogi egg rolls, while del seoul has wings and bento plates.would definitely come back!.so i felt these had a bit of a kick to them..for ~$20, you can easily get enough to feed 2 people.if you are a big eater, go for the bowl or the burrito.the tacos are relatively inexpensive at $2.but don&#39;t let that stop you! the rice is great too.$2.i&#39;d be shocked if something this tasty didn&#39;t last.great experience overall, i&#39;ll definitely be going back.would come back again.bathroom review: n/a, we had takeout.."

 now i want to go back for the main dish chinese food.on our last day in chicago, my husband and i were craving some good chinese food.that&#39;s my go-to every time.portions were good and reasonably priced (btw, 3 dishes is more than enough for an average female appetite!).but the waiter was very nice and accommodating.recommended dishes:- pork siu mai- pot stickers- shredded duck vermicelli- bbq pork- shrimp dumplings- black peppered short ribsprices are on the higher side, but that&#39;s expected eating in the loop.we had been to minghin cuisine in chinatown a few times and always liked it, but it is not always easy for us to schlep down to chinatown.it&#39;s not the super cheapest for dim sum but considering the location.all in a great meal and we will be coming back again when the dim sum craving strikes.called ahead to try to get reservations, but no luck - arrived at 11:45 anyway with a group of 8 and were seated right away! what?!?![when we left around 1 there was quite a line, but overall the restaurant stayed pretty accessible throughout our dining experience so you might as well come try your luck if you dont have a reservations]dim sum is ordered via menu versus pushed around on carts (my preferred method) but thats okay.we were seated right away, and our server was right there with the menus, water, and hot tea.i asked for extra spice and they added a good amount of whole dried red pepper which made a nice glow.authentic cantonese place in an excellent location..i probably wouldn&#39;t get this one again.fyi, do not be intimidated.turnip cake.the amount of food you get for the price is not bad.each of the three of us received our meals separately..don&#39;t miss this spot during the week for wonderful dim sum.if you have more time, i would definitely recommend trying out their store in chinatown for a much larger selection.got the shu mai, shrimp dumplings with pea shoots, stuffed sticky rice in lotus leaf, and sesame balls.i would definitely come back again soon!.it brightens my day when tom is at the restaurant to greet customers.i loved it and will be back next time i&#39;m in town..food: the food was delicious.by far, this is one of the best.great dim sum! you mark your order on a colored picture menu.my recommendations: the minghin shrimp dumplings, sticky rice with ground pork and egg yolk steamed in a lotus leaf, short ribs with honey sauce, fried turnip cake (dip it in the hoisin sauce and spicy sauce on your table), shrimp crepe with sweet soy sauce, chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, and bbq pork buns..ordered all the classics for the fam and my parents (tw) were more than pleased.in addition, the modern interior looked clean and polished, and the staff was extremely attentive throughout.vegetable rolls were soggy and tasteless.it was yummy!.they should really take care of the dumpster outside.everything is so fresh and delicious and not greasy like some dim sum places can be.amazing food.i&#39;ve worked in the service industry, i know its hard, people are mean, and you are overworked.unfortunately the pricing strategy isn&#39;t.solid dim sum available all day..so disappointing...we ordered at least 20 plates, if not more, and each left paying under $30, with some food left over.) which is a great touch.the eggplant is certainly a must as well.can&#39;t believe it took me a year to find this gemfresh dim sum which is so tastythe ribs were the best and the waitress was great to point me in the right direction..was in the area and found this place on yelp and had great reviews.delicious dim sum! tried this place for the first time and was surprised to find good dimsum downtown (and not in chinatown)..the staff is always courteous and i believe the manager who greats everyone is great..i walked in and placed my order for lo mein.all the food was excellent! the egg rolls wasn&#39;t my favorite and if you order beef ask and make sure you get the sliced thin not the cubed.they have an extensive menu with all the staples - sumai, ribs, buns and much more.a little hard to find, and difficult parking, but definitely worth it.we were seated at a small 2 person table, so when the dishes started coming in, it became challenging to stack and place them all of the table.i&#39;m starting to think maybe i don&#39;t really like dim sum..ordered dim sum items which is easy to do as the menus come with pictures and you can just mark on the menu itself..food and service was alright.they were light, a little sticky, fired crispy on the outside, and had nice chunks of soft turnip pieces on the inside.most dim sum options came with 3-4 pieces per order for around $3.location is challenging to get to unless you are already working downtown and looking for a lunch joint.even my wife feels it is authentic like from hk or guangzhou.i think providing a great service is required.this is one of my favorite places in the city!nice restaurant, good chinese food, amazing drink prices, big screen in the bar area to watch sports games (clutch during nba finals).food is fresh and the flavor is bursting through with each bite.one of my coworkers order from their dimsum and enjoyed his pork buns  in all, i would definitely come back here for lunch as service was excellent and quick."
steakbar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/steakbar-chicago,2,"Wow.i&#39;m not complaining.the next time in chicago i&#39;m going to stop in again.our waiter this time was zachary and he was so attentive and so nice! (the last time we were there - the night of 10/11 - we sat upstairs and had this super nice blonde waitress - wish i could remember her name) - i can&#39;t say enough good things about the lovely service! thanks steak bar, so glad to have you in the neighborhood!.another wells st.the vibe is very clubbish which made us a little nervous but the food and service was great!the table shared the kale and quinoa salad which was very tasty, i got the swordfish while my fiancee had had the truffled patty melt and fries.the salad we got alongside the nachos worked so well, due to 2 unique things: the croutons we normally see in caesar salads was replaced with crunchy potato chips and the salad dressing itself was very light and summery with its lemony taste as opposed to a heavier creamy caesar.the service was absolutely amazing.but it was still gorgeous.food tastes like it was out of a can.however the front door staff are the typical tough guy wanna be with quite the attitude.we had an avocado toast to start, then i had the crab roll.lets just say, it lived up to the name! it was absolutely delicious, and to make things even better, they bring it out with sparklers! so awesome! i highly recommend steakbar and i&#39;m looking forward to coming back asap!.if they do, i can see them on their way to bib gourmand status, and i&#39;ll return often.the nachos and the tuna poke come with the same tortilla chips, which would be fine.at steakbar, what you expect is what you are getting..this is a kind of new place in old town, has a contemporary look and feel.eventually we settled on the tuna poke (app), crab roll &amp; ny strip ( cooked to perfect med-rare!), and the truffle mac n cheese, which was entirely unnecessary but so delicious!  the strip was one of the best steaks i&#39;ve had in a while, and the old fashioneds were big, boozy, and delicious! service was spot on!  if you&#39;re going to splurge (it is a steak place after all), try this place out!.the mac and cheese is probably the best thing they offer..i highly recommend the swordfish steak and truffle mac and cheese.it wasn&#39;t too loud or drunk/rowdy like some of the other places on wells.the shrimp cocktail was so amazing and came out on a very cool glowing platter..he found her and told me what type of drink it was because i couldn&#39;t remember exactly and told me her name which is kristin..the nachos and mac and cheese were good though and others at the table said the burger was decent.we also got the truffled mac and cheese to share and that was also incredible because how can you go wrong with the mixture of truffles and cheese on top of noodles.they serve them in really cute jars and they&#39;re definitely shareable because they&#39;re huge but it was so good!i&#39;ll definitely be dining there again.great food, great drinks! had the crab and it was to die for! also the tuna tartare i think and also really really good.conclusion:come here only for drinks and if you&#39;re tired of all the better spots in old town."
simones-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/simones-chicago-2,1,"There&#39;s always been hipsters behind the bar who judge your drink order or are a little apathetic, but it&#39;s been bordering on rude and combative recently.that was cool, its a pretty big place, i enjoyed the food.they don&#39;t have the tipical beers here but only different and special stuff.if that&#39;s your scene though, good for you.bottom line: nice neighborhood bar.i just went this past weekend and noticed they are now serving brunch.the bartender offered to have me try samples before ordering.i&#39;ve had to wait ten minutes for a menu on multiple occasions.uncomfortable crowded.i must say it is a unique place.i might visit again because they place is good and worth a second try.they&#39;ve got a fair share of bar basics: nachos, pizza, fries, chips.bartenders seem lost in their own world.i come for the nachos!!! great neighborhood bar, the music is always different and all the staff is very friendly..always a fan of simones cool ass staff chris stevie and keith are the shi#.i would definitely go back.great food.great draft list.it&#39;s always hopping like the bars of yester years.i tried malort for the first time here, but i can&#39;t really blame that on the bar.great bartenders, very attentive..my mother &amp; i went in on a weekday for dinner.hope to be back soon to try other items on their menu..good beer good blt sandwich.i&#39;ve been to simone&#39;s a few times, they have a great selection of beer, and the bartenders were great at making drinks.the regular fries were really crunchy while the sweet potato fries were delicious.the simone&#39;s pizza might be the best pizza i&#39;ve ever had, period..i can&#39;t give a restaurant a 5 star review without trying the food so 4 stars it is!.it really is a terrible spot, dangerous, weird crowd.the tavern looks like an arcade with the way it is designed..thin, crispy crust, with a nice chew on the edges..my go-to neighborhood bar.pretty cool place that specializes in craft brews and plays 90&#39;s music.very hipster, i suggest it if that&#39;s your scene.the missing stars are for the service..i saw a wine i didn&#39;t recognize on the menu and asked him about it.excellent ff.cool neighborhood bar not uptight like the river north crowd.nostalgia.but other than that, the burger never disappoint.waiter must have hit his head on the hanging art, because he did the most bizarre thing.this place in one word basic..anyways.the stack was happily held together by two sturdy buns.this is a pretty cool bar with fun decor.here i am, two years later, still only going here because it&#39;s one of the only places on 18th i can go and get something other than mexican food, and still questioning why i didn&#39;t just get a burrito instead.good music, variety of beer and meals.had the wings and they were delicious but they give the world&#39;s smallest celery sticks.and the bartender/waiter was excellent as well!."
strings-ramen-shop-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/strings-ramen-shop-chicago,2,"Still, it was nice that we got seated so quickly, and the service was great despite not being in the main area.if you&#39;re a fan of spicy food (as i am) i&#39;d recommend starting at level 3 for the hell ramen.their &#34;pork belly&#34; had significantly less fat and it didn&#39;t really add to the enhancement to the ramen.will not come back because the ramen texture was very unique - too unique.service was friendly and they immediately bring out some glasses with a pitcher of water upon seating.ramen noodles ( cooked al dente here )are made from scratch! hell ramen looked really good until i ate it, the broth was full of chili oil ( spicy ) but lacked sodium,  maybe they forgot to add salt in the broth ,  while tonkotsu ramen had a sweet creamy thick fatty pork broth,  it was too sweet for my taste..the oden, meh.hot enough to feel the heat and still be able to finish the the whole bowl without being in physical pain.so proceed with caution.i was also surprised at how clean and well kept the restaurant was.nice casual place to eat in the heart of chinatown..we have been to strings at least five times! it has always been good.it is so delicious...omg, it was a pure slice of fat..hence the one star less.we quenched our thirst on the whole pitcher of water on our table afterwards.two bowls of kuro buta tonkotsu ramen, each with an egg, one appetizer and two soft drinks came to around $44 without tip.i love creamy and salty broth!  that&#39;s what i look for.it is a great spot for a date or decent sized group.they have a challenge where you can win a $50 gift certificate if you can finish a bowl of the 5 spicy in 30 minutes might have to try that.i tried the tonkotsu ramen which is the pork bone stock with duck and pork tenderloin.the soup was okay, but they poured so much roasted sesame oil on top that i literally couldn&#39;t even think of the stuff for about a month afterwards without feeling sick.music is good.this restaurant is the reason for our last 2 visit  chinatown.side note: you can also just ask for a container of the 5 hell ramen sauces, if you just want to try them for funsies (but they&#39;re 95 cents each which is kinda funny considering they just give you a little dollop).strings is a trendy looking place, with pretty decent food.i ordered the level one hell ramen and found it delicious.love the soups.i really liked the richness of the broth and the fullness of all the flavors..kind of pricey for a bowl of ramen, but very tasty..what made me bring this down two stars is the fact that i got charged for a simple condiment.i added an egg to complement.i just expect curly ramen to pick up soup better.strings doesn&#39;t disappoint.overall, an okay experience.they have a hell ramen contest if you can eat it in 20 mins then you get a $50 gift card and your bowl is free.pretty average.recently saw a story stating they were one of the top 10 ramen places in chicagoland.but i even if is slightly expensive and salty i would still go back! the pork just melts in your mouth! go and order any bowl of ramen and you won&#39;t be disappointed.oh yeah, and way over priced.good ramen.the seaweed garnish was the last straw and, after a taste of what probably came from a pack of those 3 for 99¢ seaweed snacks that i could snatch from any asian grocery store, i practically begged my boyfriend finish the rest (and i *never* share food).the input find was the slightly undercooked noodles, but  not enough to deduct a star.but at the end, they gave us 15% off our whole check for the inconvenience so no complaints here.broth is great."
evas-cafe-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/evas-cafe-chicago-2,2,"I ordered an iced vanilla latte in my own cup.it has heavy furniture and a stack of books and board games way in the back past the counter.but you can&#39;t beat great, affordable coffee within walking distance from my house.loose leaf tea..it feels like home! sat at a table by the window for a while, then moved to one of the super comfortable leather chairs by the fireplace.great coffee and treats and a super friendly staff.quiet place great employees large selection of tea.definitely recommend this spot if you are in the area!.eva&#39;s!  i was mostly in shock when i came here because why have i not been here before..the drinks are very reasonably priced and when you ask for a large (they also have xtra large) you actually get a large drink.i see a few people in there with their laptops or chatting.great local coffee shop in old town!perfect for a quick cup or for hanging out and doing work for the whole afternoon.for me, the food and drink were a little disappointing, from the limited choices of items, the weakness of the coffee, and the prices which are higher than most similar places ( a medium coffee and small scone about five dollars-i usually spend four on that combo..i had a chai which is my go to..study heaven! came to old town for a change of pace and stumbled upon this wonderful independent coffee house.a nice cozy place to get coffee and tea and relax...this is the best little coffee shop in old town! it has a cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, great coffee and fresh made to order breakfast sandwiches that are delicious! there&#39;s hardly ever a line and there are plenty of places to sit and hang out..delicious.it was painful to just get my coffee and be on my way.really yummy! i&#39;ll definitely come back..i had a morning cookie that was to die for.it&#39;s a little bit off the beaten path, but still in the heart of old town...this little cosy café in old town is perfect for a nice coffee break with friends or to work, as they have both great wifi and a printer!it&#39;s not as hectic as other coffee shops, it feels more like you are sitting in someones living room.a touch dark, but you wont be stumbling around blind.i would give it a 4-5 star rating except that halfway through my meal, someone entered the store and sat at my table, didn&#39;t order anything to eat/drink and proceeded to listen to loud music and watch tv shows right next to me as i was working -- there were plenty of other tables available too.they serve intelligentsia coffee and the decor here is very cute.they also have great breakfast sandwiches on the weekend.if they had a dishwasher here, i&#39;d put my emptied mug into it.first time visitor: so happy to find this gem near where i work.very friendly staff.really good coffee :)it is hard to find great coffee away from san fran but i especially came to this spot because they serve intelligentsia coffee.the shop has several large community desks, several small tables, and several large arm chairs.not a huge variety of food offerings and the kitchen hours are limited so the menu becomes even more limited when it&#39;s closed.but if you can find a place to sit (i suggest in an armchair by the fire), then this is a very cozy, low-key place to grab some coffee.good coffee, nothing spectacular..sure, they&#39;ll toast you a bagel or make an am sandwich, but that&#39;s about all they got for first meal.50! great prices especially for well made intelligentsia coffee.i work in the neighborhood and there&#39;s tons of other coffee shops that are closer to me, but still always go here.will definitely come back!.it has old vintage chairs (plenty of seating) and delicious baked goods, sandwiches and drinks.staff are very friendly.i got the red velvet latte which was unique, although not personally something i would get again.the area is not the prettiest around but it feels very comfortable in the café.great family owned neighborhood cafe.it&#39;s hidden away bellow the sedgwick brown line stop, so you really have to be looking for it to find it..this is the amazing local cafe that this neighborhood needs..this is an ideal cafe.the secret about the existence of eva&#39;s cafe is out.i don&#39;t know about you guys, but i always feel &#34;rushed&#34; or &#34;distracted&#34; at a coffeeshop downtown due to the limited space and the volume of traffic coming in and out.(try the toasted/roasted almond tea!) whether hunkering down to catch up on homework, curling up to read a book, or meeting up with a friend, the atmosphere at eva&#39;s is cozy and comfortable...i enjoyed my respite here and while it is not a destination cafe i would definitely come here again if i was in old town.is what this place is!i needed wifi for work, and stopped in for sustenance as well.the ambience is nice.so for this foodie, the hunt is on for somewhere i can go to after eva&#39;s cafe closes!   :-d..it&#39;s like starbucks meets grandma&#39;s house.delicious chicken poblano soup, great ambiance.the only problem i had was the barista, who i assume was the daughter of the owner, was sitting with her friend having an extremely loud conversation while i tried to study.i didn&#39;t find this place until 2 years after i had moved to old town and wish i had known about it earlier!.i&#39;ve had several that i don&#39;t even choke down.cozy is definitely the word to describe eva&#39;s.free review, plenty of outlets, great (but not too loud) music and tables with a lot of room..the almond croissant wasn&#39;t very almond-y either even though i overhead one of the girls working tell a customer that the almond flavor was pretty strong..serve great roasts and it&#39;s got an authentic vibe.definitely not your typical starbucks experience! i&#39;d definitely recommend everyone check it out!.i&#39;m not sure if there is a cost for printing, but there is a printer available if needed (and of course free wifi)."
la-encantada-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-encantada-chicago,2,"Could be your next number one date spot.this was our first experience with la encantada, but it won&#39;t be our last!the enchiladas poblanos are wonderful.also.i&#39;m very impressed.very reasonable pricing.the only problem is they don&#39;t seem to do a lot of business (i&#39;ve been there twice during lunch time, and my guests and i were the only patrons).what kind of mexican restaurant is this where the food takes 20 mins to come out?  now, i will say the food was good, but c&#39;mon..the food is solid.if you love mexican food and want great service go here!..go check this place out - keep this restaurant alivefood was totally worth the drive..nice place, but too dead.the crepas, on the other hand, were an out-of-the-park home run.mixed drinks were on point and when we went in the summer they had the back patio open which with a margarita in hand quickly transported me to a beach in mexico.and i had dinner at la encantada, a few months after trying to have lunch there and finding out that the restaurant is only open for dinner.get over here! bring your friends!.wonderful! the enchilada was on point and the salsa that came with chips was absolutely delicious and spicy.we started with sharing the quesadilla with huitlacoche, which was perfect.highly recommended!.had the huitacloche quesadillas appetizer.this place is an absolute gem! the décor, art and ambiance is very tasteful and modern, not what one would assume for the location..we ended up being able to pay by giving her the card number...it&#39;s nice to see that they had a full bar, and the mojitos were good.owner is spicy, original and authentic and offers regional mexican food intelligently seasoned and delightfully presented.i appreciate an establishment that isn&#39;t warming frozen meals but rather making all of the food on-site.i love how the menu says &#34;not as good as fried..my friend&#39;s carne asada a la tampiquena with a side of nopales was a perfect pairing!  i too loved my entree - a generous portion of tilapia la encantada and garlicky spinach with mushrooms.this place is so great! off the beaten path.the interior is beautifully decorated with the exposed brick and artwork.we have tried the enchiladas poblanas, chile en nogada (my favorite!!) carne asada oaxaqueña n tampiqueña and sopes all are very good!! so far so good and i hope it stays like that because this is defending my place for that yummy uniquely delicious chile en nogada!!.all entrees chicken, beef and spinach alternatives.my favorite mexican restaurant in humboldt park.this is the best place on that side of town.they were delicious, such incredibly fresh avocado too!  it was a really unique taste, like nothing i&#39;d had before, and it certainly helped calm our starving stomachs.this place is amazing food!1  we just can&#39;t believe we hadn&#39;t come sooner.dont forget to ask about the specials, mojitos were only $3..the side salad that came out was a few measly scraps of iceberg lettuce and some strips of yellow pepper, hardly a meal component.it can become costly, but the end result is a delicious, memorable meal that leaves you satisfied!thank you irma for all your hard work!.not spicy.i ordered the sizzling steak fajita&#39;s, the cactus salad, and a frozen strawberry margarita.they have many dishes you don&#39;t see at most other mexican restaurants.i highly recommend this place.carne asada oaxaca is another.not a typical hole in the wall mexican restaurant.the husband and i are guac snobs, and we&#39;re rarely satisfied with restaurant guac-- all too often, unnecessary ingredients like sour cream are added.i went here on a saturday night (the saturday night of labor day weekend) around 8pm.we wandered in around 8:30 on a tuesday night and it was empty.dinner potions were a little small.it&#39;s a nice place for a date or for couples to relax with a few drinks and outstanding mexican fare..i&#39;m thrilled i found the menu to this place and i can finally go back and get some of that ridiculous soup..great service.the carne asada is amazing they use good quality beef, i can tell as i am a true meat eater and this is some of the best tasting beef i have had in chicago.out of the way but worth it.this place is real - based on other reviews i will stay away from the margaritas but the enchiladas were delightful and i highly recommend the mexican zucchini which is sweeter than regular zucchini.it is worth it to support our local business..never bothered with anything other than the regular kind.just cuz it&#39;s dark doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s mole! ;-)  it says it right on the menu it&#39;s a chipotle pepper sauce not a chocolate/pepper sauce as regular mole is.highly recommended!.friendly service, nice atmosphere, reasonable prices, and the food is wonderful! the guacamole and salsa are fresh and delicious.the service was super friendly and attentive without rushing us.with the restaurant being pretty well empty on a friday night, some savvy marketing may be needed (and i promise not to complain when they get &#34;check, pleased!&#34;).i had the enchiladas poblanas with arroz and compote con chipotle (sweet potatoes with chipotle).my friend&#39;s and another person&#39;s.i believe the manager said bye to us on the way out."
jake-melnicks-corner-tap-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jake-melnicks-corner-tap-chicago-2,1,"Had some bbq pork and mac and cheese, oh and the cornbread! definitely worth the wait and prices (not that it was expensive).these wings were very good.the wings here are delicious and the sauces are great.food is absolutely delicious.it will get super crowded for football games, but they&#39;re great at accommodating everyone.these could be the best wings i&#39;ve had! you can split your order of 8 wings with two flavors.jake filled the bill.we were advised to ,ale a reservation for the game &amp; glad we did: basically got our own tv..you will be legnedary.very nice lunch on a sunday afternoon..it was a marinated grilled wing that had a mild garlic flavor with just a little kick to it.it came with fries and could feed two people..we started to come here because they have good spicy chicken wings..we got the turkey burger and the grilled chicken sandwich!the turkey burger was good and juicy..the wings that stood out to me the most were the sweet sirarcha wings, and the peanut butter and jelly wings.the drinks were good and the price was right..stopped in after promat for a work function, vendor had the keg room reserved, nice digs and conducive to the mingle.the food is amazing and extra large portion.we had to take a lot to go because it was so much food and sadly our hotel room did not have a microwave in the room so you best believe i ate the two remaining wings cold.the corn bread in skillets was divine as well!  my personal favorite this was the macaroni and cheese.overall, the wings are not as crispy as i would prefer.i was led by my friend and she said this is the best chicken wing in chicago but the only flavor could eat is poncho haha.service was slow- took 45 minutes for wings to come out.pulled pork sliders was my choice during this jake melnick experience.some of the food tasted a little oversmoked (specifically the chicken).really like melnick&#39;s.great for meeting friend and watching a game..made with love.and it was quite good.the beer list is good, i had the allagash 16 counties on draft and it was delicious.firecracker wings, parmesan fries and scrumpy cider..i live in the area and this is one of the spots i like to bring friends to or go for a bite to eat and drink.apparently it bothered her to have diverse people at the bar talk to other guests.beer:they have all different sorts of beer, from surly to stone.for dinner, he enjoyed some of the wings, and i ordered the nachos, which were good but not great.this place is super popular so expect them to be crowded no matter when you go.when they refilled our water, they also placed a new lemon in it!we were quoted to have a 20-minute wait for outdoor seating but then got a text 5 minutes later that a seat was available.we really enjoyed the screened in outside seating.lucked out as it&#39;s 2 blocks from my hotel.the nachos were the disappointment.can&#39;t wait to get back.coleslaw ok but i&#39;ve had bigger portions when i&#39;ve asked the deli for a taste sample.the restaurant was not full so i dont know why it took so long just for the sever to come over..he was super friendly and helpful and was always there with a fresh beer, or whatever else we needed..it&#39;s a no frills bar slightly off of the touristy michigan avenue..i enjoyed the mayo/ketchup like one that was their &#34;special sauce&#34;.i had the porch swing and loved it! so grab your friends, grab a drink and have some fun!stay cheerful ;).you can bet i&#39;ll be back!.fried pickles - my favorite of the night.my wife and i were thinking it was a &#34;wings and beer&#34; kind of night.they were &#34;ok&#34;.took a few co-workers here and everyone really enjoyed it.they have decent wings though....a cold beer was in order, perhaps some tasty little morsels as well.go to this place..on an off street as well.oh god.but.our entrees came out way quicker than the appetizers did.me and the hubby went here after a day of shopping."
nando-milano-trattoria-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/nando-milano-trattoria-chicago,1,"Been here a few times and each time the place seems to get smaller.our server was amazing and made the whole experience even better..looking at the menu i was instantly struck at how high the prices were for both wine and food.super service with very friendly staff.the ambiance was great and the food was authentic, not to mention the staff was also very friendly.for our main dish, we enjoyed the gnocchi della nonna: house made gnocchi filled with gorgonzola cheese in an aurora sauce.can&#39;t wait to go back!.wide variety, fresh ingredients, inside and outside seating, friendly and attentive staff, and the head chef/owner checked in on us to make sure we were enjoying everything.came here once in person with my family and the service was 5 star.cozy italian restaurant.food was okay, nothing special.as a brazilian from são paulo i grew up around italian food..you get a lot of &#34;i know what you will like&#34; to &#34;we can do anything&#34;.wow, i am impressed!!! the outdoor seating of this place is to die for, with perfect little twinkle lights and right in the middle of division on wicker park it&#39;s both trendy and peaceful! a great romantic vibe..i would definitely come back!.it was super sweet and tasty- i love lemon..this is as close to italy as you will get! i have now been 5-6 times and nando keeps getting better.what&#39;s not to love? classic italian cuisine, great service and a wonderful location in the heart of wicker park.amazing ambience after you get through the snobby, snooty way-too-thin hostess.i love italy and have been there many times.we ordered the arrancini, caprese salad, rigatoni alla beppe, lasagna, and tiramisu.would go again!.do yourself a favor and go here, you&#39;ll be glad you did!.everything was incredibly fresh..while we recognize that wicker park is not in rome, we enjoyed our prosecco, but the chianti by the glass left a lot to be desired.we&#39;ve been to the other italian restaurants in the neighborhood and while they were good we were never blown away so we decided to give nando milano a try since they are walking distance from my house.it certainly helps when the chef hails from italy..delicious.they&#39;ll be impressed with your hidden gem find, and even more impressed with the food.gnocchi has a great texture to it.he was a charmer without being pushy.i had their version of spaghetti and meat sauce and it was quite tasty, but i think it too fell a little flat.gnocchi is on point.everything seems made there, from the pasta to the sausage to the limoncello..we were already 10 people giving them a ton of business, and yet they kept trying to get us to order more antipasti, more wine, more everything.food is beyond excellent here, the gnocchi were like clouds of pillows, the rissotto was perfectly rice al dente, seasoning was dead on.our desserts were insanely good and i&#39;m sure if we lived in the neighborhood we&#39;d become regulars.5/10their vintage industrial decor is pinterest-worthy and they&#39;ve got a surprisingly good music selection.would definitely recommend.i want some more right now.i asked if it was ok if we dined and he said it was.i&#39;ve never had anything bad here.had a good meal, great service and fun layout at nando.there are lots of good italian places in chicago but this is the most authentic italian i&#39;ve been to.loved our apps.after dining here i can totally see why they wouldn&#39;t shut up about this place.tris di arancini di riso (trio of arancini) this was also v delicious.adorable place..i had the risotto special which included clams / mussels / calamari / shrimp - and i ate every last forkful of it.can&#39;t believe i&#39;ve never heard of this place! we walked in during do-division and really enjoyed the food...will definetly put nando milano on our go to italian list!.we made a reservation for four a couple of weeks ago to take my dad, who was visiting the city for the weekend, to a nice place in the neighborhood.in fact i am highly skeptical of anyone that gets excited by couscous.all that being said, everything i ate was delicious and i would definitely return again with family.once again, very obvious that the pasta was handmade.i&#39;m writing &#34;tiramisu&#34; because what we had was a poor imitation full of whipped heavy cream and seriously lacking in both masacarpone and alcohol.i&#39;m talking goldilocks ratios...i will definitely go back and try some more menu items...they were delicious and pretty easy to share with 2.this place is a cozy little gem that will knock your socks off.their food is phenomenal.excellent service and atmosphere..get the gnocchi.the homemade pasta dishes are absolutely amazing! also, the service was extremely welcoming and attentive."
silli-kori-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/silli-kori-chicago,1,"Wanted some good thai food and decided to try this new little gem.great atmosphere as well.we always get it for pick-up but the inside of this place is really cute we&#39;ll have to come and dine-in sometime.it used to be a more standard thai place but was renovated and menus changed into what it is today (along with a name change)...the service was great, and the server was attentive.there were 8 of us and every one loved the experience...i went with the son in law eggs with a tasty cocktail..60 bucks total with tip.just went there for the first time..it is amazing! the service is great, prompt on bringing water and refilling it! great job! the food is killer! the pad thai is the best i&#39;ve ever had! if you like spicy food the green curry with scallops is also the best! overall i&#39;d eat this everyday for the rest of my life.the kao soi was delicious and the service was wonderful! thanks for a great dining experience.service was perfect too..this place is an undiscovered gem! great ambience and even better food! flavor is amazing and price is considerably low.when you fiancé says &#34;i&#39;m angry i haven&#39;t been here before.one suggestion for the restaurant:  update the website to reflect the new (used to be thai village) restaurant&#39;s menu..drinks and eats were on time! i will go back!.i have no idea what the name is in reference to.great vibes from the music to the art on the brick walls.but last night when eating here, there was an odor of mildew that permeated the entire place.we both really enjoyed our meals.the pan-seared salmon with pineapple tamarind was very flavorful without being obnoxious.food is average to good but prices are on the higher side.the outdoor seating is in front and lovely for a summer evening on division street and the interior has been upgraded, making it feel more fresh and less traditional thai..my friend and i are from oregon and we are both very fond of thai food.then the noodles were overcooked.really and truly, i highly recommend.good dumplings and not too oily.we ordered the crispy roll, pad thai and kori&#39;s favorite noodles- all delicious! noodle dishes were flavorful and unique.looking forward to the seared scallop salad and the tom yum river prawn.great atmosphere! nice small plates.i loved the uniqueness of the menu.just go here."
potbelly-sandwich-shop-chicago-26,https://www.yelp.com/biz/potbelly-sandwich-shop-chicago-26,1,"Long lines move quickly and quality of food is always on point.also the employees on the toppings line couldn&#39;t move as fast as the people taking meat orders from the ipad, so they had a backlog of sandwiches that created a little bit of inefficiency.surprisingly all the ingredients were top notch...now the &#34;skinny&#34; is called thin cut.the coffee is great..pizza sub with everything but mayo and mustard.they serve intelligentsia coffee!.make sure to smother you sandwich with hot peppers.the food was good, and it came out fast.i clearly delineate what i&#39;d like.i ordered an italian sanwhich with everything.i love when my adventures in or through chicago take me to midway instead of o&#39;hare because there are actually options like this place for a quality vegan/vegetarian-friendly lunch at the airport!this is pretty decent-sized branch of the &#34;antique store&#34;-themed sandwich chain, located on the far south end of the airport and directly across from terminal b1.cup of chicken noodle soup &#34;to go&#34; ~ found one, yes &#34;1&#34; tiny little piece of chicken on the bottom  $3..great value.got it with almost all the available toppings.i also didn&#39;t know i had to ask for some sort of dressing separately, so when i finally got to eating the sandwich, i missed the mayo and the dressing which led to a healthier, but less fulfilling sandwich.i was just hoping for much more meat!.holy moly.i&#39;ve not had any of the salads here so i can&#39;t really comment on those but sometimes i&#39;ve had the tomato soup and it&#39;s thick and rich.the management manages the movement of the ordering line and it is always staffed to handle the rush.i am glad i did.just the way i like it.super filling- remember youre in an airport..for airport food, it&#39;s incredible.i usually get a sandwich from her and eat it in the plane.nothing special, nothing crummy - just a sandwich place.(potbellies don&#39;t exist in my parts of the us)they are one of the better options at midway..friendly, attentive staff.this really expedited the progress of the line.i ended up getting the ham, egg, mushroom, avocado, and hot pepper breakfast wrap which was way beyond my expectations!  i expected the hot peppers to be the typical banana pepper, but they were some other kind that really left a decent amount of heat in your mouth after every bite.and a little time saving tip? you can call once your plane lands and order pick up to be ready for you in 15 minutes, so that if you have a layover or need to be somewhere in a hurry when leaving the airport, the food is ready!.what did i get? breakfast flatbread with egg and cheese add creamy, fresh avocado and mushrooms.stay away from potbelly sandwiches.during the flight i pigged out.i want my $4.top notch airport sandwich.five stars, really?! yes, they&#39;re a potbelly, but they&#39;re a potbelly that delivers with lightning-fast accuracy at the highest-volume location in the country....so.i only came here for the coffee and the live performance.airport food has always been for me a glum affair.the meatballs were pretty standard but the peppers were the real ticket!  my girl got the italian and i&#39;d let you know how that tasted if she had given me a bite!  must&#39;ve been good!  the staff was friendly and helpful!  can&#39;t wait for another layover so i can enjoy some more from this chicago-born sandwich shop!..this is the midway potbelly so  you don&#39;t really expect a lot, but as airport food goes they were quite good.even i am surprised to see the sign that says that they are guaranteed to get your sandwich to you within 7 or 8 minutes.oh my glob, what a messy situation..when i added avocado slices (+ $1) they didn&#39;t skimp.we requested ours &#34;loaded&#34; which seemed to mean &#34;with all of the free things you can put on top,&#34; following whatever flyertalkians and other airportians wrote on their online blogs that revealed themselves after we googled &#34;what to do&#34; followed by &#34;four hour layover&#34; followed by &#34;mdw chicago.best choice in midway.a large 9-inch sub will run you about $6-7 while the regular 6-inch size is even cheaper at $5-6.great for a sandwich place but a pleasant surprise for an airport food place.lines are relatively long, but moves fairly quick.quick, painless, and yummy experience.we got a chicken and cheese sandwich and the kiddos gobbled it up.i always get the roast beef on wheat and load it up with all the ingredients they offer (sans tomatoes).you can also customize your sandwich or salad..all the standard stuff - meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato etc.after you select a base sandwich from the options on the board, you can choose the bread and toppings as you choose, like at most sandwich places.it is a great option before a flight.the cashier and staff were friendly enough.the wheat bread was soft and slightly sweet.good...thankfully, it was only $4.it did not disappoint as there was sauce dripping down my hands from the first bite (maybe i&#39;m just a messy eater).i would still ultimately pick this place over the other gloomy options at midway.ordered the big wreck which is salami, turkey, roast beef, and swiss."
kaiser-tiger-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kaiser-tiger-chicago-2,1,"Would love to come back on another warm evening!.the bacon variety starter, the incredible meatballs, the ridonkulous hot sauce and the most insane 5 pound meat paradise loaf.the burger was ok it was just a bit salty and greasy.the 1/2 star is entirely dedicated to the amazing service.people i came with has the justin bieber and the gaucho, they liked it a lot.as their full name implies, the offer a substantial amount of beer, sausage and bacon items on the menu, great beer selection but i did not try the food.there were some flavors that stuck out to me..we were quoted a 2 hour and 45 minute wait, but it ended up being more like 90 minutes, which wasn&#39;t too bad.had a great conversation with charlie, annie, justin and ran into a friendly face, a bartender i knew from hackney&#39;s in the south loop, katie..beer list is really deep.brunch menu (and normal menu) are both creative!.i thought the beer garden area was really solid..the fries were abundant.place has a patio out back and appeared to have some backyard games available.fries do not come with the meal and as a word of advice, go with a small fry.some of our friends ordered steins of beer, all came out fairly quickly and there is a large selection of bottled beers and beers on tap.ruh-roh!lance took it back and brought me the correct happy gaucho, and mentioned they were going to give us a dessert on the house.maybe eating there is a better deal.i particularly liked the beer and bacon brat, which has bacon, pork, and lagunitas ipa sausage, wrapped in applewood bacon, topped with pickled red onions and and a house made beer mustard on a pretzel roll.during the actual event the staff went out of their way to ensure that everyone had an excellent time.beer, bacon, sausage.i&#39;d go back.holy bacon! i love kaiser tiger! i&#39;ve been multiple times and will keep coming back.adorable place.yikes.awesome beer bar and menu is good too (sausage sandwiches are fantastic).not good service, so we decided to take our business elsewhere.i didn&#39;t want to give this restaurant/bar/pig pen any stars because they straight up don&#39;t deserve any.they should be embarrassed to serve it.drinks are watered down too!..again, if this place was in my neighborhood, i&#39;d be here with frequency.enjoyed the casual menu..servers nice, not really on their game but they were not worried about it.and even if you don&#39;t eat you&#39;ll still love the vast beer selection, killer outdoor patio, and friendly neighborhood service.the irish curry and curry ketchup were good choices, but all look inventive..she took the bag.the price was reasonable.had an event here and been back for drinks and food many times.not a huge menu, but this is a really good place to grab some food and beer.and they have shots of malört.the first time i went, the bf and i sat down and even before our actual server came around, this gentleman came to us with a beer and set it down.this is the old tasting room space but gone is the liquor store next door but they did keep the beautiful upstairs space which is perfect still for your private function."

three-dots-and-a-dash-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/three-dots-and-a-dash-chicago,1,"We got to this bar around 9:15pm and waited about 30 minutes...even when it got busy, they didn&#39;t cut corners and really put effort into each drink.i&#39;d be back but i suggest coming earlier, or snagging a reserved table.there is just way too many people for me.i&#39;m a very sociable person, i like to go to bars to talk to people and have a good time.pricey, with the air of exclusivity to match.a mai tai, a drink that&#39;s 60 years old?it probably didn&#39;t help that we had had a tremendous evening at the far superior tiki bar lost lake (which i think has since burned down?!) the night before or one of the highlight evenings of my drinking career at aviary the next night..never had a drink like this before!food: we ordered the luau chips with pineapple/avocado dip, thai fried chicken and the hanali spring rolls, which were both delicious! so tasty.if you like tiki drinks or rum drinks, you&#39;ll love three dots and a dash.00 so if you&#39;re looking for a cheaper option, you probably do not want to come here.epic or just blah.a friend of a friend wrote a list of all the &#34;must-see&#34; bars in chicago.the drinks are strong! the fun and colorful menus make it easy to order, each fruity cocktail has a great description and a photo of the drink (presentation is always important).low-key entrance via alley, but they have bouncer which makes it more safe i guess.they have a fun atmosphere and the drinks have a good presentation.attention! attention! three dots has changed their entire menu! the painkiller is no longer on the menu and they refuse to make it! the bartender mentioned they have a new manager who changed all of the drinks.starving from all the walking, we decided on the pu pu platter which came out very delicious besides the eggrolls that had a awkward taste that i never encountered before.i have wanted to come here for ages and thanks to a spur of the moment adventure, my friend and i finally did.i only liked the sliders and crab rangoon.they had so many empty tables but they had reserve on it...they do not disappoint.it gets pretty busy and when we were there, lots of empty &#34;reserved&#34; tables.coconut cream foams on top of the drink with bits of coconut meat inside the drink.the drink variety and rum selection are almost staggering.then another 20 to get a drink made.i know you can rent out private sections of this place if you wanted to host a party over here.i do understand the drinks take forever to make and have a big ingredient list but it wouldn&#39;t hurt the bartender to smile for a second.the interior of this place is just fun, and is a perfect place for a bachelorette party or any other celebration.on weekend nights, it can get so outrageous that standing room feels like a privilege.this bar is playful with great vibes.the atmosphere inside was pretty cute and i loved the decorations.note - i have been to &#34;lost lake&#34; as well (the other famous chicago tiki bar), it was excellent as well, but if you are the typical tourist i would skip the adventure to the suburbs and stick with the three dots and a dash for your tiki drinks.even if it isn&#39;t busy they like to have a line so they make you wait to get in which is very annoying..i tasted my friends drink, something with cucumber and foam, it was delicious.if you don&#39;t it&#39;s so hard to move around there.my husband and i started with and shared the zombie, followed by the pu pu platter.this place is very interesting and very popular.we stood by the bar and watched the bartender work his tropical tiki madness.s.the waitress was nice and explained the drinks to us.i also had to try the actual three dots and a dash drink, which i was pleased with as well.this turned out to be the perfect place to begin our date!after a tour of the menu by our friendly server, we enjoyed the following:painkiller no.a tiki lounge hidden in river north - you would need to go through an alley that is lit with tiki torches...the bar is usually filled with travelers and good conversation.probably not :/.it does get pretty crowded later at night, so if you&#39;re looking for a more chill time, go early.all were pretty good, but of the three, i liked dead reckoning the most.every block you turn to you see an alley...if you only want drinks, there&#39;s only standing room around the bar.we had to come back later because the line was so long to get in..service: good when it&#39;s there, sucky when you have to find itdrinks: two-mix drinks are strong.i came with my sister and found a seat at the bar.i appreciate the hospitality for sure.there is a long line after 10pm on the weekends.but it was dead, which was sad.at one point someone in my party sent back a drink because it wasn&#39;t what was expected and she paused and had an attitude about it, although she did give them a chance to order another one.we walked downstairs into a dimly lit room and it was pretty packed but we were able to squeeze in the bar to order some drinks and stand off to the side where there was a little side table.very whimsical bar revival! we happened upon the entrance by accident as it&#39;s hidden away in an alley.&#34;  we ended up testing the waters and staying a bit longer (one of my friends was visiting from europe and we hadn&#39;t seen her in several years) but this left a bad taste with me, especially because there were many open tables available even when we left."
spotted-monkey-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/spotted-monkey-chicago,2,"Can&#39;t rave enough about this new lunch spot downtown..you really can&#39;t go wrong with spotted monkey!...tried the buddha grilled cheese since i&#39;m a vegetarian.order duck over chicken for sure.while the sandwich is slightly smaller than what you&#39;d get at zenwhich, you get twice the flavor...the veggie egg roll was super tasty too!i loved that they came around to check if you needed anything else, and refilled your water...i ordered the horchata, i&#39;m usually not a big horchata fan, but this one was hot and delicious.stopped in for lunch the other day and had a yummy bahn mi sandwich and le croix.i feel spoiled and fat.i promise.while spotted monkey is still a bit out of the way from my office, it is a touch closer than saucy porka, so i&#39;m happy.super awesome.this place was fantastic! we got the loaded funky monkey fries, the puerto rican rice with guajillo pork, and the guajillo shrimp, ropa vieja beef, and five spice duck bacos.both very flavorful.i&#39;m not sure if they updated the recipes, but the baco&#39;s are all up to par in terms of flavor, and each dish packs a very different punch.certainly a unique lunch, and a place with enough choice that there will be plenty of other flavors to try coming back next time.duck gumbo was rich and delicious.we ordered the guatemalan donuts rellenitos with nutella.20 i paid for lunch.been to this restaurant twice now.i was also able to try a guajillo pork baco  - ftw - bacos are good!the staff is super friendly.packed with flavor.the staff was very friendly.located right across willis tower.the fusion is really not just any crazy idea but a creative one which leaves your mouth watering for more..but the good here is really good!.it is a gem.baco.absolutely loved the panang curry chicken baco and the panang curry chicken banh mi!wished the seating space was more as the place was nearly all filled up when i went with a few colleagues.yummy! nice fusion of hispanic and asian flavors.solid spot for lunch in the loop with excellent service and lots of options.what a darn tasty, flavorful lunch with great customer service - (he was very friendly, outgoing, answered our questions without hesitation, and the food is brought out to you at the table).i was more surprised at how well the kimchi was as it was better than some of the ones i&#39;ve had in korean restaurants.more vietnamese staples are included in this menu, with some deliciously unique twists (pho broth + mexican chiles!) and a healthy variety of duck options.i&#39;m going to try the shrimp next time because it looked great.nice place for a quick lunch.i would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area.got crowded for the lunch hour.the fries weren&#39;t bad by any stretch but paying that much for fries with half the pricey ingredients left off was a bit egregious.(actually their coffee machine was broken, so vietnamese coffee--i don&#39;t know if it was iced or not--wasn&#39;t an option today.the vibe is trendy, but the seating is limited.it&#39;s that good..the latin-asian fusion combo provides so many interesting flavors and there is something on the menu for everyone.would definitely go back and try another dish.bathroom: unknownstaff: the cashier girl was super friendly to n00b me by suggesting which are the most popular items and which things i might enjoy - and her advice was spot-on! the food also came out rather quickly, fast cooks."

grand-palace-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-palace-chicago,2,"This place is for advanced eaters for sure.for the same price, i feel like i could get way better food.i guess my biggest qualm was that things were not sweet enough, and if they were, then they weren&#39;t sour enough.but i would say it was lacking in flavor.i love it!  and the price is good as well.the price for each dish is about $10-16.i ordered the chinese spinach (kong xing cai), beef noodle soup (niu rou tang mian), and ma po tofu.the old story is do not judge a book by it&#39;s cover.summary: this place doesn&#39;t look very special, and you may overlook it entirely as you head towards chinatown, but rest assured, this place has authentic home-style canton/hong kong cooking.granted, this place is great for seafood lovers and just ok for meat lovers.not so good on american chinese dishes like sweet &amp; sour chicken and mongolian beef.the owner behind the corner is super friendly and is a people person.we also ordered the pork belly with black bean sauce and it really hit the spot.in every chinese movie i&#39;ve seen, there have been multiple scenes of families sharing big meals, and if you&#39;re prone to suggestion like me, then you need to know about a place like this after watching a movie like that.they offer a parking lot which is small and usually there isn&#39;t any spots available, but there are ample street parking.had been here couple of time, decent eatery for cantonese style food and seafood, i had very good experience with their steamed or stir-fried fish dishes before, remember to check with the waitress what they have daily from the sea.great place to get a everyday meal from.the food here is really good..yum.so what?  well,  i ordered mongolian beef and it was tremendous.i now understand everything..not sure how lunch is, but dinner was great.don&#39;t let its size or appearance deceive you, let your tastebuds be the judge.best pot stickers i&#39;ve had in chicago! great place to warm up after new years parade.my favorite chinese restaurant for traditional cantonese home cooking.authentic chinese food!!!! everything is tasty and affordable.5 stars.wow quite long for carry out."

qing-xiang-yuan-dumpling-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/qing-xiang-yuan-dumpling-chicago,1,"Well worth the trip to chinatown!.and i was able to eat all of the food surprisingly, 16 dumplings and 6 skewers.been there couple times.staff are so friendly and helpful which is a bit unusual for a chinese place.food is excellent, but the richland food court is rather depressing.that&#39;s awesome! what i only order is dumpling.the beef skewers were very good too!  will be back to try more..it&#39;s quality dumplings at a very reasonable price..what sets this place apart from the others is the service.we recently took a road trip to chicago, and this was my &#34;must-have&#34; restaurant pick due to the great reviews and my ever raging dumpling addiction.they are served in a bamboo basket and they are steaming hot.we choose to get the dumplings steamed and they are one of the best.don&#39;t know how they get 4 stars.i must say for an asian restaurant is quite clean.it wasn&#39;t busy when i went for dinner, but maybe i was just lucky?my friend and i ordered the shrimp, pork, and leek dumplings and the lamb dumplings.damn.the location is a bit difficult to find but it&#39;s worth a visit!.the dumplings here are fresh and tasty.chicago is a great food city and chinatown is loaded with awesome fare from across the cuisine.love coming to this place when i&#39;m in chinatown, the staff is very friendly and it make a big difference.the first thing you notice is that the dumpling skin is not very thick - i personally really like this.i had heard great things about these dumplings but we left disappointed..the lamb dumplings were soooo good~  if you like lamb, it is a must!on the same note the skewers were superb.we will be back to try the beef and lamb dumplings and the rest of their menu.i asked the front person for her best recommendations, of which she said the lamb + coriander and pork + shrimp..if the lamb dumplings are anywhere near as tasty as the lamb kebabs, they&#39;ve got my name on them next...- 6 skewers per order but portion is kinda small for the price..we ordered the lamb and coriander and the beef and onion dumplings.not sure the tiny skewers were worth the money but it was so yummy.just okay.now that they opened a storefront, it&#39;s totally worth every penny! here&#39;s why:what we ordered:potato salad: cold shreds of (raw?) potato with chili oil.i enjoyed the lamb and coriander dumplings; i thought it was a nice snack.these delicate and flavorful little pillows are heavenly.prices are high also.a bit easier to find, so i hope their dumplings are as good as they were at their previous location!.can&#39;t go wrong w/ any of the dumpling selection.the hostess, sans coat, ran down several storefronts, descended the stairs, and flagged us down.the squid was amazing, i can easily say it beats down many places i&#39;ve had both in china and in nyc.you won&#39;t be stuffed from this place but you&#39;ll feel content and the dumplings are made very well.my favorite was the lamb and coriander one, so juicy and filling!.the kiosk is in the food court of the richland building.this shop hand makes each and everyone one of their dumplings when the order is placed.highly recommend.the dumplings are made to order, so be a little patient.my friend had stumbled upon this weeks before and had been raving for weeks about how good the dumplings were.entree portions come in large numbers (15+), and unfortunately you cannot mix and match.my asian friends wanted to try this place.everything we had was delicious.definitely a must try here.the staff was very helpful and the food was true to its authentic taste and flavors.instead of going in the chinatown strip it is located outside the strip where you can see the train station across the street.as soon as we sat down, we ordered two dumplings (lamb and coriander, and pork with cabbage), as well as kimchi, lamb skewers (just like i remember in china), and green tea to share.my friend and i ordered the beef coriander, pork and leek, a shrimp one.and there&#39;s free wi-fi since reception is shoddy in the basement.my only dislikes, we also got chicken heart and gizzard skewers - both came out cold, chewy and completely unappetizing (mind you, i&#39;ve had both of these parts before deliciously prepared, so it wasn&#39;t an eating weird organs issue).all of the dumplings were so good! the skins were very thin where you could see peeks of the fillings, the ingredients used were very fresh, they all came out piping hot, and there was a little bit of broth inside the dumplings which reminded me of soup dumplings (xiao long bao).if you don&#39;t want to eat the entire thing in one bite, beware! the juices will squirt out and possibly into someone&#39;s eye!we ordered the beef / coriander (chinese cilantro), beef / onion, and pork / shrimp.and, the price was so reasonable..we got their recommended dumplings; the pork and pickled chinese cabbage and leek, egg and shrimp.overall a great experience!..the lamb and beef skewers tasted good, however the dumplings were better when they still in food court.the skin of the dumplings no longer have the stretchy good bite to it that i liked.however, as much as i wanted to give it 5 stars, the filling flavor was not 100% there for me.dumplings: 5 stars.while everything i tried was delicious, i cannot get over almost slicing the inside of my mouth open on a piece of plasitc.as we were waiting another 10 minutes for the check, people began to wait for seating by the door.the waiter apologized profusely for the long delays, but given the lack of value and the truly horrible dining experience i sadly have to give a 1*, which i do not like doing.this was a supreme disappointment and i still cannot reconcile how a place with such amazing handmade dumplings could bring themselves to send something that ridiculous out of the kitchen.the service was really good, i got attention right away."
nana-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/nana-chicago,2,"Our waitress was too friendly patting me on the back and touching my shoulders.our food was wonderful,  i recommend everyone stop in for lunch or just a drink.love love love this place! great food and service.the food was outstanding.i don&#39;t even like pork that much and it was so damn good.so if they want my juevos rancheros business, they better open up a little earlier.wonderful bacon.local ingredients, farm fresh food with lots of flavor.located in hipster bridgeport, nana&#39;s offers &#34;farm to table&#34; dishes.the ingredients are high quality and always fresh, but nothing stands out as special.worse service i have ever received.we shared the avocado fries, and it was my first time having this appetizer.it has a contemporary modern flare to it.nana is another restaurant that i want to eat at more than once a month:  the food is incredibly fresh.she had empanadas and i ordered the veggie burger which came with a garlic aioli and a creamy sauce.the beermosa was very light and easy to drink.busy brunch at 11 am this morning.i even finished off the greens and they are not something i normally order or enjoy.one of my favorite breakfast spots in bridgeport.bridgeport staple.&#34; thanks for the advice, buddy.it is great, the only problem i have with it is that there&#39;s not a lot on the menu and the items are a bit pricey....i won&#39;t be going back..staff has always been very friendly everytime i&#39;ve come here.i had no idea what i was in for.the only thing that bothers me is that it is a tad pricey with smaller portions, but that is expected with these brunch places.i really think nana&#39;s could be one of the best, especially for bridgeport.i came to nana with a friend after she reccommended it for lunch..i came back several times but recently i have been left with a not so great experience.we were going to order empanadas, but she informed us they were sold out.they should call this nana&#39;s house of salt.anytime chorizo is involved, i expect a lot of flavor, and i thought the pupusa would only add to the flavor aspect and give the dish a different texture component as well.cheers!.it was something about the taste..love the food, love the service.we ordered nanadict and american breakfast, they both were tasteless.it was a pleasure to meet him and i know i&#39;ll definitely be back when i&#39;m in the neighborhood!..i had the kale salad in the first time , you won&#39;t be disappointed i guarantee.the oysters were a tad bit rubbery and the remoulade sauce was bland.it&#39;s been open for a few years so i thought i should try it.the avocado fries - so good! i also tried the garden omelet and it was very delicious.i got the nanadict which was highly recommended but i thought it was okay.be aware the entree options for gluten free are very limited especially between breakfast and dinner window (about 3 hours): five pretty basic sandwiches made on lettuce.my friend also loved her chicken sandwich.you know, us: people with an infant.the restaurant had beautiful artwork decorating the walls, and the servers were wonderful.i love nana! this has certainly become my favorite brunch spot here in chicago and one that i enjoy taking visitors to try.and they open at 10 am for breakfast a little too late for breakfast place.regardless the place is always booming and food &amp; drinks are spectacular.it&#39;s delicious mexican breakfast with a poppin patio and all for a fair price.i do love the decor in here..but we were delighted by the shrimp po boy and mac n cheese.good assortment of beers and a great-tasting bloody mary.love the vibe of their place but their staff doesn&#39;t always pay attention which is a bummer.(and i love avocados)  but i didn&#39;t enjoy them all that much."

la-sirena-clandestina-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-sirena-clandestina-chicago,2,"Our server coursed the meal for us as well.she insisted that our dishes were coming out but we were over it.best best best best best best experience ever! server was spot on and professional, food was to die for, ambiance was exceptional and the icing on the cake was my lovely drink that my server recommended.the ambiance - okthe food - okthe service - okthe ceviche is not that good especially after having ceviche in peru and other parts of south america.a lot of the stuff they have is tapas sized...the presentation in the martini cup is cute, but not exactly practical for mixing the ceviche with the guacamole! the house-made crackers had a nice salty pastry flavor, so you don&#39;t have to worry about eating the ceviche with some cheap store-bought saltines.i&#39;d rather have this than a cheeseburger.incredible food and great service - highly recommend!! our server was great, incredibly personable and made stellar recommendations for food as well as cocktails..although the preparation was perfect (especially the terrine part), we expected a lamb entree and pretty much got an appetizer.the cocktails and service were pretty good too.the empanadas were just okay..service was on point, from making and changing our reservation, to our wonderful server.we will be back!.on the bright side, k enjoyed his steak and eggs but then again he&#39;s easier to please than i am (i promise i&#39;m really not that difficult!).i don&#39;t know that it would be good as just an entree on its own though as in that form it might be kind of boring.not as busy as the other highly touted establishments.great food!! every dish we tried was full of flavor, the exact amount of spices and herbs, not too overwhelming but definitely edgy.in a brazilian restaurant, therefore, naturally i had to start off with a capirina drink which was perfectly delicious.we ended up ordering one of each when my other friend and i gave her a death look.coming back while in chicago.we stopped in here for cocktails and empanadas one afternoon.my glass was never empty and there was always food on the table.that only begins to desribe the wine, as it was chameleonlike throughout the meal.the mousse was amazing but the donut was dry and lacked the flavor i was looking for.i pointed this out the manager, you could clearly see that the empanadas was stuffed with nothing but beans..the grilled hanger steak was too tough-- very hard to chew through tendons.service was attentive and excellent and the pace of the meal was leisurely and relaxed, as it should be on a warm summer evening.regarding ambiance, it&#39;s a narrow room with high tin ceilings and exposed ducts, so the crowd noise is awful -- way conversation-challenged.was really looking forward to this dinner - bummed it was a major letdown! we made open table reservations and are glad we did - the place is really small with only a few tables which are really close together.fresh food, consistent service all delivered within a cozy atmosphere.the drinks are amazing.we ordered a ceviche, hangar steak and moqueca.the pork shank was amazing! the empanadas were beyond good! also , the polenta - wow! ended the night with a $2 cookie on their dessert menu- do not leave without the cookie.la sirena clandestina was wonderful.it was divine!this chef is clearly a genius.the food was great! we had the kale salad, the empanadas of the day, the flank steak, the rice and beans, and the rabbit, all of which were great.it&#39;s more like a warm pillow of baked dough filled with a soft gooey cheese.i think the portions could be tweaked  or, alternatively, perhaps arrange the menu from smaller plates to larger so people know what to expect size-wise.i&#39;ll be back, let&#39;s just hope i can make a reservation.we had a group of five for dinner with reservations on friday.friendly and knowledgeable staff, nice environment and one of the best kale salads i&#39;ve ever had..i had some pork beef rice and beans concoction, which really was not too satisfying..it was 9 ladies, the birthday girl brought her boyfriend.we went here for dinner on a wednesday night and had a 6pm reservation.we were very satisfied with our meal.it&#39;s a go-to lunch spot when i have colleagues in from out of town.but they give you what you pay for.we enjoyed a very good brazilian bowl with avocado and cuban sandwich with salad that also was first rate..the fried cauliflower is melt in your mouth delicious and very lemony, and a must have off the menu.the kitchen aroma is wonderful.we recently returned from a trip to south america and wanted to try chicago&#39;s version.the flavour is also greatwe ordered the moqueca (the clam and shrimp stew) and the hanger steak.i went to the bar and got my check.our amazing waiter who&#39;s name escapes me (he was a tall dude in a black shirt with giant glittery wings on the back)  knew his wine and his suggestions were excellent.in 2016 i want to frequent restaurants within walking distance from my house more often.we had a business meeting at the sand box down the block from this restaurant and walked by on our way to the meeting.i was a bit disappointed with my experience because i&#39;d heard such great things.nice and dark little gem.i came here with a friend from italy who had never had south american food before.amazing ambiance.food to die for.empanads, always baked, were tasty.i would just mention though that the acoustics are a little wild, i could barely here moms and she was right next to me.i&#39;ll warn you we shared, but the size is more for one person.the space is cozy, intimate, and full of rustic charm (without looking like a pinterest board gone wrong).the wait time was short, given that we went for lunch.the rating is based on the overall experience.great date restaurant! portions were perfect for sharing."
briciola-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/briciola-chicago,1,"I will definitely come back.will definitely be back again soon :).i worked as a hostess in college, and this experience was just very strange to me.my date had been here many times and could not believe how awful the experience was.great!! the food is delicious as is the service.the patio is beautiful!  it feels so nice to sit outside here..service is amazing.the quality of the steak was also extremely disappointing.a last minute trip to chicago for halloween meant that i got to see some of my besties and got really good food! my native chicago friends had not been here before and wanted to check it out.not sloppy italian but clean execution with the right size portions.the summer is great at this place given that you can sit outside on the patio! it is all lit up in lighting!i think this is truly one of the greatest italian restaurants in chicago!.i had the salmon which was overcooked, my date the halibut..you definitely get what you pay for at this restaurant.worth a visit!..would not recommend.lastly, the tiramisu.entrees-take me back!  we had the bolognese pasta, potato crusted salmon, porkchop with arugula and spicy seafood pasta.had a wonderful dinner here on saturday night--delicious, authentic food and great experience! we ate grilled calamari, octopus, squid ink linguine with lobster and scallops, duck risotto, and the chocolate souffle for dessert.we were all very impressed!  i received a thank you card from my dad a few days later which has never happened :-)we were seated outside which is one of their highlights.one of the best meals i&#39;ve ever had! thanks briciola!.i have found the food to be generally good, but not always consistent.the veal was lacking any robust flavors and once again, the sauce was just ok.loved it.seriously, you won&#39;t be disappointed.the pork chop was huge.cute little italian restaurant, with a backyard that i really wanted to dine in, but didn&#39;t want to wait on a saturday night..they were able to accommodate us at 8! the waitstaff was great and very knowledgeable.all of it was outstanding and everyone enjoyed it.they brought us free bruschetta (bomb) soon after sitting down, and then we ordered:appetizer:calamari alla griglia- i personally didn&#39;t eat this, but everyone was a fan and the dish was gone within minutesmain dishes:risotto of the day - it was a lamb risotto the night we went, and the lamb was very flavorful! the risotto was also good- i&#39;ve had better but i would order it again.i highly recommend coming here!.great date night atmosphere with cozy tables and low lighting.i suspected it was to camouflage the canned vegetables.i had the mussels they were great the sauce was well balanced and not overbearing.the food, the service, the ambiance.but we are married with two kids and when we want to go on a dinner date, the food better be damn good.the waitstaff will recite each dish orally at table side for what seems like an eternity, and then you&#39;ll just have to rely on either your acute elephant memory or a game of 20 questions to figure out if your actually interested or not..we never saw our waiter after we ordered.aside from the huge plus of the byob ($3-4 corking fee), they also had solid italian food.the food here is amazing and being byob saves you some bucks that you can put towards splurging on more food.and the homemade pasta with it = heaven.we left satisfied and happy.the tree covered outdoor space is sprinkled with string lights and is absolutely charming.entree i got the tagliatelle with bolognese.i had the rollata di pollo, which was really good.this place had amazing food (squid ink pasta w/ seafood &amp; a lobster ravioli in a champagne cream sauce), very friendly staff and the place gave me that homey vibe of a neighborhood restaurant back in italy.the rabbit in the risotto was not gamey but very tender.also loved the bruschetta on the house, such a nice touch.it&#39;s a good neighborhood spot but the food just didn&#39;t have that wow factor.mario, the chef/owner oversees every detail of the food before it&#39;s delivered to the table.i had the &#34;tortellini al burro fuso&#34;, one of the best things i&#39;ve ever ordered at an italian restaurant.why 4 stars? there&#39;s a $4 corkage fee which is stated in the menu.came here from los angeles and dined on 9/1/15.i would definitely have either of those 3 dishes again.service was close to non-existent..my $18 spaghetti with meat sauce was about as tasty as my elementary school&#39;s cafeteria spaghetti.best advice make reservations days ahead of time, oh and they are closed monday&#39;s.super good! cute and intimate feeling restaurant.not sure if i would go back.it was already after 7pm on a festive saturday night, we were speeding up halsted street from bridgeport contemplating where we could take a bottle of wine and still get in.went here a few years back for some byob and italian food.that, ladies and gents, is how i enjoyed briciola and their delicious food! i couldn&#39;t have asked for a better birthday dinner with the girls.."

 i had to ask for a glass of ice.what a charming, authentic italian restaurante! we walked in without a reservation and were warmly greeted and welcomed.( his reply )  was extremely loud and obnoxious and told us we would not be seated  until the entire party was present and accounted for.alas, it was a work lunch so no wine for me.there was so much seafood in that dish it seems it is more like a dish for 5!! ended our evening with the very best tiramisu in the world!! yes, i am the tiramisu expert and rosebuds is truly mouth watering amazingly delicious.we had had a long day at the hospital, exhausted and starving we decided to finally jump out of highway traffic to grab some food.zuppe del marecaprese saladnice wine listand fabulous cannolis..homemade caesar- no bottled dressing, fresh anchovies.big portions that&#39;s what i&#39;ll start out to say here tried it here for the first time yesterday can&#39;t believe i took this long to go there, service was really good, had a good bottle of wine to start with being a italian restaurant there is a big wine menu, had a chopped salad for appetizer very, very yummy, then for my main course fred flinstone pork chops! i willed myself to eat these bad boys they were so big, very tasty breaded served with potatoes and green beans, my wife ordered fruiti de mare basically a seafood pasta, this was also fred flinstone size and had to bring the rest home for our son, everyone else&#39;s dish i noticed was huge as well, pretty pricey though be prepared to spend some dough especially if you order wine and appetizers.just be warned that the potions are huge!  i was craving risotto and didn&#39;t see any on the menu but the chef accommodated with something that was just a mermaid short of the ocean&#39;s entire bounty.huge portions..me and my girlfriend ate at the rosebud on taylor street in chicago on september 25th of 2015 we had a waitress named amy.sheltered here with some friends for a late lunch during a blustery snowstorm one recent saturday afternoon..great italian music too!.1.altogether, two plates, no drinks, no appetizers came out to $60 for two people...will visit again pronto.overall great experience.now there are others that are a little more glamorous like rpm italian but nobody has great food and service like rosebud.thank you for the enjoyable experience for me and my co-workers.must try the chicken parm.rosebud provides warm bread-focaccia and crusty italian-with olive oil and grated cheese.i would live on their stuffed mushrooms if i could! i came here for my birthday and the server was super friendly! he came out and sang me &#34;happy birthday&#34; with the most delicious oreo dessert.food was adequate.it wasn&#39;t very appetizing in presentation either.great service, awesome food, and large portions.both entrees were delicious, but the side of mixed vegetables were amazing with roasted garlic, it was worth the $9 dollars.i love this place! my family and i have been coming here for years.he said bring it back with the receipt, i did.i ate most of it but i had a good 3/4 of a meatball and some spaghetti left over..there was a little too much meat for her taste in her spaghetti but she still thought it was delicious.it was good but not amazing like the rest of the meal.pasta: linguine &amp; clamsseabass with spinach --- special, not on the menuwine - i trusted the waiter and did not regret - except that i cannot recall what he selected.likewise, the ziti was fantastic.the service was fair (we were never told of the specials, which sounded great as we eavesdropped on another server at another table, and the bread was delivered late and slightly cool).we all had the caesar salad, this is the best caesar salad i have ever had!had the bone in ribeye with the peppers (pizzaiollo style) and it was great.shrimp were tender and lightly breaded..drinks didn&#39;t get refilled, some drinks were forgotten, we had to ask for butter for the bread and it came a half hour later.i also had the crab stuffed white fish, it was amazing!!  the vodka sauce was really good too! the service was great..i had the penne with their bolognese sauce which has always been a favorite.we ordered the bruschetta appetizer ($9)."
