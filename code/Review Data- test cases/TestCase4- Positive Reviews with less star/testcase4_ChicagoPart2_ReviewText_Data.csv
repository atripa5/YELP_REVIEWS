blackwood-bbq-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blackwood-bbq-chicago-4,2,"Positives:delicious brisket and the ability to choose lean, normal or fatty is great.So good!! also got the brisket chili.The only downfall about the place is there is absolutely no parking.When you pick out your meat you also pick out a sauce- they have a north carolina, south carolina, kansas, a couple others, and then a mustard sauce.Last, but definitely not least, the cornbread.Backwoods  breakfast is amazing!!!!! i wish that i could  have breakfast there every morning.Awesome place for lunch! i would have asked for extra sauce on the side if possible.There is nothing here to blow anyone's mind, but for a quick lunch option, it is about as good as it gets for me.South carolina had too much mustard for me its the only one i dont really care for.I had a sandwich with kansas city bbq.."
home-style-taste-chinese-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/home-style-taste-chinese-chicago,2,"Forget chinatown! head to this place! i've been to the country of china and this seriously competes with the food i had there..I chose the veggie medley (sautéed eggplants, green peppers, and potatoes), beef with basil, shrimp and chive dumplings, and crispy chicken and eggplants.One plate will easily feed 2 adults.They also don't speak very good english, i asked about certain dishes and they couldn't give me any answers about how it was prepared or the components.The menu is pretty large and i'd suggest you stick away from the recognizable americanized items.Oh, my god.Definitely this place will become my 'personal canteen' lol i love the beef pancake.But now, i and my fiancee would both adamantly say that home style taste is probable the best chinese restaurant in chicago.Only wish they had  used less salt!next time we'd definitely try some of their northern chinese style boa, scallion cake, etc.."

wasabi-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wasabi-chicago,2,"I thought the service was pretty good, and there was an extensive amount of choices on the menu.I would understand if there was no tables available or even no standing room but the restaurant was empty and clearly able for us to stand and wait for the remaining party.On my first visit, i wasn't very keen on the tonkatsu and thought the shoyu was actually better.I'd say the soup base was satisfactory, but nothing compared to the ramen shops in tokyo.The pork belly is so so, lots of veggies (i like healthier options).That's really the only way i can describe it.Just like everywhere else, there is usually a line, but if you catch them right when they open for dinner or near closing time, the wait isn't long.My favorite ramen house thus far making it hard for me to digest knowing i'm from out of town! it's byob of beer, wine or sake so be prepared!order the ramen bowl, all are great but the house signature special tonkotsu was creamy and amazing!great atmosphere, cozy and a casual local hang out spot.It is a long process - it takes up to 45 hours and requires special attention'.Overall, everything is great.."

quartino-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/quartino-chicago,1,"I couldn't really remember the other types of salumi and formaggi that we chose, but overall it wasn't memorable.Tortellini in alfredo with peas and prosciutto - good amount of prosciutto to provide the right amount of saltiness for the dish.The pizza was perfectly cooked- had a great crust and the cheese was ooey gooey perfection!the tortellini was on a bed of thinly sliced prosciutto that just melted in my mouth! the house-made pasta itself had a great bite and the cream sauce was perfectly seasoned.Had the parpadelle, which was too salty and missing the satisfying meatiness (that's what she said) of the ragu.The lamb dish that j and i had was phenomenal, pizzas were unbelievable, i do remember us having too much bread  and wine at one point.No bueno.I typically do not write reviews good or bad, but in this instance i wanted to give a shout out to the gentleman who was the bathroom attendant last night.Star granted.Four clams in the shell plus lots of chunks of clam flesh; slices of red pepper and garlic.So, putting aside what was probably an off day, i look forward to going back and trying more plates and exploring their wine list, and would still recommend quartino to other people.."
