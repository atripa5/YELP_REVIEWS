glenns-diner-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/glenns-diner-chicago,1,"Yum!got there at 9:15 one saturday night, there was a table open for us....for dessert we shared bananas foster, which my friend was excited because apparently it&#39;s a hard dessert to find in chicago (or so he says)..i don&#39;t remember what i had the first time around, but i remember it being good.i have not been disappointed yet.of course, having polish genes make me hypercritical to such offerings..i am talking about groan worthy delicious.in the future, i will ask for only 2 because by the time i got the the 3rd leg, it was pretty cooled down.it came up on yelp as a seafood restaurant, but we just couldn&#39;t figure out how they could exist in a diner..euroatheart.i will most def come another tuesday.so don&#39;t call at 530 looking for a 7.here&#39;s an idea.the lobster filling was a joke, all celery with some cucumbers (i think), and lots of mayo.yum!.staff was very helpful.we also got mac and cheese..love breakfast here!  big fan of the dad&#39;s french toast and the egg sandwich..yeah baby!  if you&#39;ve never had sturgeon before (i don&#39;t remember ever seeing it offered anyplace else) order it, you won&#39;t be sorry.well, i smiled.great atmosphere.was pretty damn good...for what we spent verses what we got, it was just a little disappointing..whatever.it is so tasty on its own!phil had the shrimp po&#39;boy, yum yum yum! the roll it was on tasted like it was baked fresh that day, the shrimp were lightly battered and the spices were on point.i have a feeling it&#39;ll be delightful!..i enjoyed my visit here.the seating is a little tight inside, there are also a few tables outside as well if you like the sunshine.that was fine.the servers were super cute hipster dudes, so i might go back just for them ;).my partner ordered the crabby burger and she absolutely loved it.went for the ayce king crab on tue.same with the fish in the cioppino.not the food preparation, they are on top of things, but the actual table service.the smoked trout hash and eggs is one of the best things i&#39;ve eaten in a while.we were greeted so warmly and people really actually seemed to like to be there.it is located next to the cta brown line&#39;s montrose train station.their food just didn&#39;t hit the spot.well it was more potatoes than corned beef.if it were anywhere but a diner, that would be fine.took them  hour and a half to figure out that my salad and fish grill taking too long.i got the crab legs, which come with cole slaw and corn on the cob.also gotta mention the giant ass bloody mary, amazingggg.it&#39;s called a diner, but more like a restaurant or a high class diner.in any case, this little unassuming,  cozy place  on a friday eve peak dinner time was packed, but we didn&#39;t wait too long maybe 30 min and were seated at the bar.i wanted coleslaw with it, but of course they were out of coleslaw so i settled for fruit.service was friendly..the only thing i would suggest if you&#39;ve never been there is to try to get there early before dinner if you don&#39;t want to make a reservation.i would eat here every night if i could.ordered fish with &#34;key lime&#34;  which was really slice of  lemon and &#34;honey butter&#34; which was just regular butter.i will be rooting for them.we got seated on the later side and had to wait awhile maybe crabs were not cooked properly.ben (a great waiter there) suggested it as i spoke about my love for shrimp and salmon.i made a reservation for saturday night for 8:30 since i figured it was going to be busy.we have been going to glenn&#39;s for years, and this is the first bad experience i have had.food is fantastic - we&#39;ve sampled just about all the appetizers (calamari is to die for) and thoroughly enjoyed them all.my mom and one of my best friends couldn&#39;t stop raving about this place.favorite brunch place!! my boyfriend love to try new places but we usually find ourselves here once a month.it was obviously busy that sunday."
thai-bowl-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-bowl-chicago,1,"Taylor street may be known for italian food, but when i&#39;m in the area, i stop here.the tom yum could use a little work as well.tasteless food..i would not make the special trip from the burbs just for this place..the food is just kind of smelly.i would only order from here if i&#39;m really craving pad thai since it&#39;s down the street from my apartment.it&#39;s perfect hangover food - especially the tom yum.third, spicy basil leaves should have a certain amount of a liquid-y chili broth swimming around, not this one.the service is sometimes choppy here as they don&#39;t speak very good english, but other than that this place is great.the prices were kind of up there, $4..it was difficult for me to savor or recognize the tamarind flavor in my pad thai because i could literally feel my blood pressure rising with every bite (needless to say i couldn&#39;t finish that meal)..am never looking forward to rudeness from the one who takes the order.she should have notified me before i placed an order.if you&#39;re a kind of person who goes to asian restaurants just to eat crab rangoons (like me! lol) this is not the place!.all in all this a nice, quite little restaurant on taylor street right by uic, and i&#39;d recommend it if you&#39;re looking for a quick carryout thai food!.had the steak salad.thipi thai is way better!.i thought i was going to puke.the little outside area is very pretty when the weather is nice.the pad woonsen was always my favorite dish and the crab rangoon is just incredible.delicious food, cheap and friendly workers.i waited 30 mins for them to get my order.i give them 5 stars for the thai dishes i love.that was the last time.the jade noodles with chicken are soooo good! i&#39;m typically picky with thai food but this place is really yummy and satisfying...50.they gave me a substitute dish which was pad thai, it was just ok, it wasn&#39;t flavorful.probably the best around the uic area.large portions for under $10 plus they will honor your uic card for a discount woo! the rice is unique to this place - some kind of special blend of spices make it like no other fried rice and the pad thai is one of the better ones i&#39;ve tried no matter what meat you choose."
harvest-moon-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/harvest-moon-chicago-2,1,"There are 4 equally difficult decisions to make here; the homemade macaroon was the winner for me..everything was better than good.i went here with my boyfriend for dinner and we ordered the steak, scallops and salad.however, they had a bunch of options for her to choose from which was great!we split the quail appetizer which was similar to chicken wing size and super flavorful! my friend got the flank steak and really enjoyed it.live bands friday and saturday night..tried the burger and flank steak.if you can&#39;t get brunch right there doesn&#39;t seem to be a bright future of longevity here.people don&#39;t want excuses, we just want good food.i had the grass fed flank steak entree which was amazing!!!! i was told they recently started having live music on the weekends.all tasted fine, but nothing amazing.at best order in for delivery on a week night and add your own seasoning to the food.this may be understandable on a busy night, but this was a tuesday evening, and the place was half full."
spacca-napoli-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/spacca-napoli-chicago,2,"I gobbled down the end crust, even though that is the filling part.in the end, we ordered one prosciutto pizza and one of the special pizzas.and we all know that&#39;s 4 glasses approx.so i had to hide it in my purse, which i didn&#39;t think was necessary.equally great is the food.if you want to save money and eat regular old pizza, order dominoes.well.great place with fantastic pizza.great place!.their burrata.my boyfriend unknowingly ordered a sauceless pizza even though the waitress gave us a heads up about it when introducing herself..that wood burning taste is irresistible and the fact that it is thin and light allows me to happily overindulge.all were excellent, and enough to share with the table so everyone got to try.the service is pretty good, the food is pretty good, it has a nice ambiance, put it all together and it should make for a pretty good restaurant but every time i&#39;ve left this place i&#39;ve had to try to convince myself that it was worth it and that i&#39;m not still hungry but the truth is it just is t worth it and i always do leave thinking about what else i&#39;m going to eat.better atmosphere here, but somewhat more consistency at da nella.you will not regret it!!.a lot of places can make a pizza with red sauce, cheese, and pepperoni, but to make a delicious pie with with such non-traditional pizza ingredients definitely showed a glimpse of spacca&#39;s inventiveness.pizzas were outstanding, as was the burrata appetizer they were offering as a special.spacca napoli is not about gobs of cheese and loads of sauce with everything on their pizza.this place makes everyone in my family happy- kids, grandparents, husband and myself.make sure to keep the pizza cutter on your side if the table so you can threaten to cut whoever is trying to grab the last slice..been here a couple of times, sampled a few regular pizzas, some of their starters, and some special star-shaped pizzas they had while a napoli chef was in residence.the one we ate there was delicious..margherita: a classic that nobody else in the city does as well as this.great pizza place!!! a bit too expensive for what it is ( pizzas and pastas), but excellent food,good wines, good service.also, the other dishes besides pizza on the menu looked great--i&#39;d love to come back again and try them!it was really nice to come here, relax, people-watch (lots of dates going on!), eat some well-made pizza, and enjoy a cup of coffee afterwards.really good quality ingredients.so anyways went out with friends to spacca napoli.always great service.as good as neapolitan pizza gets.atmosphere: 9/10service: 10/10food: 9/10.the individual ingredients were fine but it had way too much going on (i wound up eating off half the toppings and then trying again, that worked pretty well).i can&#39;t even imagine how busy this place gets at dinner time and weekends; there are plenty of tables! that brick oven must really pull its weight!the prosciutto and bufala appetizer practically called my name though i wish burrata was available.service is fast and friendly..i would definitely say one of the better pizza places i&#39;ve been to.would go back in a heartbeat.better than coal fire, which is much closer to me...my cousin and i came here, as we had heard that this place was a local favorite for authentic brick oven pizza.scott was a pleasure to work with while planning our party.our server sochi was incredible, friendly, attentive and knowledgeable!.after like ten visits i figured it was time to hop on yelp and let the world know how amazing spacca napoli is!burrata.simple but delicious! service &amp; the patio dining were superb as well..first time here.moving to the area and had to try this place after the rave reviews and driving past it a few times.have to let it sit a minute though, because of the very thin crust and the toppings not completely set when hot.prices are a bit upscale but the quality of the ingredients justify the price.pizza is always delicious, no matter which one you get.the soup and salad are ehbut the burrata is a must order! they only have it certain days so call ahead to make sure!!the pizza is delicious!.great pizza and service.the hostess was very rude not a good welcome ( first time to this restaurant  )also the manager it was sarcastic when i asked for a quit cornerrestaurant supposed to be a relaxing and get away place.the real buffalo mozzarella is to die for and octopus app is the best!! keep doin what your doin&#39;!.we ordered 4 different glasses of white wine , they were all sour tasting.they serve top-tier neapolitan pizza here.the pizzas are the stars here and they certainly did not disappoint tonight.our family equates chicago deep dish with casserole.don&#39;t forget to grab a free piece of cannoli on your way out.they have interesting mixtures that can satisfy just about anyone.i&#39;m a big fan of thin crust pizza and this place does not disappoint.the burrata appetizer special comes with an awe-inspiring ball of cheese, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with coarse salt.after working at eataly chicago&#39;s pizza pasta, the bar was set pretty high for how my experience eating here would compare.i love chowy dough...the charbroiled baby octopus starter was on point.i love going to this place.thin, but with a nice raised soft crust.boss jonathan has the sensitivity, the focus and the direct experience to deliver the best italian pizza you can dream of in chicagoland.waited 25 minutes for a pickup order (after it appeared my order did not go in) with half the pizza missing cheese, scarce meat and both pizzas cut in a combination of tiny and oversize pieces.best authentic italian pizza in chicago! my all time favorite is the margherita.don&#39;t feel like i should call a crane machine to pick me up from my table and drop me off at my bedroom.i&#39;m sure there must be a prize!  pizza for a year is my wish."

blackies-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blackies-chicago-4,1,"We went last night, because we wanted to try some of the new menu items, and glad we did! we had the pulled pork &amp; polenta, the 5 cheese truffle mac (love that they use ditalini pasta), and the three cheese tortelloni.the bloody mary itself needed some serious doctoring up though.the beer prices are good though.just had a lunch with my business partner here.yum! outside seating, food was awesome.cheap wholesale.blackie&#39;s went out of their way to correct an incident i had with them.waited 25 minuets after being seated and never had a server come up to take drink orders.oh, make sure you stop into their restrooms.also forgot the diet coke i asked for.definitely recommend.now that it&#39;s just like every other restaurant out there, we find ourselves trying other places far more often...she finally went up to the bar to ask for a refill..there&#39;s lots of vegetables and they taste so fresh! you have try portabella burger even you are not a vegetarian.they have quite a few craft beers.under or improperly staffed.just moved down the block and decided to try blackie&#39;s.this is the type of place you can sit at the bar and not worry about anything.looking forward to trying it out again!.at night their drinks are delicious and they have a great many options for martinis for a reasonable price.i&#39;m a fan of blackie&#39;s.breakfast/brunch is my thing.i had the salmon and it was just ok..an old bar..blackies was right near her apartment.take the criticism and improve upon it.this is easily one of the best places for food and drink in the south loop, and one of the best patios in the city.even though i express my concern with owner i feel like i have lost a great spot and i should know that things are not for ever but my favorite angus burger it&#39;s gone.the atmosphere is excellent, the menu is outstanding (try the salmon sandwich), and the bar is sexy as all hell.$20 minimum bar tab was an annoyance.i&#39;ve only been here and had burgers and the chili which are both outstanding.great classic neighborhood spot.the patio faces south so it really nice to have the sun warming you the whole time.blackie burger was also excellent.nope..i personally love organic produce, which is always hard to find when your eating out and on a budget.if i would suggest anything, however, go on a sunday for their brunch.and i won&#39;t recomend them anymore!.good overall bar for a beer or two..part of the charm of this place was that it served good food without any frills.but it&#39;s definitely not family friendly atmosphere; not definitely if u have kids."
calumet-fisheries-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/calumet-fisheries-chicago-4,2,"Eat at you own risk!!!...delectable and delightful and easy.@annie n.definitely going back again to try to trout and fried oysters.shrimp is delicious - no condiments needed -at least for me.the fried oysters were to die for and so crispy yet juicey.that 70-year-old smoker really is an excellent machine to deliver such aromatic smoke on these jumbo shrimps..my brother likes slaw and wasn&#39;t impressed by theirs.this place is definitely a experience to have in a life time..smoked fish (smoked on the premises), who even does that any more? don&#39;t miss this place! i heard they use natural wood and no artifical flavoring.boy, we were in for a treat! one of the guys (regret not asking his name) explained the sections of the salmon that taste best.my only issue with them is they don&#39;t accept credit cards and they have an atm machine (strongly advise not using because the owners of the atm will assess a fee and you&#39;ll get charged by you bank also for using the machine).the fried shrimp was forgettable, and the fried smelts were okay - the batter was more like ground cornmeal-like, rather than the crispy batter i was expecting.the fried shimps are to die for...this place was definitely not worth the trip.they used to have a medium but got rid of it years ago.nice location too, something about the bridge, the tracks, the elevated freeway, the train drawbridge, the old industrial silos, is kind of romantic.go now and try it all.i can&#39;t fully recommend the fish dinner as it&#39;s not the salmon and the price was high for what it was.the fried catfish was pretty great, especially with some mild bbq sauce.we seen this place on anthony bourdain&#39;s show and decided it was time.despite the other raving reviews, i would not recommend or go back..smoked shrimp (10/10) - large shrimp, smoked perfectly with so much flavorsmoked salmon (10/10) - nicely cut, smoked the same way as the shrimpfried oysters (6/10) - i&#39;m not a fan of the texture of fried oysters so this may not be completely accurate but i didn&#39;t feel like their fried oysters tasted any different from ones i&#39;ve had in the pastfried shrimp (8/10) - if you&#39;re not a fan of smoked foods, then i would recommend to go with the fried shrimp, medium/large shrimp, fry batter was nice and crispy**they will give tartar sauce and cocktail sauce with your order.would go back to try the smoked shrimp.i went out with friends on a bike ride from downtown chicago.i am just amazed.definetely worth it!!!!! as i waited on my order to be ready i was looking at the rest of their menu.fries were just ok.i did not order shellfish, but my order came in contact with something that touched shellfish.there&#39;s probably a reason that&#39;s the main thing i recall really liking here, and that the rest of what i ordered was good to not bad, but not sure if i&#39;d say go out of your way unless you&#39;re on the south side.ps...but we loved what we ordered:fried scallops - the best and really hearty piecescalamari - delicioussmoked salmon with garlic and peppers - great flavorfried oysters - good to try but probably sticking with cold oysters.the big thing was just committing to make the drive here, but once i got in, i could see why the reviews here are so great..of the fried things, i think my favorite were the smelts.we also got a tour of the smoke house.or troha&#39;s.some was edible, other parts were mushy and i had to spit out.it would have been nice to have a place to enjoy our meal without harassment.so glad we did.it is a little pricy but the quality merits the price.although, my favorite is always the fried shrimp with two mild sauces.i have visited this place countless times and i was always the fried shrimp girl but i ventured into the smoked fish and shrimp and there is just no going back.anthony bourdain&#39;s show about chicago prompted my interest in calumet fisheries.i..the smoked salmon is good.on my daily commute back home, i&#39;m always tempted to make a quick pit stop by the fisheries and make use of the emergency stash of cash i keep in my car for this purpose alone.take out only.the full order of fries shrimp was on point..it is cash only, so come prepared..but for the money, i can do way better at home and save by shopping at costco.great fried seafood in a family run spot.service is quick and food is always freshly hot.i watched anthony bourdain chow down on some seafood here and then found myself in chicago for a wedding a couple of weeks later.got it? good.highly recommended!..tried the smoked shrimp, &amp; i loved it!! :) i cannot wait to come back and try the smoked salmon and lake perch!  everyone should check calumet fisheries out.i tried the following:fry fish - i&#39;m not sure what kind of fish, but $7 got me a pretty good amount of fried fish pieces and they were pretty good."
blackwood-bbq-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blackwood-bbq-chicago-5,2,"No ribs (though it looked like they were running them as a special on a different night than when i visited) or hot links.enjoyed all of it including ambience, will return.the good: great sauces and the meat was tasty.the alabama pulled chicken is another favorite.the platter came with 1/2 lb of freshly sliced beef plus homemade pickles and a side.the service and food here is unmatched!  you&#39;d have to be in nashville to find better..98.the quality of the meat was, for the price point average or above.it was a pleasure to come to blackwood at the end of a long work day!.mac n cheese side was small.the brisket was great and tender.its kind of like fast food for bbq, however for a similar cost you could get so much better at an actual bbq restaurant.kenneth hooked it up, making sure we had everything we needed.the sweet tea is perfect, not too sweet.obviously, this isn&#39;t a problem that anyone would encounter in-store because they have the sauces for you at the table, but it was a huge let down for my delivery experience.as if reading my mind, the exceptionally friendly salad maker asked, &#39;what toppings would you like?&#39;  i peeked past the glass and saw awesomeness.the staff seemed overwhelmed when there were 3 customers at the counter.the set up of this place is like a quick lunch spot but the price does not match that...also got the mac and cheese and feel like i could eat it every day.one tasted like tabasco sauce and the other was just as watery..why is the mac n cheese so good? blackwood bbq uses extra sharp white &amp; yellow cheddar plus aged gruyere and then top it with a perfectly cooked panko crust.great little place to grab some grub.i really liked my pulled pork salad with ranch dressing, and the 2 meat platter-beef brisket, pulled chicken with side of pickles, choice of side (potato salad for me)! meats have some flavor some parts of brisket abit dry and i like my meat drenched in sauce(2 of 6 bbq sauces to choose from-i liked chicago style and memphis style bbq sauces!) service quick and price reasonable for portion!.the pork was average.the only negative i can really find is the meat didn&#39;t reheat great the next day.the sides were delicious, even though extremely small in size..blackwood bbq is a counter service quick bbq place.i&#39;ve got to say, i&#39;m not a huge bbq fan but blackwood was delish and the staff was awesome!we all go brisket, mac and cheese, pickles and a corn muffin.the sides were fairly enjoyable and reminded me spreads at picnics with slight twists to each dish..if you&#39;re close by and need a quick bite its by no means bad i just wasn&#39;t knocked out of the park by it.however, the portion size of the platter was extremely disappointing...great hospitality and outstanding food this is the second time i was here and i was here yesterday and will continue coming when im in the area and hungry mmmmm."

hopsmith-tavern-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hopsmith-tavern-chicago,1,"We weren&#39;t really sold but then we had it and it was amazing! tacos! amazing! loved the green beans too! so hats off to the door guys! #steel.a huge group of us went here after dinner and walking around the city for a bit.big fan of this spot for weekend drinking and happy hours! they play great music, there is a lot of space, great beer selection and fun crowd.i am sooooo not a beer person, but hopsmith tavern&#39;s killer bartender helped me become one, even if it was just for the evening.good beer selection, prices are fair but i&#39;d recommend finishing your night here if you are on division, seriously always filled with girls upstairs.great atmosphere for watching the game on sunday.i had a good time with my coworkers.in fact, almost a bit too attentive, but we did enjoy the beer samples and recommendations from the bartender.skip the food.i will be returning to the city in july and will definitely be going back to hopsmith - thank you for a fun night!.today my husband and i ended up at hopsmith tavern on a whim after we finish running our saturday errands.she wonderfully worked through a rather moody manager who tried to not play the volume of the game all 50 of us had come to watch.it&#39;s the same company that owns woodie&#39;s on wells st.my nephew still talks about the bacon pancake dippers as his favorite pancakes in the city.they have a huge beer list if that&#39;s your thing.we decided to invite some friends out to watch a basketball game on a sunday night..great prices and great customer service you just can&#39;t go wrong with that.great environment for a hawks game or any night out!  we arrived here about 30 mins before the hockey game and were seated by the time it started.what i love most is the wall of windows that open.they have definitely upped their game and become a go-to spot on division.hands down the best one was the bbq brisket, which made me fall in love and vote for them back at the yelp event..i cant walk in there again.we didn&#39;t have anything to eat, but, everything that was coming out of the kitchen looked really good!! if you order the appetizer sampler, it comes out in a replica stanley cup (blackhawks just won the cup), they ring a bell and they set off this like sparkler type of thingy! its pretty fun and everyone cheers! its awesome!go ahead and give it a shot!enjoy!...i hate to give one star reviews - really do.apparently they serve this rumchata + something else drink that is served every time by two people, one of whom carries a sparkler.i will be taking my business, friends, and money elsewhere in the future.the beer list was really nice and different than the standard craft choices.after sitting in the downstairs area for quite some time, we made our way upstairs which opens up to a whole other bar area.stopped in for brunch yesterday and decided we made a great decision.others in the group got a burger, the foot long grilled cheese and the southern chicken wrap.our food was good-- no complaints.my husband will not stop raving about the mac &#39;n cheese with fried buffalo chicken and bacon..they offered a very impressive beer selection both draft and bottle.we didn&#39;t get any food this time, but i would definitely go back to check out the menu...check it out!.they have admittedly great music and music videos to go along, but it was so crowed that it made it a bit challenging to get to the bar.i&#39;ve curiously wondered about the name for a while and the nice manager megan explained the history in great detail.everything was phenomenal! the southern chicken salad wrap was to die for and the wine was great quality for the deal.good pour, quality pickle, olives- everything accounted for.since it&#39;s a sports bar it gets very busy and very loud on game days and the wait is no fun, but worth it.the food was real good and bad he beer selection was fantastic.food was delicious..i have been wanting to go here since they opened except on a friday or saturday..we will definitely be back when we are in the area!.heaven is a place on earth.first thing i noticed was the smell this place smells like a gym locker room and sweaty butt crack.tried making eye contact with servers..unless you&#39;re looking for a potential fight to occur or a night without your possessions, i would not recommend hopsmith.but i went with guinness, because i just love it so much, and seeing it in an enormous beer stein was kind of magical....they walked us over to the 4 am bar and hooked us with with more food than we expected and of course more free drinks and shots.absolutely terrible service.$5 for any of their &#34;fat pour&#34; beers, and $5 for their house cheeseburger and fries, which are delicious.their grilled cheese measures 12&#34; long and is filled with crisp bacon, two different cheeses, some spicy mayo and two fried eggs.hopsmith is rad.smiles everywhere!  when in downtown chicago,  this has got to be a stop!.but the fun was in the appetizer served in a stanley cup and sparkler pictured here."
cookies-and-carnitas-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cookies-and-carnitas-chicago-2,1,"Unfortunately when we look at the very limited menu and the prices of the things on the menu we turned around and left so sad i don&#39;t want to go to this place for so long and it was a total disappointment.well, okay that explains it..my favorite sandwich to get is the grilled cheese..be understanding and try something else.i recently met the owner brad.wicked impressed, they have made big improvements on service with the influx of online business they received.i ate a few bites of the grilled cheese and i could honestly feel my arteries clogging, lol.the interior is simple, spacious, and clean, and it consists of bold red walls decorated with local art (for sale).you will enjoy your meal- but nothing stood out as outstanding and the housemate chips are too greasy.my girlfriend and i tried this place out months ago and still go regularly, getting pork belly/shoulder and steak tacos (i think pork shoulder is the best).it&#39;s cash only, so come prepared and come hungry.each one is an amazing deal at under 3 dollars and huge (each one is a breakfast in itself).it is not all about you and your convenience..the cookies are so good.the guy filling it had his fingers grasped around the edge of the bucket..had a cookie for desert.transported to food heaven.they seem to really care about what they are doing, it just didn&#39;t translate to something i liked.delicioso, sabrosito, yummy yummy!  great pork belly tacos and other fun daily specials (like today it was a beef brisket taco)  carnitas are mouth watering, portions are good sized.there must be an inch of meat in these tacos! stuffed! no 2-bite tacos here: &#34;double walled&#34; in local tortillas, full of juicy braised meats ranging from goat and brisket fatcap to chorizo.finally had a chance to get up there last week.pros: large tacos, amazing steak fries, huge delicious cookies.i will be stopping by again next time i am in the area.third, the sandwiches - i&#39;d say go with beef over chicken.stopped in for a cookie and the suggestion of fellow yelp crew.did we order them? yes, yelp confirmed, just slightly delayed.overall wonderful experience and best of all, totally awesome food!.a great spot for a bite - their cookies are dope! i love the kitchen floor cookie - it&#39;s rolled in espresso! their sandwiches are also very delicious.if you order an ice cream sandwich, you will need to share, they are huge.the food is delicious, but it was a twenty minute wait for a single to-go taco.highly recommended.i can&#39;t wait to come back and have more.this is a great spot in a good location.this is the best grilled cheese i&#39;ve ever had in my life.the cookies are huge and yummy.great atmosphere and super friendly people.we took two cookies to go, i can&#39;t wait to taste them.their cookies are so good too.i was really looking forward to the ice cream sandwich but was disappointed when it came out frozen solid.he was so distracted.so far i can&#39;t recommend the blue salad and the chorizo taco enough!..and they didn&#39;t skimp on that either!for a $1 charge i had the greens as a side.server was super chill and friendly and let us in regardless.plus, what a great concept! i love this place.and it&#39;s byob!.big enough that 2 of them is enough for this 6&#39;2&#34; 230lbs dude.a carnitas meal should not cost upwards of $25 (cash-only, too).after eyeing up the amazing-looking cookies, i had to ask our server/cashier--where are the carnitas tacos?&#34;&#39;carnitas&#39; is more the style in which we prepare the meats than the meat itself,&#34; she replied.i&#39;m so disappointed :(...the meat was so tender and delicious and the cheese was perfect.we head back to the table.just ordered through grubhub from this place.this place is fire! crazy fresh ingredients awesome tacos and pizza.on to the food.but, my recent adventure to this establishment was not great..."
azteca-grill-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/azteca-grill-chicago-2,2,"Reallllly good mexican food!.i&#39;m glad that she was happy with her selection.stopped by after the cubs game, food was great stake and grill chicken tacos have a really good flavor to them just don&#39;t like the flour tortillas, chips where kinda stale but they where free thanks to the check in but if i would of payed for them i would of been upset.the service is always quick and the food is always tasty.the service is extremely pleasant and the restaurant is very clean..she is awesome and sweet, totally attentive.i was expecting something completely different when we pulled up..i have a low spice tolerance though so keep that in mind.the service is outstanding to and friendly.they have three salsa options: a green tangy jalepeno (i think) one, a super spicy smooth red one, and a deliciously chunky tomato onion classic chip dipping salsa.excellent little taco stand in wriggle like..the chips and salsa were ok, but the salsa was almost a watery soup, and like everything, covered in cilantro.this place has no redeeming qualities..it would have been advantageous to be told that this amount of food could not be consumed by one person.i&#39;ve eaten here 3 times now and i just had my first bad experience with this place.others at my table had a salad, burritos, enchiladas and a tilapia bowl.late night after the bar, no doubt a better choice than mcd&#39;s..i&#39;ll be watching my bank statement to make sure the meal&#39;s only charged once....also, the chips and salsa are pretty disappointing.felt awkward having someone keep bringing up the issue of tipping.azteca&#39;s food is always great! super fast and super delicioso! the fish tacos are a great choice (tons of food!) but you also can&#39;t go wrong with a classic quesadilla.it had such good flavor and texture.&#34;you can take your parents to meet azteca and have a nice sit down meal with chicken fajitas and fish tacos.full of drunk people on a saturday, slow service, food had no flavor.the food was actually very good too and prices were reasonable too..it&#39;s kind of off the main drag from wrigleyville and easy to get to.defiantly coming back.you must get three of the same, which leaves no room for adventure!the other thing was that my husband ordered a shrimp burrito and a fish one came instead.i went in and a staff member was very rude- i asked if i could please have green salsa only as i am not a fan of red salsa.points for enough meat and not too much cheese.they weren&#39;t stingy with the toppings and they were really filling.ordered again no issues and the food was great!.for what it is, it&#39;s ok.they&#39;ve got some great chimachurri sauce and a fire salsa that will definitely bring the heat.affordable considering right down the street from wrigley field.i mean its mostly rice and beans.my husband and i were scouring yelp after our game we attended at wrigley field.i&#39;ve got to say- i&#39;ve never had something from azteca that was less than phenomenal.wonderful place!.i also had the pastor, which was a train wreck..never again.very consistent and fast, and open real late!.the churros are incredible! the enchiladas, fajitas, quesadillas, etc.5 stars simply for having the best horchata that i&#39;ve had so far in chicago.also, even better when intoxicated.the server was so friendly.we had the enchilada suizo with skirt steak and the flautas.....their guacamole is the best i have ever had at any mexican restaurant.it showed up super quickly, and everything tasted really fresh.very friendly and attentive service.the real winner of the menu is the tortilla soup.which is  disgusting.yes the delivery man was nice and fast but the tacos were inedible.i eat here often for lunch.truly hit the spot but also hit my wallet.fantastic food."
immm-rice-and-beyond-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/immm-rice-and-beyond-chicago,1,"Definitely one of my favorite thai restaurants now.i&#39;ve been living in chicago for almost 20 years and have always been on a search for some taste of home.papaya salad is funky, savory, and refreshing..the spices are interesting, curry tastes very differently from other places.they let you taste the gravy of all the different food in the food warmer.have eaten here twice and am eager to try more of the menu.once the word gets out, this place will be hard to get into.it is these same reviewers who complain about how immm is &#34;pricey&#34; - sure, if you go in comparing it to mass produced american-chinese over-salted reheated frozen panda express, immm is not what you&#39;d called &#34;dirt cheap&#34;.not expensive and not crowded.that was after the hour of waiting - then she was able to prepare the food in 3 minutes from behind the counter.do yourself a favor and indulge! i recommend going with the tasting size portions so you can try a few different dishes as well.only reason i can&#39;t rate this place higher is that i ordered the egg rolls, and the product came out frozen (not cool or cold, but frozen) in the center..they do allow you to try the dish before you commit to getting a serving of it which i think is really cool.the food is soooo good! specifically their khao mun gai.i tried the palo (eggs and pork cooked in spices and gravy), a dish whose name i can&#39;t remember that had scrambled egg, sliced sweet potato, and fish sauce, and sweet stir-fried pork..that rarely happens.i liked it!atmosphere: loved the wall art, cute little story to go along with it; i also appreciate that there wasn&#39;t a tv in site as i feel they&#39;re way to distracting while i eatservice: the staff helped us try the various dishes they were serving that day, the chef went out of his way to make sure we were enjoying ourselvesfinal note: try the tea.i&#39;ve traveled extensively through vietnam and this reminded me more of the food i had there than the &#34;authentic&#34; vietnamese restaurants in the neighborhood.i had spicy fish balls and panang (as usual) and they fixed the prob about the portion.was planning on going next door to tank noodles and saw this little place and thought i&#39;d try it out.my new favorite thai place in the neighborhood.they have about 10 different variations of this salad (one of my favorite dishes).i was wrong).do youtube research before coming here to fully appreciate the foods.cute presentation, but held about half the amount of tea as tall glasses other restaurants use.i liked the panang mhoo (penang curry with pork) better, a reddish curry dish with some kick but easily handled by my taste buds.it beats the typical thai restaurants for menu diversity.this place caught my eye immediately..if you are not interested or concerned if the food sitting there for too long or look soggy, there are also variety of food made to order.a wide selection of delicious food, many of which you&#39;ve probably never had.i was honestly not sure if i would like &#34;authentic thai food&#34; as much as i loved the americanized version of it! but the owners were so nice they actually let me sample every single item off of the buffet and explained what makes each dish unique and special.i am not normally a fan of the super sweet thai drinks, but here it really works as a counter-balance to the tastes and heat of the meal.now i can experience this food again a mile away from home.i ordered from the pre made cafeteria style dishes.keep doing what you&#39;re doing and don&#39;t pander to the average american palate!special, affordable, and simple magnificent!.careful with the heat, they keep it real..can&#39;t wait to go back soon:).the foods is incredible and like you are actually there.the curries are spot on, and the group of thai people i came with all took some panaeng curry home.."
andiamo-pizzaria-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/andiamo-pizzaria-chicago,1,"The best one is the pizza &#34;regina&#34; with bufala mozzarella and evo.closest i&#39;ve had to a ny pizza, absolutely amazing waitress was really sweet but it was annoying that she couldn&#39;t answer any of my questions, like &#34;what is curdo, porcini, melanzana.tastes like i am in a piazza in rome..very mundane pizza place in chicago.our first time ordering from there, and will be going back.we want our food to be good, but the first thing we want is that it will not make us sick! mike, the owner, was very polite and it gave us a full refund, but still i do think that they should be monitoring their food more closely!.authentic gem - have dinner here before it gets totally crowded..plus if you speak italian you&#39;ll love them even more.had to doctor up my slices a lot at home to enjoy eating.it&#39;s totally worth every penny..yum!.thin crust with a moderate amount of chewiness (definitely not neapolitan) and lovely, traditional toppings.awesome pizza.nothing beats brick oven pizza.the pizza was thin-crust, which i wasn&#39;t expecting from the pictures.do yourself a favor and give it a try!.congratulazioni da un italiano!.he placed the most exquisite dessert in front of us..although i wish they had more contemporary combinations of toppings, the quality and value are excellent for the neighborhood..amazing pie.the salad was okay at best - bland and the olive oil was old.i was impressed with andiamo&#39;s menu and the pizza was delivered much faster than promised and everything came as ordered."
la-cecina-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-cecina-chicago-3,2,Highlights for me were the warm salsa and the homemade tortillas!..food is mediocre for the price paid.awesome fajitas.it used to be called la condesa and they have free parking across the street.definitely recommend..
fennel-and-iris-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fennel-and-iris-chicago,2,"Stopped in here on a weekend morning, early.this place just doesn&#39;t deliver on the flavor part of that equation.the space really is amazing for parties because its so open yet cozy.)she said they were going to start preparing their own baked goods, which i cannot wait for.and he was not busy..i loved that the coffee we ordered was dropped off still in the french press.we rented the location for three hours and the menu selection offered was diverse and reasonably priced.awesome!it&#39;s been pretty empty when i&#39;ve gone there--i hope they get more business, because they&#39;re a welcome addition to the neighborhood!.the bun was fresh but chewy.i chose the scrambled eggs, potatoes, and toast, and modified it to egg whites sans onions.this how a little cafe should look like! wonderful spot with fresh french pressed coffee and darling tables.from the moment we walked in everyone was attentive and helpful.they do frequently have private parties there, so it&#39;s best to call or check their facebook page in advance if you don&#39;t live close by.overall some mind blowing taste explosions of flavor definitely happening here.food is clean, tasty, light and has a touch of homemade flair (fresh fruit, french pressed coffee, and slightly burnt toast)..thank you to kathy &amp; staff.in that cost is also included coffee, tea, and pop..tables are left dirty, nasty floors.we waited an hour in a back room full of junk, then finally left...nothing to complain about though.was he suppose to get up and get it himself? there were only 2 other customers so it was not busy.my best friend had her daughters first birthday here.do yourselves a favor and walk down the street to anywhere else..very friendly with a nice friendly ambiance.there were shared platters of food using a menu customized to what our bride wanted.the place is also byob, and they&#39;ll chill your champagne for you (cold champagne on deck is key when you&#39;re having mimosas!)..both were tasty- nothing mind blowing, just good.it also seems the waitstaff is prepping food as well as serving..my friend had the almond tea and it was fantastic.also the food seemed to take a while to come out even though we were the only people on the restaurant but it was very good.kathy and her staff were amazing to work with."
crazy-crab-1-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/crazy-crab-1-chicago-2,2,"The waitress pretend as if she is my boss and want me to order more food.from the appetizers(fried calamari &amp; cajun fries) to the main and live foods( lobster&amp; the headless shrimp) the service was unbelievably fast and i&#39;m dyin to go back  looks like i am crazy for crazy crab !.we will be coming back!.food was good but portions very small! if they can get the portions right then this place will be very good!! owner very nice but slipped up and said they weigh the crab while still frozen which makes no sense because of ice factor!!!.my..the staff was very nice and attentive.crazy crab does have potential but i&#39;m going to wait at least two month before i return.99...we ordered the garlic edamame, two pounds of snow crab legs, one pound of head-on shrimp, and two corn cobs, all in the medium spiced mixture of their there sauces.the tails were small and very difficult to get the meat out.awesome food at reasonable prices.$38.not worth the try.you eat with your hands so it gets a bit messy but the two hand wash stations are centrally located.he double charged my card, and i never received my food.again, not a big thing, just something to keep in mind! my boyfriend had the garlic edamame, crazy wings, and cajun fries and thoroughly enjoyed everything.great food.my fiancé and i went in for dinner and could not have been more thrilled with the food.amazing tender and fresh alaskan king crab!! so messy but so fun at the same time!! super staff to match the great food.so addicting! nice little bar too- have me a very healthy pour of wine! very nice folks working there as well!.the service was really good as well.cant wait to go back.2.we ordered the lemon pepper for our clams, which came as part of combination #1, a great introduction to the restaurant that also included crab legs and head-off shrimp, corn and potatoes.i&#39;m a foodie, so i just wanted to try it as an experience.there was no sausage, but more importantly they only gave me two small crab legs.."
dmk-burger-bar-chicago-6,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dmk-burger-bar-chicago-6,2,"I&#39;m so pleased this location is now open, not only for myself but for my visiting friends and all suburbanites.easy takeout window, quick service, not terribly priced for navy pier.great music, awesome beer selection, interesting burgers.this location in navy pier doesn&#39;t compare to their original restaurants.service was super hit and miss..for 17 bucks, i got the poorest poor boy i&#39;ve ever had.surprisingly good burgers, very tasty fries, and a beer list that wasn&#39;t amazing, but is better than expected for a chain joint at navy pier.v.overall, a solid spot located in the newly renovated section of navy pier.parmesan cheese was dumped in the bag and the truffle cream lacked any flavor if it was truly even in there.service was slow   two guys in the whole place for a very busy lunch crowd   got the fish tacos $9.juicy, perfectly season, insane bite from the bleu cheese, but sadly not as much spice as i wanted from the ketchup.we stopped here for a quick lunch on our first day in chicago as my kids needed to eat asap.everything was lukewarm, and the bison burger was so small for like $12, it was quite pathetic.however, i was disappointed by the  thin  gumbo.we finally walked out.awesome little place, somewhat hard to find just because it is down near the end of the pier..a great way to round out the morning.the new dmk at navy pier is better than the one in lakeview (which imo has gone downhill).they&#39;re fried to the right doneness and the aioli is the perfect position rthe drinks menu ranged from beer to wine to cocktails and watching the bartenders make the drinks was quite entertaining..margarita was excellent.go somewhere else !!!.a hostess sat us at a table of our preference, and we looked over the menu.great location on the pier to people watch and look at the boats.but i must say i have had better..however our service is the reason for my rating which started off really good, our server was funny but things quickly turned as we sat there for at least an hour before our food was finally delivered to our 4 top table in the middle of the afternoon.however, my husband had an &#34;ok&#34; experience with his meal.i only received 2 small pieces.much better.fries come in good sized servings without the need to get the large orders to share.finally ordered our drinks and food, sat there 10 more minutes before the bartender noticed we did not even have a glass of water."
the-southern-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-southern-chicago,2,"The pork wasn&#39;t seasoned or cooked in any unique fashion but at least it was moist, and while my mom said her shrimp grits were good they were just ok.the drinks were strong and delicious.everything was absolutely delicious! service was great and they have an awesome beer selection.i was not expecting much and was very pleasantly surprised.we chose the latter - saving a good third of the dish to take home.i&#39;d purchased a groupon for dinner and i was so excited to finally experience the food everyone had been raving about.the southern is one of my favorite spots in chicago..i ordered the freaks n geeks flight and started with the cheese plate, which was very good with a nice variety- cheese, grapes, pickled fruits, fig &amp; crostini.each was well-run -- one was this past new years and a prior event was a seafood boil.the bartenders were super nice and the drinks were good.perhaps there weren&#39;t enough choices on it.beer and orange juice, so essentially a glorified blue moon.this place offers a nice ambiance with the low dim lighting to give the bar/tavern scene (almost too dim to be able to read the menu).both times i had a groupon, which was a great deal: 2 entrees and 2 beverages.the food is not bad, and most things were fine if not great.so i kept hearing how great this place was so me and my sister went there last sunday night and used a groupon she had - $66 for $39.it wasn&#39;t that bad, but it wasn&#39;t worth ever ordering again.service/drinks were good, nice ambiance.the decor is nice with tables that can seat 8 in the back.sometimes i bite into sandwiches and let out a little sexy noise- i did that with this one..they were over cooked and just poorly conceptualized.our drinks were never empty.gin has become a recent favorite of mine and this drink doesn&#39;t disappoint, very smooth and the flavors were balanced well.seats right away, service was quick.the drinks were disgusting.it may seem a bit pricey but it&#39;s well worth it.i loved that it came on top of biscuit because fried chicken and biscuits is the best thing ever.both of us had the fried chicken.admit you forgot to enter and monitor our order and now you have an 8-month pregnant woman (me) calling you out.they have a really nice patio area and both times i went we did not have to wait for a table..the only downside? a few items, and the ones we planned on enjoying, were so popular they were out (fried chicken and artic char).but the menu could be bigger.we sat at the bar bc in order to sit outside in the patio or on any table we needed to make a reservation which i thought was weird being that it should be first come first serve and the tables were empty at the time.i have been here on more than one occasion and they don&#39;t disappoint.this dish is delicious especially with the egg! when my husband and i traded plates, he never gave it back but instead finished it off so i won&#39;t be trading plates with him anymore.they also have a fried chicken benedict..the spiciness seemed to vary depending on what part of the sandwich you bit into but the tarragon buttermilk aioli did a fine job tempering the heat.i wasn&#39;t even hungry! i just needed to get out of the apartment.the restaurant has a nice vibe and a pretty big outdoor patio.and then another 30 minutes passed away.when they have the outdoor seating available, the restaurant basically doubles in size..my wife said that she was really nice and helpful over the phone too...this place is cute and cozy i was sick with a cold but needed to get out of the house the bartender made me a hot toddy i think it&#39;s called hot scotch next thing i know i had 5 of them!!!! i felt so much better and completely drunk! the food was amazing.waiter was great, but the door to door time was about 2 hours.this review is for brunch.just wish they had a bit more options!.a friend of mine also ordered this and he thought the same thing.this place? where do i start? i lold at whomever review f.it was a generous portion that all of us had plenty to enjoy.to complete the wonderful experience the décor and sitting are eerily beautiful! i plan on going back soon..food was good, but nothing exceptional."

uncommon-ground-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/uncommon-ground-chicago,2,"You will truly find uncommon things there which makes it better than other places.we had the mixed berry pancakes, ham and cheese stuffed french toast, egg and pepper breakfast sandwich, and chilaquiles.fish tacos, calamari, brussel sprouts (spicy) and slamon are all delightful!.stick a fork in it, we&#39;re done with this place.they have a nice selection of craft beers if that&#39;s what you&#39;re into.i ordered some eggs and sausages.greenstar brewing clams to be the first certified organic brewery in illinois.this place is nothing special.way too overpriced for seriously mediocre food at best.i ordered the mushroom &#34;ravioli&#34; and it was good.calamari had strangely foul after taste with random three fries on plate (raw).i will say that the food was alright nothing that impressed me but the reason that i did rate it five stars is because the manager was very accommodating and attentive when the waitress seemed to be busy with the guests at the bar.ambiance: the show area is a bit tight.all in all, we recommend uncommon ground as a fun retro place in wrigleyville.front end and kitchen were obviously overwhelmed by late sunday morning crowd before a cub game.i went there on a friday night and our waiter was utterly overwhelmed and not at all apologetic for ignoring us.this place has great potential but right now is not cutting it for the neighborhood..now they are overpriced and full of themselves- the cover is to pay the musicians because they are too cheap ass to do it themselves.this place is too inconsistent.cost:$14 (ham &amp; cheese stuffed brioche french toast)$13 (farmers market scramble)looking back now and after writing down what a friend and i shared plus the prices, this might be on the middle to lower end of brunches i&#39;ve had in chicago.was here over the weekend and the consensus was: fail.just.it just felt chintzy and uninspired.bad service and the food was bland and served to us completely cold (amongst other issues).if i was this way again, and had time, i&#39;d come enjoy a leisurely meal here.the high prices made it much worse because the quality was no where near where the cost.we had a party of 19 in one of their private rooms.i&#39;m not familiar with this area but i would say this is the best brunch place in wrigleyville! ps: on the days of afternoon cubs games, make reservations.cool rustic ambiance but the food was sub par.decent sweet potato fries.the music room is especially fantastic, with perfect sound and a really nice ambiance.i also tried the gluten free roasted cauliflower which was ok, but sadly it followed the calamari which was a hard act to follow..the food here is amazing ! the lavender &amp; honey roasted half chicken is a dish that will leave you wanting more.we&#39;re from out of town visiting friends and family ~ it was marvelous to enjoy leisurely drinks and meals - we were not rushed to turn over window table..service was excellent.we went here because my 6 year old son only eats organic and it&#39;s hard to find a place with such a menu..i was wanting breakfast but didn&#39;t want to make it, and it is closer than the diner.(this was halfway through our brunch - come on! i&#39;m thirsty.the food was delicious."
primebar-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/primebar-chicago-2,2,"Went here for a charity event and the venue could not have been more prime.your drinks are overpriced and vary wildly in strength depending on who&#39;s pouring.the drinks were just &#34;this is alcohol,&#34; and nothing too special.also ordered the ginger root beer.i&#39;ve also tried to ceasar salad which is pretty good.i doubt that this will be my next destination when i visit chicago.all the food here is very average and so when you add on poor service, it really makes it not worth the effort.great location for many offices downtown and also very near union and ogilvie stations.i would recommend stopping and trying it out, if it not your thing they have some sister operations to the south.though the restaurant was busy; we were able to grab a booth by the bar and only had a limited time to grab a couple of drinks and dinner before heading up to the aragon ballroom, our server was able to get us multiple drinks and our meals quickly while not losing out on the quality.i don&#39;t enjoy writing negative reviews, but we left because it was already a real bummer of an experience.boom!.- not sashimi grade.our waitress didn&#39;t check back on the entrée so i was short on time and ate only the spinach and chicken.what a neat place to hang out for a few drinks.they don&#39;t skimp on the toppings either!if you&#39;re looking for a place to dine near the opera house, ogilvie/union station, or financial district, i&#39;d check this place out.many suits and ties, but not stuffy at all.i had the spa day drink which i highly recommend for a summer day.i want to give this place 1 star.she was incredibly snotty and said oh well i&#39;ll go get your waiter.one of the fancier happy hour spots in the loop (but consequently also one of the pricier ones).went here for my welcome lunch at my new job, with the other 3 people on my team..wish i had those instead.first thing i noticed was that they had an outdoor patio as it was warm out.you will feel out of place in a t shirt and shorts.this place, for me, beats 1 north, pazzo&#39;s and rivers.dropped by for a work hh last friday night; primebar has huge space but as a result it features pretty poor customer service.it&#39;ll usually be half the price of all the other brews.) if it wasn&#39;t on the massive delays on refills from this it&#39;d have a perfect 5 and i hate not doing that as i don&#39;t think it was a restaurant issue but just a waiter issue.our waitress did the best she could do.the ambience, music and food are pretty good.we had much to discuss, and we were interested in ordering (a few glasses of) wine and some snappy appetizers or finger foods to keep us focused on our long-overdue meeting.we had a work happy hour here and the space was good with so so service they could&#39;ve served at least another dozen drinks to our group if they&#39;d been present and proactively asking.the chicken was moist and flavorful and the fries were standard.great food and wonderful ambiance.definitely worth a second chance.come to think of it, everything here is good.big comfy booths line the walls..will definitely make this the go-to lunch spot when our team has our &#39;fancy&#39; lunches!.i won&#39;t hold that against them too much though."

 we have only been a couple of times, as we just discovered it recently, but we will be back again very soon.this is the go to place for great food and last minute plans on a friday.they have plenty of specials throughout the week to give you a little break on the bill.thin, chewy yet crispy crust with whatever ingredients you want=nirvana..frasca is the perfect spot for a girls night out.manager tony saw our 2 babies were beginning to fuss from across the room and booked over.the pepperoni does have a spicy soppressata on it, so that makes sense.also, i appreciate the consideration you took in believing i wanted to cut my pizza by myself at home.i find relaxing and conversation difficult here..the management staff is attentive and routinely checking in on guest to ensure that they&#39;re enjoying their meal and experience.cheese boards and bruchetta boards are great and the pizza is excellent.i&#39;ve had the brussels sprouts salad (very tasty, so many different things going on and they all meld together perfectly), and most recently tried the meatball appetizer too..the food was great, pizza was on point, great flavor, and the calamari was good too.love this place the only thing i wish it wasn&#39;t so loud.highly recommended..the pizza had no cheese whatsoever.the melon just over took the proscuitto and ricotta.they also do a pretty solid brunch.update 1: ordered the spinaci pizza on monday.randomly got the crispy cauliflower last time which was delicious.it was a good call.so we had the brussels spout pizza and the 4 cheese ravioli.perfect place to go if your looking for date night or even family night..service was good, although we were momentarily forgotten at the bar waiting for a table.brussels sprouts and cauliflower.it was amazing.warm and cozy interior with good food and large wine selection.they cannot add extra cheese.i felt like apologizing when we left but did not.on point.we chose four pizzas on a two for one wednesday night special.we&#39;ve also been here for brunch a few times, and they&#39;ve got great bloody mary&#39;s complete with a tomato mozzarella skewer and a mini beer back! tip of the trade: bogo(yes, free!!!) pizzas on wednesday.the pizza was amazing! we went on bogo pizza night, so the total bill was very reasonable for downtown.great little italian place right off the paulina brown line stop.while they were very apologetic, i order an hour before pickup because i don&#39;t have time to sit around waiting for them to cook my meal.they serve pizza here.they use smoke daddy&#39;s bloody mary mix which they also have available to purchase by the bottle for $5.the food came out right after, which was nice..portions were smaller than expected..let me start off by saying i love bloody mary&#39;s.the interior is nicely decorated and has a very interesting vibe..5cured duck: 3bruschetta: 2.in an effort to &#34;add&#34; to the flavor, we ordered a side of tomato sauce.the atmosphere was great, the food and music outstanding, and the service- attentive and friendly.we went with the pasta and pizza combo with some of their brussel sprout salad as an appetizer, which were all pretty great outside of the sprouts being seasoned a little heavily.highly recommend this.the service was great and the food was better! i have actually made reservations for my birthday brunch this saturday! i hear it&#39;s great, can&#39;t wait!.lots of cheese!pizza:-potato and bacon pizza: this is a white pizza, really fantastic, light yet luscious flavor.my fiance loves the bloody mary that comes w/a bacon and is a meal in itself!my friend leigh had the chicken pesto panini which was super amazing.it&#39;s a staple in the roscoe village area, there&#39;s never too long of a wait, the pizzas are fantastic, as is the rest of the very seasonal menu.the pizza was fantastic, the servers were super polite and actually knew their entire menu..wasn&#39;t disappointed with frasca.for our meals we shared a couple of pizzas.it was warm and comforting, and a wonderful fall entree.i had the build your own wine flight (their thursday drink special) and it was the perfect compliment to my meal.i had a cabernet and a spicy meat lovers pizza and they went together beautifully.we had to flag someone else down for our check and then she never came over to say thanks or have a good night..my boyfriend had the rags pasta with lamb ragu and that was really good, too! i will definitely be returning as i was obsessed with the ambiance as well as the food! awesome wine selection as well! great spot off the paulina brown line!.:(their pizzas are good, but not amazing; there are better wood stove pizzas out there in chicago.great place for a nice italian sit down, or if you&#39;re in the mood for a big ol glass of wine, you won&#39;t be complaining."

dosirak-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dosirak-chicago,1,"I am truly disappointed about this experience.so if you&#39;ve had the typical korean rice cakes (dukbokgee), fish cakes (odang), etc this is the place to go.the walls are painted with different korean dishes with smiling faces.and they deliver!.when i went in for carry out the staff was rude and sealed the deal for me never ordering from them again.first time there, enjoyed it.i ordered for delivery.if you need a quick korean fix while in the medical district it will do but tozi in wicker park is waaay better.i had no issues with their service.never again.the check out girl was polite and friendly..i&#39;ve been twice now, but i&#39;ve been mostly disappointed by the food so far.for some people like me, the bottom of the rice is crispy so i enjoy eating that part.more kimchi and more kimchi please!.like, eating white rice alone bland..splashing some sesame oil, hot and not, gives this dish some depth.i can&#39;t disagree) with 3 banchan each, which were different on each tray.&#34; it&#39;s been 45 minutes- then they finally call, i go down to get my food, the delivery man isn&#39;t even at the door.sad to say, it didn&#39;t live up to the korean food i am used to on the north side of town.the pork was good but very oily.there weren&#39;t that many people, so i was surprised.one of the few korean restaurants near me.whenever i crave for korean food, dosirak is my go-to option.chicken wings decent.kalbi was good.i had a strawberry banana smoothie while waiting, highly recommended.i had planned a lunar new year celebration for my co-workers, so i decided to order in korean for the team.the place is cute and we&#39;ll kept but is on the smaller end for seating.it may not be the best korean place but i seriously don&#39;t get why it has gotten 1 and 2 stars!.walking down taylor street for a quick lunch, i see several tables of empty outdoor seating.pro: dosirak has great food with okay pricing..95).i tasted my bf&#39;s seafood tofu soon dubu and the flavor was good with a slight kick..the food was pretty good and a good amount of spicy..i&#39;m definitely coming back!..both were pretty good, and the service is good as well (i should note i don&#39;t know korean food well, but i enjoyed it)..authentic and cheap.finally, authentic, delicious korean food by uic.i stuck to what i knew - the bulgogi.the pajeon was fantastic - my favorite part of the order.the service was chaos."
foundation-room-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/foundation-room-chicago-2,1,"The host was not very warm since it was noted that we were not members (again, get over yourselves!) and were shown to what felt like a darkened dining room from a wealthy family 50 years ago.the aaron sanchez designed steak tacos, are small, but mind blowing great.they know how to treat their vips, so glad i joined!.often times we overlook staff at shows, but not here! top notch folks! can&#39;t wait to go back.we danced until the wee hours of the morning! will most definitely come back for a girls night or date..the décor is asian inspired - if you&#39;ve ever wanted to look at a buddha while drinking a scotch you could do far worse than the foundation room.the foundation room is actually members only, but you can easily get in for events..great to come here before a show, i enjoy the bar area much more than the restaurant.we went for the first time last week.very overrated is all i can say.service and decor were fine but nothing to write home about."
earls-bbq-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/earls-bbq-chicago-2,2,"Pretty good deal and plenty of food for the price plus it&#39;s drive thru at a convenient location.went there this weekend, bf and i decided share a 3 item &#34;platter&#34;...the cole salad was amazing i ate it and was like &#34; yo this is pretty dame good &#34;.the brisket is one of the best i have ever had!! i get the half pound sandwich with two sides and it&#39;s only around $10! great deal! i&#39;ve had the rib tips and they were really good.the girl had shouted back to the guy that they were out..i&#39;ve visited earls twice.eating in would be uncomfortable..we will definitely be making this spot a regular.the prices were so cheap.the donuts were tasty warmed up, but perhaps a bit too much sugar on them?.super friendly staff, no soup fyi, idk why there&#39;s a sign that says soup but they don&#39;t have any.the menu is full of great choices--ribs, chicken, brisket, wings, smoked sausage.i ordered two 1/2 lb brisket sandwiches (no bun) with baked beans and on both of them, the brisket was incredibly fatty and tough.i enjoy dry meat so i&#39;m not complaining.i remember when it was kfc, then it was empty for a very long time, then became duff&#39;s dogs, now it&#39;s earls.we had brisket,was good not much flavor there but was cooked well must dip in bbq sauce,sausage tastes like a prepackaged which spent some time in smoker,salmon was better moist with some good spices,and ribs were good and smokey and were again good.under $30 for 4 meats!! can&#39;t get that anywhere else.we might as well have just dined in.our office will for sure order from here again!.outstanding pulled pork, with a delightfully balanced sauce - a little smoky, a little bourbon-y and a little spicy made it interesting! the fresh out of the dryer doughnuts are an amazing cross of yeast and cake with a crispy sugar dusting - not to be missed!!!i would brag some more about the best new barbecue spot on the nw side, but then us locals would never get in.this place is nowhere near my house but i will definitely go back multiple times for their smoked meat.it is nice that it is in the neighborhood and has a drive thru.carolina (vinegar based and very thin in consistency)3..what a great addition to the northwest side.i will certainly be back to try the other smoked meats, donuts, and shakes!!sauce-wise the georgia and original is where the party is at.the meat was pretty hard which mean i had to chew it a lot.the coleslaw was perfect and the donuts!! oh my goodness! they were heavenly!! i cant wait for them to start serving breakfast and beer!! all these negative comments need to at least come back one more time! and some people didnt even eat the food they said.did i mention that i love that?.a fine addition to the area.the pulled pork sandwich was delicious and the bbq sauce selection was good.the bbq was delicious and very reasonably priced.pastey, crumbly and flavorless.the donut at the end was the topper!so glad to have a place like this in the neighborhood! we will be back!.i can see this becoming a main staple for us.sooo super yummy!!! best brisket ive ever had!! coleslaw is perfect and the mac and cheese!!?!? omg orgasm in my mouth!! we also ordered 3 fresh homemade donuts!! they we so good and warm!! i cant wait to go back and try everything else!!.the pulled pork was very fatty, the ribs were dry and tough, mac and cheese tasted like a generic version of kraft out the box and the cole slaw was bland with barely any flavor.new place in neighborhood, not so good.earl&#39;s isnt bad.i had salmon, brisket, and pulled pork; he had sausage, rub tips, and pulled pork.they were okay, but not outstanding.it&#39;s ok!   we will be back!.i like the sauce options on the table, especially since i&#39;m more into the tangy, vinegary kind.5 because of the drive through.this is a bbq joint and not fast food.food was remarkable &amp; amazing service.glad i found this place and now have great bbq near my house.this place was all the talk of the neighborhood when it opened.great spot for bbq on the north side that&#39;s not too well-known, which means it&#39;s easy to get in and the food is top notch every time i&#39;ve gone, plus when have you ever had a bbq salmon sandwich this good for under $7 that wasn&#39;t located on an ocean-side? the brisket tacos are massive and really good too.i haven&#39;t ever been a big bbq gal and have never craved the stuff like i am currently but earl&#39;s is one of my favorites around town.mmmmmmm.amazing all the way around i will definitely be back.it was literally the best i&#39;ve ever had!!the brisket was our favorite.i wish it had some lettuce and onions and other toppings to add more flavor to it.i liked it!   had pulled pork and brisket - liked them both, brisket a little fattier than the pork..&#34; what about the smoked chicken? &#34;nope.yes.my only criticism: the brioche bun was a bit oily considering the oils in the meat, great bun, but ideally a bun would absorb the oils, the brioche bun turned into an oil slick..i&#39;ve been to other places such a smouqe and this place by far is better."
ftw-chicago-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ftw-chicago-chicago,1,"Fun alternative to dave and busters! i loved the environment.she came by to check on us, i said that we were all set and would take the check.it was so fun.ftw is the new type of arcade.p.now like i said it wasn&#39;t bad, but when you are expecting it to be spicy it kind of left us disappointed.the seating around the bar is comfy and roomy..it&#39;s a cool spot to go for something different for a date but nothing stuck out besides the miniature golfing i&#39;ll come back to check out the food when i&#39;m in the area..pretty good game selection, but just in case the noise emanating from the popular star wars game is too much for you to handle, they have a couple of adjoining, sleek lounge rooms you can escape to.when we entered, the woman at the register was talking to her co-worker and did not acknowledge us right away.the bartender was nice and let us sample absinthe when he overheard us talking about it.there are some new or interesting games, of course lots of old casino games (like coin-drops), but also some stripped down version of common smartphone games (flappy bird, plants v zombies among others).is 21+, so we only encountered a few parents with kids who hadn&#39;t yet left for the evening by the time we arrived.it was the most expensive birthday party  that we&#39;ve ever hosted, and the service was the worst we&#39;ve ever received, by a wide margin.they definitely need cooler stuff.also, we didn&#39;t try it - but they have a putt-putt golf course in the back.what a fun night! took my roomie there to celebrate her bday with our friends! fun fun fun! alcohol and games in one spot! what else can you ask for??? alcohol can be pricey tho, but it&#39;s worth it..i also recommend playing the big connect four game..waited longer and had to approach someone else for her to wait our table.anyways ftw does a great job being an adult arcade.there was something for everyone, including drinks for my fiancé &amp; i! we had a great time! (wish i&#39;d taken pics of the food, but we were too busy enjoying it!).so i asked him for a new drink.typical for downtown but we enjoyed playing all the games ! what&#39;s nice is you get this electronic cards and they do not print tickets instead what you win gets loaded on the card.i personally am partial to the football throw and the basketball shot games more than the video games they had on offer.our server never came to check on our food or drinks..the menu is short and the food isn&#39;t that good..if i only spent my time there playing games and not interacting with employees then everything would have gone great.no tables other than high tops available.i tried the happy hour (monday to thursday 4pm to 9pm) $10 2 hour unlimited gaming option.a completely new arcade means high tech shiny new games galore! this place is awesome, like a playground for adults.this place was really a lot of fun.it&#39;s definitely our &#34;go too&#34; spot.ftw tag line should be - where an adult can be a kid!my visit to ftw was amazing! i had a great time playing all the games..so cool! the games were really fun.sorry we tried to spend a bunch of money at your establishment.the meatball sandwich was really delicious, great beer selection.i had some thoughts that they wouldn&#39;t be able to handle a kids event, since there were sort of dave and busters-ish.first as far as adult arcades go, this one had the best ambience bar none in my opinion.i&#39;m not familiar with how much other arcade type places cost but i believe this is reasonably priced.5 star overall rating for ftw is accurate."

trattoria-ultimo-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trattoria-ultimo-chicago,1,"This is my fifth time here and again i loved my meal.but so many things about the restaurant fell flat that i would not go back.byob was great.byob.the specials were written on a chalkboard that was brought to each table so that made it easier to remember the dishes.and hands down one of my favorite spots on chicago.would recommend to anyone looking for a fantastic reasonably priced meal in the area.i need risotto since i&#39;m a gluten free.thanks for a great experience, anthony!.i would have given this restaurant 5 stars if they didn&#39;t slap on a $5 corkage for the beer we brought..it was odd that the vegetables were grilled a new then chilled.that&#39;s the case here and the menu changes frequently to work in things that are in season.anyway, i went to the soft opening the other night and came away super impressed.overall the experience wasn&#39;t awful but it wasn&#39;t great.intimate setting, knowledgeable and welcoming owner/host.it&#39;s byob, and corkage is $5.we don&#39;t get to see such good service very often among tip-hungry servers..quit being a dummy and go eat there!.we shared shrimp and sausage for an appetizer, i had the gnocci dish for an entree, and my fiance had the scallop and pasta dish for his entree..great service, prompt food, granted we were the only ppl there.this place is a great hidden gem in west town/ukrainian village, although i think some context is useful because this is not necessarily the right restaurant for every occasion.portions are perfectly sized so you can finish your whole dish without feeling overly stuffed.we&#39;ll definitely go back..but they have an atm on site if you don&#39;t have the funds.worth the slightly higher prices, good for a fairly special occasion.this is a true italian restaurant.good food, great service! cash only threw us off but the onsite atm made it easy...second she up sold us on everything.she was surly and unpleasant and we had an unpleasant discussion about their corkage fee, an unnecessary charge when they have no wine or spirits to offer.this place is fantastic! real fresh italian food.both apps were served with practically a whole salad of their own.your hostile and unprofessional reply does confirm the behavior several other yelp patrons claim to have received from your staff..my partner had spinach tortellini stuffed with asparagus  in cream sauce which he loved.decent portion sizes on the apps.the staff were complete assholes to our group of 17, trying to tell us what to order and getting frustrated when we didn&#39;t follow their &#34;orders&#34;, charging $2 per person for a birthday cake cutting fee when they didn&#39;t cut the cake or do anything more than pass off a stack of plates and forks that we could use.before i dive into our experience, i want to say the reason for 4 stars is that atmosphere still needs a little work and i wish that took credit cards (cash only at the moment).i think there was a language barrier between, but pouring the blame on us wasn&#39;t the answer.we were given a large table (even though we were only two)near the kitchen because it was so cold out.great customer service for a large group of people.will definitely be returning!.they forgot his dish.its now about 10:30pm and once i confirmed with my party the waitress hadn&#39;t come by the table in my absence, i politely walked up to the front of the restaurant to ask the waitress if she knew about when the entree&#39;s would come out.came for a big bday group dinner, and the food was amazing, good service and great ambiance!   again, byob!must go!.the food is delicious, simple and lovingly prepared with seasonal ingredients.i am not too picky, so when the waitress totally forgot our dessert after half an hour (and all she really needed to do was bring it out of the fridge), i was still sympathetic.i threw a party for my company and i can not say enough about our experience! the service was fantastic (the owner tony waited on us with his waiter) and the food blew my entire group away! the atmosphere/decor is very simple but comfortable.will not find a better italian restaurant than trattoria ultimo in chicago.cityofchicago.the service is lovely, attentive yet unobtrusive, meals are coursed perfectly, and you never feel rushed..portabella mushrooms were great and the charcuterie was amazing..i did find that he seemed to be recommending the higher priced options..and the flourless chocolate cake was decadent as well.it&#39;s byob and cash only! and worth it!.started with the scallops and mushroom/asparagus apps.briciola a block away is a much better option.i just sampled the new [fresh green] almond &amp; prosciutto ravioli.every time we leave full and satisfied and wonder why we don&#39;t come back more often as the food is so good! it&#39;s also byob.go for the specials, they are always changing and never disappoint!.it was an enjoyable leisurely dinner.we will all likely never go back, but - at the very least- happy to try this local spot.service was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable, giving in-depth descriptions of all the dishes.oh, yes, almost everything is organic and natural produce.the restaurant  is both clean and tidy--despite having limited space- all the staff members there greeted me with smiles as warm as the gnocchi  they serve there."
trike-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trike-chicago-3,1,"I got a bonus apple with my delivery tonight, which i consider to be a legit bonus.the atmosphere is laid back, and the sushi is tasty too! i have ordered delivery multiple times and it is always very quick.the restaurant has been pretty empty both times i&#39;ve been (for sunday lunch), which is odd considering how busy all the other restaurants in logan square are on weekend afternoons.delivery is always quick.space is good and tables arent as crowded as other sushi places (and they are not usually at capacity).i usually get the panang curry which is flavorful and full of vegetables.no other artwork or anything else.adorable!.my sister and i ordered some sushi and pad noodles and it was warm and delicious..i usually rate a thai place by their pad thai - it was so mediocre here.i&#39;m still a fan!!.the second time i ordered the beef noodle soup and it was delicious.i have also gotten take-out on numerous occasions, which is also quick and reliable.both noodle dishes were bland.i&#39;ve been to several thai places in logan square now, and trike is right up there as one of the best.the food was very good, but delivery was 40 minutes late...we ordered crab rangoon, spicy crispy noodle and garlic fried rice.lots of variety..food , debatable.consistent, quality dishes and sushi every time! menu has a lot to offer and the atmosphere here is relaxed.clean facilities.just go.ordered delivery with my parents last wkd at trike.i like it when i go to a restaurant and the rice is in a bowl and you spoon the curry and vegetables on top..i can&#39;t say enough about this place..i&#39;ve frequently visited trike because it&#39;s right in my neighborhood, i love the byob aspect and the service is always friendly!   the dragon roll is my go to and i love trying some of the chef specialities....had the red curry, which was ok - decent spice, but again in a very watery sauce.this is a nice little thai/sushi spot.i loved these and gobbled 3/4 of the order down.the sushi i had was just average.the other times, i was (1) disconnected repeatedly, (2) nobody answered the phone although the restaurant was open, and (3) the food just never showed up and i gave up calling to check on it.don&#39;t come here unless you have a couple of hours to spare and a great amount of patience on an empty stomach.been here twice.however the one time i&#39;ve eaten there and ordered the pad see ew, it was really bland and chicken pieces were too chunky and not appetizing.food: decent, not spectacular.i would highly recommend the blueline and logan square roll - they are delicious :).we went on a friday night and they had a jazz guitarist filling the air with musical magic.the broth was slightly sweet, fragrant, and light in flavor, and while i typically prefer a more beefy heartiness to the flavor in my beef noodle soup, i found this a pleasant departure from the norm...my boyfriend had the beef soup and like it too! prices are very reasonable and we left very full! they offer lots of sushi too that looked beautiful but we didn&#39;t try that.it&#39;s thai.super good beef noodle soup!  the broth was rich with flavors other than salt and their homemade hot pepper sauce made for a great final taste..food and service is amazing.the water is infused with cucumbers.prices are really reasonable.happy to have a local spot to satisfy my thai food cravings.the pad thai was ok, not great but good..nothing bad to say.the staff was very friendly and attentive.perhaps it was my fault, ordering sushi from a thai place, but from the reviews, i expected better..i&#39;ve also tried most of the curries and i think they are outstanding:  flavorful and full of fresh vegetables..i ordered a spicy miso which was somewhat bland, the gyoza which was okay and the garlic fried rice which had good flavors but was way too salty, and i love salt.be careful fellows.trike, where have you been all my life.both excellent dishes that left us satisfied and wanting more.soy sauce is all i tasted."
caribbean-jerk-palace-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/caribbean-jerk-palace-chicago,1,"Good flavor a little pricey,  i&#39;ve been 4 times and each time consistent..the lobster!!!! wow!! just wow! aphrodisiac for sure! gotta check these folks out if your in the area one day.the seasoning is on point! i had the jerk chicken and the oxtail with candies yams, green and fantastic mac and cheese..approximately 15 mins.i&#39;ve had good jerk chicken before but i think this maybe my new favorite spot ! highly recommended.lol.really good food.still no order.we&#39;ll be back soon!.honestly, perfect if you ask me, just call ahead of time cus they kinda drag but once you take a bite, you forget all about it.it&#39;s nothing unbearable though.issue #2: after about a half an hour, they hadn&#39;t called my number, and there we&#39;re more and more people filtering in the restaurant..the harddough bread was good but when my boyfriend asked  &#34;what are those.the jerk chicken taco wasn&#39;t on a tortilla but a pita bread which i thought was odd but it ended up being good.i had to try everything and so we ordered the lobster tail, chicken wings, and half chicken dinner where each dinner came with 2 sides along with the rice and beans.keep up the good work and you&#39;ll have a long term customer here.i had there jerk lobster tail.been meaning to write this review for a minute.and that&#39;s after you&#39;ve already waited 30 minutes and paid for your food!!!!!!  (it would be nice to know that before being made to wait for 30 minutes)but the fun doesn&#39;t end there!!!!  then you still end up waiting another 20+ minutes!!!now even further insult to injury, they forgot some things in our order...the people that answer phone get defensive when you ask them to repeat the order to ensure that they wrote the order correctly and to make sure you mentioned everything that you meant to order.i&#39;m from arizona, i travel a lot all over and this by far is the best.good for carry-out orders!.call ahead and order.the cashier was super friendly and recommended a pie and my gawd it was delicious..food is always freshly cooked and delicious.this food is so good it will make you smack the fire out yo mama the yams and mac.the chicken is served on a bed of beans and rice so technically you get three sides with your meal."

got &#39;em.but they had this huge, square ice cube..it was also so noisy that we could hear each other.miles, the singer, must know every song written and is a classy performer......i live in the neighborhood and am so happy this little gem is down the street.definitely a wine bar, not a pizza place, although the pizza is still excellent :).you have to check this place out.i think with some more tweaking, angelo&#39;s could be top notch but they have a lil more work to do.that you haven&#39;t fully taken steps to do so says something about how you do business, what you value, etc.we had a question about a particular wine on the list and she brought over the manager to provide a description.we have ordered delivery multiple times (usually just thin crust pizza and/or a pasta dish) and it&#39;s consistent and tasty..it&#39;s an exquisite and upscale restaurant with fine furniture and a cozy interior, along with tvs playing old classic movies while the bar played sports games.one weird thing though: as fantastic as their dine-in menu is, their take-out/delivery menu is just standard chicago nonsense (wings, beef, etc)..i couldnt eat it.actually i could spend most of my days eating their take on bolognese.albany park needed this!.hector needs to ask the guests what portion of wine they want when taking the drink order we dont mind paying the 20$ glass but at least double check with your guests thats want, everything else was excellent as always.the pizza was amazing.very beautiful!i highly recommend the butternut squash pizza and the asparagus and pesto pizza.&#34;  which was refreshing..at the time it was both an italian and mexican restaurant, and while i can&#39;t complain about the food i ordered for delivery, it was a bit confusing how encompassed both cuisines.wow!! what a great spot! best wine bar in chicago !!the service was amazing i had a few glass of wine(they have over 100 different types) and meatballsmy good friend had the grilled octopus and he loved it !! the place was super clean and very well designed.this cocktail had a smokiness that you would swear could only come from 15 hours of low and slow wood burning bbq yet this is in a rocks glass! absolutely amazing mezcal in this drink and the black sea salted rim was a bad ass touch."

janes-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/janes-chicago,2,"Chicago bless you jane&#39;s.the food and service was awesome.they give you free bread and delicious honey  butter, so bonus points!the boys ordered the burger and some sort of omelette, and i ordered the breakfast burrito.i&#39;m updating this review because the manager was kind enough to reach out and ask me to call.we were welcomed sunday morning with a smile and enjoyed our picturesque morning overlooking the street.brunch is delicious!!!spinach &amp; feta omelette was bursting with cheese!  yes-please!pork belly dish was amazing.which i guess explains why the waitstaff looked completely miserable and dead behind the eyes.the food here is really good and the service is great.the chicken itself wasn&#39;t super flavorful and a little dry.it changes from day to day, is seasonal, and always delicious.meh, whatever, it&#39;s just a bloody mary so it&#39;s fine, but i did find it a little weird.after adding a copious amount of salt and pepper, it was something i would still pass on next time.it was bit $ tho so i&#39;d pass on this...food and service are both a 5.nice neighborhood restaurant, with downtown pricing.absolutely scrumptious.step up the seasoning, teach your cook how to prepare eggs over medium and train your wait staff better because they will make or break your restaurant.a nice place to go if you are in the neighborhood.i had a wonderful experience, baked goods were yummy and i loved the steak, egg and potato dish w yummy sauce.our server, emily rose, was so sweet and adorebale.the food was wonderful.so yeah- we were fine with the food, but definitely not raving about it.my man and i, this is our go-to date night location.came in blind, not even knowing what was on the menu- hoping for a substantial meat-based dish.jane&#39;s is my favorite bucktown brunch spot.i had the bourbon pecan gelato which was just okay.bowl of fruit same story.your owner could have still have made good on the offer to replace an appetizer and i wrote her a letter to suggest it.can&#39;t wait to come back!.the omelet itself was huge and stuffed with feta.yea i know what you&#39;re thinking - quinoa vegetable burger?? i was surprised myself but for a vegetarian burger, this is hands down the best..i&#39;ve been vegetarian for 20 years, and i eat out a lot: jane&#39;s homemade quinoa-vegetable burger is the best veggie burger i&#39;ve ever eaten..i visited ~1 mo ago.bland and competent does mean good mashed potatoes.frittatas overloaded with basil and so overlooked, the eggs are dry and unpalatable.wonderful cosmopolitans..second time was ok, but i think that is enough.evidently the lack of concern is filtered down to the employees.definitely check it out if you are in the area and want to switch it up from the crowded 6 corners, and other high traffic areas and still have a good meal with some nice atmosphere.hands down my favorite brunch spot in chicago - we come here a lot! i have had nearly every item on the brunch menu and each one is really good! my favorites are the blueberry pancakes (packed full of fresh fruit) and spinach and feta omelette..and the food was wonderful! it was a great place to host a special event!!!.love this place for brunch! you can get some unique options or high quality versions of your standards.the cocktail menu was very creative..such a wonderful brunch spot..super friendly staff and owners, fresh tasty food and dog friendly outside!  the tuna app to the angel hair pasta - great.i dined on a friday night with my girlfriend and brother.a few years ago they expanded to accommodate larger groups and special events but the local feel and friendly vibe has remained the same.first time bringing my parents for brunch on mother&#39;s day (we always try to go new places for them) now they want to go back!.i can&#39;t thank them enough for being a part of a memorable day for our family.skirted with a small fully in view kitchen and a tiny bar space, jane&#39;s minimal seating and city-rustic vibe makes it a nice selection for a date with your squeeze.my glass sat empty for the 2nd half of my meal.she made it somewhat uncomfortable."
takos-koreanos-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/takos-koreanos-chicago-4,1,"The chicken korea taco was very good.i&#39;m heading there tonight, so we will see if the 4 stars stick!.however, i was disappointed that they weren&#39;t as flavorful as they appeared.the service was great!  quick to respond and friendly even though some of our guests were late.yum!.i highly recommend!.one side of the place has windows that open to the street, although there is a bit of traffic noise, so we choose the other side.they harmonize two vast different cuisines so beautifully.it was stuffed with bulgolgi and kimchi rice (so good!) among other things.i&#39;m no big fan of kimchi but the fried rice i had here made me a believer that i can be swayed, it was bomb!can&#39;t wait to be back in the area and hungry to make another stop here and try something else.attentive and friendly staff! only wish it was closer to home! this will be a must-visit every time i am in the area.didn&#39;t know what this fusion of foods would taste like, but i am sold...solid flavors in the tacos but the quantity of filling was lacking so the ratio of meat to tortilla was off.my personal favorite menu item is the bulgogi burrito meal.place is cash only and byob, so remember to come prepared.spicy chicken; a-okay..oh, and the korean guac was really good as well, served with fried wonton chips!ok, enough about the apps.the burrito meal included a side of guacamole (very good with a small kick of kimchi spice) with chips.happy to see this place open as korean tacos are not prevalent in the land of banks and italian food.it was perfectly seasoned with a spicy chili paste absolutely delicious..can&#39;t go wrong.we started with the beef barba fries, which were actually pretty good.my favorite of these three was the tilapia, a nice big piece of fish, lightly breaded, and perfectly crisp.i went with the tacos as that was the mood i was in.i would probably eat here more often if i didn&#39;t have to think about getting cash before walking in...service?  outstanding.the potato salad that came with it was flavorless also.i was really disappointed in it tho.i&#39;m usually a big fan of korean tacos, but this place just didn&#39;t do it for me..i tend to go hot with my choices, and they tend to be a little bland for my tastes.korean/mexican fusion.game over..**also, as many others have noted, cash only.both were close to my place.2.i am in pittsburgh with another restaurant.wasn&#39;t sure how the fusion concept would work and man did it.the place has a nice atmosphere, clean area, and very good service..well this is an interesting mix of two cultures..the food is great and at a great price point but until they start accepting cards they can&#39;t get that 5 star rating.check out this spot! tacos are amazing.bonus points: they played kpop during our entire dining experience..80! they are byob and don&#39;t charge a corkage fee! there aren&#39;t enough places in this neighborhood that have good food at this price.pretty darn tasty and thinking it could be a good choice for a take away before heading to empirical or visa versa as takos koreanos is byob.kimchi fries were really interesting and the flavors worked well.good tacos, very good service and excellent kimchi rice.overall, though, very pleased and will be definitely stopping to dine-in in the future..the enchiladas are not okay either.you&#39;re are not going to think highly of this place until you get there.and of course for you complainers out there they are still cash only.the horchata here was not as sweet as other restaurants and that&#39;s exactly what i like!our waitress was julie and she was amazing! such a beautiful and kind server and loved how she was so attentive and helpful to us.that sucked, but the food make up for it..the place was decently sized and our group was able to be seated immediately.i had a kalbi short rib taco, a spicy pork taco and the beef barbi fries.i&#39;ve been to a few korean/mexican fusion restaurants.overall, i would recommend eating at the restaurant rather than electing for carry-out, primarily because the food doesn&#39;t transfer as well being placed in a to-go box, rather than being eaten fresh in the restaurant.really tasty and different from all the other places around.i walked in, and the place was packed! i love seeing that.this is by far one of my favorite restaurants in andersonville area..service was a bit slow, especially at the end of the meal, but i think they were probably trying to just give us space.try it, you won&#39;t be disappointed, but don&#39;t forget to bring cash :).great service and outstanding food, i&#39;m a fan, for sure.prove that."

fish-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fish-bar-chicago,1,"Just not cheap and not incredibly hearty.service is always great and the drinks are to die for.i&#39;ve only been here a couple of times, however both times were fantastic.they ended up comping us for one dinner.one of my favorite places to get seafood on the north side.you probably think i&#39;m going to go on some dramatic tangent about how their food wasn&#39;t up to par, but that was not the case at all.the satchmo po boy (crawfish and shrimp) was good but hate how it was plated, literally served in a little hot dog paper container..i liked the red fish sliders.can&#39;t go wrong with $1.it was pretty bland.me and my companion were in the mood for seafood so it seemed like a good place to try.the rest of the restaurant is bar stools.amazing! the clam chowder and blackened redfish were absolutely delicious.atmosphere- really good atmosphere and decor.we celebrated a special occasion recently, and we&#39;ll forever appreciate how the chef tony, manager carly, director of sales shannon, and entire staff made things extra special.s.only downside is that the portions aren&#39;t that large, so if you&#39;re starving order a few things.great for small plates, groups of 2-4, and drinks.she was very attentive, patient, and understanding.great deal for a big ol&#39; load of these round little guys.4.there were about 3 per taco, less than the size of a quarter and drenched in so much sauce/lettuce that i could barely discern their presence.our drinks were served promptly and only took a few minutes to order.my boyfriend and i went here last night and the night started off kind of rough.the hush puppies were really good: perfectly fried, a good combination of tastes.this place is incredible.best decision we made.i am all about praising a place that has excellent food but it seems that the recent trend of the ultra trendy food spot with terrible (flat out shitty) service needs to end.as we left happy hour, our waitress gave us a free &#34;sea-sipper&#34; for our next trip, so we had to come back.amazing staff - super friendly and always there to help you decide on that extra key lime pie ;)i recommend anything here -  the fish special, taco special and of course the tuna tartare.they don&#39;t just tell you their names as a courtesy, but they ask for your name and address you accordingly while you&#39;re there.great service, really solid food, and nice little drink selection.the portions are a little small (small plate style) but you will get full.they need to offer these pickles as a side dish.the oysters were divine, however i wish they were served over ice, didn&#39;t ruin it for me though.couple of things: they only have two oysters &#34;on tap&#34; every day-- sometimes they&#39;re both east coast, sometimes west coast, or one of each...this is a phenomenal sandwich, shrimp, crawdaddys, and garlic bread.), and key lime pie ($6) were cooked properly, and tasted great.on a saturday night, we decided to come here.so here&#39;s what&#39;s good:taste (my po&#39;boy had the perfect flavors &amp; texture!)servicecomplimentary beer samples with your orderhere&#39;s the not so good:portions aren&#39;t fillinga little over pricedmy order was to go and no napkins or silverware left in the bag :(overall i will comeback but wish the portions were a little larger for what i paid.such great food!! i had the west and east coast oysters.always great! everything i&#39;ve ever had here has been fantastic.wowza.i had the cobb salad with a salmon add-on: $18!!!  the salmon was dry, and very salty; i was in a hurry as during lunch break and i considered sending the whole thing back and gone somewhere else.alex was our waitress and she was super attentive and even gave us free raw oysters and complimentary drinks for our next visit! we will definitely be back in the lakeview neighborhood for this dining experience!.) we have tried almost everything on the menu, i will not bore you with all that.oysters!  order them 9-11 pm on mon-thurs or all day sunday, they are very cheap and they are always good.they had a small patio outside but we sat inside at the bar and our server was very attentive.me and my husband found it last summer on accident and it was heaven.the service is phenomenal and the food i&#39;ve had is always on point! the sliders, brussels sprout salad, and hush puppies are all so good! i cannot say enough great things about their clam chowder soup! it&#39;s perfect on a cold day and is so tasty! this place never disappoints and is so worth checking out!..forgot to take off the hush puppies of which they ran out.ehh def not.great food and great service.after a long day at work my girlfriend ordered me dinner from this place thinking it&#39;ll be a good treat giving the reviews just to end up with 2 oz of salmon 3/4 oz of cauliflower soaked in oil along the side with 3 small onions and few sprigs of arugula &#34;yes soaked in oil as swell&#34; we weighted them for fun after we were both shocked when we opened the bag."
old-town-social-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/old-town-social-chicago,1,"We will forsure be back.it&#39;s actually quite a good restaurant, too.good service!  did not order but looked fantastic: cheese curds, turkey swiss sandwich, duck wings.during the week is the best.we&#39;ve been told 3 times in the last 25 minutes &#34;you&#39;re food will be right out&#34;.on the upside, i&#39;ve had desert here before and they have pretty good bingets.i just ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup.this is my kind of place.pros: beet salad is tasty (just not that filling), burgers are solid, ots burger great (comes with aoili, which is not mentioned on the menu), good make-your-own burger with lots of toppings, desert donut with chocolate sauce, excellent and large drink menu (including cocktails, i liked the writer&#39;s vice with elderflower liquor)cons: bar gets noisy when crowded or when games are on, mac n cheese side small and not very flavorful, belgian fries are just regular shoe-string fries (so nothing special), aoili tastes incredibly similar to mayonnaise, used a gilt city voucher and were told of other, non-stated restrictions while trying to use it, prices of all non-burger items too expensive..however i was very disappointed with my meal.after visiting old town social a couple of weeks ago, we had dinner to check out additional items on the menu that caught our attention last time.their charcuterie is made in house, and lemme tell ya, it&#39;s delicious! their bloody marys are also one of the best i&#39;ve found.old town social is a place that is a breathe of fresh air after a long work week to come and unwind..my water glass never got filled.service was awful.i took a cursory glance at the menu before ordering sweet potato fries with a double of the balvenie, totally ignoring the fact that there was a backside of the menu with all their cheese and charcuterie options, a separate menu with specials, and list of signature cocktails/beers.amazed that they don&#39;t have any ports on hand.&#34;the h&#34; was an excellent coctail and our server was so friendly! the overall ambience was great!.a couple people ordered the same drink and said it tasted like vomit.i would definitely recommend that either to share as a starter or for your entree..great food, atmosphere, and service! highly recommend the quesadilla, warm pretzels, and fried pickles! awesome food made with fresh ingredients.love the atmosphere.all the boys and girls that wouldn&#39;t talk to you in high school populate this trendy, dark attempt of a brewpub.just a little pricey.we were seated right away and placed at a candle lit window table in the front area.there are better places in the area with better food and cheaper costs.i used to go here when i was younger and thought this place was pretty great.we had the chef&#39;s choice charcuterie and cheese.don&#39;t go for food (and definitely don&#39;t go for vegan food) but do go directly left to the &#39;library&#39; and post up next to the blazing wood-burning fire, in velvet cozy armchairs and spend your saturday afternoon drinking prosecco and being glad you are inside and not outside.boyfriend had the old town breakfast which actually came with half a sausage and maaaybe two eggs (seemed much smaller).i also think it gets a little &#34;douche-y&#34; on the weekends.we sat down on this weird couch with a table it was kinda cool but also a bit uncomfortable.this review is based strictly on the after hours night scene.the wings were rather enjoyable being pretty meaty and made with a good buffalo sauce.failed to put in our drink order initially and had us re-order, then forgot to enter one of our dishes and told us that we hadn&#39;t ordered it at all when we pointed it out.given that this place is on the wage of yuppieville lincoln park, i shouldn&#39;t have been surprised.yes, today.the biggest downside of the night was that our waitress seemed to be sporting an invisibility cloak for a good portion of the night.place was empty at 11 am so no problem getting seating.maybe i&#39;ll have to get something else next time!.it was a generous and pasty portion for the eight pieces of toasted bread it was served with..i had a great time!."

to choose your own level of salting??anyway, besides sauce and lime, i&#39;ve rarely had to do my own legwork of salting a taco (prob had to do it one other time).their al pastor burritos are the best, and the people who work there are really nice.i&#39;ve had many of the ones from the lists that companies such as thrillist puts out, and nothing comes close.if you don&#39;t try this place for true mexican food, it&#39;s your loss.hidden gem simple mexican joint.only way to make real al pastor.oh don&#39;t foget try the al pastor! it&#39;s the best on the on the northside of chicago.green salsa was good!  fresh cilantro and onions! will be coming back to this place for sure to try more things!.$1.the two things that make this place stand out are the atmosphere and their beans.this is a nice family owned place with a charismatic chef and delicious tacos and burritos.tortas and tacos are great.fast and friendly service..great local spot for no frills tacos.the pastor and carne asada tacos are great.the tacos are delicious, and the people inside are so friendly.delicious!only downside is the place is small with competing televisions and unsupervised kids (at least today anyway) so it was chaotic.i used to work in a restaurant, and i was blown away by how hard everyone was working and how attentive they were to their customers.as always i got the tacos to test the water.so, so good.increible!while this place looks more like something you would stumble into in the wee hours of the morning it&#39;s quite phenomenal no matter what your substance intake.not only is the food great, but the prices are affordable.tuesday &amp; thursday are $1.i&#39;m sorry, i&#39;m not feeling the rave reviews at all.it is a real boon to have reliable taquerias so close to my house, especially on wintry work-from-home days.the food is amazing! i am half asian and look like i could possibly be latino, but am not.enough said! gracias primo!!..go to taco joint for our neighborhood..i am within walking distance of aprox 6 mexican restaurants.it&#39;s become one of those places that i can&#39;t seem to try anything different because what i&#39;ve tried is just so good! the cooks are always friendly and greet me when i walk in making me feel welcome and always ask how the food was as i leave.the front of this taqueria is poorly laid out - there&#39;s nowhere to form a line for the cash register because service desk is so close to the window.parking lot is too small.so glad to have found this place! al pastor tacos are the best in town.their red salsa is not something to mess around with....just coincidently i was leaving the gym on a tuesday and was craving tacos..because i just..i had to run away because it was so good that i wanted to eat everything all night.this is a traditional, family owned and operated mexican restaurant.tasty tacos! the vegetarian option is surprisingly good, too.fresh ingredients and flavorful, perfectly presented  food (burritos that don&#39;t fall apart!) cool staff, fast service, open late.now that i am moving away, i am really going to miss the place.these tacos are amazing!  the flavor and portion size of meat and ingredients outweighs the price for sure.my family loves tacos and tonight, with additional family over, we were in search of a new authentic place for taco tuesday.it&#39;s an unexpected find on this stretch of lawrence ave.one of my favorites in the neighborhood.overall, a good neighborhood taco joint.their burritos have the perfect balance of all of the elements, so it does not become a mess at the end.the carnitas is better than anywhere i&#39;ve had in the city - the service is great and this has become my weekly taco fix during the work week (my office is 1/4 mile away) - i am sad that our offices are moving downtown in early september, out of all the wonderful restaurants  in the area, i will miss primo chucki&#39;s the most!.50 on tues &amp; thurs..solid solid solid no thrill mexican in ravenswood/uptown.regardless, my recent meal at primo chucki&#39;s may have been (among) my top five best mexican meals ever (and i eat a lot of mexican food)!i was greeted with a very enthusiastic &#34;hi! how are you?!&#34; from the kitchen as i entered.primo chuki is very friendly you gotts comebin and say que &#34;pasa primo!&#34;.very yummy! it is traditional taqueria but done well..great mexican spot right by my place....outstanding service, fantastic freshly made sandwich.they are absolutely amazing here and have great flavor!  the reason i didn&#39;t give it five stars is i also had one of my wife&#39;s chicken tacos, and i was not a fan.classic authentic mexican food right around the corner! i heard these were the best tacos in town and although there are a lot of really great mexican joints, this one has a family vibe, quick and friendly service and really good food.food is meh, service is worse."
vincent-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vincent-restaurant-chicago,2,"Everything was delicious and thoughtfully prepared..when we made the reservation, we noted that one of the diners (me) was gluten-free.great place to come with friends where you can actually hear each other and converse.the front of house ruvealed himself as the owner and told us if we ordered our food with him that it would be faster (like it was a secret).stop in for the ambiance by yourself or with a date and let the night go from there.it is expensive but i have never left thinking it was over priced..i&#39;ve been here many times and it never disappoints..our waitress wasn&#39;t just friendly, she knew her stuff!of course a major selling point for me is that they have a great wine list with minimal markups!in other words- this place rocks!!!!!.i often find more pleasure from their small plates vs.give it a try.we then shared the chocolate cake with peanut butter center.it&#39;s a smaller place, but not too small..we all started with the onion tarte (yum!) and then i had the lamb burger - amazing!  it was really delicious and nicely juicy yet cooked perfectly.favorite app: polenta.the food and service was wonderful at vincent.vincent has a great staff and the ambience is great.the soup was interesting, but the meatballs stole the show, crispy on the outside, soft &amp; juicy on the inside.the menu is small but very creative and changing all the time.had an amazing dinner with my husband last night.germain concoction.the owner added one of his favorite to our cheese board..service was solid and very friendly...they never called, which surprised me.our server was delightful and charming, camille.as for the brunch entrees, we ordered the dock worker, grilled lamb burger, and pork belly sandwich.we&#39;ll definitely be back soon!.rip to the dock worker, and to the many sundays we enjoyed there.there isn&#39;t anywhere to stand so that was a bit awkward for 30 min.the whole staff is really terrific!.we&#39;ll be back!.slightly crispy on the outside, but fell apart easily with a fork.no complaints about the food..but then again, i never am.great intimate setting and they have some nice outside seating which is right off clark so you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re right on the drag.ing..interesting decor.usually very accommodating if you don&#39;t, but they get packed quickly and you may miss out.the food was excellent.the three of us went to vincent for dinner.our server was excellent with great banter and just the right amount of attention throughout the meal.in fact they were so good i doubt if the chef would put a poor quality entree on the menu.wouldn&#39;t have been a big deal if there were more space, but there really isn&#39;t much in the way of waiting room.ambiance, food, service, amazing.love going here with my partner for date nights.staff was super friendly and welcoming, and the food was excellent.a neighborhood stand out well worth traveling for..the burgers are succulent and big.the food is probably on my top 10 of restaurants i&#39;ve tried.the decor of the dining room is lovely (perfect date spot fyi) and the food was fantastic..the service was impeccable and you could time your orders according to the pace at which you ate your meal.the food was great although the place is small and crammed! there was one or two waiters and service wasn&#39;t great.the food is stellar and the feeling there is very welcoming.can&#39;t wait to visit again next time i&#39;m in chicago.the gnocchi and pork belly were both pretty good, but nothing too crazy impressive.to each his own, but i have never had a bloody mary at brunch that had nothing - not even a lemon on lime or olive.the staff is very friendly.everything was noteworthy and the service as always was exception- also went on a double date more recently.starting before dinner with the best mocktail i&#39;ve ever tasted - i just ordered &#34;make it without alcohol&#34;....best posh spot for drinks in andersonville.for my main entre i ordered the white wine mussels and frites.this means that there is a chance you will need to signal to your server that the table needs something, but i&#39;d much prefer that to smiling and nodding that the food is good every 2."

 i have to say this is the best rice ever.good baklava as well! just wished the lunch special on weekends was available &#39;til after 1pm.this is north side gem!!!.this sorta thing never happens so i was in shock.they have a nutmeg/cinnamon/anise flavor to them and are not overly sweet at all..so i went up and finished filling 1 glass of water and as i did only did she point out if i wanted ice in my water which u proceeded to put in the other glass and she took the first glass i filled up and served it to our table as i began to bring the other glass of water i just filled up to my table and unfortunately the table we sat at which was empty still had a few rice grains-thats how our experience was.good food, generous sized portions, and reasonable prices.my wife and i share the kabob kubideh entree which is 2 skewers of your choice of ground beef chicken or lamb kabob.i asked the staff one simple question - is anything that i ordered spicy (hot)..do not be surprised when you see your bank account threy charges more then the price in theis restran, this what happens when i order from them 2 timesthey charge more money.the kashke bademjan  (persian eggplant dip) was very oily and didn&#39;t have enough eggplants or any yogurt on it which almost every persian place i&#39;ve been to did.will definitely be back.service is awkward, you get partially served.we ordered 2 kebab combination plates that included beef koubideh kabob, lamb koubideh kabob, filet mignon chengah kabob, and shish tawook served with basmati dill, basmati plain, cilantro tahini, and yogurt cucumber sauce.i love how casual this place and the quality is the same every time.the service was quick and friendly.you may want to opt out for something a bit sweeter.mamoul - sweet &amp; spicy, something unforgettable.love their lavash bread versus the pita which you can find at any neighborhood mcdonald&#39;s.the wait staff is very attentive, understanding the proper balance between enhancing a dining experience vs.great flavors and  a great value.best persian food in chicago! kabobi is by far the best out of all the restaurants in the city.50 and my first time here - that&#39;s kinda embarrassing - little things like that get a feedback like this - be smarter next time$2.awesome place, delicious fresh food.be careful bc it could be addicting.cozy but no cramped.asks if everything is great and shares a quick laugh.i believe it&#39;s the kabob sultani (?) that my boyfriend and i get every time we come in.if you are in the mood for kabob you can&#39;t go wrong with anything on this menu.love love this place best persian food in town! kabobs are so juicy the rice is delicious and their hummus.very nice.one of my friends mentioned that the owner of kabobi is indeed the brother and at one point in time was the head chef at reza&#39;s so it makes sense.then they brought another order of falafel, and that&#39;s when the confusion began.i was disappointed in the hot sauce though.if they had a unique innovative dish that i could keep coming back for, that would be the cherry on top! i found most of their food tasting the same - which isn&#39;t a bad thing!.after visiting rezas, noon &amp; kabob, pars and others i decided to try kabobi.persian salad (cucumbers, tomatoes, parsley, onions, tossed with olive oil and lemon), a small side of falafel, baba ghanouj, and lamb kabob with dill rice.the food is almost identical to that of its infamous sister dining restaurant &#34;rezas&#34;, but with a more traditional persian presentation with the layout of plating (rice/meat over the rice).delivery took longer than the estimated time, but the food was well worth the wait! the falafel was well seasoned and slightly spicy, the meat on the kebabs were tender and flavorful, and the dill rice was plentiful and delicious.very good quality.the food far exceeded any expectation - everything was phenomenal!and the service was on point..very good.the hummus is out of this world, one of the best you&#39;ll ever have.my wife and i make an effort to go here at least once a month.only complaints are i don&#39;t want to pack leftovers myself and cheap styrofoam to go containers need to be improved.stop reading this review and go!they do a lot of carryout too, but the service is so good, i&#39;d eat in.chicken lentil soup and baklava are also delicious.kabobi is basically the same thing (just as good) but much more casual.the meat is flavorful and succulent.awesome kababs, persian rise, and hummus.love the skewer combo of chicken thigh and filet mignon.and for $7, we got boneless chicken, well-seasoned ground beef, a mountain of basmati rice, hummus, pita and salad, and all of it was amazing.hubby plowed through his meal.3) hummus ($4.huge portions of dill rice with choice of two kinds of kabobs- i&#39;ve tried the lamb, beef and chicken and i think the chicken is best.its good.( please when you order check your account same day and after 2day and take pictures for proof)i have pictures for my proof account before &amp;rafter the order.by the way its very large portions but it so good, you wouldn&#39;t want to share it :)and don&#39;t forget to get a tea, after!.definitely can&#39;t wait to go back ! plus we went on new years day evening time was so crowded but it&#39;s a holiday and i like to believe crowded is good! my albanian friend recommend this place saw a picture on her snapchat and asked where and few hours later we went!.i showed her my order receipt and requested for the dessert a second time she promptly took my receipt and the it in the trash.i&#39;m so embarrassed! i&#39;m never ordering from this place again!  we called twice giving our address and they kept saying it will arrive in 15 mins then we called again after 20 mins and they said that they never got our order and was thinking of a different order when they spoke to us but somehow managed to charge my card twice! we talked to the owner and he was very apologetic but that doesn&#39;t fix our frustration.kabobi is absolutely amazing, their food is perfectly seasoned, perfect blend of spices and huge portions! the place itself is not the nicest and the neighborhood not the greatest but believe me the food makes up for where they lack."
sink-swim-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sink-swim-chicago,1,"The 114 old fashioned and harpoon fizz were the standouts as well as the white wine that was suggested to be paired with our food choices.and incredibly boozy drink.was over beans and had sourdough soaked in vinaigrette and green beans on top.the food was all very tasty.just had the oysters/octopus/crab cakes.boy, am i glad we did.served with oversized brioche.we ordered a couple drinks which they have a nice selection and the house white wine was amazing.for what it&#39;s worth, both dishes would&#39;ve been really good if the flavoring was just toned down a notch.i wish i could remember which oysters we had.chips are bulky and again if sharing this large plate with 3 people, you each get 1 small fish and 1 large chip.we traveled to chicago from ohio just for one night.you are probably not as gullible as me, so don&#39;t order the shrimp toast expecting giant prawns laying on bread.i am just not into the whole gastronomical experience of having such a small plate.i had the fish and chips, which was good but not a standout.also, props for the cleaniest bathrooms of anywhere i&#39;ve ever been which is always nice for us girls!i highly recommend their spicy summer cocktail which is like nothing you&#39;ve ever had and will keep you thinking about it for days as well as the funky spanish maeloc cider they have on tap.i almost ordered another serving because it was so good!.you get about 7 of these little guys and they are a fantastic appetizer.ambiance is cute kitschy retro, food was better than okay, service was terrible.i am not sure what all the hype is about besides that it is the &#34;cool place&#34; in that area.very nice atmosphere and friendly &amp; attentive servers.get ready to hold the candle up to the menu!.for the entrees, we went with the fish and chips and the spaghettone..o.i hope something can be done about that.the food was just ok - this might have been because of restaurant week.attempt to beat &#34;the champ&#34;.my bill was unexpectedly adjusted to deduct the price of the sorbet after my waitress, risa heard my thoughts.the evening ambiance was very warm..great space, cool vibe...the oysters were so fresh and delish.easily managed to get a table despite being a friday night.the lighting is dim and there is seating at tables up front, and bar and booth seating behind.the drinks are also expensive.however, it wasn&#39;t posh or pretentious and the vibe, overall, was approachable and easy-going.the menu mostly consists of a lot of seafood favorites that our perfect for seafood lovers.uncomfortable chairs.highlights were most definitely the shrimp and the parsnips, which i would say are must haves.i must got not be hip enough.pasta alla chittara had great potential and flavors, just disappointed a bit with the amount of smoked octopus for $18..the red sauce it came with was also yum.no waits! but that might not last forever.the cocktails when not made properly and the food was lackluster at best.or less slab of fish, and 3 head on shrimp in a small bowl.the squid ink seems intimidating, but honestly my assumption was correct in that the ink itself has no flavor and sink | swim merely dressed it up with a little salt and probably garlic.another way of saying it is, in my opinion, the dishes we tasted were good, but were just missing that wow factor that justified the price we paid.fish and chips was so flaky and wonderful, but the humongous chips were just a little too big to munch on.all great.added to the &#34;willing to travel for deliciousness&#34; list.for the small dishes i think we tried the smoked parsnips, shrimp toast, and a broccoli dish and split the poached sole as our large dish.there may be a lot of words i didn&#39;t recognize on the menu, but the wait staff was kind, attentive and not pretentious in the slightest.subtle and perfectly textured the entire way through.when you wake up the next day craving the seafood dinner you had the night before for breakfast, you know it&#39;s good! everything was amazing, but the broccoli, fish &amp; chips (normally not a fried food person, couldn&#39;t get enough) and cod really stood out to me.pecorino cake - no good.the food is good but it is quite expensive and i don&#39;t think the price matches the value of the food."

(which can be a hard thing to come by in this area.it&#39;s nothing complicated or fancy, but it&#39;s light and really good.they rendered the fat from under the skin nicely, but the cole slaw was wilted and they used the worst bbq sauce- open pit.i really enjoy this place.the chicken fell off bone.as it being a &#34;chicken&#34; wrap, you&#39;d think it would be the star of the meal.they have fresh spinach leaves, romaine, mesculin mix and for the less adventurious.i guess the &#34;salad bar&#34; part is where customers make their own salad, because all the fixings are facing outwards.fast delivery, reasonably priced, and honestly some of the best chicken i have ever eaten.def eat here!.the soups are delicious too!.no other place has grilled chicken like this.the salad bar has ample fixings.i&#39;d say hit this place!.always fast, friendly, and tasty! the chicken is simple but flavorful.the seating is typical cafeteria style furniture but it&#39;s colorful and kept exceptionally clean.i&#39;ll try it once again but i have my doubts..:(.my new go to chicken joint and they deliver! yea boi!.their soups are delicious and the salad bar is always fresh.the chicken was dry with little seasoning, and the mac &amp; cheese was very bland.it is juicier and seasoned better than the roast chicken that you would get at a jewel or grocery store, i find them to be too dry and salty..i finished the entire thing in one sitting, which is unusual for me.the salad bar here has a variety of different veggies.they do deliver.the chicken was delicious.i love the place...the staff is friendly.i go all the time every week and i am never disappointed!!!."

seoul-corea-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/seoul-corea-chicago,1,"Service is fine but the place is really small so it can get very crowded.the soondubu tofu jigae (spicy stew with seafood) was delicious, filling and not overly spicy..not that healthy.nevertheless, i find it much better than some korean restaurants in wicker park or lincoln park.it was beyond my expectation.my wife and i have eaten here a few times, always order something different, and have never been disappointed.the first restaurant i went to around uchicago.however, the service can be a little slow.seoul has gone under new management a few times over the years, but it was my introduction to real korean food.after a bit of explaining she told me to get the bibimbap that came in the cast iron type skillet.i paid $17 for a half-cooked egg and some rice that barely covers one takeout box- this price is ridiculous and much too expensive! they are not organic etc to be charging this price! do not go!.i&#39;ve been here a couple of times and will go again..:/.i think i may need to find a place with a some kind of &#34;star system&#34; for spiciness, as un-spicy korean food is simply a non-starter.the byob is always a plus in my book!3.and yes, the food is over priced for the experience.decor is minimal but clean.i love this place.the bulgogi and other dishes are fine, but it&#39;s obvious that they&#39;re trying to cut the bulgogi with lots of veggies and other stuff to bring down the price.the owner has been always nice to us and for me its one of the best places to eat around uchicago in a cold day.wonderful mom and pop korean restaurant and a hyde park gem...in silence.prices were descent, maybe a bit on the expensive side.(i personally think that if your party size is beyond 6, at any restaurant, you should always contact in advance.this is a great eat spot for vegetarians! very small and intimate.we once sat for twenty minutes before anyone took our order.i loved it! it reminded me of a small restaurant outside of my old post in korea! this is a must try.$12 for bibimbap is really ridiculous.it is authentic...hi: delicious authentic foodlo: too quiet?.however, the owners make the food themselves, and you can definitely taste the home-style cooking behind their dishes.i got my first-ever hot stone rice bowl, and poked at it.again, great food but you can get almost twice the food for that at other korean restaurants..exactly the same menu lower prices.they packed on so much vegetables and barely any rice or meat.great for dinners with friends.this is one of those places you want to become a &#34;regular.it stays crowded here and has a small cozy atmosphere, so good luck finding a seat!.i get a craving for both every few weeks, and nothing else will do.went again, enjoyed it more the 2nd time and i knew what to expect this time around.i would come here just for a quick casual meal and but probably woudln&#39;t bring a date as the tables are really close to each other and the food isn&#39;t write home to mom about.i really admire this couple for successfulky offering such delicious authetic korean food!  the woman works so hard everyday, and her cooking is incredible!  i&#39;ve tried all the other korean restaurants in chicago, and this one has the best kimchi soup, it reminds me of my mom&#39;s home cooking (she&#39;s korean).we were so angry and left 0 tip, and we will never come here.even in hyde park, there&#39;s plenty of better food options..the bulgogi was great.but the dolsot bibimbap is delicious and the couple running the place are nice (but still offer typical no-frills korean-style service).the place is extremely small, only able to serve up to 20 or so people, but that is part of the charm.that taste was lacking here, maybe in a nod to american palattes, but the food was delicious and authentic enough to satisfy an itch for korean..they literally use hamburger meat in their jap chae and bibimbop.) newly spruced up, new entrance, fresh furniture."
pizanos-pizza-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizanos-pizza-chicago-2,1,"It&#39;s ideal for those who want a quick bite whether you are a tourist walking around millennium park or happen to work downtown.for the pizza, we pre-ordered a half veg and half mark&#39;s special.the serbian bartender was great-very attentive, friendly, and fun.this was the only restaurant open near my hotel after i came in from a late-night flight..we went with a classic - the thin-crust pepperoni.hopefully you can order ahead..i had a young lady and she didn&#39;t appear happy to help me with my order.thank goodness this is far from the only show in town leaving no reason to waste time, resources and patronage on this one.pizano&#39;s has lou&#39;s beat 10 out of 10.i read the staff was rude, at first maybe, but if you bicker with them and respect them, they are real, interesting characters! love the bartender!.really filling and delicious..the sausage didn&#39;t taste great, and the crust tasted a little stale...my dining companion is a fan of deep dish so i knew he&#39;d be anxious for a pizza.i like the atmosphere of this place.had personal &#34;mark&#39;s special &#34;.visiting from buffalo, ny and we walked by and decided to stop in for dinner.salad dressing was italian, but very mild, good, but i expected more of a red wine vinegar dressing which would have made it even better.what a magnificent, kind hearted human being..not bad.visiting the city from out of town or for the day? take your group to this great pizza and pasta place! we send our out of town guests here instead of uno&#39;s because of the thin pizza and selection of other great stuff.i&#39;ve heard locals come here for thin crust pizza.it was still good, just slightly unexpected..i&#39;ll go 3 stars, but only because yelp doesn&#39;t let us do half stars.and to end this extremely delicious pizza night we had the deep dish cookie with ice cream.i was pleasantly surprised by the good lobster ravioli and spinach ravioli.where i&#39;m from you don&#39;t store pizza in a warming oven and serve it like a hamburger.i kept thinking that the crust reminded me of a pizzelle made of flour and water.the table i was seated at was in a corner and was tiny, but could&#39;ve just been a function of being a party of two during a busy lunch hour..i guess yelp is a little high with it&#39;s rating of 3 1/2 stars.no apology from the driver..i&#39;m not coming back.deep dish did take about 30-40 minutes to cook as they promised.we sat at the bar,which wasn&#39;t busy.ordered a pizza at 11:11pm last night.which just masked flavors of the sauce and everything else.i went on open table and reserved a table so we could eat right after a day at the museum and park.staff is very cool and friendly.it makes sense because it is always full of people, mostly families with kids, so as long as you&#39;re not planning to go for a romantic date, it is very recommended.i am very disappointed ."

love their rice platters, pho, spring rolls, che 3 mau, everything!!!! everything is made fresh daily and they are very kind to let you know a head of time if your dish is going to take awhile to cook due to demand of certain entrees.this is disappointing, as the whole draw to this place is a crowded, cheap, high energy place for pho and a few other secrets that keep you guessing.tank noodle is fairly large and hard to miss since it&#39;s on the corner.extremely fast service.the taste of asian culture in chicago is not found in the tinsel-for-tourists chinatown -- it&#39;s squarely set on a 3-block stretch of north broadway in the uptown hood.food was delicious.fried egg rolls were delicious (use fish sauce for dipping).a+.the crepe thing with shrimp and veggies was super good so definitely get that!!also, it did not make me feel to well after we left.one thing i really love was the their menu book because of the binding and finishing.i also never pass up their spring rolls and get a different smoothie every time i visit, but my all time favorite is avocado :)pros: fast service, great food, outside red line argyle stop, near vietnamese groceries which sells fresh produce and a variety of seafood selectioncons: long wait, come in before the lunch rush, parking.go to dong ky at 4877 n broadway stchicago, il 60640.however, they gladly and apologetically made him another entree of his choice, and his meal was free!.i am guessing that chicagoans are missing out on the real authentic vietnamese food if they claim this is the best vietnamese restaurant in town.you can never go wrong with their curry chicken.it was fine.was a frequenter of this restaurant as they have great pho options, by this last visit is absolutely the last visit for me! their service has never been particularly great.i visited and had a giant bowl of beef pho with everything possible in it..they also give you a shit ton of watercress.the portion is big, they give you lot of meat!never had bad service here!!.hands down best pho in the city and the location is very interesting as it is in the thai area which makes eating there even more authentic!.pho + extra meat, authentic and very good.the papaya was worse, it tasted incredibly watered down..the broth at tank is darker than many toilet bowls.i&#39;m too afraid to eat uncooked sprouts because it&#39;s prone to illness and i don&#39;t like mint leaves.haha.boy, was this place delicious.the waiter will be waiting there till you are ready to order.my boyfriend ordered a beef stew with bread.their pho is like another pho place.went there on a friday night a couple weeks ago with my friend.though we were lucky enough to get a small table in the back.also, i&#39;m pretty picky when it comes to good vietnamese food (mama le&#39;s home cooking spoiled me).bonus points for having an outdoor patio during summer!..competitor pho 777 is located just a block east down west argyle.my vermicelli dish was also quite tasty and had lots of vegetables - i had so much leftover that it filled up an entire to go container.the xl bowl was not as big as i thought it would be and the broth was a bit too sweet for my liking.) we told the waitress and asked for the correct one.me and two of my girlfriends went there for a brunch, we ordered two appetizers(pork eggrolls) and a vietnamese pancakes; 1 extra large beef pho, 1 beef bread, 1 beef rice(with shrimps too); comes up the total of about $53.i&#39;ve been known to get a train up there by myself from the south side where i live just to satisfy my pho cravings.yep.meat is also pretty tough.it is not bad but sometimes i can understand why they had some health and safety issues at the restaurant......the noodles were the highlight though.not to say it was bad, it was not, but i wasn&#39;t sure it was worth the extra effort to come here.the broth was very rich and after adding all the veggies into the bowl, it felt like home!i enjoyed the che 3 mau and my friend who has never had it before compared it to halo halo.this place seems to get alot of attention from my non-fob friends.we originally wanted to go to sun wah to have duck but had no idea they closed on thursdays.i understand tank noodle is more convenient since it&#39;s the closest to the train station but it&#39;s definitely worth it to walk 2 blocks to uptown.but it&#39;s kind of all in the experience and never bothers me that much.overall, the food was authentic and standard vietnamese, but i will say i wasn&#39;t expecting the small pho to be $11.this place is huge; i&#39;ve never been to a vietnamese restaurant that&#39;s bigger, so that means there&#39;s lots and lots of tables.good portions.this place is alway packed and that&#39;s because the food is delicious, the portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable.when expressing my grievance, they assured me it would only take 10 minutes to make my dish, but by that point i completely lost my appetite."

sunda-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sunda-chicago-2,1,"Be sure to order their bloody mary and diy!..coworker got the sunda poke and i got the salmon bento box (which came with miso soup, seaweed salad, spicy tuna roll, and teriyaki salmon on a bed of rice).i look on their website today and clearly see that sunda social drink menu from 3-6pm (i was there before 6pm).i usually always end up here for a special occasions..it was filled with savory juiciness and was also presented nicely..i went with the miso soup and the spicy tuna with crispy rice.adobo braised pork belly:  once again, sunda, has taken my nanay&#39;s recipe and somehow modernized it.the rolls we ordered were the lobster summer roll, i would definitely order this again.fish was fresh, about average quality grade.the service is great, though a  bit slow because of the amount of traffic they get..it was good.try the spicy edamame as well.the tuna was also served first way before before the unagi.enjoyed the vibe and water.it did come but no spoon.going to the restaurant is a great experience...the hype here -- is not real.i asked my server for some recommendations on sake - he provided a couple great options so i went with a flight of three (junmai/tokubetsu junmai nigori/junmai ginjo)..nice atmosphere and interior decoration; waiters were also dressed impeccably well, but don&#39;t think i&#39;ll be returning.and they do have outside seating.their bibimbop was good, not memorable but pretty authentic.brussel sprouts salad: my favorite vegetable shredded into a wonderful salad that all the men of the table even enjoyed..i&#39;m sure they have a lot of other great things on the menu, but the crazy rice is definitely a gimmick and a huge rip off!.very busy even at 9:30pm.the food here is really good and well executed..i would come here again.we ordered the crispy brussel sprout salad, shitaki edamame dumplings, and bang bang salad.amazing food as always! we had a 5:30 reservation and we were promptly seated.i ordered the panang chicken and my wife order the bibimbap, both were delicious! especially the panang chicken, it tasted amazing!overall the food was good, the service was somewhat awkward (they claim they were understaffed that day.all the food here is pricey (take note of the 3 $$$), and the presentation is pretty fancy, however i tried a lot of my friends&#39; dishes and the only one i really liked was the brussels sprout salad.i recommend a few visits, a couple of plates at a time and make sure you pair with a cocktail! you won&#39;t regret it!!!!!!also a great date spot if you want to show him/her you know one of the hottest places in town! don&#39;t be shocked if you spot a fellow blackhawks or cubs player, and maybe an actor or two!.so far, sunda is my favorite restaurant in chicago.i really would like to give this a 3.note - we were unable to split the bill.i was wrong! :) we trusted in our waitress to bring out some of her favorites and she did not disappoint.for dessert we got the green tea donuts to go and those were yummy as well.great taste to it.food is fresh and delish.the bao pork buns were phenomenal and had the table going crazy.once my crazy rice came, i was famished.overall, nice ambiance, decent food with plenty of variety and options, but underwhelming.the location is trendy and the fusion food and decor makes it a great place for an office outing or even a date.the food is just amazingfor you yelper there if you come this place you most order the blood marry i have never have nothing like that u.with all that you may find my find my next recommendation odd, but do yourself a favor and sit at the bar on a night when nahm kim is working, he is not only an awesome mixologist but also a gentleman and a perfect host, you won&#39;t be disappointed!  after our first visit a week earlier he still remember our name, we will be back every week while working in the windy city!.the food tastes fine, although it&#39;s not super creative asian fusion per se..the brussels are to die for but we enjoyed pretty much everything that we ordered.the okay- the duck with kimchi was not awesome.sunda has been one of my favorites for the past two years! the ambiance has a very cool vibe and the service is excellent.it is kind of loud.our water glasses filled and a server at our table within another minute.soooo good! also the dynamite roll.the things we did get were delicious and dangerously overpriced, lol.as you know from my former review, we were blown away on our first visit here back in the spring.the longevity noodles are a must-have as are the hand rolls that seem to change from time to time.(1/21/2013)kicked up asian food and a &#34;fancier&#34; version of the home-cooked pinoy meals that i am used to.we had miso ramen, duck buns and the soft shelled crab benedict.had a decent lunch a few months back atmosphere is beautiful and the sushi was decent.the lighting was dim and moody.this is a spot to check out!!!.i was too full to try anything else."

their beet salad is to die for!.service is not very desirable, even on a mom and pop shop level.we went here on a friday night and i must say this place is extremely overrated.i really liked this place.the staff is wonderful and attentive even at the busiest of times.i have eaten here twice.i highly recommend shokran.wonderful food that was very authentic to morocco.the service and people here are also very engaged with their customers and this is reflected also by the peacefully themed atmosphere(if you&#39;re eating in).just wanted to reaffirm my love for this place! i have returned a few times a year for the past three years, and friends are always super impressed when i bring them.the moroccan sausage was very good and had a nice spicy flavor.it is amazing..we were welcomed to our table with a basket of warm pita, some spicy red sauce and a container of olives.unfortunately, it&#39;s cash only.m liked that the lamb wasn&#39;t &#34;lamb-y.wonderful people and delicious food.please do not waste your time or money here.first time we had moroccan food and would surely go again, weather it was the appetisers or the tangerines all were very good and the service comes with a smile, all in all a very pleasant experience.good atmosphere as well..byob and reasonable price points make this place worth checking out but i won&#39;t be back.place is not that good.not a problem at all.and then ask your waiter about when they serve it in morocco and who makes it and how.i enjoyed the experience of trying moroccan food.i wish they gave you the option to control the sugar.we had the marrakech lamb tagine,  the cook spinach appetizer (don&#39;t remember the name), the kefti meatballs, plus for dessert some moroccan cookies and the poached pear thing.not a welcoming attitude from staff and is only cash!  good thing there was an atm in the restaurant.we were full after eating that and really didn&#39;t need anything else after that.discover shokran.we had the lamb fez tagine, braised lamb with a sweet and savory sauce studded with dried fruit; royal couscous, an enormous dish of couscous covered by braised vegetables, a lamb shank, seasoned chicken breast and merguez sausage; and the sweet chicken couscous, another huge portion of couscous topped with saffron braised chicken breast with raisins, chickpeas, and sliced almonds.shokran takes reservations--gotta love it! i made the resos a week out and the day of the dinner, they called me to confirm we were still dining and to remind me they were byob--gotta love that too!we opted for a few appetizers to share and each ordered a main.we picked a cozy one with couches and draped fabric along the ceiling.the service matched the food, and it almost felt like we were sitting in a living room having a meal at someone&#39;s home.i had to order that ahead as i don&#39;t think it&#39;s on their regular menu..as for the food, it was pretty solid, but all the dishes we ordered were very sweet!  we had the chicken pastry, sorry forgot the name, to start with.in a weird location but well worth the visit.the ambiance is great; the three different rooms create an intimate, chill, and cozy environment which i really enjoyed (note the creative fabric canopy they installed to mask the drab drop ceiling!)basically, nothing tasted &#34;bad&#34; or was unappetizing, so if you come with an open mind and an appetite and you won&#39;t be disappointed.i think they should bring down the number of people allowed back there.for my first visit today i tried the lamb marrakech and the apricot tart.this is why we wanted to have our anniversary dinner at shokran.very authentic morrocan cuisine , very tasty i enjoyed very bite of my meal , the mergaze is the real deal just like the one from my country ( algeria) , the service was very good also ."

broken-shaker-chicago-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/broken-shaker-chicago-chicago,1,"$89 bill for three drinks and one appetizer will put you back into a funk.i ordered from the special cocktails list, but if i went back, i would order a basic cocktail, like a manhattan or a gin &amp; tonic.i got back to my room nowhere near tipsy.awesome spot!.every time i walk into broken shaker i instantly feel 10 times cooler.it&#39;s good for groups ranging from 2-6, but i wouldn&#39;t take more than that as space to sit would be hard, if not impossible to find..some friends recommended this place and two thumbs up! lively atmosphere, but not overly packed for a saturday night..great cocktails with a twist: balanced interpretations of the classics, daring but again devilicious combinations.tropical drinks abound, if you don&#39;t know what to get, the bartender is super helpful..most importantly though, drinks were great! my girlfriend got the miami vice g&amp;t and i went with the coco puff mint julep.super cool craft cocktails and relaxed vibe.they dont have any happy hour specials :( great atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable bartender.met some friendly people while visiting here, stop in and have a drink, you won&#39;t regret it.fine relaxing lounge environment for a long day.there were no seats left at the bar and many of the couches were reserved so we just put a couple chairs together and it was fine.it&#39;s awesome!my husband and i came for a quick pre dinner drink on a wednesday night and let me tell you, it was crowded at 6:30 pm! the vibe is tiki bar without being too cheesy.situated in the back of a remodeled youth hostel, the vibe is cool.both were well crafted.if you want a little quieter space, opt for out front where the dim lighting and seating clusters offer a little more space.however, my bad ass mixologist of the night, trevor, saved the day.i had it with fried yucca.the service was horrible, it took forever to be served, then forever for the drinks to come.other than that, great spot for cocktails!.delightful!.a very cool loungey type cocktail bar! it&#39;s also very big and has multiple rooms with lots of good group seating.around $13 a cocktail which is a little high but worth it.it was incredible.either way it has more of a speak easy feel than your typical chicago drink spot, i&#39;d definitely come back.everything from the décor, to the setup, to the drinks were all amazing &amp; yet very different from anywhere else...we stayed at the bar to chat.so if you&#39;re ever in the area and are looking to grab a bite and a drink, this is great choice.it&#39;s very popular so snagging a table can be tough as the evening gets later.great drinks, very unique selection, my husbands drunk had cloves in the orange garnish.i ordered a chicago politics cocktail in the golden pineapple and it was expensive, but tasty - and worth it! this was a fun bar and i would go there again.willow? both were exactly what we wanted, cocoa and.the cocktails are delicious and the dj was spinning really good tunes all night long.service is thoughtful, however the drink menu harbors rather intricate combinations of ingredients so come prepared with good talking points to pass the time while waiting for your drink(s).they categorically do not split checks for groups, a bit annoying and confusing.like many of the new bars in the area, they have a nice list of cocktails.furnished and decorated with pieces of what i would think that was sourced from a bohemian library garage sale, it works splendidly!it&#39;s nice addition to river north since it&#39;s something i&#39;d expect in wicker park.the old fashioned was no longer on the menu but they still had the ingredients to make it.in fact the waiter suggested a few items off the menu.the service wasn&#39;t the best, it seemed like we only saw the server every 45 minutes, which is strange because it&#39;s a pretty small area and wasn&#39;t busy.the cocktails were outstanding and cool lounge vibes.fun, casual, but classy vibe..highly recommended!.super cute place.i haven&#39;t eaten there a lot but sometimes get appetizers which i would highly recommend.they tasted good but it was the food that will bring me back to broken shaker...about 5 minutes later the server came by and took our drink orders.yo, this place has it.i visited this cool little spot downtown to see a local band called marrow perform.this is a great option for someone who doesn&#39;t want to club in chicago or wait forever to be served.cozy atmosphere,  great music and good cocktails..definitely one of the best cocktail bars in chicago, if not the us.i&#39;ve been to broken shaker in miami plenty of times over the years so when this popped up on my yelp i had to stop in.with a wide selection of drinks, life-sized jenga, and a chill atmosphere, this place is really wonderful for a non-rowdy night.we were acknowledged and handed a menu right away and it was easy to order even though the place was packed.this place has a really cool vibe.there was enough background chatter and noise to avoid silent moments and it was quiet enough so that you could hear the person across from you.this is the best place for drinks in the city.definitely extraordinary cocktails for 13 bucks, a bit pricy but worth a try  (i went for don&#39;t kill my vibe - was not disappointed).i recommend ordering old school drinks off the menu rather then trying theirs.loved the atmosphere!  it was laid back and comfortable, but still nice.there were so many lovely people gathered here for a tuesday night.excellent drinks! mixology at its best! i loved every drink i tried..overpriced..adios!!!!.we walked in not knowing what to expect."
wilde-bar-and-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wilde-bar-and-restaurant-chicago,2,"It&#39;s rare these days! we were offered a dessert on the house but we declined because we were too stuffed.the latter is unbelievably rich and filling..the use of virginia baked ham and a mystery ingredient below it gave the dish a sweetness that was not pleasant in a benedict..don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s decent, but oftentimes felt the quality could be turned up a notch.fantastic food (personal votes for the reuben, shepherd&#39;s pie, and the chicken curry!!), good service, great portions, beautiful setting, reasonable prices.also the open windows on a nice day is a great touch.the atmosphere is great for any book lover (or really anyone who wants to feel cozy), and the mac and cheese is life changing..was served cold and not very satisfying.menu was fairly large with lots of options to choose from! the staff was friendly and took care of us in a timely manor.start with the cheddar artichoke dip and your meal can&#39;t go wrong.it&#39;s nice too, because every plate that they bring out that&#39;s gf has a little flag stuck into it so that you know for sure you&#39;re getting the gf version.she kept our table of 4 entertained and the wait for our food short!ask for fiona-she&#39;s got your back!....the food is solid.i&#39;ve been here twice, and both times the service has been great.it can get a little crowded during peak hours which sometimes has influence on the quality of food.love this place!  food is great, the price is right and the staff is always amazing!!  try the buffalo chicken.had dinner here last week and everything was great! chicken pot pie and meatloaf was really tasty and cesar salad was a great addition to our meal.food: excellent..if you aren&#39;t planning to stop in and eat.large portions.this is also by far the best sports bar in the immediate neighborhood.our waiter, ian, packed it up for us to take home..i had the crab cake appetizer, which came with a small portion of arugula and pear salad - just enough for a light dinner..it was absolutely delicious and the serving was a generous size.i finally stopped by here the other night for dinner with a friend.friends had a reuben and the grilled cheese/soup combo.it comes with 2 pieces of bread, and a generous portion.portions are generous and the food is well prepared..that is too long: if you&#39;re in the neighborhood, this place deserves a visit more often than once every three years.the artichoke cheese dip appetizer is insanely good, and an enormous portion even for three or four people.wasn&#39;t the greatest food i had the chicken club and my mom had the steak salad..pretty extensive beer menu..also the artichoke cheese dip is great for a couples appetizer while sipping on a variety of beer flights suitable for any meal.germaine, and champagne it was awesome.went to wilde a couple weeks ago with a few friends and it was a fantastic expirence.will be back for another experience!.overall the experience was good, but the food took a very long time to come out.i came here for the 4th with a few friends and it was really good times.absolutely love this place.i ordered the chef burger which was a caprese turkey burger.i touched oscar wilde&#39;s.we had a really good time and will probably go back, but it&#39;s not at the top of my &#39;must got back!&#39; list.it&#39;s soft and creamy and with the wasabi allele?--forget about it!  with the cold rain we went for comfort food.showed up before the lunch rush and was seated right away by then took 12 minutes for the waitress to show up..they also need a lot of reminders to bring more water, the check, etc.ate, drank and enjoyed a wonderful evening.menu highlights: curry chips (fries), cobb salad and burgers.our waiter was very nice.wilde indeed..if sitting at bar, bartender tends to forget about you.i want to love wilde.literally some cooked dough sparsely topped with goat cheese, tomatoes and basil.they do have brunch specials, $8 mimosas are pretty solid.beautifully comfortable library-like decor.so kind, attentive and fun!aside from the excellent ambience, come to see molly!!!! can&#39;t wait to come back!.after a small sample, i already had high expectations by how good it was.wilde is always a pleasure-- competent service, great drinks, fun atmosphere (especially when it spills out onto the sidewalk on a gorgeous day like today), and creatively executed pub-food-with-a-twist.taste like old england.food here is constantly mediocre."
tweet-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tweet-chicago,2,"Great good, fun and courteous service.place looks nice from the inside and the staff is really friendly as well.probably one of the best bisquits and gravy i have ever tried and definitely the first vegetarian one...come hungry, leave happy! (that&#39;s already someone&#39;s slogan isn&#39;t it?).so my two friends who are childless invited my husband and son over here when we were visiting from ca.we had to wait for about 40 minutes before being seated, but the whole experience was just worth it.the atmosphere is casual and welcoming..it&#39;s ok, but i&#39;m missing the reason for raves.he even added a little twist to the first one with fresh berries that was purely his idea.the hollandaise sauce was fantastic.great service, great food..just the right amount of good comfort food.i&#39;ve only had the breakfast foods so far.communal dining isn&#39;t for everyone and sometimes you just want to have a private conversation with the person you&#39;re with without random people being all up in your business.it&#39;s soo good yummyyy delicious.definitely that was too much food.breakfast portions are huge and the price is very cheap for the food quality..i hope they address this issue!.the entire time we were there he was very attentive and made sure we were never thirsty.oh and our server rex was the best!just beware this place is cash only.i had the tofu scramble and it was really good.coffee was offered, but we refused, having already had our caffeine fix in the morning.apparently this is how brunch is done now, lots of food and cocktails! can&#39;t go wrong!it&#39;s also cash only and they do carry out orders.delicious food, prompt and friendly staff..i appreciate that they have awesome vegetarian and gluten free options.great food, great service.cash only!.come hungry! they start you off with this cinnamon flavored bread cake thing- *drool*.we have been to this place a thousand times, we attempted to go recently and it seems like the restaurant changed management.they take our names to their list and send us over to a busy bar section to wait.crab cake benedict and of course some biscuits and gravy will always hit the spot.good food and good atmosphere.the apple filling side was in nice in theory, but not extremely palatable.what a delight to find this treasure!love everything about it.our server was the most pleasant experience of it all, kind, warm, and attentive (a primarily spanish speaking older gentleman).we&#39;ve been twice and will certainly be back.the gluten free menu was extensive and everything on it tasted amazing.the staff is amazing, the food is always on point and it&#39;s simply a staple in not just uptown but in chicago.i&#39;m a big guy and i still split the meals.i felt kind of bad about it, but that was a really stupid policy on tweet&#39;s end.i had the omelette with apple in it and i ordered a monster bloody mary.&#34;  i also got an order of eggs scrambled as well as some hash browns to sop up the gravy.i have been here a few times.atmosphere, good.huge size and the chipotle mayo was perfect.my friend really liked the chilaquiles.try the breakfast burritos! serves intelligentsia coffee! awesome service too!.my husband got the burrito #8 - dirty man w/ lots of different meats.my favorite part was the waffle! so fluffy and done just right! and that fruit cup everyone talks about is wonderful :)it&#39;s about average price for a breakfast place especially for the city! i&#39;ll totally be visiting again!.i was here for breakfast this morning with two friends of mine after a cute guy in the elevator of my building recommended it to me..i also love that they understand gluten free so i don&#39;t have to blather on about cross contaminationfavorites are chocolate chip pancakes, eggs benedict, spinach omelette and chilaqueles.the food was tasty, service efficient, and the menu extensive (i rarely have so many options for brunch as a vegetarian!)  the place is pretty small, and cash-only - both things to be aware of for first-time visitors.immediately as we sat down, coffee was poured in our mugs.you get a little amouse bouche of sorts - today it was some sort of appley bread which was delish! i ordered the classic eggs benny with hashbrowns and a side of bacon and also a soy chai latte.my friend, who had tried these danish tasties before other places, said they were a bit more dense than he was used to.only drawback is the seating is a bit tight, which can be a little uncomfortable, especially with a little one.they tend to be very busy, so we&#39;ve learned to arrive early."

the owner, staff and food are all amazing.i would eat there every day if i could.pies are great.we also got an order of the deluxe gravy chips which came fully loaded with beef tips and cheese - wow, these were amazing!

we need your flaky pastry, crispy chips (especially with gravy!), your magnificent savory pies and delightful desserts.i had the steak and ale pie and my hubby had mongolian beef.i got the chicken balti pie with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy, to say that this is the best and most fresh food i&#39;ve put in my mouth in a while, would be an understatement.however, the ginger soda here is not overly sweet at all (yet still perfectly appeasing to my taste buds, i promise)..dining area is small so not the best for large groups.add full english to that, thank you very much!!their cooked english breakfast- available sunday&#39;s only was authentic and delicious.will be back, especially late nights!.."

mahalo-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mahalo-chicago,1,"It tasted like uv blue vodka and sprite lol.i went there with my girlfriend for a brunch.got a couple cocktails and beers- all were good but a little pricey.you guys need a hawaiian food consultant? contact me..came in for dinner and drinks on a friday night.the peppers were cooked just right..teehee :p.after my first disappointing visit to mahalo during their opening week, i decided to revisit mahalo with another friend today.more like bathrooms at a bar than at a relatively expensive restaurant.not a very traditional presentation either.i visited mahalo last night to enjoy the weather on the roof and was not disappointed.a lot flavors that you don&#39;t typically get in restaurants.however, i keep hearing about how people are intensely ill after eating here.service at the bar was a little sluggish, but otherwise amicable, and attentive.definitely recommend this place for a couple or a group.i&#39;m not sure exactly what it was (or maybe all of the above), but this dish was not impressive.first vibe was great.it arrived when our drinks were empty.food portions are small, especially for their price.the vibe was nice and so is the decor but the food is over priced.our server was super cool, gave helpful suggestions, and was attentive - bonus points because he said we looked like we were from hawaii.we ordered the big kahuna, a $28 pineapple, rum, piña colada type drink for two.as for the food and drinks.he had us laughing too.the tuna poke was very fresh and a decent sized appetizer.i would go again!.however, we had the kalua pork platter and it was definitely just ok or less than ok.is it a bit pricey?-sure but, given the space and the real estate, the price is justified.it comes with wanton chips and a very small order of tuna.i heard the poke was good, i would go back to try that, otherwise not sure i&#39;d go back.and we were looking for a rooftop deck, which this place had.can&#39;t wait to come back.wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the food but loved the patio and the ambiance.loved it! chicago does brunch right..i love spam.over-priced, though.love the decor and vibe of this place..the team did a great job on the decor and you really get the tropical feel when you walk in there.my expectations for this restaurant comes from my experience at roy&#39;s which serve hawaiian fusion..their rooftop outdoor seating is amazing.."
uptown-pho-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/uptown-pho-chicago,1,"Take a look at my photo of the stew, and pay uptown pho a visit the next time you&#39;re in the mood for something exquisite!.this place is a little off the beaten path by how east it is (almost at sheridan), but it&#39;s worth the trip..the food not only tastes great but has also saved my husband and me from some potentially killer hangovers.it was definitely overladen with lettuce and not enough of the rice noodles that i normally love the most in spring rolls!the service was also very lackluster.the service is also great.the dishes ive tried here were all delicious.just the way she came to check up on us reminded me of how my mom would treat me and my friends at home.went with a friend with the intent of finding another place to get good pho in the city.the crispy shrimp rolls are my favorite, always fresh and tasteful!.cha gio came 3 to an order for $5, and they were crispy but the filling aside was just alright.it was on the sweeter side, as on yelper pointed out, however, i just put in more heat (spice).it was too sweet, and the portion was significantly smaller, and worse i got a huuuge mouthful of gristle.i also highly recommend getting boba smoothies here, they are fresh, cold and delicious.we were glad we waited because the food was amazing.their meat balls are delicious; they&#39;re not the processed, over-salted and fake-looking ones you usually get.i like the beef salad--probably the best that i&#39;ve seen in chicago.my only critique was the eye of round.for example, we [stupid americans] just started eating the tempura by the piece.i suggest if you plan on eating here to dine in.outstanding experience! ask yourself, why do i pay more to dine out, instead of saving cash and cooking in?! quality ingredients, quality entrees, and quality service; that&#39;s why! uptown pho has it all! the rice noodles are the freshest tasting i&#39;ve had in chicago, and the broth is a warm, aromatic nectar that i continue to crave the moment i walk out the door.i like this place over the popular tank noodles.i ordered bun bo hue and hubby ordered xtra large pho.came here for some pho and this placed delivered.he is very friendly and talkative and loves to teach people about his culture and food..the pho broth was a little too bland for me until i spiced it up with chili paste.presentation of all the dishes was very good, everything looked great as well as tasting good.awesome pho (vietnamese noodle soup) restaurant in argyle! it&#39;s a couple of blocks from the argyle red line stop, but it&#39;s definitely worth the walk! after trying other pho places like tank, pho 888, pho 777, and others, this place is by far the best in terms of value and portion! in terms of the broth, it&#39;s similar to the others, but they give you so much meat and noodles! like so much meat! they also give a generous amount of veggies to go with the noodle soup.love this spot, legit pho.the crab rangoon was superb and deep fried to perfection.i bought the yelp deal of $20 for $25 worth of food and went with my boyfriend for dinner.the food was delicious and the atmosphere was cute and cozy..i came by after i got off of the red line from the gig..it appeared to have come straight out of a pre-made/pre-packaged peanut sauce product.not only was the owner/manager waiting outside for me, he insisted i take a few lollipops home with me too.my new favorite pho place in chicago! perfect broth, great service, and clean interior.since we didn&#39;t know the popular way of eating the appetizer, they showed us how step by step haha.recommend!.the spicy shrimp was fantastic with an interesting dipping sauce, but it was served with sweet potato fries that were boring..poof gone! au revoir! adios amigos!  it wasn&#39;t until i turned around and looked at the cook/owner behind the counter that i was able to get the check..overall, uptown pho is a nice change from the more popular destinations with a slightly different take though it didn&#39;t win me over.uptown pho is our absolute favorite spot for some amazing pho and spring rolls! the service and quality are outstanding and prices are great too.we got the uptown pho, which had a great broth, but nothing out of the ordinary.strong smell of incense as i walked in through the door.i&#39;d definitely come back and try other dish.when the place we initially wanted to try was closed, we reluctantly decided to give uptown pho a shot, and we are so glad that we did.but after trying their spring roll and pho the place is legit! they having amazing pork and shrimp spring rolls.the waitress was really patient when it took us a long time to order even though she was the only one working.there is one i gripe i have with the service.i would definitely return to uptown pho before the glut of other similar restaurants for the nice, accommodating service.tasty after the first few bites, regretful after that.nice place and conveniently located a block or so from the argyle redline stop.having that classic pho-noodle bite is a must.i am glad that police were nearby because of the recent murder associated to gangs that occurred just on this area this week...absolutely fresh!  ok, that&#39;s two, but you get it.i&#39;ve tried several of their rice dishes - all terrific.the food was above average.overall, good prices and great portions, but for taste this place falls somewhere in the middle for pho, and so i might end up at other places along argyle in the long run.i kind of felt like i was getting dinner at a stranger&#39;s house, which is pretty weird.we will be back the next time we are in chicago!.both of us thought everything was spot on, delicious and budget friendly! everything was super fresh and well made..byob is nice too.my favorite place for bun bo hue in chicago!.my goto spot for vietnamese! try it if you haven&#39;t! you can thank me later!.the signature dish i had was tasty and filling."
vora-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vora-chicago,2,"And food was double meh.can&#39;t recommend more, much better than sunda or union or the other loop places.arrived on a sunday evening around 8 pm.i continue to await.it&#39;s one of a few places you can get taiwanese cuisine.that&#39;s a big surprise since they are more like a taiwan resturant.e.well, now i feel comfortable giving them 4-stars.so we came in and the food was better and our waiter and the bus boy or someone in training were amazing and friendly....we almost sent the congee back because we thought they brought out the wrong thing.they barely speak english.i called vora to explain what happened.:).the cake had been delivered earlier and they held it in cooler..fortunately they were willing to fix it up.and it was also odd (and a bit annoying) that they served my dish a full 20 minutes before my husband&#39;s dish was served.well, you already guessed the ending.the food came out quickly and tasted great.the seafood lo mein hit the spot.there are seriously too few taiwanese restaurants in the city.but the prices were good, the drinks were yummy, our food came really fast, and the decor is nice and trendy..i ordered a dan zai noodles, but it definitely wasn&#39;t what i expected, although it was fairly yummy..the pricing can be slightly steep for portion of food served.there were also items on their television screens that weren&#39;t available on the menu yet.you must get the pork belly over rice! it is amazing! the xiao long bao (soup dumplings) are delicious as well.i basically got a plate full of tofu and sauce.not traditional taiwanese food! don&#39;t go there!.i&#39;m not saying it&#39;s completely worth the money, however after taking into account its authenticity and the fact that you can&#39;t get taiwanese food as good anywhere in the vicinity, vora hits a solid 4..if you&#39;re taiwanese and looking for some authentic taiwanese food because you&#39;re missing the motherland, don&#39;t go here.the hot pot is good.in a city where there are so many choices for quality food and service, i don&#39;t see how this place will survivor with an experience like the one we had.i use this place to get lunch a lot for work.we mostly ordered off the menu in both chinese and english, pretty much everything on there was great (the breakfast combos are especially good deals and are available throughout the day).staff was super friendly, he kept checking if i was doing good and happy with the food.we waited for a long time and no one collected our checks.instead you have a clean, modern look that is somewhere between upscale and mid-scale restaurant, and an atmosphere that is comfortable..this place is awesome.the wine paired with our meal was equally as great.when we wanted dessert, we had to wave down another waiter to place the order.if you&#39;re in the area, stop by &amp; try the restaurant :)...also my kung boa was not spicy at all.finally i give up and ask.we tried about 4 different kinds of dumplings, shrimp wonton soup, a chicken entree (called something like three sauce garlic chicken that was exceptional), and the banana chocolate egg roll for dessert.some of my personal favorite menu items are the pork belly over rice (271), double cooked pork (305), spicy beef soup (231), and salted crispy chicken (222).our server matt was extremely nice and friendly.however it was worth the wait."

 friendly.i enjoyed both ciders (cherry something and a hawk something??).its worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area.so i just had the duck fat donuts; it&#39;s like duck stuffing served with ice cream.upon our waitress&#39;s recommendation, i ordered the tripel karmeliet which as not hoppy and it came in it&#39;s own glass.glass).you&#39;d never know this was such a great beer bar walking by it but they&#39;ve got a great selection of belgian and other midwestern beers.i will note that since they opened up the addition, wait times have taken a nose dive which is very welcomed.i&#39;ve had their wings which are dry rubbed and then fried..this place has become a destination for me that delivers solid enjoyment.my gf and i were so disappointed, we left our zombie dusts.the venison was cooked to perfection u do not need a knife to cutit.every bite of this sandwich was savored, and it came with a large handful of excellent thin fries and an awesome garlic aioli.carded at the door, then sat at the bar.(which was awesome) the brisket is really good, but a little on the fatty side.food is really good.so i order the mussels.mediocre food..the coffee flavors mixed with the hops is trippy.one of our son&#39;s favorite spots, so we had to like it.the crowd is always pleasant, no one gets too rowdy, and the noise level is at a level comfortable enough to have a conversation with the people at your table.although they do get busy later in the night, it never feels crowded! my one complaint is that it&#39;s really dark inside during the day so you&#39;re better off trying to snag a seat at the patio, but beware the wait!.we had an awesome hybrid of a mead and a cider with michigan cherries.major disappointment..i want to be buried in a bed of their frites and aioli.the place is deceivingly big, from what i understand it is a case of success leading to expansion.hopleaf is capable of much more and much better.the other food here is unfortunately hit or miss.went here while on a short trip to chicago.it was floral and refreshing.ambience is great and very typical urban pub.maybe my expectations were too high what with all the rave yelp reviews.it comes with a bucket of crispy fries.1.a must go to for a beer lover in chicago- no reservation needed.we were very pleased! they served us right away even though it was 6 pm on a friday.i don&#39;t eat shellfish, in fact i&#39;m allergic to most seafood, and i find mussels disgusting but somehow hopleaf not only makes them well, but they&#39;re amazing!

brasa-roja-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brasa-roja-chicago-3,1,"The service was inattentive.picked up an order of chicken with sides and arepas.about two months ago i purchased the chicken dinner which was overly salty.95 you can have grilled rotisserie chicken or steak with beans and rice..it may have been 80-85 degrees in there.low key, simple, and delicious.i also like the ambience here--it&#39;s not too dive-y, like mexican taquerias or some other latin american places can be.the best chicken in the block! service is fast, but phone orders are even faster.although, i can really appreciate the hand painted walls which takes you away to the scenery in colombiamy recommendation for first timers that have never experienced colombian food, you&#39;re in for a treat: try the empanadas for your appetizer (1-2 per person, depending on hunger), matrimonio or the bandeja paisa for your entree, and the colombiana soda to drink.will leave here satisfied.los empandas are amazing.my friend max lives across the way from this place and he goes weekly.my husband loves the empanadas.i love this place! i must admit that the first time i was here, the place looked sketchy.ordered for pickup for 8:00, arrived early at 7:55, waited until 8:20 for entire order.they know their are mostly mexicans in the neighborhood, (and like most colombians), know how to run a business and make sure you get your salsa verde and if you ask for tortillas.rest maybe will need some improve decoration wise soon but for the rest great food, good prices and nice staff.95 for the chicken or skirt steak special, drooling as i&#39;m typing this review!!!..the only thing i do enjoy is the 2 small boiled potatoes that comes when you order a whole broiled chicken.my fiancé and i are still kicking ourselves that we&#39;ve lived in this hood for 2 years, and only just discovered brasa.you  really have no idea what to do when you get inside and no one really goes up to you.and so cheap!..a must try, charcoal grilled chicken is quite the treat.thought it might have been a bad day.the food isthebomb.i observed a few other tables and noticed that they had to keep reminding their servers to bring things (napkins, drinks, etc).the seasoning is super tasty and the chicken is tender inside.$40 for 3 adults, 2 kids..all i can say is that i wish i had found this place years ago.on my way out, i got a couple of bunuelos, $1 e.try the steak and chicken combo! its amazing!.the chicken is just where it&#39;s at.i had a half chicken the other day that was a bit dry.the first thing you see when you walk in are the rotisserie chickens cooking..but if only i ordered the 1/2 chicken, but because i was in such a hurry and so hungry, at that point i could&#39;ve eaten the wooden tables, and for some reason didn&#39;t even bother reading the menu, just went by what i remembered from the yelp reviews..delicious food.finally, for desert try the brevas con arequipe.great food!!! if you are new, visiting chicago, i suggest you to try them.adds that 1 to make it a 5.golden brown skin and flavorful when their hot.the best chicken i have ever had.their plantains are also cooked perfectly.i must say the food and the service was great.cafeteria blech atmosphere and mundane service.love this place!!! i get the steak or chicken special! you get rice, steak, beans and a little side salad for like 6 bucks! food is great and the places decorations are so cute...this place knocks it out the park.makes great leftovers as well and the salsa verde is unreal.will return in the very near future..this little restaurant is on the corner, the parking was hard to find but once we parked and went inside it was nice and cozy.&#34;brasa roja&#34; is both dine-in and take-out friendly.the people working here seem very friendly, however, i&#39;ve never eaten in, i only have done take out.everything is on point and the steady soundtrack of cumbia really adds to the atmosphere..side note ladies,  the first bathroom stall needs to be repaired, it doesn&#39;t lock.get the whole chicken meal with potatoes, corn pancake and plantain..their 1/4 chicken lunch special is absolutely perfect in every way.locations: there&#39;s one location near kedzie and montrose and another near irving park and elston.delish.the sides of a plain rice and beans were okay.however, the chicken can be a bit dry.probably the worse.go now.get the empanadas too.no surprise though, the chicken is that good."
salonica-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/salonica-chicago,1,"I always mean to try the pancakes but eggs always win out.when i heard about this diner i thought it was strange that they serve breakfast,greek food and mexican food.their service is the best--friendly, attentive, and super quick.marry me?.bro in law had the burger..baklava was nutty and good.the places that get it right at a decent price are few and far between, and salonica is at the top of that short list..friendly staff that doesn&#39;t rush you, even though it&#39;s usually pretty busy with a lot of people eyeing you down for your seat.i would definitely say it&#39;s a great value..apparently breakfast is served all day but waffles only until 2pm.they have fast and attentive service, huge food portions that taste good, and reasonable prices.my girlfriend&#39;s french toast combo was ~$9.this is just your standard diner, made pricier by virtue of its location.no, you don&#39;t come to salonica for the coke, but the coke here is good.while the greek standards were good (the souvlaki was well prepared and the grilled veggies fresh), the mexican dishes were surprisingly good.it&#39;s close enough to the museum of science &amp; industry that i&#39;m going to make this my post-museum nosh whenever i visit.service is great and the food comes very fast..i got the steak and eggs and it cames with everything, hashbrowns, toast and the whole shabang! i really liked it and it was a reasonable price.that being said, the lamb could have been cooked for much longer! it was tough, we had to really cut at it.it didn&#39;t have that cinnamon hint to it either, which i was disappointed about.i was all set to give this four stars.if i was greek i would be ashamed of this place.food came out really fast! really nice early morning breakfast tempo.they have your standard pancakes, waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, etc.service was fast and efficient, i was in and out in less than 30 but i still smell like fried food.the only thing i did&#39;nt like were the pork chops.my friends had :the french toast with eggsthe chicken sandwichthe chicken saladwe all left stuffed!..a hidden gem, on the corner of 57th and blackstone, that is inexpensive, filling, and taste good!the setting is basically a diner but they also specialize in greek cuisine.ugh.visited salonica several times during my visit to hyde park to see my son at uchicago..best greek food in hyde park--you can read about their menu in the other reviews, but i highly recommend their gyros or athens chicken.save room for dessert (or just get it to go), because the rice pudding is some of best in the city.friendly staff and reasonable pricing.my husband and i went there this morning and ordered a coffee, orange juice, restaurant named omelette, and cheese omelette.all in all, it&#39;s a solid value place for the quantity and quality of food.it came with coffee, which was nice.my coworker and i both ordered the skirt steak.10/10 would eat again.wish they were crispy, but that is pretty impossible in delivery mode..steak and eggs were under seasoned and undercooked, (the t-bone was blue around the bone)  sent the food back with the hope of a finished medium product..the meat was very dry and the sides weren&#39;t tasty at all.we all were very filled by our meals (french toast and side of sausage for me and hubs, and monte cristo sandwich for gpa).nice little corner cafe/diner in hyde park.what i like?the nice old fashioned looking design of everything.this place was my home away from mom&#39;s kitchen for my 3 years at u of c.the decor is, i&#39;m guessing, from the 60s."

the-orbit-room-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-orbit-room-chicago,2,"Given our large bar tab, i was very disappointed at the treatment of me and my guests.destry had tomato soup and it was really bad.the beer and food is a little pricey so i can&#39;t give a full 5 starts but the food is really good.orbit room is one of my favorite local spots.i really like that they have a &#39;no children under 13&#39; policy, because sometimes adults just want to be able to drop an f-bomb now and then without people tsk tsk&#39;ing you.i will definitely be back and reccomend this bar to my friends..kuma&#39;s: 1.orbit room, i live really close to you.orbit room is fantastic! this place simply rocks because its not crowded, they have a large tiki style chill patio to dine al fresco, the food is priced really well and although their beer selection was small they had some quality beers to choose from.the patio is one of the best.the nachos and hummus plates are my favorite, but absolutely stop in during the summer when they roast an entire pig on a spit in the tiki inspired back patio.good pasta.go for dinner, stay until closing drenched in booze.you can put anything the kitchen has to offer on the pizza too, if you dare.most times and the food as of late has been taking a looong time.this place has a perfectly seasoned and cooked burger without a multitude of toppings and attitude to hide behind.this was the perfect place to have a low-key birthday party with a few friends.this is my go-to first date spot and if it makes it to a month.i&#39;ll be back!.the orbit room reserved us tables and just had us run a single tab capped at a certain budget (which we didn&#39;t even reach because the drink prices are so darn reasonable!).overall i recommend this place for a date or with a group.the party went great and everyone left merry as fuck.she was loud, constantly walking and stomping around our table, and all you could do was ask her to stop.orbit is okay if you want to just get a beer, but the prices aren&#39;t great.in fact, the kitchen staff guy simple removed the picked-at dried-out burger and salty soup from the table after an hour all why not saying a word.that nice corner booth is no more.but the tables are spaced quite far apart from each other and the clientele here is kind and courteous.other than that, the patio is nice and the atmosphere is good, but when you&#39;re hungry and waiting, none of that seems to matter.less patient customers might have a real problem with the service.beautiful beer garden completely hidden from view.the patio has a tiki look to it and is a pretty good size.it kinda transports you, not in the rollerskating-waitresses-who-hate-their-jobs sort of way, but in the cool-rockabilly-chicks-with-tattoos sort of way..even if boiler room was running a special, lil sumpin runs a pint $5-7.i had their burger for the first time years ago when kuma&#39;s had a 2 hour wait (one of the waitstaff actually recommended it).and the whiskey specials.went there with my wife, 8 yr old and 11 yr old at 1pm on a sunday and was refused service because their minimum age for service was 13!?  they had 2 tables taken and the rest were open.awful place.i often associate chicken tenders as budget friendly food and not necessarily ambrosia but i will gladly order them here.should i say the most awesome server ever ali.the mac &amp; cheese was particularly awesome.good drinks and the nachos are awesome! definitely get the pulled pork on them.don&#39;t let the dark gloomy interior get you.great punk rock-rock playlist.love the old school decor and the music was pretty killer running the gamut between richie valens to the damned.one of my favorite hangouts.we grabbed a table and were greeted by a most friendly chap who advised us they had jack daniels cocktails for the low, low, bargain price of $4.goo.i also commend them for their no kids policy.we visit my sister in chicago and look forward to going there..we all know how annoying customers are, especially drunk..good thing they are.the staff is beyond fantastic! ali, andy, matt, bobby especially!!! i have had several parties here, and they are always insanely fun!above average bar food, big portions, drinks are priced right, and the patio!!! the patio is definitely in the top three in chicago, for sure.still love the orbit room!  friendly bartenders and servers, good food and specials everyday make this a certain win!hard to believe i haven&#39;t written an update in 5 years but that&#39;s okay.get it done, orbit room!.i let yelping go for a while.staff is great and on point!  eat here!  everything on the menu is great,  personal favorite is the buffalo chicken wrap..the people here are really cool.the food is great, the drinks are excellent, and the service is always super attentive.this place is great! lovely patio and a good selection of beers..i so want to like this place.order the street corn appetizer - so flavorful and delicious!! bartenders are friendly and engaging.i can&#39;t wait to check out the patio, as i&#39;ve been told it&#39;s really nice.great music, nice bartenders, cute (&amp; clean) decor, and delicious food- what&#39;s not to love?been here a couple times recently after a several year hiatus.well to start they no longer serve it.this is such a cute little bar with a great atmosphere and excellent food.the server even repeated it back to me that it wouldn&#39;t have sour cream, so it must have been a mistake made in the kitchen.we left early.we were planning on heading over with 4 adults and 1 toddler around 5:30pm on sunday.they&#39;ve tricked out the patio tiki style a few years back and it is awesome.during the winter, they&#39;ll throw up a huge heated tent for you to smoke in."
little-vietnam-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-vietnam-chicago,2,"When it was brought to the manager, she said &#39;oh but i saw you drinking out of the cup?&#39;.the folks at little vietnam do a fantastic job bringing the flavors of their namesake to the windy city.i had a spring roll and meatball phó.anyone living in chicago should be in need of that.the bahn mi bread was crispy and the meat was expertly marinated.changing my rating way up.i would recommend it to anyone who loves vietnamese food!.no need to go to argyle if you&#39;re in edgewater, this place has you covered.wtach out!.i had the rice noodles with grilled pork and eggrolls.the lemongrass chicken tasted like your typical &#34;asian sauce in a bottle&#34; kind of stir-fry.but that&#39;s the traditional way.and their spicy pork sandwiches.helping me with high chairs and bringing out sip cups for the kid proactively..family owned and reasonably priced..thanks to yelpers&#39; review, we tried this place this evening, and the only reason this place didn&#39;t get full five stars was our part of not be able to enjoy it more than we did, cannot wait to return.the best vietnamese food i recall ever having was on broadway several years ago and that place closed.to be fair, this is not my fave food, so i expected more.a cleaner, lighter, less authentic take on vietnamese.water was always refilled.got take out another time and got the grilled pork banh mi, pork roll banh mi, shrimp spring rolls, and an avocado smoothie.vegetarian pho- pro : all of it was delicious, and the broth was ginger-y..nice open space that is calm and quiet in the afternoon..i had the fo and loved it..but their service was terrible too much judgmental when people come to the restaurant.the meat looked better than the sometimes-gristly slabs of meat that appear in other pho i&#39;ve had.just like the real thing!  so good!  good atmosphere and excellent service as well.outstanding food and good service.it&#39;s quick, cheap, and has amazing vegetarian options.i heard this place had a grandma transplant from argyle st, and it shows.i&#39;m so glad i came across this hidden gem.the pho wasn&#39;t bad but wasn&#39;t great either.aside from the cilantro and jalapeños there was nothing banh mi about it.wandering around edgewater on our day off and decided to stop in to have a light lunch.flavorful broth, perfectly cooked vegetables and lots of bean sprouts.i could have fallen off the train and landed in a seat.during my first visit, i had the combination pho.perfect!the location boasts very popular affordable sandwiches, and being near dice dojo, i was happy to see that a group of diners were playing a board game at their table when we arrived.the ambiance/decor is a little odd.i also really love their 3 color dessert, which doesn&#39;t seem to be on the menu anymore and i really would love if the owners bring it back! i also recently tried their lemongrass chicken and asked them to make it spicy and it was delicious! the dish had so much flavor and perfect spice level! owners are extremely nice and accommodating and the place isn&#39;t too heavy on the wallet either! i cannot wait to go back there again!.i&#39;ll even go out in a limb and say it&#39;s better than tank noodle in uptown.the egg rolls and shrimp spring rolls were good too.this is a cute little restaurant and pretty empty when i visited -- around 3 pm on a week day -- and the service was fine.the vietnamese coffee and thai tea were delicious.not greasy.i&#39;ve been walking past this place since it opened and never went in.first a caveat - i am by no means an expert in vietnamese food.service was friendly and very fast.same for the lemongrass chicken..there is a very slight sweetness in the broth that differentiates it from all the other phos in chicago.i could have left the egg off though as it just didn&#39;t fit with the chops and rice marriage.outstanding service..the prices are slightly higher than the norm, and the portions slightly smaller..a broth really makes pho and there&#39;s was delicious! although we were only in there for a little bit the wait staff was friendly and the place was really clean.what a gem ! excellent food.the bread is always fresh and soft and so is the cilantro.everything i have ordered has been delicious - great pho (super fresh!), vermicelli rice noodle salad, egg rolls, spring rolls, lemongrass chicken (very spicy!) and the banh mi.however, i really disliked the tv that was on (so distracting when you&#39;re with friends).the pork banh mi was pretty good but i wished the meat was a little more flavorful.their menu is small but covers some pretty good ground.the service and the staff are awesome as well.viet cuisine is my favorite so i&#39;m always down to try new places, but i wasn&#39;t expecting much..this place has great service, great pho and very good sandwiches.good pho, spring rolls, and egg rolls.."

fulton-market-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fulton-market-kitchen-chicago,2,"She definitely went above and beyond! two months later i still have attendees tell me how great this party was and how accommodating and nice the staff was!  definitely a terrific spot for drinks, dinner or an important event!...not a place to go for a relaxing.could have been the awesome artwork on the walls, (which you can purchase for the low low of about 5gs) the aforementioned creative cocktails served in all sorts of kooky glassware, or the globally inspired menu of smaller bites, but this place was packing some serious smoke shows and is far from the white tablecloth experience i was expecting.very flavorful, and each bite left me wanting more.the decor, food, service - everything was wonderful.for our main course we had the gnocchi and pork shoulder.will definitely be back!! i would suggest making a reservation in advance.i also had the grilled octopus, highly recommend.it was something you could whip up in your kitchen pretty quickly..excellent house music and a local artist was doing a large self portrait painting in the main room while we were there.the staff was very attentive and friendly which is always a big plus!the restaurant was very very accommodating to my food allergies.fortunately it&#39;s not just cool and pretty but the service and food are awesome.it was delicious and quickly devoured..it was perfectly cooked, extremely tasty.surrounded by a creative environment, would be back again.i worked with kelsey, the director of events, to plan an event for work.sorry fmk, i won&#39;t be back...i also ordered the red snapper it was fried perfectly!definitely coming again! friendly staff! great food! and love the drinks!.we tried that peanut butter one and it was so unexpected.waiter had an attitude, music was abnoxiously loud for all (waiter said couldn&#39;t control), food had no taste, small portions.the interior is really fun and busy.i figured since i saw it all the time, it must be good, riiight? plus they&#39;re like naming themselves the fulton market kitchen of all kitchens in fulton market district (or even on w fulton market st), and as you know, there are a lot of great ones..i ordered one that was $26 without realizing it..very good food and service.must order the brussel sprouts, cauliflower, and garlic fries! great sharing portions!.the discrete location location of this bar/restaurant is a shocker.i&#39;d absolutely recommend checking this place out and go a bit early if you can- it does begin to fill up around the usual 9p hour.this level of service makes us want to come back and recommend fmk for private or semi-private events without question!food standouts: brussels sprouts (in a date emulsion!), octopus, pumpkin soup, two tails, suckling pig.really good eats, fantastic cocktails, but it comes with a price tag..my other car is batmobile cocktail ($13) -- half froth but at least you don&#39;t have a big chunk of ice in the middle.i want to like this place, but can&#39;t.interesting menu items and good food.i would highly recommend fmk for your private party venue.alright, this review is starting to sound extremely yelpy so i am going to stop here, but seriously this was a very weird, very bad experience.in return he brought all the food including appetizers at once and main dishes got cold.prefer traditional dining? they do that to.00 a piece.the decor of the restaurant was hip and funky.my only wish is that the next time i come is that they have changed their menu up as it is not a very large menu and for several months, with few exceptions they have pretty much had the same menu and do not offer any specials.i seriously love the range of art they have at fmk, like the hanging ship or whatever they are in the lounge, the aliens and angel motorcyle chick.fmk seemed fun and quirky and i was even thinking of hosting a large event here in the winter.cheers to the most colorful and fun place in the fulton market.however it was absolutely delicious.our server was high as a kite and everything we went to order we were told &#34;you don&#39;t want that&#34;.while grilled cheese isn&#39;t a delicacy, the little sandwich just melts in your mouth..the gnocchi is excellent; hamachi crudo light and dressed up with a great mustard sauce; a beet salad our table shared was good enough to order a second; the burger was monstrous in size."

very nicely arranged, service was great and made you feel comfortable instantly.we have never had a bad experience here..had the entremes appetizer, all four items were delicious, main course was the lamb and the pollo mole negro and both were very good, the mashed potato with the lamb was so good and the mole was expertly made.can&#39;t go wrong here.always love the food, service, and ambiance.so she invited me and boy do i have to say, they were one of the best i have ever had.there sopes are delicious and so are there tamales, i definitely approve and should somehow input that into their main dishes.there are two rooms one is a little more colorful than the other.everything that i have ordered here has always been pretty good.- their green mole sauce!worth mentioning- enchiladas, uchepos gratinados (fresh corn tamales served with green mole sauce, the tamales were sweet so if you like sweet, that&#39;s good).worth every penny! don&#39;t let the fancy tables fool everything is authentic about this place and phenomenal service.i thanked them profusely and high-tailed it home to open the presents.jk she didn&#39;t complain about her salad and soup.the margarita i had tasted odd.i was really surprised and very happy with everything!.my fiancé and i went here last friday for dinner and had a wonderful time!  we got the chef&#39;s choice 5 course meal w/ wine pairings and it was incredible.she knew we were first timers so she recommended the pambasos, basically a burrito on garlic bread..food looks just as good as it tastes.the duck was cooked perfectly and the mexican sangria was great!  the waiter and service were superb! we will be back!.best mexican food in the neighborhood.we started off with the guacamole and ceviche.i bet it was 15 or 20 minutes before our drinks orders were taken (or we were acknowledged, then a long wait to get drinks delivered).my husband and i tried it out for the first time about a week ago and we absolutely loved it!the service, food and atmosphere were all on point.as for my husbands steak dinner, it was an epic failure.will definitely be back again.the margaritas are wonderful, and the flavor of the food is complex and has you wanting to keep eating to taste all the flavors.the place was kinda quiet and different.it wasn&#39;t bad but it wasn&#39;t amazing like i&#39;d hope it would be.a close friend and i were starving after church and good &#39;ol yelp pointed up right in this direction.i went there with my bestie! we both love mexican food and margaritas, so we decided to check out this new to us spot.both of our entrees were outstanding..we even liked the plating.one thing i really enjoyed was relying on them to suggest meals and drinks which added to the experience.and cooked exactly as ordered.wow.so did the sopes.the  second dish was almost inedible, the fish was so over salted it was left on the plate almost entirely.had it with black beans, guacamole and platanos maduro.i will not be going back.the restaurant was clearly short on waitstaff and the owner should&#39;ve know how busy it was going to get on a valentine night with all tables reserved plus accepting walk ins so there&#39;s no excuse for the very slow service which almost ruin my night but my husband n i just decided to have a laugh about it while watching all the chaos unfold.this is one of the best restaurants past logan square.i assumed i was going to your typical taco joint, so when i got my menu and saw most items in the $18-30 dollar range i realized this must be something special.i had the lamb in black mole sauce and my wife had the tamales in green mole sauce.i will go back there after 6 months or so and check it out again.not to be missed are the flautas, enfrijoladas, tamales de elote and the guacamole..great service great food! we made reservations for 7 pm last friday, we got there right before 7 but the place was almost empty, so we sat wherever we wanted, they were training a new busboy and were very attentive to our needs, the food was excellent and the service just as good.really nice staff makes you want to come back.i was scared to try it last time because i&#39;ve never had it.i have been visiting this restaurant from the time it opened up, that should speak for it self.the staff is very friendly and professional.i had the steak.one of the best mexican restaurants around! the owner takes care of you himself and makes you feel so welcome.there are not many good and fancy restaurants around that neighborhood."

kumas-too-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kumas-too-chicago,1,"It was so bomb, i almost exploded in flavor.this location is way bigger than the original kumas, so never a line never a wait, the pig destroyer (pulled pork shoulder sandwich) big enough for two people, and the iron maiden burger is really good.the mac and cheese is really good! also took the bbq pork fries, it&#39;s really huge for an appetizer.waitress was awesome the whole experience is always perfect.they forgot the fries.anyway, the burger was amazing!!! our server, peter, was great, patient, and helpful as it was my first time navigating the nice variety of burger options.it has a bit more refreshed vibe than the original (though the original is still pretty great), and i like that there is plenty of seats at the bar, and you can order there if you can&#39;t get a table.it is like an upscale version of kumas corner.got the neurosis got goat cheese instead of cheddar and swiss.plus they blast it so loud that a conversation is impossible.the beef is high grade and gave me a meat high that&#39;s hard to come by when you don&#39;t know how to cook and you&#39;re trapped inside for months.we have heard lots of good things about this place from others who have been to chicago.kuma&#39;s too specializes in creating flavorful, unique, and tender burgers.i had a burger delivered to my house.this can be a good thing if you actually want to hear what other people are talking about.95 (hellmouth burger)let me preface by saying i have not been to the original kuma&#39;s since every time i try to go, the wait was just unbearable for my hungry stomach.the salad was a refreshing bite while we waited for the burgers.the burgers are good, but nothing extraordinary.service was fine though..in the abstract it seems like a great burger shouldn&#39;t be that hard to make..overall, the price was a bit expensive.i&#39;m normally a fan of pretzel buns but this one was just so salty and substantially pretzel-y that it took away from the burger somewhat-price: it ain&#39;t cheap.5 star review.i&#39;m mostly reviewing this for other vegans -- i came along with a bachelor party group and was thrilled to see the warning: there are no vegan options on kuma&#39;s menu.i know it&#39;s gotta be good..i don&#39;t care what you put on it.mac &amp; cheese (build your own) is to die for !! large selection of burgers also.if you do not like loud music then this is not the place for you.we don&#39;t do &#39;a little bit of pink&#39; here.also, i don&#39;t like my burgers too big because the eating experience of it all becomes a bit annoying atleast for girls..this is my type of place!they noticed instantly my made in detroit jacket and one of the servers jen then came up and said hell yeah detroit (turns out she grew up in the metro detroit area also)!so looking at the menu most of the burgers are all named after heavy bands like the metallica burger, high on fire burger, mastodon burger and so on.the beer selection isn&#39;t terrible either!i plan to get the infamous mac &amp; cheese next.compared to the other four my burger was on the small side.the food is unbeatable.my medium-rare burger was unevenly cooked for some odd reason, and my gf&#39;s medium was on the verge of well done.) whereas the original kuma&#39;s is clearly appealing towards a more wicker park crowd as it&#39;s along west belmont, kuma&#39;s too tones it down a bit as it tries to appeal to the lincoln park crowd.i did not think it was as good as au cheval&#39;s burger but it is still worth going there for great burger!.if you&#39;ve been to the original kuma&#39;s, then i&#39;m afraid this place might be a bit of a letdown as far as the atmosphere goes.to make the statement that they have the best burger in town, you gotta back that up and they didn&#39;t at all.also this place doesn&#39;t advertise itself as a place to play classical while enjoying a burger..kuma&#39;s too, are you joking? i thought you were in the business of creating a great burger? do your job right and stop feeding us sand paper (the other 6 in my group didn&#39;t finish their burgers either).when kuma says it&#39;s pink throughout, it&#39;s true!  juicy.it has a kick with the cayenne croutons and i usually order an extra for the next day&#39;s lunch.i love every burger at this place.i recommend lair of the minotaur which is topped with bourbon poached pear..since being &#34;off&#34; bread, it was the go-to burger as far as i could see, but i&#39;m sure i could &#34;nicely ask&#34; for any of their burger creations to be sans bread.moral of the story: good things come to those who wait.i&#39;m not sure if they just didn&#39;t play anything i know or it was just indiscernible to me.mmm.yum! i could only finish half of it.i really appreciate that they put a lot of shallots on it too.arriving a bit after 2pm, there were maybe 3 tables sat in the dining area and the bar was about 1/2 full, so i sat there.too bad they weren&#39;t cooked correctly because they did look goodtoo bad also it was a carryout so i couldn&#39;t even send them back.totally rocked it with the buffalo sauce that melted my face off.this heavy metal themed burger joint has a great vibe, good staff and awesome music playing (if you enjoy a bit of metal)."
snarfs-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/snarfs-chicago-4,1,"I can see snarf&#39;s becoming a local staple.another good menu item is their turkey sandwich..far superior than a subway, potbelly, jersey mike&#39;s, or jimmy john&#39;s.so, so delicious and moist.ive always has decent service.definitely never going to this location again.95).this experience won me over for our holiday catering.quick tip - during busy times like lunch and on weekends, it seems quicker to order online ahead (these people who did so got their food way quicker than those of us in line)."
red-door-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-door-chicago,2,"Wanted to love this place, but between the service and lackluster burger, i couldn&#39;t.we went there with a groupon for a for course meal with wine pairings.this place is pretty cool.cocktails great, beer cans/bottles not the coldest in the city but overall this place is great.5 stars for food1 star for serviceequals 3 stars all in all (me being nice).they also got our order wrong and forgot to add an extra egg to the entree.all the brunch menu items here were $11 a piece.they have an eclectic brunch selection.apparently the kitchen was backed up.and the food was fantastic,  i don&#39;t like chicken breast no matter how it&#39;s cooked but at red door it&#39;s cooked so well my mouth was watering for more as i was eating it! let&#39;s not even get started on the bottomless mimosa, they are great and don&#39;t stop coming.i recommend having nothing else to do for the rest of the day if you choose this option though.beware though, these are really strong! definitely get a bang for your buck.we had to ask three times for someone to come and serve us.stopped in last night quickly for a drink with a decent sized party.tip:  sitting at the bar gets you better service and drinks are refilled way faster than when you&#39;re sitting at a table.we broke all our glasses.the service was good and the place was packed.it was a huge waste of our time..the kale chips were way too greasy and honestly i&#39;m not sure how someone would finish a bowl.spacious and sort of hidden away from the rest of the world..i was charged $1 more for my chicken and biscuit which was disappointing to see.&#34; i suggested they update/remove the check-in offer, but as i am writing this review about one week after dining at the red door, the check-in offer of kale chips is still there.but, elise (the bartender) made my night so much better by keeping my drink full, laughing with me, and making light of the situation.dinner took slightly over 3 hours.- kale chips = gross..very small place, but with very friendly and helpful staff.i liked your atmosphere but not the chaos.really fun bar in bucktown! we didn&#39;t have any food, but came here for drinks, which were fantastic.they&#39;ve just lost seven customers.the service was crazy slow on the food.dined here last night and enjoyed the experience.stopped in a few times with varying levels of business and always had a great time.we can&#39;t be sure.he was super helpful and willing to bring our two friends who were running behind to the table also.we waited outside for 45 minutes only to be told that we needed a reservation! the girl who told us was very rude and unaccommodating even though one of her colleagues lied to us! do not go there without a reservation since you will just waste your time!!!!!..i won&#39;t be going back to red door.excellent place for a party and bbq! hosted a joint birthday on the patio, and everyone loved the food and atmosphere! troy and his staff made planning the event easy and enjoyable.anyway, the staff is always super nice, they&#39;re dog friendly, the drinks are always good (and strong!) and they change seasonally, and the small plates are definitely worth trying.server brought use ice since there were no chillers, but why serve warm mimosas? my chilaquiles were great looking and tasted delicious though.it&#39;s a cool spot with a great staff."
the-dock-at-montrose-beach-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-dock-at-montrose-beach-chicago-2,2,"After exploring the bird sanctuary, we saw the dock and thought it was cool there was a nice chill place to eat and drink on the beach.great place to go for a day at the beach or a quick stop at it.great location and potential, all ruined by being terribly managed and understaffed.i would not recommend this place to anyone.v.the place is on the beach, so during nice weather - you cannot find a better spot.plus free parking! no worries about expensive lake timed parking!.5 friends out for a dinner.in town for a visit with family and friends and heard this place was awesome thru some locals we met out and had to check it! i loved it! right on the lake, with awesome drinks and food! melissa our waitress was super fun, fast and knowledgable.the hostess tonight sucksnot flexible with seating and then our waitress disappeared would not recommend this place ever.the views are great, the food surprisingly good, and they have a decent beer selection.it took about 45 minutes to get our food after we ordered, and one of the people at our table did not get his order.once it as a dj spinning &#34;i feel love&#34; by donna summers...i wouldn&#39;t say that it was the best food i have ever eaten, but as i first stated, it&#39;s great for what it is.my wife and i  (and our friends) love this place.still, we won&#39;t be back.we were there wednesday evening when it wasn&#39;t busy but it took about an hour and twenty minutes to get our food.love how close it is to montrose dog beach.could have made the same one at home myself, sour cream was watery.i ordered and chicken panini which was quite tasty because it was dressed with carmelized onions and cheese.go for the chill vibe and family friendly atmosphere not the best meal of your life.or, perhaps they should get someone to sell beers from a big tub - like at the train stations.just got my first beverage at 7:20..this place is outstanding! the view and the &#34;bar type&#34; food is amazing..the seating is very limited so the wait can be long 30-45 minutes and there are no other options nearby.the restaurant was super crowded so u must need to arrive extra early.seared white fish, cabbage, just the right heat on the salsa, and a citrus white sauce.love this place..they also have television at the bar.also, they took long breaks (during which they played weird synthesizer-ish music that was much louder than the band and not good) after only playing one song at a time, strange...we sampled some of their signature cocktails; cucumber summer fling was my favorite.thirty minutes just to get a seat.then again, if you had little tolerance for loud children, you probably wouldn&#39;t have been at the beach on a hot saturday in the first place.great location, nice staff, good food.the fish had no flavoring and i don&#39;t even know if there was any of the &#34;citrus sauce&#34; on it that it was advertised to have.go for a drink but stay away from the really bad overpriced food.the brilliant mgmt at this location in an effort to ease the burden of the kitchen feels that sitting people when tables are available is not a good idea.no indoor seating, but they do have tables in the sun and tables with large umbrellas for those that prefer a little shade.finally, i got the check, they never apologized for the inconveniece much less they discounted anything on the check.we came on a friday; but as bars or restaurants go, they were pretty empty and we still ended up waiting for a table.summer is when i really like to watch what i eat because its when im out jogging,diving and kayaking.."

should not have been.food and service was great! i&#39;ll come back here again.but we tried the pho here on a cold weeknight.i would encourage you to try it out!.happened to be in the neighborhood and stopped in based on good yelp reviews.the owners are also so amazing! the husband is bosnian and the wife vietnamese.fantastic service.i licked the bowl and helped my friend finish his since i have more appetite than him.it&#39;s definitely great! we tried the mini shrimp pancake and spring rolls as appetizer and they are amazing.should you be so lucky to amble in on one of those nights!i totally recommend the plum liquor--slivovitz.i stuck with the pho, and a enormous pair of spring rolls.amazing food! super cool owners! very reasonable price..i got by boyfriend hooked too! i&#39;m not asian, but i went with a vietnamese friend and she said it tasted like her mom&#39;s home cooking..ditch the date and get down with the crawfish! service was great as well.but we were extremely disappointed.you just have to get pass the weird bar in front.the food was great and the owners were fantastic.i make my own stock at home,  but am truly impressed (and humbled) by owner gnoc&#39;s stock.it was very good had the beef stew with rice noodles.i&#39;m glad there&#39;s finally another vietnamese restaurant besides tank that serves a great bowl of pho!also, awesome music on the speakers: destiny&#39;s child, usher, rihanna.the owners were friendly and inviting and the food was fantastic.the front half is a pretty cozy bar, if well-lit.of course being outside of argyle i get a bit skeptical.for $11 i thought it was a big gyp!as far as the décor goes, it&#39;s kind of cheap looking in person, don&#39;t believe the pictures posted on yelp.definitely will be back to try more different things!!.the spring rolls, the spicy lemongrass beef pho, the chicken banh mi, the watermelon smoothie that i slipped some vodka into, the coffee, it was really delicious, and i&#39;m often disappointed by vietnamese food.the rice with pork chop was tasty.i&#39;ve never been able to stomach crawfish before, but loved this recipe! my husband loved the spring rolls, but i tend to prefer the lighter flavor of a spring roll and the meat gives a heaviness that i was not ready for.the pho makes you feel warm inside and you won&#39;t even notice the weird bar in the front.i ended up with the beef stew (instead of pho, go figure).this place has new owners.this is an interesting place.the ambiance is super strange though.we always order combination pho.they absolutely deserve the 5 stars.the food itself is phenomenal.anyways, definitely go if you are looking for something out of the ordinary.i cant wait to try the rest of the menu.the taste was out of this world i could not believe it.all the food was excellent and cooked and seasoned perfectly.i haven&#39;t had everything, but everything i&#39;ve had has been excellent to say the least.we got the spicy lemongrass noodle soup, extra spicy, and it did not disappoint.we promised we would return-- and we will!."

city-cafe-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-cafe-chicago-2,1,"The service and prices were good.reuben was juicy and had lots of flavor.this will be my new breakfast spot to bring my friends and fam when they visit.will be back!..the waitresses were really nice and pleasant.real chicken (lots of it), real greens, veggies, fruit.two pancakes, two eggs, two slices of bacon.despite some of the less than stellar reviews, i have eaten there four times now and each time the service has been good, the food well prepared and tasty (and tons of it), the place has been clean and during this last visit, the owner remembered my order from my previous visit which was about a month prior! everyone here is very friendly and the patrons are everyone from priests to punk rockers so it is fun for people watching too! if good ol&#39; hearty diner food (at about half the price of golden nugget) is your thing, give these folks a shot!.i love diners because they&#39;re no frills, unpretentious and it&#39;s a place to sit and chat.amazing chipotle breaded chicken sandwich!!!! so good and filling.instead i went for ham and eggs which was fine not great.the food is simple but tastes amazing..it is the best french toast i&#39;ve tried.i ordered the corned beef hash...lots of families and kids and sunshine coming through the windows.a little steep for me..m.does this place still exist? i tried to find it but all i saw was a liquor store.friendly, clean, fast, delicious!!!  i had lunch, my aunt and sister had breakfast.they prices are reasonable.a little more expensive then i&#39;d like but i guess that&#39;s how diners are today.last time i tried the breakfast special, an avocado/tomato/bacon omelet, and was thrilled that it was genuinely chock full of those ingredients! not a gross, dry, eggy bite in there!plus the service is always wonderful.i never wrote a review in my life, but this place made me write one.your parking is for customers and i was one..this place is great!....great service, very attentive.this place is awesome.i&#39;m a breakfast fanatic and not having to many options in the northside this little gem is great..the burger was cooked perfectly and fries were crispy! skillet was full of meat and veggies rather then just potatoes like some places do.someone parked in the in/out area and almost blocked us all in:(it&#39;s surrounded by one way streets so it can be tricky to get to the parking lot behind the restaurant.."
