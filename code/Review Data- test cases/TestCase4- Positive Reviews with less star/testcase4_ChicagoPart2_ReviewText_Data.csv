glaze-teriyaki-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/glaze-teriyaki-chicago,1,"The bad: the sauce, while good, was a tad overwhelming in terms of thickness and amount.it&#39;s very comfortable inside for dine-in and has a contemporary feel.the salad was fresh and the honey lemon dressing had a great zest and sweetness..takes a little longer than something like chipolte but i&#39;d go here over nearby fast casual restaurants 10 times out of 10.it&#39;s great they give you a salad too..as a previous review stated: the food quality has declined.tender ribs with a nice, not too sweet sauce.(4."

kumas-too-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kumas-too-chicago,2,"Service was fine though.the first word that came to my mind before i came here was &#39;intrigued&#39;.i understand you play metal in a metal themed restaurant (to be fair i had no idea what the place was until i showed up for dinner with my friend) but it was just so loud.definitely not somewhere i would seek out on my own -- as someone who cares about animals, the &#34;bovine genocide&#34; t-shirt on the wall did not help my appetite -- but obviously i am not the target audience.this location is way bigger than the original kumas, so never a line never a wait, the pig destroyer (pulled pork shoulder sandwich) big enough for two people, and the iron maiden burger is really good.the hamburger was delivered by caviar, who did an excellent job because i live on the west side and the burger was juicy, hot and obviously just grilled.i ordered two burgers, both medium.had a soda made in mi and it was good.onto this kuma&#39;s.had a nice kick to it and a slightly different flavor than most bm&#39;s - definitely a thumbs up."

front-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/front-bar-chicago,2,"I was 1st drawn in by the sign saying there were plenty of power outlets and to come on in.still, i have nothing but excellent things to say about this place.will definitely return! one of my fav spots in chicago now onwards."
pizzaiolo-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzaiolo-chicago,1,"Love love love this place! great pizza margherita! small and quaint! great service! we will definitely be back for more!..friendly service, small but clean outdoor seating.amazing pizza.maybe because it&#39;s tucked away on a side street, away from the view of passers-by on broadway, or maybe it&#39;s that the non-neapolitan pizza of the other side of the restaurant (panino&#39;s) that gets more of the attention.cute atmosphere with good service.the.after 10 years in chicago and plenty of great options this unassuming place has probably the best neapolitan pizza i&#39;ve had in the city.we started with appetizers, had pizzas and then went on to main entrees.we finally settled on one and it was not fabulous.the emilia pizza with cream, mushrooms and pancetta is one of my favorites."
harvest-moon-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/harvest-moon-chicago-2,1,"Other items we got were the monte cristo, pretty good, the duck waffle, and the french toast..not timely.will definitely be coming back..it took forever just to get our bill..my boyfriend loved their take on an old fashion, there was a great selection of wine for me.live bands friday and saturday night.the food is average, albeit allegedly farm to table ingredients, under seasoned and lacking taste that an inexperienced person could yield in their own kitchen."
machetes-big-quesadillas-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/machetes-big-quesadillas-chicago-5,1,"Good quesadillas large in size.cochinita pibil is authentic..i wouldn&#39;t mind paying an extra buck or two to round out my meal.went in for lunch and didn&#39;t know what to expect since i have never been there., this place has the worst restaurant concept.their menu selection is not big at all, so no reason for slow service or customers to not know what they want.i will definitely go again.huge quesadillas for $10 a pop! had the cochinita pibil which is marinated pork &amp; the rajas con queso.i was pleasantly surprised to say the least."
trike-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trike-chicago-3,2,"It was rubbery and tasted like like it had been cooked and then left out all day on somebody&#39;s counter before being dumped in my noodles.the decor is original and a step beyond typical thai restaurants.we ordered crab rangoon, spicy crispy noodle and garlic fried rice.holy cow, why was i waiting so long.ordered the food to go so i couldn&#39;t quite grasp the ambience of the place.they get your food ready in 20 minutes or less for takeout and have so many menu options.their crab rangoon are like halloween candy versions of actual rangoon.the service here is excellent.everything was wonderful! the service was good.the restaurant has been pretty empty both times i&#39;ve been (for sunday lunch), which is odd considering how busy all the other restaurants in logan square are on weekend afternoons."
derby-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/derby-chicago,1,"But micaela (manager) responded within hours of my  initial email and said she would be happy to host our event.came here for a drink on a saturday.we claimed a table right before a rush of people came in.we went to watch a mizu basketball game and got to watch it, the bulls game and mnf.i hosted a birthday party for my best friends at derby last weekend.so why 3 stars?the service is -- to put it mildly -- horrible.i&#39;d recommend this to anyone!.hmmm.lets not be pretentious eh?my one issue with this place are the bus boys.the bar derby, on the other hand, is hot,  overcrowded, and bad smelling, bringing to mind not thoughts of the classic churchill track, but of its decadent infield."
fish-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fish-bar-chicago,1,"It was tasty.we shared a bunch of plates and everything was great.figure the friendly neighborhood, freshness and good service are worth the extra coin but value is the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars.this is a phenomenal sandwich, shrimp, crawdaddys, and garlic bread.amazing! the clam chowder and blackened redfish were absolutely delicious.amazing staff - super friendly and always there to help you decide on that extra key lime pie ;)i recommend anything here -  the fish special, taco special and of course the tuna tartare.on our next trip, we ordered blackened red fish sliders, lobster tacos, and mussels.(tip, ask for the garlic aioli)great date here, good bartender service; amazing food, date and i were impressed..the restaurant itself is casual, bar style seating with 3 booths, great music, and very laid back."
community-tavern-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/community-tavern-chicago-3,1,"This new addition to the community is sparking a revitalization to the eateries in the area..i had the burger which was basically inedible.we really liked our meal here and commented about how we wanted to come back to try the double cheeseburger (which we saw a ton of coming out of the kitchen, so they must me amazing)...the owner of the place stopped by and we told him how we enjoyed the meal and would recommend the place to anyone who asked..thanks to amazing hostess, jamie, bartender (sorry, forgot his name) and server sammy.the steaks were great."
