pinstripes-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pinstripes-chicago-2,4,"Pinstripes catered our engagement party this past weekend and did a great job.we commented on how this would be an ideal date spot.shoes and bowling balls were conveniently located right by our lanes.i opted for the stuffed mushrooms and the tenderloin sliders.i don&#39;t think it was worth the price we paid for.both were very delicious, especially the short ribs.i was lucky enough to attend the grand opening, and folks, you&#39;re in for a treat!! even with masses of people, the site was ready to serve! all the food was phenomenal- my favorites were the italian jambalaya, chicken parmesan slider and all of their amazing desserts! (ok, the wine wasn&#39;t bad either)this pinstripes has two huge levels- the top is darker and more sexy, while the lower level had white lights and felt more romantic..i made a reservation for a group of 15 a few weeks beforehand over the phone although their online reservation system said it was unavailable.really enjoyed it here! came to dinner with a large group of kids and adults all part of my family in chicago for a wedding."
bacchanalia-ristorante-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bacchanalia-ristorante-chicago-2,5,"I&#39;m truly glad the majority of chicagoans don&#39;t know about it, because it&#39;s easy to get in! and in close proximity to lagunitas, so if they have a giant line, the trip south is not a total loss.how did i get pony?now, i know this has nothing to do with food which wasn&#39;t all that great either!!! i didn&#39;t leave this place thinking oh yeah i can&#39;t wait to go back!!!i had fun as always with my friends but i trully don&#39;t see why some people think the food is so great at this place.came here to celebrate a friend&#39;s birthday and i was surprised how jam packed it was.its not over priced, its consistent, and best of all it&#39;s just sooooooooooooo yummy! don&#39;t miss pasta vino italia festa in the summer with bacchanalia makes their famous sangria!..i had not tried bacchanalia yet and since it had been on my list for awhile to try- it popped into my head when i had a craving for some good italian food.this kind of carelessness and disrespect toward customers drives me bonkers.well i was definitely disappointed after reading the rave reviews.they serve up some exceptional pasta here.this place has been zagat rated as fuck for years, so there&#39;s a touch of resting on laurels here, but if you&#39;ve got 50 or 75 bucks to blow for a date, i&#39;d recommend this place for sure."
belly-shack-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/belly-shack-chicago-2,4,"We could have cooked at home instead.i can&#39;t believe i waited so long to eat here.a the greatest mouth orgasm that i&#39;ve had in a while.my sister and i came here one evening to try out their famous belly dog.pretty good..my fries came out white hot, very very good.the belly dog was topped with a slaw with korean flavors and a spicy mayo with a pita like bread instead of a bun.the beer menu is good the toppings were good and the lemonade was great.i got the pork meatball sandwich, which ended up feeling like a bit of a carb overload, because it&#39;s a big fluffy bun, with pork meatballs, and then a lot of noodles."
pl-zen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pl-zen-chicago,4,"Beer selection was solid.definitely worth a try if you&#39;re in the area!.the guacamole was delicious and the marg was good.gave us a breakdown of what&#39;s what from wines, beers, and food.however, you can&#39;t really complain about getting a creative burger, a beer, a shot of bourbon and fries for 15 bucks.i would pass on coming here a second time though.i&#39;ll definitely be back to pl-zen when i&#39;m in the area (which, sadly, isn&#39;t frequently..everyone&#39;s always really nice, but man, this place is slow."
vera-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vera-chicago,4,"Cheese, cheese.the mushrooms are arranged around a soft egg and i swear it was like the king of all mushrooms-- that good!service here is fantastic! it certainly helped that there weren&#39;t too many people here but our server was super knowledgeable and even helped prepare a dessert chocolate mousse on bread with a candle on top.yumyes to every food item thank you.been wanting to go to this place for a while.i know a bit about wine, but certainly not enough, and now i know more.i will enjoy it, but i will order &#39;smarter&#39; next time.i should have known-- the evidence is everywhere-- thoughtful, warm, perfect.it was fairly empty at 9pm on a thursday.psshhhh.but honestly,  the food was really good."
shokolad-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shokolad-chicago,4,"My friends got a coffee to go from here and said it was decent..the coffee is very good.the borscht was phenomenal and full of flavor which comes with a few tasty rolls on the side..great little ukranian diner..it can get pretty busy for them, worth the wait.served with delicious brioche rolls.not as much of a fan of the omelet, which as someone else mentioned was more greasy than fluffy (maybe cooked a bit too much?)."
bombay-wraps-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bombay-wraps-chicago-3,3,"In an indian style).the sweet potato fries were redeeming but really, how do you screw those up?the workers also somehow managed to make me feel rushed for my order even though the restaurant was empty.got takeaway about 20 minutes before close - their rice supply had been exhausted for the day, so i opted to order just the chicken tikka and sauce sans the wrap or salad.stop by for lunch before my trip back  to boston..the ordering and prep works pretty similar to a chipotle line, where you can choose between a wrap or salad bowl and then pick from a variety of traditional indian fillings.i don&#39;t think i would go back.won&#39;t come again unless the salt issue is solved.i also got to try their samosas which are perfectly sized and tasty.i had (1) paneer wrap accompanied by a mango lassi so that filled me up."
summer-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/summer-house-chicago,4,"We ordered the guac which came with just the right amount of chips.we got seated at a prime booth area with a picture of us in front of the yes sign picture, and our waitress was just as sweet as can be.walking into summer house feels like you&#39;re leaving chicago and entering california.we were so pleased with the food.on a recommendation from a friend who lives in the city, my wife and i ate lunch here a few weeks ago, and we were absolutely pleased.perfect brunch spot in the city!we went for lunch and it was the cutest little place ever! luckily, there was no blizzard out but if there was one, i would appreciate this establishment even more so due to its beach-y interior.the service - the servers have always been really professional and i&#39;ve honestly never had any issues.my friends love this place so needless to say i&#39;ll be back!  hoping for better service from restaurant and cooking staff.in particular because you can get it on an english muffin (if that is your thing).when you walk in the door it&#39;s slightly confusing, there&#39;s a bakery counter in front between the restaurant and the stella bar, and two host stands for each."
del-seoul-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/del-seoul-chicago,4,"There&#39;s something about korean tacos that are so satisfying.i came here around lunchtime on a saturday and there was plenty of space to sit.got the bibimbap and it was delicious! the service could be a little friendlier, but overall i&#39;d recommend this spot to others!.great for lunch and dinner.the tortilla was so soft!.food was amazing..absolutely the best tasting korean fried chicken drumlet in the city.the bibimbap in a hot stone bowl is always good.but really, when i think of this spot, i think of a quick, delicious bite."
the-monkeys-paw-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-monkeys-paw-chicago,4,"For our visit- my friend was in heaven as they had old fashioneds in the cask.i have to admit that when i went, it was after a volleyball game and i was all gross so walking into this place was a little embarrassing.i like to fancy myself a bloody mary connoisseur and the mp bloody rates pretty high on my list.we were immediately greeted by a really nice hostess (who i am pretty sure was the owner).if you&#39;re unsure about what to get though, there are a number of themed flights as well as ones for bourbons and single malt scotches(!).we arrived just before the kitchen closed and didn&#39;t want to feel rushed into ordering a dessert or any other food, so we stuck with drinks only.every creamy bite of polenta was complimented by a tangy bite of salad and tomato reduction.from craft brews to whiskey flights to cask-aged cocktails, you can tell by the presentation that they pay very close attention to detail here at the monkey&#39;s paw.my friend i came with was pleased with the options of flights of scotch to try!.this was fine, as we got great service."
la-bomba-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-bomba-chicago-4,3,"Very fresh.wanted something to eat on my way to work.you are in for a treat!.50 and comes packed with said fruit and other goodness.i am sure if it was hot, it will be a whole different story.la bomba really is.it&#39;s all fried."
compass-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/compass-bar-chicago,4,"The good: lots of interesting drinks and the food is great.the goat cheese counteracted any spiciness from the peppers and the bacon gave it a smoky flavor...love this place.it&#39;s basically a large bar space without a &#39;restaurant&#39; area, per se.my boyfriend and i grabbed a table and immediately started paging through the menu.in my opinion however the pizza isn&#39;t fantastic..just an ok experience, the service was not that great, several people who had arrived after us got served before us, there was a pretty good beer selection, we ordered fries as an appetizer but it didn&#39;t get there until after the pizza had come."
white-palace-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/white-palace-grill-chicago,3,"That&#39;s for fast food establishments.count on staple diner food, that quintessential &#39;50s aesthetic, and quick service.the food is what you&#39;d expect from a 24hr place and so are the shenanigans.you nod at the sober ones as you sip your hot coffee and they drink their orange juice while watching their friends race yours to the bathroom.decor - i really liked the decor inside the restaurant, pretty neat! :)parking - plenty of parking if you park near the whole foods and just walk down to the restaurant..as for the food it was ok not great.this place gets a three stars just by being open all night.food is still great, service is great, but the late night crowd has shifted from a quiet, potentially romantic setting to a loud, ghetto environment requiring security.the place was dirty but the food was fine for the price!."
cemitas-puebla-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cemitas-puebla-chicago-5,3,"Would love to be back to try some of the other stuff on the menu!.the pork cutlet was thin, but well flavored.my cemita was really great! the chicken was flavorful and i really liked the concept but the bread was just a bit dry.i am pretty sure i will be back to try the cemitas.this is not your mama&#39;s torta, these are huge with a lot of meat and cheese.definitely enjoyed this high-end little fast food establishment.i don&#39;t think there is any going wrong with anything you order at this place.i feel that they are putting less meat and less ingredients in the cemitas at this new location.it was the perfect fast casual lunch we were looking for.."
hing-kee-restaurant-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hing-kee-restaurant-chicago-2,4,"The food at this chinatown restaurant, &amp; selection on menu is really worth 5 stars..the beef pancake seemed like a larger fried spring-roll, was okay but didn&#39;t rock my world like the rest of the food.one of my favorite go-to restaurants in chinatown.when you place orders online it costs less!!.but hey that&#39;s the only reason i knocked them down 1 star.another favorite is the pork flapjack rolls.i was not into it at all.people definitely come here just for the xiao long baos.i actually went past the restaurant three times."
pizzeria-del-mercato-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-del-mercato-chicago,4,"Come here if you like lingering at the table and don&#39;t like being rushed..if i lived nearby and wanted a cheap quick date spot, i might use this, but i honestly doubt i&#39;ll ever be back.so when i crave pizza, but don&#39;t want deep dish or even thin crust from other pizza places and want a &#34;healthier&#34; if not &#34;guilt free&#34; option, pizzeria del mercato is my absolute favorite..our table was ready when we got there.i didn&#39;t think it was domed long enough though.i was here with one other person.the crust is nice and toothsome and the ingredients are super fresh.so, the pizza is good."
slurping-turtle-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/slurping-turtle-chicago,3,"My bowl of ramen was good but wasn&#39;t anything special in my books.overall a great ramen spot in river north.things that i thought could be better - the chashu pork slices, they were sliced a little too thick for my liking.it didn&#39;t do it for me :(if i had just stop at the duck fat fried chicken, this would be a 4 star review.we ordered a wide variety of options and my favorite is the green tea cream puff! like a pillow of taste bud delight.the tunes are top 40s (though not the super obnoxious tracks).for the noodles, i tried the tan tan ramen.definitely recommend! if i were to go back, i would order the duck fat fried chicken.good ramen! not sure about other dishes though.not the best ramen, and because of the location, not the best prices either."
the-halal-guys-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-chicago,4,"Located in the busy division and clark, this place gets a lot of traffic as it is also nestled with local shops and bars.not.both are a large portion for one person.late night + dranks = extra yummy eats..and don&#39;t let that quantity sales food you..i just stopped in for a late night fix and was met with exceptional customer service.+ good quality meats.parking isn&#39;t too bad around this area but if you go at night, there are always lots of drunk people walking around since there are lots of bars around this area."
kim-and-carlos-hot-dog-stand-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kim-and-carlos-hot-dog-stand-chicago,5,"I personally love the heat so it was no issue.i always stop by here when i&#39;m in town for a couple vegetarian chicago dogs.i paid the extra dollar to get the polish sausage and picked my own toppings! they also have the classic chicago dog as well.it was perfect eating it on the steps of the field museum while admiring the skyline and the lake.they come stacked with mustard, relish, onions and a pickle spear.i think it&#39;s cash only, so make sure you have cash!.the first time it was perfect, but the second time the bun got soggy.i absolutely love this family and their food..i&#39;m literally salivating as i write this thinking about how delicious this hotdog was."
chavas-tacos-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chavas-tacos-chicago,4,"Also, they sometimes tend to forget my sauce, napkins and fork even though they&#39;re not busy.i quickly learned i have to ask for my tacos with onions and cilantro, which annoys my snobby tendencies, but i gotta pick my battles you know?on the days i&#39;m feeling uber lazy and not wanting to cook, chavas is a good option for food delivery.i also asked to be called on my cell so i could come down and my landlord was awoken to pounding at the front door from the driver.this was a gem as my friends and i rented an airbnb across the street.ran across this place off yelp and it was a hit.so if the weather&#39;s nice just take it to go, grab a 6 pack of coronas at the corner liqour store on western and picnic your culo in the park on grand avenue 2 blocks west past western ave.and every time i&#39;m here, their horchata is my drink of choice.ps- the place isn&#39;t pretty but boy, is it good.too hung over to move? broke from a long weekend? need mexican food to make a quick recovery? this is your spot.."
frontier-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/frontier-chicago-2,4,"I ordered the venison, which turned out to be delicious.we all stared at this dish wondering how to share it since there were only 3 brussel sprouts cut up.the alligator legs seemed to be more of a novelty than a real dish, and although we enjoyed the brisket (+those sweetbreads!) it was just such a small dish.our second course included pulled boar and rueben sandwiches..it was a very uncomfortable situation and i don&#39;t recommend using the bathroom.the frontier did an outstanding job! everything we had discussed was followed to a t! working with jen was great! they did everything they could to make all of the guests happy, and checked in with me often to make sure everything was going as planned! the food was great! - we did the large format menu (whole pigs) with all the sides - which were delicious.any bartender that can whip me up a special lions tail is a winner in my book! the fire up front really adds to the cozy ambiance and makes you want to stay a while.- duck tacos:  comes in 3.great space and awesome patio."
el-maya-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-maya-chicago-2,4,"Where has this place been my whole life!!! omg! this place is amazing! the service is great! the food is even better!!!! this is a must for those that love modern mexican cuisine!!! delicious!!!! we will be back!!!..com/biz_photos/el-m…).stopped in for an early dinner and margaritas on monday and had a good experience.was old.ok.so the salsa we started with was amazing.we opted to stick with the chips and salsa till our dinner hit the table.the restaurant was very empty on a saturday night, and the bad part is should not be.i highly recommend the carne asada."
osteria-langhe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-langhe-chicago,5,"Once again, delicate and flavorful with each bite and may i add a generous portion for restaurant week and in general.fantastic cocktails, need to come back for wine to truly taste the region!.the octopus did not have a rubbery texture to it.well since they open 12 days ago.they are dry and not very appealing.street parking has always been easy to find in this area (but then again we tend to eat early, like senior-discount early)..plus steering us away from the carne crude was also a ding.yes the concept is just your basic noodles with meat sauce, but it is done so well! the pasta is so fresh and the ragu is fantastic."
jarabe-mexican-street-food-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jarabe-mexican-street-food-chicago,5,"All the tacos here are under $3 and they are some of the meatiest and most packed i&#39;ve ever had.although they were not big, they were full of nice chunks of quality meat with red cabbage, avocado, cilantro, sour cream, and beans..i finally got in the store this saturday and had the carne burrito.i love this place! i&#39;m not in the area but would gladly drive out here for their steak breakfast breakfast tacos any day.i love that.decent tacos and clean establishment.they offer several aguas frescas, as well as fresh tortilla chips with some killer good salsas.byob.."
tommy-guns-garage-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tommy-guns-garage-chicago,4,"My favorite parts were that they provided props and even taught you a few dance moves.great concept!  staff was extremely friendly and food was pretty good..it was a really great show and the performers/waiters are so nice.the staff wear prohibition era duds which adds to the ambiance of the place.so i&#39;m a sucker for dinner shows and this one has been by far my favorite one, partly because i was so involved in the fun there were moments during dinner i was legitimately afraid i was going to be arrested for having hooch!it&#39;s pretty obvious the staff here loves what they do and are quite good at it.3.also had a huge dessert table too.the staff was fun and friendly."

café-marie-jeanne-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-marie-jeanne-chicago-2,4,"Great ride..green and yellow zucchini thinly sliced submerged in olive oil, herbs and cheese.the mushroom omelette was delicious, just a little too salty.the texture was a bit grainier than the best pot de cremes, but i assume that is an occupational hazard of coffee grounds.very tasty.the big-league brunch items that we ordered and shared were smoked pecan french toast and a fish plate.when the server returned and was like &#34;i ran these two cards i found on the table&#34; without even asking.i saw the veggie dagwood on the lunch menu.get baked goods, great expresso coffee, and excellent brunch."
the-spoke-and-bird-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-spoke-and-bird-chicago,3,"The in house pancetta was very smoky..the pancakes were a good sized portion, but a wee bit dry.the food is very good, but it can be a bit on the pricey side..food was okay, nothing amazing.definitely worth giving a try!.there are sunny areas (when the weather cooperates) and shady areas and the whole space is quite large.ordering at the counter was easy, menu sounded appetizing, staff was pleasant, and the patio was huge and inviting.this sure is a cute place to come with my girlfriend ;)."

duck-duck-goat-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/duck-duck-goat-chicago,3,"And ended up cancelling a second reservation of each because i wasn&#39;t very into the food.as this restaurant is part of a larger group with much experience, i expected that reservations would have been honored in a timely manner.it has influences of chinese cuisine with a modern twist.so many umami flavors going on here.i know i&#39;ve mentioned flavor 100 time already, but flavor.rest assured that this won&#39;t affect you at all if you are not very chinese.while i would say i probably prefer the food at little goat and girl and the goat, i would still absolutely come back here for a special occasion or nice dinner.flavored weren&#39;t as robust as everything else but it was crispy &amp; good portion.e.the inside was velvety while the outside was crunchy."

old-lviv-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/old-lviv-chicago,4,"And the food proved law #346 overwhelmingly.only points i would knock off is that a lot of the stuff didn&#39;t set well with my palate (lot of fried greasy mystery meat) but thats just a personal preference.it still has the grandma&#39;s home feeling, but now it feels more like grandma is on her deathbed trying to cook and run a business.they serve an outstanding ukrainian borscht here, pre-mixed with sour cream and full of tender sliced cabbage and chunks of potato.second time, it&#39;s also 11.i brought this up to the waiter, and after talking to the manager, he apologized for their mistake and allowed us to stay.having a ukrainian friend with us to point us in the right direction was definitely helpful.i loaded my plate with a ton of blood sausage and other questional meats.the cold/salad area had pickled cabbage with caraway seeds (this was not kraut), puréed beets with horseradish, creamy tomato and cucumber salad, an amazingly delicious potato salad with cubed ham and peas, chopped oranges and watermelon, and assorted cake slices.."

turkey-chop-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/turkey-chop-chicago,1,"But frankly, you should just bump whatever you need to do because that jerk chicken wrap deserves priority.great food, great staff.there were pieces of bones and gristle and fat??(where the hell did the fat comefrom on that turkey?) and i actually wound up throwing most of it away."
jj-thai-street-food-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jj-thai-street-food-chicago,4,"Their ice teas are so amazing, when i was done, i wanted more!  they are darker than most so it&#39;s not overly sweet and diluted with milk.but it&#39;s going to happen regardless because the food is so damned good here.so good!! stopped by for lunch this afternoon after rave reviews from a coworker and i was not disappointed.if you&#39;ve decided that you&#39;re not a fan of thai food, you should seriously consider giving jj thai a shot.for our entree, we both had some variation of noodles and bbq pork with a side of soup.)i would definitely go rice dish over noodle dish next time i&#39;m here.but if you&#39;re open to an adventure (particularly if you&#39;re open to spicy food), this is your place!it&#39;s pretty small so you may have a bit of a wait, but it&#39;s well worth it! or you can call ahead to make reservations.byob! we ordered the chicken balls as an appetizer and i ordered the papaya salad (crispy, fresh and not overly spicy) while the boy ordered stir fry seafood with egg.this place is also super close to home!  my memory is failing me on the other items we&#39;ve tried, but one that i do remember is the fried chicken wings!  delicious.the sweet/sour sauce that comes with it is so good."

cold-storage-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cold-storage-chicago-3,4,"Order the scallop and coconut ceviche - it is so good and like nothing i&#39;ve ever had - super creative.the atmosphere is relaxed and industrial yet really small so reservations are recommended.deliciously fresh oysters, some of the best.overall, the seafood was fresh, but the bread was over-toasted (difficult to break off and dip into the mussels broth); the octopus was chewy, and complemented the andouille sausage well; and the coleslaw that accompanied the sandwiches was perfectly dressed and the cabbage still crunchy.i thought the smoked mussels were also quite interesting, though not sure if i&#39;d eat too much of them in one sitting.definitely worth a try.i know cold storage is known more as a seafood restaurant, but we came here for an industry special -- order any alcoholic beverage and get a free cheeseburger.definite fan of cold storage, actually liked it better than swift &amp; sons - but so very different.the grilled octopus was a bit too charred for my liking.cold storage has it."

(drops the mic)i believe who owns the cheesecake factory has a hand in the grand lux café.it&#39;s basically a tad bit more upscale than cheesecake factory but only because it&#39;s right on michigan avenue- so the views by the window are great for people watching from above!.we had a very late lunch and thankfully, they serve lunch until 5pm (and brunch until 2pm).i&#39;ve also eaten at this particular location, several years ago.i ordered the indochine shrimp and chicken - combination of chicken and shrimp, onions, ginger, sun-dried cherries and dried apricots sauteed in a sauce of mild curry, plum wine and cream."

tanta-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tanta-chicago,5,"We ordered the following: clasica causitas, all three empanadas, plancha marina, and arroz criollo.i might be biased because i love pork belly and tamarind, and this dish married the two so brilliantly.i did try the pork belly and it was really delicious.but, it was just way too salty.our waiter was so patient and explained the ingredients i didn&#39;t know.most of it is open air and has an awesome chill vibe.there&#39;s an interesting list of cocktails, topped by a fragrant take on the classic pisco sour.the food did not disappoint either.i have had ceviches with much more flavor and less acidity than what they served here.ask the waitress for advice because the menu can be confusing if you&#39;re not used to the food."

naf-naf-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/naf-naf-grill-chicago,5,"Naf naf is a great lunch or quick take out dinner type place.naf naf is the new winner!  $7 for this was a bit of a crime; five small pieces of falafel mixed with the other items left me fairly hungry, and nothing about this was special.the steak swarma was served with rice and i had it topped with assorted vegetables and a spicy cilantro (?) sauce.i don&#39;t know what naf naf is doing to their falafel and pita, but they&#39;re doing it right.it&#39;s not fast food but good food fast! i like how everything is fresh and quick.if you&#39;re in a hurry, beware of the lunch rush, because the line can get pretty long.it was as good as other local favorite fast-food chains such as pita inn and roti, but i think the pita bread put it over them.i really like the falafel&#39;s and it&#39;s nice you can order one on the side for an additional 50 cents.very tasty!my only complaint is that it&#39;s more expensive to get a non-pita dish.today however, i was able to try their chicken and steak shawarma rice bowl and i must say that it was quite delish."
ugos-kitchen-and-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ugos-kitchen-and-bar-chicago,4,"It is kept simple and i really like that.nice to know of a good italian spot that is kid friendly and closer to home.my group and i actually rang in the new year here, and it was great! besides the food (the prosciutto pizza - which was more of a flatbread - was delicious with salty, crispy prosciutto and a spicy bite to the dough), the waitstaff was very friendly and fun..i loved my kale caesar because the kale was tender and the salad was well mixed.the prosciutto had a white sauce of sorts and some amazing peppers to add a bit of kick to it.to be fair, some of the dishes are smaller portions so it sounds like a lot but was a pretty reasonable size meal for two.it had cacio e pepe levels of fresh cracked pepper which i loved, but if you&#39;re shy when it comes to pepper, you may want to have the kitchen hold off."

lyfe-kitchen-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lyfe-kitchen-chicago-2,4,"It seems several other chicagoans love lyfe, as the place was poppin with business peeps in the area.the tables have salt and pepper shaker but the salt part is very small (maybe 1x1x1 in) so it&#39;s a way to encourage a lower sodium meal, which is pretty cool..it has a very calming atmosphere, you feel healthier just by walking in, and the people were so nice.it&#39;s also a smaller location but very popular.there are better places around streeterville to spend upwards of 10 bucks on a healthy and fulfilling meal.i had the wrap along with the ginger mint chia tea which was just okay.my sister and i went here for lunch since we were in the area and needed something relatively quick.they have a full fledged gluten free menu!my favorite is gluten free lyfe veggie burger with sweet potato fries :)."

(yes, i verbed falafel.in a rush?  craving some medi food?  want a cheap lunch?this is the place for you.while hummus, by definition is impossible to screw up, it&#39;s not hard to make hummus fantastic or incredible.this place is genius! fast casual restaurant offering flavorful, delicious mediterranean food.a young asian girl behind the counter wouldn&#39;t listen to us, was rude, and we stood there for at least 10 minutes waiting for someone to slice the chicken shawarma.*credit cards accepted."
