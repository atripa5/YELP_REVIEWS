falafel-island-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/falafel-island-chicago,4,"And even answering a few questions about the city in general!.came with rice, beef, salad, and hummus.price is cheap.it is very dried and tasteless.i think it was $7.i tried the beef but i hear the chicken is the best.i was meeting up a friend in the loop and had an hour to kill on an empty stomach.rice was good, salad was good, hummus was good, but friend&#39;s lentil soup was not good.menu looked good, so in we went.the staff was nice and the food was cheap, but on a whole, i was severely unimpressed and do not intend to return, no matter how good the falafel may allegedly be."
little-bucharest-bistro-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-bucharest-bistro-chicago,4,"This was a hearty dish of grilled eggplant, cabbage, peppers, spinach, and garlic couscous in a tomato sauce.then we had  braised short rib goulash, it was an pretty okay dish, the short rib was a little dry but the goulash was absolutely delicious.upon walking into little bucharest bistro, we were immediately hailed with a jovial greeting by branko, the restaurant owner.the atmosphere was super cute.there was a live singer that evening..and i&#39;ve had better meals for less than $40 a pop with a drink, shared app, and tip.village salad was loaded with balsamic vinegar, and the tomatoes did not taste good.whereas in some places this might cause the food or service to suffer, we had really wonderful service and even better food."
flacos-tacos-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/flacos-tacos-chicago,4,"Their frozens are on point(even for a girl who prefers the rocks)! the ice is crushed so thin, it almost comes out frothy.don&#39;t miss the $1 taco special on tuesdays as well as the deals they have on other days of the week as well.in fact, it was as if someone just decided to toss in any veggie available.reasonable prices and okay tacos.people kept getting their orders and let&#39;s say 25 min goes by (which it did), and finally i walked up to the counter and they magically had our oder ready, in a to go bag.the quesodilla didn&#39;t come with the red or green salsa..i was surprised at how busy it got on a sunday night.very little avocado to be found.service is decent and a fun atmosphere."
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,4,"The food orders and cokes (to couple with our crown) kept pouring in- the wait staff was amazing.the place is small but very cozy and casual.it&#39;s places like this that make me happy to live in noble square!.my friend got the chicken which was very moist and tender!  i wasn&#39;t too big a fan of their empanadas and have definitely had better at other places around the city.i will definitely be back the next time i am craving some cuban food!.i wouldn&#39;t go back..we ordered sweet plantains, yucca and a steak sandwich.which is kind of dumb because of you come in for a special whether it&#39;s lunch or dinner their all $7-$10 so you have to get way more food.the papa rellenos are so good."
osaka-sushi-express-and-fresh-fruit-smoothies-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/osaka-sushi-express-and-fresh-fruit-smoothies-chicago-2,4,"I ordered the regular rolls (tuna, salmon, etc) and they were all good.really good value!.24 oz for $4, which wasn&#39;t bad.the fish itself is generally pretty fresh and lacking in odor, but the prices are also a little steep for the quick, simple spot that osaka is.each customer is handed two packs of soy sauce and chop sticks with their orders.my roommates and i ordered in from osaka this weekend.was starving after 5 hours at the art institute of chicago! ordered 2 rolls to tie us over to dinner.next time, i&#39;ll stick with smaller, boxed sushi and maybe try a don.the prices are fair given the location and quality.and as an update, no more styrofoam containers!."
zaytune-mediterranean-grill-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/zaytune-mediterranean-grill-chicago-4,4,"I really liked it, the wraps are really big and have a lot of meat.in a separate component was the kalamata sauce which seemed to be yogurt-based.i feel i made two key mistakes at zaytune.i was very surprised that i liked everything.very good steak shawarma platter with rice and a couple of dipping sauces..i can never seem to finish an entrée in one sitting.i easily run through 2-3 cups of their wonderful tomatoe based hot sauce every time.the dip that comes with the fries is really, really good and i would actual love to just have a bottle of it to put over my next 10 meals.the tastes mix well though the lamb did have the smell that only lamb has."
dos-riccos-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dos-riccos-chicago-5,4,"The simply decorated seating area is pleasant enough, but can get warm and smoky once they start cooking in the kitchen.the food is kind of pricey for what you get.how can that possibly work?  egg-foo-youngritos?  kitty-catacos?  i imagined walking out of there with an oddly-filled burrito and some kikkoman soy sauce packets.we saw dos ricco&#39;s on chicago&#39;s best and decided to give it a try before heading out of town at midwayhonest review its not good the food is so overrated to the max like youll eat here n be like wtf thats what the hypes about n btw it is expensive n portions are small its jus like a normal taco place nothing special i would go to tio luis instead that place is great..but whether you dine in or take out, you need to try dos ricco&#39;s!!!the waitstaff are very friendly and will talk through the menu with you.this dish does not disappoint.this place was an absolutely fabulous find near chicago midway airport..i wasn&#39;t sure quite what to expect from dos riccos, but the reviews were decent and they were in walking distance of the midway hampton inn, so i went for it."
peach-and-green-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peach-and-green-chicago,4,"Right next to goddess and the baker, and a small step up i think.this place has the best cobb salad in the loop! the chicken is straight from the rotisserie, they chop the bacon right in front of you, the dressing is very well balanced and the portion is incredibly generous--it could be lunch for two if you aren&#39;t starved.been here a few times now, just for breakfast though, while the coffee is overpriced for the small portions you get, at least the breakfast sandwiches are big and good quality for what you pay for them, i&#39;ve gotten the breakfast burrito, egg ham cheddar, and full irish, of them the burrito was easily my favorite.held up extremely well.the descriptions are detailed which makes deciphering the cute names of each dish easy.the wrap also had a caesar salad in it that included lettuce, cherry tomatoes and croutons.only come here if you enjoy drinking and paying $4 for what they claim is a &#34;matcha latte&#34; but is essentially hot water with a hint of milk.55.onward and upward.i immediately regretted not getting the homemade ginger syrup in said latte, as i only noticed the sign after sitting down."
kurah-mediterranean-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kurah-mediterranean-chicago-2,3,"For food, we got the bacon wrapped dates, the squash and the combination kebab platter (kefta and ribeye).spinach and feta pies -- a bit doughy and a bit bland but not terrible.this place have very nice decor for the location! i went with a friend yesterday and had a very good moscow mule, zesty and somehow refreshing ceviche appetizer, and biryani--the yummy sauce and almonds! the service is friendly and pretty quick for an early dinner..i went here on a friday afternoon and the parking was packed.the rose infused flan and chime cellars pinot noir rounded out our experience.we spent a little over $30 each after taxes, drinks and tip, but were not exactly full after everything was said and done.i ordered the waiter&#39;s recommendation of kebbah and the fattoush salad.kurah is a charming restaurant with middle of the road food.we shared the combination platter (rib eye and chicken) with grilled veggies."
bodhi-thai-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bodhi-thai-chicago-2,4,"95 between 11am-3pm as a lunch special!i order without bean sprouts because i don&#39;t like them.for entrees we got the massaman pork curry, the eggplant basil chicken special, and the pad khee mao noodles with pork.this is a small place with very limited seating inside and out but that&#39;s ok since the experience is amazing.with great flavors and a hefty serving size, i will definitely be back to have more amazing thai goodness.i&#39;d like to try more of their dishes.i also think the sauce wasn&#39;t that tasty and could have been thicker.the entree menu states each item serves 2-3 people, maybe if it were tapas.it does not taste all that spectacular, but still pretty good for its price.the curry was delicious.yummy hot thai food, i got the pad thai with peanut butter sauce and he warmed it up for me! if the weather wasn&#39;t so cold i would&#39;ve got a thai iced tea! also weekly specials looked great!super nice owner, he is happy to be there! i even got the cute mini tote/wine bag."
bari-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bari-chicago,5,"(sandwiches people)seriously, for the same price as what you&#39;d get at a subway they serve an additional 3 inches of better stuff.the pepper jack cheese actually has a pepper jack taste.so this place is more then just sandwiches.i ordered friday night before they closed and wonder if they were using up old bread.i&#39;m currently trying to compare the italian subs at some well-known places and, honestly, i can&#39;t choose a clear stand out, just yet.with a killer combination of capocollo, genoa salami, mortadella, provolone, lettuce, tomato, and spicy giardiniera, bari foods in chicago&#39;s west town has perfected the sandwich, any sandwich.they&#39;re packed with meat and are very reasonably priced.this place is about as chicago italian as they come and they have some great stuff inside.i love this place for their subs, browsing the aisles of delightful italian foodstuffs, and the incredibly strong accents that prevail.the star is the deli in the back and the great italian sandwich (recommend with giardinera)."
shokolad-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shokolad-chicago,5,"The servers are nice.their prices are more than reasonable, and the food is always delicious.those were tart cherries served with powdered sugar and unsweetened cream.ooo and trust me, i&#39;ll leave it to them because i&#39;m sure it would sound ever so sexy compared to what i could mumble!  on a similar note, i couldn&#39;t believe all the ukrainians who reside in what i would call ukrainian village/humboldt park and who came in to visit the boy working.i wish they had given me 2 large, or 4 small pieces of toast rather than the two small ones (this is my constant cranky concern), but everything was wonderful.shokolad is a delightful ukrainian restaurant/bakery, appropriately located in the ukrainian village between the humboldt park and west town neighborhoods.anyways, enough of my life&#39;s history for now, this is yelp after all.great brunch/lunch option.this was one of the last meals of our chicago trip, so we were waddling around like penguins from all of the rich food that we had eaten.i had the varenyky, veggie dumplings in sauce at their food stall at daley plaza, it was delicious! will go and visit the restaurant to taste their extensive menu."
coyotes-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/coyotes-restaurant-chicago,4,"The workers here are nice.nothing wrong, but nothing great.the tacos are just the meat grilled and covered in onions and cilantro, so an authentic taco and not the usual taco fare that you get in a tex mex place.the tacos are amazing! i tried both the lengua and the asada and both are delicious!!! for about $2 each including tax, it&#39;s a steal! plus one point.the service is extremely quick here.not sure what happened, because they werent always like this.they also have a really good selection of ice cream here! i will definitely come back here.overall, pretty good, but not the best.we were hesitant, it looked dirty and run down but we were also hungry and hunger conquers all.the steak was alright and the chicken was just gross."
the-bristol-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bristol-chicago,4,"The space of the bristol - shabby chic, loft, locovore complete with tables made of reclaimed wood, mason jars, brick walls, and light-bulbs with visible filaments - made me think that the employees might be warm, inviting, and friendly.the ice cream tasted just like this indian ice cream called kulfi.i look forward to coming back for their brunch one day!.she recommended 7 appetizers for 5 people and 5 entrees.we walked in w/ a group of 3 around 6 pm on a friday sans reservation and were fortunate enough to get seated right away.i&#39;m by no means a brunch aficionado, but the execution of dishes was great.thanks.we started to think about our order and realized that was way too much food.next we had the escolar with red quinoa.chicken n biscuit - it was a little on the small side, but the flavor was definitely there."
chicago-wingz-around-the-world-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chicago-wingz-around-the-world-chicago,3,"The surrounding neighborhood is pretty rough, so i would recommend driving over to the restaurant.and there were no fries, luckily i caught it before i got too far away.all flavors were delicious.didn&#39;t even know this spot was over here.i can honestly say i&#39;ve never had a bad experience here.best wings on the planet! get the garlic parmesan, cheesy buffalo, and jerk barbecue and you&#39;ll get a vast myriad of memorable flavors.amazing service.when we first stepped in we could see the place was clean and the aroma of the wings filled the restaurant."
parlor-pizza-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/parlor-pizza-bar-chicago,4,"Overall the food is okay, but the highlights of this place is the atmosphere and vibe here.my only request would be to have a better cocktail list.what the heck!  you had three types of vodka to choose from (which the waitress will bring), then you go the the bloody mary bar and choose from 4 mixers, lots of hot sauce, pickles, cheeses, meats, olives, peppers, lemons, etc etcwalked by a few times during dinner time and it looked packed inside, was walking by during lunch break once and it seems not so busy and we walked inthe environment is nice, very chill and good for relaxing and conversations, the food tasted so-so with big portion..another favorite with a clever name was the cheesus, mary and joseph.will come back for sure.ample seating during the workweek, too, which is quite the commodity!.closer to three-and-a-half.but i thought the use of truffle was super overpowering.on the other, it can get very loud on the inside, and there are better pizza places in the city."
cafe-central-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-central-chicago,4,"I think what would help the mofongo would be the addition of say, shrimp stew in the middle, all covered by sofrito, or at least another sauce.make sure you come thursday-sunday because that&#39;s when this sandwich is offered! the waitress brought it out cut in half on two plates without asking, which was by thoughtful, as we had told her we would be sharing everything.yay this place is cheap, fast and yummy.the jibaritos were perfectly sized and cooked.i found cafe central via yelp, of course, after sifting through a good puerto rican place to try out the jibarito.about $5.i am speechless because that is what happens when you sink your teeth into the crispy plantain, steak and cheese sammich  :)  no time for talk just eat.the slice of kraft american cheese that they throw on this thing brings everything perfectly together in an unparalleled state of harmonious flavor profiles.husbo had the goat stew and it was scrumptious.the service was awesome, everyone was so nice, and this will be a regular answer when asked the question, &#34;where should we go for lunch?&#34;."
dianas-food-and-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dianas-food-and-restaurant-chicago,1,"If heaven were a place on earth! this little gem is right near my house and i couldn&#39;t be happier.steak sandwich, the cuban, and the steak empanadas (plus their great prices)?  all good at diana&#39;s, which is only open for breakfast and lunch (or maybe an early dinner, if you can move fast)."
la-palapa-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-palapa-chicago,4,"On my last day working in the area, i ordered the filete relleno and almost kissed the fish.the fish tacos were just okay.it&#39;s a lot if food.dining outside, protected from the street noise and the elements with a canopy, was a pleasure.&#34; ummmmm.i had a chance to try the langostinos and they were perfectly seasoned and flavorful.the manager gets on the line and apologies and says he will send out our order again and will throw in something extra for the inconvenience.they passed their inspection???  we didn&#39;t leave a tip for the waitress because of her lack of communication with us; didn&#39;t ask how food was, if we wanted anything else, or bring check on time.my son loved them! oh since we brought wine for the adults, we ordered orchata for my son.i do think the dishes could be a bit over priced and the place in the summer is a total party spot."
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,4,"Great beer great specials great location next to the metra and grand aveburgers are great and the patio is greatgood specials too..we started with naked wings with jerk and chiliyaki sauce on the side and i probably could&#39;ve eaten 20 of those by myself.great place for food and drinks!i ordered the cubano grinder - pulled pork, ham, dijonaise, swiss cheese and pickles served with sweet potato tots.the variety of the menu- from alligator and lamb to crayfish sausage, is refreshing and adventurous couture.they could be kicked up a bit with hot peppers or giardinara.simpson&#39;s image sidled up next to the event info.and was really happy with the whole night.parking is usually tough, so leave the keys at home and walk.guess i&#39;ll have to come back for more tasty beer and yummy grinder.cool spot with an interesting mix of people and awesome beer selection."
knife-and-tine-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/knife-and-tine-chicago-2,5,"Yelp&#39;s burger binge week brought me to this fine spot.fried chicken dry and bad.not a terribly large place, but they have 2 separate rooms; the main room which has a booth wall and the bar, and then a slightly smaller room sectioned off by double doors which looks onto the main street.our group was placed in a private room in the back with its own doors.i must say though that my favorite part of the meal was the bloody mary.both tasty and fresh!for an appetizer, we ordered the dates, and they were so good!!our dinner was delicious! i ordered their famous burger, which was fantastic.the only thing lacking is the dessert.we had several questions about the menu that were answered with the information already presented on the menu.- ciopinno had a good flavor with a spice kick.if you&#39;re feeling breakfast try the k&amp;t hash."
vera-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vera-chicago,4,"-chicken thigh-shrimp - the shrimp was good but just didn&#39;t stand out uniquely.we ordered a couple of the wines on tap and both were delightful.i also had a flight of sherry, which was divine.the only thing that was lacking was the salad.couldn&#39;t find the uni though..done.i&#39;ll try to rate in order of yumminess:-beef tongue - tender and served with delicious chimmichuri-egg ravioli - a big ravioli with a runny egg and soft cheese in the middle, served with english peas and pork, this was delicious!-grilled octopus - tender (not chewy) with a nice sauce, fingerling potatoes and lima beans-vera platter - 3 cheeses and 3 meats - highly enjoyable-bread - order it for the quark! - we had to google this one, it didn&#39;t sound great, but it&#39;s delicious!  tangy and smooth, i highly recommend, which tied with the salt &amp; pepper butter - i couldn&#39;t get enough bread for this delicious butter!-roasted beets - always a winner, i wish i got more-calamari - i&#39;m not a fan of calamari, but i tried this to see how it was, i just think it&#39;s always chewy, though the flavors were milder and didn&#39;t smell as fishy as it often canwe tried all the desserts, my favorite was the chocolate bar (it is what it sounds like, delicious chocolate in broken up bar format).the service was super friendly, knowledgeable and patient, but also very slow.we came here for dinner a couple of weeks ago and loved it."
peachs-resturant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peachs-resturant-chicago,3,"So good!.the server was polite.this place was average.we sat and watched tables go 5-6 minutes with empty plates and trash from the people who previously sat there.overall, i highly recommend you give this place a try.the pancakes were not done in the middle.not sure if the food was enough to overlook everything else.the other items were not bad but just ok.they carry stivers coffee which is good.it just didn&#39;t &#34;knock me out&#34;."
steakbar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/steakbar-chicago,3,"Next, their customer service is great.i believe they are because we had so much topping, we ordered more plain chips, and they took a while because the server explained they&#39;re made in house to order, so she couldn&#39;t just bring them out.i love the concept of a steakhouse combined with a bar vibe.the prices are comparable to other places in the neighborhood.we were clearly stuffed up on carbs before dessert so we had to pass on it.the meat, chips and side of queso were great.after having tried this place a few times now, while the food has gotten better, the service has not.all the fav&#39;s--au cheval burger, prime rib sandwich--killer chicken fried steak--$5 house wine served in high end glass and a carafe--great cutie waitresses (ashley)."
amk-kitchen-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amk-kitchen-bar-chicago,4,"For dinner my cousin and i shared the churro sundae which was spectacular.our server was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.can you ask for more?? turns out you can, because i also ordered the pork belly and it was amazing as well.that is a rarity for me to say as i usually love mashed potatoes.i came here on a friday night with a bunch of friends and the restaurant was pretty crowded (save 2 tables), so that was a good sign.i love smokey drinks and this drink had just the right amount of toasty flavor with cool garnish.probably one of the best brand new restaurants i&#39;ve experienced in a while.it was one of the best dessert i&#39;ve ever had..a late night bar and food concept that&#39;s reasonably priced for locals and classy enough w/ its open garage style door for people from further away to want to chill there."
asian-outpost-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/asian-outpost-chicago,5,"I really have not had service this bad in a long time.my favorites include: pork belly buns, quinoa stir fry, panko tofu with jalapeños.if there is one thing that you remember from this review, it is this: order the pork belly sliders!  if you don&#39;t love them, come see me.despite that some noodles ended up sticking together that became a large chunk, the broth, egg and pork were very good.we went in on monday night to celebrate our wedding anniversary.i also liked the slaw side - not mayo dressed, but more like a vinaigrette and was freshly dressed so it had a great crunch.quinoa salad is very good.our two side dishes were yellow quinoa with mild curry seasoning and hearty black pepper potato salad with bacon, celery, and green onions.the food was fresh and delicious and our server was friendly and helpful.great delivery!! the miso soup and dumplings were hot and the sushi was cold and fresh."
stax-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/stax-cafe-chicago,3,"For several weeks, i would go spinning and then come straight to stax for a filling and satisfying brunch.over all, this place was exactly a-ok for me, i had the dulce de leche french toast and the dulce de leche wasn&#39;t mixed in the french toast, it just replaces the syrup.the coffee was outstanding.i went back a second time for lunch, but i tried my sister&#39;s omelet and it was great.45-60 minutes had passed since we finished our food.all in all, this place was alright.it&#39;s on &#34;taylor&#34; street :).i&#39;ve now been to stax cafe on taylor three times.it&#39;s my &#34;go to&#34; for sure! i highly recommend this dish for anyone who loves bomb food.the star of the show was the adorable mini waffles i got with my omelette."
cafe-el-meson-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-el-meson-chicago,2,"Just with one visit and i knew this was a place my husband and i can just sit in for hours.i wish such place exists in my hood in albany park on the north side, within close proximity to my apartment.i&#39;ve been back a few times."
shabowl-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shabowl-chicago,1,"They did not even acknowledge the price difference.i think that filipino food tends towards the drier side (where the flavor is in the meat marinade instead of a sauce), and i found my dish kind of dry."
carnitas-uruapan-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/carnitas-uruapan-restaurant-chicago,4,"Omg!  amazing!the salsa and peppers make the taco!   dont pass on these.i came on a saturday morning and was greeted by a young girl at the counter who told me to sit anywhere.the salsas were tasty too.you can buy corn tortillas from them and eat it right there in the restaurant (seating is somewhat limited though).it was a wonderful lunch.carnitas, please.the tacos were excellent and i checked in on yelp and got a free chicharron - it was huge.the staff is super friendly and were very tolerant of my broken spanish.the chicharron was also amazing, very soft and crunchy.once you get seated, service is lightning fast where you get your corn tortillas, salsas, and food within 5 minutes."

the-artisan-cellar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-artisan-cellar-chicago,4,"I&#39;ve never seen any of their movies, i think all the quotes i&#39;ve heard from them sounds dumb, and i don&#39;t find myself wanting to be or look like either them.the only inconvenience is wait time: plan for about 20 minutes to order and get your panini.the soup of the day was minestrone (i didn&#39;t think i could handle the turkey chili with plastic teeth).at first glance i thought the sandwich seemed a bit small and might not be filling enough.there are definitely better and faster options-wish we had picked one of those places instead.definitely a nice change from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the merchandise mart and loop.i came in here looking for wine to accompany a birthday dinner with my boyfriend.50 it wasn&#39;t cheap but honestly for a lunch in the loop it kinda is, as sad as that is ! the sandwhiches are made out of the best ingredients and while they are not huge portions by any means they are decievingly filling.the bread was pressed perfectly and the individual components were very fresh and flavorful."
giordanos-chicago-30,https://www.yelp.com/biz/giordanos-chicago-30,4,"Make sure you go hungry!!.had a family dinner with 12 people and we left very happy.the crust was hard and had no flavor.i thought it was too much going on.we saw a few chairs in the bar area, and asked the bartender if we could order pizza at the bar, was given a little attitude again, and after apologizing for inconveniencing her, was told we could sit there and order pizza.we were too stuffed for dessert after all was said and done, but i wouldn&#39;t hesitate to come back to another giordano&#39;s the next time i&#39;m in town.the thing weighed maybe 4-5lbs and cost close to $30 usd.the calamari was breaded and crispy but it too had next to zero flavor and that&#39;s with the marinara sauce.the service was good, pizza of course took awhile (about an hour because it&#39;s deep dish).i feel that with a place like this it is a once in a time thing where you should just try it."
phils-pizza-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/phils-pizza-chicago,4,"I can&#39;t tell you how many hoe-ass pizza places like to charge you $20 for a medium pizza, and hardly put any meat on that sh*t.came here after a long day on the south sideone of the best places for thin crust in the city, their crust is thick, very similar to beggar&#39;s, you get a healthy amount of toppings as well, and the peppers are sliced and not diced, in addition it&#39;s very reasonably priced for the amount you get, definitely the best pizza place in bridgeport..the first time i ever went to phil&#39;s was when they were on halstedupdate: 8/10/2016phil&#39;s pizza is now my pizza of choice sorry beggarsbut phil&#39;s is better and also cheaper!go to phil&#39;s for some great pizza! yummo! it&#39;s not a fancy pizzeria but trust me they&#39;ll fade any fancy pizzeria place out here!!!#awsomesauce!!..the verdictthe crustwas good , thin but not as crispy as they advertise.so i guess if they had answered the phone, i could&#39;ve experienced their food.it&#39;s pretty damn greasy, especially if you get their sausage but so delicious.they don&#39;t have cups either but they do have plenty of seating and free parking up and down the street.when i&#39;m sober, phil&#39;s is still my go-to."

medici-on-57th-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/medici-on-57th-chicago,4,"But come after 11 pm and get discounted bakery items!  the spinach goat cheese pizza is amazing, as is the mexican chocolate milk shake.visited the actual restaurant this past sunday.to me this feels like the kind of place you bring your parents when they&#39;re in town and you want to impress them with your hip but approachable neighborhood joint, or a first date when you don&#39;t want the person to know your true self.lunched here with a small group of eight as part of a meeting.and did i mention cold? so, i called the store and explained what i just explained to the lady who answered.i do enjoy coming here and its always busy so they must be doing something right.i can&#39;t believe it took me this long to visit this hyde park institution! thank you, daphne l.as for the menu, most milkshake fans swear by the mexicana, though all the shakes have the benefit of coming with house-made whipped cream, greatly improving the overall quality of the shakes.but, after trying to add salt, pepper, and parmesan cheese - i gave up and asked them to take the dish.cappuccino and mexicana shake are good."

wood-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wood-chicago,4,"The rest of us didn&#39;t order any meat dishes and weren&#39;t as satisfied.kale salad: the pork was juicy and crispy and mmmmmmmmmmmmm.the portion size was just right so that i was full at the end of the meal but not overstuffed (like i would be at a pizza place).every component of this dish was perfect.we had some of the small plates which included the &#34;special&#34; short ribs, which were good, but not for everyone as they are not the fall off the bone kind (which jeremiah explained) but they were packed with flavor.in fact, she nursed one the entire dinner when she normally has two because she was concerned about inebriation.overall, a phenomenal atmosphere and great main dish, i&#39;ll definitely be back!.as we were drinking, we got hungry.jeremiah recommended the roasted chickenhonest review food is really good get the corn soup!!! trust me its amaizing the flambe pizza is really great to orded the duck, pork loin, and short rib n the chocolate dessert its really amaizing service was jus okay like for the price i should be treated like a king n the prices are expensive like really really expensive.."

ground-control-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ground-control-chicago,4,"The best review anyone can give about an entrée is ordering it a second time.chicago has more than a few places to get vegan american foods (think po&#39;boys, cheesesteak sandwiches, biscuits and gravy) and ground control doesn&#39;t do anything particularly novel compared to chicago diner, handlebar, native foods, karyn&#39;s cooked or kitchen 17.the first time i came here, i ordered the sweet potato tacos and they were very good.the food is amazing - i had the beet burger which was one of the simplest, closest to beef (which i haven&#39;t actually eaten in over 3 years), veggie burgers i&#39;ve ever had.but there&#39;s a twist: the menu is all vegetarian and i think every item has a vegan option as well.her response was nothing but a shoulder shrug, she never offered to remake it or anything.i felt like the wait staff was doing me a favor by coming to the table.the jibarito was amazing! the seitan was succulent and thin.their fries are the only thing i don&#39;t understand about this place, i guess they don&#39;t carry homemade fries and that is a bad thing because pretty much everything you order here goes great with fries! their other sides are not impressive so we always get unhappy about  sides.i was not disappointed! i ordered my vegan and they were flavorful and so filling."
kusanya-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kusanya-cafe-chicago,4,It they had more vegan options i would increase the stars.this is a really nice cafe with a great vibe.the prices are fair also.but i did want some tea and i got a really big cup of green tea with honey in it./halsted green line.i decided on a coffee and a slice of chocolate cake.wish there was a cafe like this by my house!!!! lol.nice little gem on the southside.
carbon-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/carbon-chicago-3,4,"Gross.highly recommended.many of the other offerings looked underwhelming.i would skip the tortilla soup.albeit a bit strange because it had carrots and peas inside.i think the price point is little high here.i bought two of each taco, guacamole and some beans.anyhow, something in the bowl made everything a bit soggy.best chicken tacos i&#39;ve ever had, no joke.it&#39;s a hybrid of a burrito bowl and a salad (a mix of the best options of chipotle and qdoba, respectively)."
giordanos-chicago-16,https://www.yelp.com/biz/giordanos-chicago-16,4,"The winning protein topping was the all-beef meatballs! we had to get a personalized 6&#34; pizza combo each before we left chicago..we ordered the meat and more meat stuffed deep dish pizza.very well recommended when you are staying in the area or on a short business visit.i can normally eat quite a few slices of pizza, but here i struggled through two.finally had the opportunity to try a real deep dish pizza while visiting from california.i should have ordered thin crust.friday night.it was all delicious and with enough left over for another meal over the weekend.it does not matter and we absolutely find those stories utterly so self-absorbed that anything the reviewer types afterward becomes suspect."

turkey-chop-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/turkey-chop-chicago,1,"It&#39;s almost kind of hard to not want to support a business doing so much good, especially since the food and service is also phenomenal.so, this review is absolutely no reflection on crystal.great food, great staff."

giordanos-chicago-27,https://www.yelp.com/biz/giordanos-chicago-27,4,"Crust here is just rubbery and the sauce is bland.i didn&#39;t love the sauce, and the we didn&#39;t eat our crust which is usually my favorite part.i like that we could pre-order the pizza while we were waiting to get seated.supposedly it takes 30-45 minutes to get the pizza made which lined up with our wait time.i just had to get some authentic deep dish pizza while i was in town.the waiter didn&#39;t even stop by after besides to bring us water.yum..someone at home told her to try giordano&#39;s.it was extraordinary and well worth the navy pier mob."
galata-turkish-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/galata-turkish-restaurant-chicago,2,"It&#39;s a great addition to university village.my friend wolfed down his kabobs despite ostensibly being full from our massive round of appetizers.they were so sweet and offered to put my flowers on the bar since there wasn&#39;t room for them on the table, and gave me a free drink for my birthday.each dish comes in four so you can share with the entire table."
busy-burger-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/busy-burger-chicago,4,"I read some other reviews on here where the cashier fails to ask follow up questions like these.ordered a dcb and he didn&#39;t ask me if i wanted cheese or if i wanted raw or grilled onions!? i ended up with a burger with no cheese &amp; raw onions.i hastily searched for some place to send me a burger on grubhub and found busy burger.50 each.it&#39;s a pretty standard chicken sandwich with bacon, lettuce, tomato + the busy sauce; i generally add avocado to mine, it&#39;s the perfect addition.only two things with my order, my food wasn&#39;t cold but it wasn&#39;t sizzling either  when i picked it up &amp; the size of onion rings was disproportioned to the price.the spicy busy sauce was great, and had a little heat to make for an interesting flavor to go on the char broiled meat.i&#39;m not sure if it was a mistake, or if that&#39;s how they make the lettuce wrap, so i&#39;ll try it out again and update this review!extra star for their milkshakes.the burger bun is fresh and tasty as well.fresh natural ground beef, nicely seasoned, hand formed patty, grilled and not fried, the busy beef patty is a thing of beauty."

currency-exchange-cafe-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/currency-exchange-cafe-chicago-2,4,"The service is a bit slow and one of the servers was a little dismissive of one of my requests.the concept is great - i believe they wanted to transform an abandoned building into a space for food and art.it&#39;s actually a lot of chips sitting in a jalapeño-tomato sauce, covered in chicken, sour cream, cheese and eggs, which i ordered scrambled.i went to cec yesterday for their &#34;grits and butter&#34; event hosted by the silver room.the music here was also really loud and didn&#39;t really give me a cafe vibe, and it was definitely hard for me to hear my conversation, even though i was just sitting on the opposite side of the table.i&#39;ve found it a great spot to camp out and do work.i love the bookshelves and one day when i&#39;m not working maybe i&#39;ll grab a book..this cafe&#39; is defintely a new concept and part of investment in a community that needs a commercial boost.the only knock is the service started off great, then there was a huge gap in time to take our orders."

bistro-18o-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-18o-chicago,4,"All the other menu options look great too.one of the best places i have tried mexican food,  i would highly recommend this one.the burgers are sublime with unusual toppings (the place describes itself as a &#34;latin american grille&#34;).everything about this restaurant was outstanding! except the coffee it was okay (i&#39;m big on coffee, so -1 star).he showed us the menu and highlighted a few items..man, it&#39;s like a weird.i really admire the sign/signs that they have outside of the restaurant that profiles some of the menu."
turquoise-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/turquoise-restaurant-chicago,4,"They put an upscale spin on a type of food i don&#39;t typically associated with upscale.moreover, it comes with a huge helping of fries, so you won&#39;t leave hungry.they didn&#39;t even know the channel and they waited the table very well too.every time in chicago, we make the effort to visit and always good.you would not think something so cloud-like would burst with flavour either, the way those seasoned scallops tasted.we ordered hummus and su boreji for apps.perhaps order ahead.it was soooo good.it started to get really warm by us at our table for whatever reason.try the turkish custard, much better."

snaggletooth-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/snaggletooth-chicago,5,"I considered not eating most of it, but did anyway to see if it was just unbalanced in some places.five minutes later, i picked up the rest of the order..and fun fact, the cured fish go really well with ravioli.i want to try everything on the menu.as far as the food goes, the schmear bar is an awesome idea.further enhancing the experience is the wonderful people behind snaggletooth; such a warm, friendly couple that have created a fun, cozy, relaxing, neighborhoody vibe in a beautiful little space.the co-owner explained they were a coffee place, not latte.this place is the real deal!  come early because they sell out.snaggletooth got a little piece of my heart the second i walked in and saw all of the beautiful succulents, rustic mismatched plates and silverware, and last but not least."
ruxbin-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ruxbin-chicago,4,"This place was on my list for a while but i avoided it because i heard the wait was long/i get hangry easily.without a doubt, the most hipster place i have ever dined at.if you only go here to see the tardis-like restroom, it will be worth it.the atmosphere is perfect for an intimate group dinner (or in my case, dinner with the bf and my dad).portion side is a bit small, but i felt prices fair given the quality.many reviewers have commented how the garlic fries were amazing, but imo.there were dishes that we loved, including the cauliflower and the foie gras.i know.5 plates for $65 per person.i&#39;ve been there twice and both tines the food was good."

(if sunny) large open space and plenty of room for people.as other reviews mentioned, service can be spotty.so service is so so, drinks are alright, food is great and they made it super easy to pay.the steak was okay though i probably would replace it with a different flavor on a next trip.i know it can stink being on the other side of the bar, but don&#39;t agree to it then, ok?  ok.i could barely swallow the pork belly.i was very excited to see that they had things on the menu that appeared to be vegan or could be made vegan.i will need to try more of their tacos to comment on it."

fontano-subs-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fontano-subs-chicago-2,5,"Meat was well-sliced though i could have used a few more slices.i typically ask for no mayo because even when i have asked for only a little mayo it still seems like they put a lot on it.i got the blockbuster with everything, and oh my was it good! the bread was perfect for me and oh the meats.the sub: italian sub was good, although i was expecting for their cold cuts to be among the expected but i think no pepperoni was used.this place is a small storefront in little italy, now surrounded by the uic campus.made me remember how good cold sandwiches are.beautifully sliced meats and cheeses served up on fresh gonnella bread.my favorite sandwich place since uic.i am indeed the biggest fan ever of their meatball sub with swiss cheese and a pickle on the side.but it was still great! next time, i&#39;ll get the &#39;cheesy beef!&#39;."

(chicken + maek from the korean word &#34;maekju,&#34; which means beer) i organized a chimaek meetup for the chicago korean language meetup group at rice&#39;n bread, and it was a terrific night out! rice&#39;n bread had plenty of room for our group of nine, and the server easily split our bill without complaint.the spice was actually spicy and sooo satisfying."

catch-35-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/catch-35-chicago,4,"Nice restaurant, in general! live music never fails - so few places have a live band these days.my main dish was a local white fish, and it was very well cooked, well presented and overall very tasty.so i chose it for my friends/family to try.service was very attentive and the atmosphere was nice, but wasn&#39;t blown away by flavor of the dishes.i am glad i had the opportunity to try this restaurant for restaurant week 2015.the decor is upscale and inviting and the live music was a nice touch.i loved the dressing and the fresh fruit on top.i will visit again.&#34;we ordered a bottle of wine, sea bass, and scallops.catch and carry is on the other side and if you don&#39;t work in the building it might be the best kept lunch secret in the city."
honeys-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/honeys-chicago,2,The restaurant has an art chic/speak easy feel.-1975 cocktail - b (did not prefer the bar adding cava to old fashion recipe)-hamachi - d-caesar salad - a-buckwheat pasta - a--bass - a--strip loin - b-baked alaska - b.but that is expected at a new spot.caesar salad-grilled and was pretty decent.paying attention to every last detail that is happening at your table.

balena-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/balena-chicago,4,"Our table opted for the restaurant week menu, but we also ordered the brussels sprouts pizza, which was my favorite food item.the ceiling was so high and everything was wooden and rustic.love the razor clams pasta which is not even on the menu.it was very yummy and i will certainly go again.it is just north of north ave.we ordered ourselves a bottle of wine and had a total of six dishes between us.very interesting menu.my girlfriend and i went to balena for our anniversary.i didn&#39;t ask for that, and i didn&#39;t expect it (i mean it wasn&#39;t gross- i still ate half, it just wasn&#39;t that good) but what a nice gesture.when we were seated, our waiter was very pleasant and informative."
yolk-chicago-8,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yolk-chicago-8,4,"The staff is very nice no doubt on that, that&#39;s the whole massive food system the issue.the coffee was so good! i wish i knew what they brewed there.like the other places i had been to before this place was full and bustling but i managed to find a place in 5 minutes at the bar.the food was good and i would definitely go back again.i always see crowds huddled around the entrance in the mornings on the weekends so i figured i&#39;d give a try to see what all the hype was about.my biggest issue with this place is that it was so hard for me to decide what to order! they have a pretty extensive menu.we both enjoyed the food and service.it also comes with a side of diced red potatoes and fruits.yolk is a decent brunch place here in chicago; there are several locations in the city.we ordered the peppermint mocha and strawberry orange juice."
table-donkey-and-stick-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/table-donkey-and-stick-chicago,4,"Finally, the desserts were really good and quite beautiful.to eat we had the duck liver mousse with raspberries (their signature dish) which was good and well-executed, but probably not something i would order again, very rich and fatty.frankly, the food sucked.really enjoyed my experience here!  we ordered a charcuterie plate with 3 different meats and cheeses.g.there was duck liver mouse (da bomb!!), grasseola was the aged meat (goood flavor), cantal cheese dressed with honey and nuts.i&#39;d highly recommend this spot!.when you walk in the host stand is absolutely gorgeous and all i could think about is if the stand was hallow and how hard it would be to lift it..i think the only slightly annoying thing is that the host stand is located off to the side when you walk in."
spotted-monkey-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/spotted-monkey-chicago,4,"In a way it is saucy porka 2, as the layout and the menu has a very similar feel to saucy porka.kimchi is the start of this dish.besides just bringing over the order to our table, they offer plates/spoons when they see you may be sharing food, and come over to fill our waters.since it&#39;s opening, spotted monkey has worked out its kinks and is now in one of my favorite go-too&#39;s.all in all, definitely a fan of the asian-latin fusion going on here, and while the fries were probably my favorite thing on the menu, i had no major qualms with the other dishes as well.guajillo pork baco - liked the pineapple topping - wish they would put that on the bahn mi pork as wellpanang curry chicken - good, but could have been a little more curry-y in my opinion, or maybe just add a little sauce?five spice duck - tender and not fatty duck, well cooked, but lacked some flavor - a bit gamey.for lunch i had the panang curry chicken salad and a picadillo eggroll and both were outstanding.stopped in for lunch the other day and had a yummy bahn mi sandwich and le croix.this place is great.and last but not least is the puerto rican rice bowl with pork."
chilango-mexican-street-food-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilango-mexican-street-food-chicago,4,"Also, the orange sauce on everything.without a doubt, one of the best non-taqueria taco joints i&#39;ve been too.lovely quick and cheap lunch spot.i was on the hunt for some good al pastor tacos, and this place was convenient so i decided to check them out.ordered:the fish tacos - on special and really liked it, there was something sweet on it that i didn&#39;t care for but their spicy serrano sauce did the trick.the al pastor was nicely cooked, not my favorite but it came with cilantro and onions and i believe some pineapple bits.their burrito bowl is average, i had it the first time i went and almost never came back (that would have been a tragic mistake)i do not like that weird sweet pink sauce.in this case it is a matter of the former.husbands tacos were great, and i loved my chicken taco salad.first of all i don&#39;t live anywhere near taylor street, but i had a taste for mexican food and this was one of the restaurants i bookmarked on yelp."

3-greens-market-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/3-greens-market-chicago-3,4,"The coffee bar coffee wasn&#39;t bad, but their pastries beyond their donuts looked terrible.only downside is that is closes pretty early at 8.they need more seating, but i&#39;d be back for lunch if was nearby.listen fam, we people come from the old country buffet, golden corral, and chinese hybrid buffet spots that serve tater tots and pizza along with sweet and sour pork..i had the pastrami sandwich which was advertised as thin cut but was definitely on the thicker side in my opinion.the hot bar and the salad bar are both billed by the weight (about 10 bucks a pound).if you want the perfect burger, you still gotta pay your dues.i was new to the dillmans pastrami--it was warm and salty and honestly, just perfect.will definitely be back to try more!."
weber-grill-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/weber-grill-restaurant-chicago,4,"My kids like the pretzel rolls with butter.shredded pork was awesome, and the meatloaf was excellent..my dinner here was delicious.carrot cake was bomb (in the good way) and i love carrot cake, so applause for the desert.we were both in the mood for fish so i ordered the parmesan-crusted tilapia and he the wood-grilled caribbean mahi mahi.they gave quite a set up with the grills in the kitchen where you can do over and see them cooking all the food.when we found this place on yelp (conveniently located around the corner from our hotel), we didn&#39;t actually realize this was the weber grill brand restaurant.we started with a brilliant pretzel tasting roll.the meal was wonderful, portions were perfect, and the noise level is what you would expect in a chicago restaurant bar."

disotto-enoteca-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/disotto-enoteca-chicago,5,"The pork belly with gnocchi is delicious, but the portion is *huge* so order wisely if you are splitting other dishes.the price was a little too high for my blood but i&#39;m guessing you are paying for the overall  experience as well.the fam is an array of dietary restrictions but this place was a winner on every level.they were out of the burrata, but the server suggested another dish, the eggplant meatballs.there&#39;s no signage outside on the street.our server was prompt with our drinks, and gave us excellent recommendations.i would suggest coming here for a date with the romantic feel and ambiance.knowing this, i submissively let her take the reigns of my evening while she started me off with a global tasting tour of her top picks: 75&amp;co.would be happy to return again!.then before our wine even arrives, the food arrives--all at once! the olives, the egg bread, and the ravioli, which then had to sit  getting cold while we ate the appetizers while (finally) starting the wine."
nandos-peri-peri-chicago-22,https://www.yelp.com/biz/nandos-peri-peri-chicago-22,4,"You order at the counter and they bring the food to you!.i chose medium spice level for the chicken and i had the macho peas (a pea mash with basil, thyme, and chili) and the red skin mashed potatoes (with garlic) for the sides.only instead of grabbing a number and picking our own seat, we were told where to sit by the hostess (not even escorted, just told).i&#39;m thinking they&#39;re still trying to work out the kinks because the seating was a bit confusing and we had to figure some things out on our own.maybe the peas because they&#39;re different, or let&#39;s be honest maybe the mashed potatoes because, well, they&#39;re mashed frickin&#39; potatoes and i&#39;m what some would call a &#39;carbo queen.i think it&#39;s a great idea you can order, pay, eat and then leave great!we ordered a small plate of two boneless chicken thighs with peri peri rice and the mush peas with mint was delicious! we had chicken thighs with a mango lime marinade it was delicious and juicy.on my last visit, my mom was in town visiting and the hostess was so accommodating--it was my mom&#39;s first visit, so she gave us free appetizer coupons.truly loved the experience and cant wait to come back with the hubby!oh and the best part we made it back to the parking lot after shopping at a few other stores @ roosevelt collection within 90 minutes which is free! yay!!.ambience is excellent with modern decor and outdoor seating.however, the amazing chicken makes the seating system a side note."
