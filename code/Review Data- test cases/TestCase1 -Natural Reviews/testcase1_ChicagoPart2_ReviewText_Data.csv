herb-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/herb-chicago,5,"We had a really weird dinner here.curried rice croquette salad for my starter; quite good, first time experiencing fermented pork.next were the appetizers.they&#39;re  going for the high end space but its really just good solid spot..why?  because it&#39;s amazing, and i&#39;m afraid if no one knows about it, no one will go, and then it will disappear with nothing to fill its void.but i had no idea where it was and it needs an awning or something.but the owner was so friendly and accommodating she said she&#39;ll create a special menu and open it up to others given it was thai new year.the chef/owner sent out a complimentary starter.love the atmosphere."

barcocina-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barcocina-chicago,4,"We had a variety of tacos, but the crowd favorite was the hawaiian pineapple pork.the food was pretty good, they were good sports by providing a lot of free chips for our many guacs/salsas/etc.i could&#39;ve ate 10 of these.anyway, for the price, you&#39;re essentially getting 2 drinks in 1 so nothing to complain about, i guess!as for food, we ordered the pozole for the table.we noticed this place awhile ago and finally were in the area for dinner.definitely going back to barcocina.be warned, these are not the &#34;traditional&#34; tacos you usually get in the states - no ground beef or carnitas to be had.the tacos were alright but nothing special.i had such a great experience at barcocina! we had a group of 12+ girls and they were so accommodating.the outdoor seating is probably the only reason i gave 3 stars instead of 2."
cohiba-cuban-cuisine-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cohiba-cuban-cuisine-chicago,4,"I can&#39;t believe we&#39;ve lived in the neighborhood for so many years and waited so long to try it!  the service was fast and friendly and the place was very well kept and clean.it seemed like a smaller place and it was a monday evening around dinnertime, but was not crowded at all.i ordered the classic ropa vieja and let&#39;s start with the side dishes, superbly seasoned yellow rice, black beans and sweet plantains.she got the three vegetarian empanadas and some yellow spanish rice.will have to try other dishes to give them a more accurate rating..i&#39;d certainly come back!..the place was totally quiet, but it was winter, after a particularly brutal week.the chicken was dry and the chorizo was too salty but the pulled steak -which the service recommended- was the bomb! the 3 of us didn&#39;t want to eat too heavy so split a plate with all the different."
rojo-gusano-chicago-7,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rojo-gusano-chicago-7,2,"It&#39;s too good to be wasted, people!  anyway, the guacamole was delicious, but so we&#39;re the chips thst accompanied it.:).i lovemezcal, so i&#39;m excited for when that comes in!.the tacos were brought out very quickly, very delicious!the cheese plate we got was melted cheese and chorizo and we were given some tortillas, soooo delicious but greasy (obviously)we also got fried plantains for dessert, also so good!i would definitely come back and try some other foods here, it looks like they have different options for lunch as well."
leghorn-chicken-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/leghorn-chicken-chicago,3,"Order process is super easy..nothing is worst the soft limo fries...hubby tried the nashville hot thigh on a biscuit.their chicken is truly that good.i got the nashville hot breast with a buttermilk biscuit with pickles,lettuce, cheddar cheese, a side of ranchero sauce.there are a ton of extra toppings but i wanted the pure experience of a chicken sandwich only pickles on top.as for the other toppings, it was a shame that organic lettuce and tomato were probably stored in a mediocre refrigerator situation because the lettuce was one step away from frozen and the tomato was heading towards mushy."
horse-thief-hollow-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/horse-thief-hollow-chicago,4,"All three of these were well above average and the santa was flat out phenomenal.service was good.we each had a 773 nitro stout, and it was delicious.i had spinach burger which was pretty damn flavorful for being primarily spinach, hubby and my fil had burgers and fil had bowl of green chilli that was crazy spicy, even for his giardnera-loving self.i&#39;ve been here twice now and i just love it! the burgers and the shrimp po&#39;boy are excellent.lights dim evenings.my companion enjoyed the green giant sandwich which lived up to its name.in the middle of beverly stands horse thief hollow - a brewery done up in charming, chic hipster-farmhouse decor..i did find the beer menu a bit confusing, as it&#39;s written on a board."

horizon-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/horizon-cafe-chicago,4,"This place should rename to football omelets!  you can guess why.this is a much beloved hangout among friends, and i finally started eating here now that i live a couple blocks away.this wasn&#39;t anything special and the pricing was typical / in the ball park for most meals.i had been here once before and remember leaving feeling disappointed.i visit once or twice a month as i live down the street...i gave one (1) more star for this review because there are many items on the menu that is awaiting for me to sample in the future, so i keep open-minded and will be back possibly for sunday brunch.they were fantastic! i prefer baked omelettes over pan fried ones, but this one seemed to be the latter."
earls-bbq-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/earls-bbq-chicago-2,4,"I&#39;m not a big bbq sauce person so i loved that they had multiple different types of sauce for you to choose from.so if you come and food starts to run out, that means it&#39;s good.a great addition to the neighborhood!.mac and cheese was delish!  we will definitely be back!.their website needs some updating.service was super friendly, maybe too much..it did not taste homemade; very disappointing..just a small chalkboard that says, &#34;we&#39;re currently sold out of."

sunset-pho-caffe-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sunset-pho-caffe-chicago-4,3,"Usually we get a lot more when we order at other vietnamese restaurants.the back half of the restaurant is a nice looking vietnamese restaurant.i mean all of vietnamese restaurants all compromise of the same things.the beef stew noodle was good along with the pho.the bill was cheap, the service was friendly, and everything we tasted was as good as anything we&#39;ve had on argyle.the food itself is phenomenal."

bread-and-wine-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bread-and-wine-chicago,4,"Had a wonderful experience here this evening for wine &amp; cheese.house made ketchup was a nice touch too.i think the tempura cauliflower was my favorite, and we didn&#39;t even order it! the chef gave it to us for free.if calories and cholesterol weren&#39;t a thing i would have ordered 3 more and called it a day..can&#39;t wait to go back!.the entree was overly salty and i like salt.while two of us, myself included, were atrociously underdressed, the staff made sure to get a table ready for us, on the patio.we shared a pancake with cherries.the most memorable menu items (menu is not very big but plenty of variety) were the raw scallops with juniper berries and oranges and the burger."
burnt-city-brewing-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/burnt-city-brewing-chicago,4,"Although we didn&#39;t bowl, there were some lanes open.if we had a couple sips left in our beers when he walked by, he wouldn&#39;t stop or even attempt to make eye contact to see if we wanted a refill.i was so sad!at least the tots were pretty good.the &#34;facemelter&#34; hibiscus ipa overpromises (my face didn&#39;t melt) but was the only good thing i found on the menu.he was on it with the water.we look forward to returning in the future and trying out the food.edit: forget what i said about the lack of fries, the pretzel appetizer they have makes up for it! it tastes more like a delicious breadstick than a pretzel, but that&#39;s what made it absolutely heavenly! i could eat this and the cheese dip for days!.i ended up trying two of the sliders and a cactus taco.open until 3am on saturdays! i have to go back for some of their grub, not just beer.simply awesome!."
idof-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/idof-chicago,4,"All around positive experience and i&#39;ll definitely be back!..it just wasn&#39;t great.it&#39;s like a qdoba or chipotle but with mediterranean food! the works were fast so our wait in line was minimal.the place looks nice and it&#39;s organized..enjoy the cyo plate.sauces were good, especially the tahini and red pepper hummus.."
el-nuevo-taco-loco-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-nuevo-taco-loco-chicago,1,"This clean, unassuming taco stand on the corner of a residential community has had an uphill battle to open.it&#39;s definitely going to be my new taco place."
weather-mark-tavern-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/weather-mark-tavern-chicago-3,3,"They came quick and were delicious! this a stone&#39;s throw away from our daughter&#39;s new home.good beer selection (did not try the food), efficient bartenders, and plenty of tvs.:)if this were closer to my office i would totally come here for after work happy hours but unfortunately i don&#39;t spend that much time around here.i&#39;ll definitely be going back.never bothered to check in on me after that.if this place had been open when i lived down the street on indiana i would have been a regular.there is plenty of seating so unless the cubs are in the world series or the bulls in the nba finals, you will still find a spot :)..easy enough to sit at a table and chill with a good conversation, but the loud techno music gave almost a pseudo-club feel.booths are separated with giant sailboat sails and the cocktail menu includes standards like dark and stormy and specialty drinks like dragon in the sea, weather mark mai tai, and man overboard."
beef-shack-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/beef-shack-chicago,4,"The brown bag way is so old school and that right there is how it should be.long story short he loved their beef, but wouldn&#39;t go so far as to say one was better then the other, but i know better.decadent flavors!.fries are fantastic.didn&#39;t have to fuss with ketchup packs- they had nice small containers good for eating in or for take out.solid entry into the neighborhood!.as a plus the place was clean and the staff was super friendly.i would absolutely return!!!!.enough that i turned around to the kitchen and exclaimed across the restaurant that everything was delicious."
ñ-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/%C3%B1-chicago-3,4,"I&#39;d love to know the thought process behind the name as you can&#39;t find it in your gps, it&#39;s impossible to find on google, and if i hadn&#39;t checked in when we got there i&#39;m not sure i would&#39;ve been able to find it on yelp to review it.like if  you went to the bathroom by the time you got back the game would be at halftime packed..desafortunadamente, i had to get my ass to work.they were all very good but man was it loud! (maybe, i am getting old lol)...finally got a chance to visit this place after a few failed attempts by the gf to bring me here.we started off with the beef empanadas.my hubby and i went in on a week night around 6pm so they just opened."
primebar-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/primebar-chicago-2,4,"Sriracha deviled eggs were awesome, just enough hot sauce to make for a memorable flavor, but not too much that your eyes start to tear.i had the sriracha egg appetizer which tasted delicious for the first bite and it felt kind of gross as you had more.next time i would probably stick to the basics on the food and order a burger or something..sat at the bar.great lunch spot if you work in the loop.we arrived to find ourselves the only ones in the place (so much for needing that reservation!).not one waiter, waitress, busy boy, etc came up to us.the portion size was more than enough for lunch.drinks were a bit harder to come by, but you just had to keep an eye out for that tray of wine coming around, otherwise it was a bit harder to get a bartender&#39;s attention."
zaki-mediterranean-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/zaki-mediterranean-grill-chicago,2,"It made the salad tasted blah.their lunch special was really good and filling for one person.the containers were flimsy, stacked terribly and leaking by the time i got them.the guy asked me if i wanted a burrito instead."
truenorth-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/truenorth-chicago-2,2,"My horoscope predicted &#34;a change in my daily routine&#34;, but i had no idea it would be this lovely!.m! they&#39;ve also got a variety of smoothies and pastries.the wasabi wrap was so good, not even over exaggerating! with even just the first bite, i was blown away! there were little wasabi peas in the wrap that added such a nice surprise and texture! the soy ginger vinaigrette was incredibly and once again the amount of chicken was generous."
wilde-bar-and-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wilde-bar-and-restaurant-chicago,4,"Great prices for the quantity and quality of food that you get.was served cold and not very satisfying.they have a large bookshelf filled to the top.my favorite is what looks like a mini library with a wall of bookshelf and tables right in front.the lettuce was fresh and the croutons and dressing were tasty.i was doing the whole30 detox so my choice for food was a little limited and i couldn&#39;t drink.we have had multiple recos..warm and gooey with delicious onions soaked in what seemed like french onion soup and then topped with a fantastic garlic crumb crust.since i can&#39;t not order mac &amp; cheese when it&#39;s available on the menu (and, hello, this version included lobster and truffle oil to top it off!), i can confirm that this version should not be at the top of anyone&#39;s &#34;best mac &amp; cheese&#34; list."
mamas-boy-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mamas-boy-chicago,2,"So we asked for some with our salad starter.my boyfriend is a mamas boy so i knew this was the perfect place to bring him on a date night.the service is beyond on point, i&#39;m going to bring some of my goodies in for them as a thanks!briefly, i will sum up my first experience:our server kosta is very welcoming and friendly, and makes great conversation.the salad was just right."
rivers-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rivers-chicago,3,"We both had the crab cake sandwich..went here for lunch and sat by water.go there people.i didn&#39;t get a rude server like many people have indicated, but with that clientele it wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all.pros:beautiful restaurantwide variety of options for foodlarge drink menufriendly service (major plus)great date placegreat location to take (7-10) kids to teach them how to order and behave in a restaurant with table cloths! :) i&#39;m not joking it was just nice enough to be a good place for that.went with the groupon for two beer flights and two appetizers.i had the shrimp curry which sounds thai, but tastes very italian (with minimal curry taste.for some reason though, this place is always crowded.the garnish of cilanrto with the basque pepper gave the fish a nice kick, and the spinach and wine sauce was good."
lou-mitchells-restaurant-and-bakery-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lou-mitchells-restaurant-and-bakery-chicago-2,4,"Huge portions served with brilliance and great flavor.pretty cool treat!!  it was so good, i grabbed a few more.great diner for breakfast.you can order 2 eggs and they must be the size of ostrich eggs because you get a helluva healthy portion.most important meal of the day and they do it justice.fairly bland space but a nice, covered patio for enjoying breakfast in the summer air.the food was typical diner fair, but everything was executed well and the staff were super polite.i don&#39;t care if there is communal seating (though there are also booths).waaaayyyyy in the future."
frasca-pizzeria-and-wine-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/frasca-pizzeria-and-wine-bar-chicago,4,"As an added benefit frasca is located a very short distance from the paulina brown line stop.increase the cheese factor and i&#39;ll be back!....on my most recent visit, we tried the special risotto that had asparagus, prosciutto and a fried egg..we had pino grigio.food all around was outstanding! we ended our meal with the skillet cookie, because have you ever had a bad skillet cookie?? it was super soft and delicious.brunch, lunch, dinner or drinks - frasca is a lakeview hot spot."
yard-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yard-house-chicago,3,"Applebeesish, and i hate that place.our bills got messed up.it kind of looks like a weird disney world city with several chain restaurants, over priced apartments, and the mariano&#39;s, so this chain restaurant/ bar fits right in.first thing that caught my attention on my second visit to this place was their main door handles shaped like a yard glass.the peach cobbler with cinnamon ice cream and the chocolate brownie smores.my stack wasn&#39;t spicy at all and my biggest complaint was that the tuna was cooked all the way through.all the food was quite good and our server kept the beers coming.i love this place more than my dog.the servings were more than enough for two.everything came out hot and tasted pretty good."
first-slice-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/first-slice-chicago-4,4,"50 a slice, and a great location.fruit pie.then had a slice of the key-lime pie and was tasty as heck too.and yes, those are some of my responsibilities as a retail professional.the bacon quiche fills my heart with joy with each bite of fluffy egg/bacon goodness.what could be better than eating well and doing good?you can&#39;t stop at one slice at first slice.great selection of teas and coffee as well.a stellar weekend brunch spot for 1-2 people - staff was a bit slammed on a monday but the food came out great."
windy-city-bbq-classic-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/windy-city-bbq-classic-chicago-2,1,"Oh yeah!.the price range was $59, $79 and $99 dollars and it was well worth it."

taus-authentic-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/taus-authentic-chicago,4,"I just have to say for the prices, the portions are small.definitely different than the old prasino, but still carrying through some similar themes..a side of salad would complete an otherwise perfect board of ingredients.on the side there were a couple of chunks of pork belly, some grilled cauliflower and the scallops were topped with golden raisins and ginger.it&#39;s a delicious duck flatbread so the obvious answer to this soggy pizza problem is to switch the ricotta for delicious goat cheese.i had read the mixed reviews on yelp but was still super optimistic.for entrees our waiter recommended the steak &amp; eggs, tamale and croque madam..but we walk by here a lot and never really have the urge or want to go back in."

community-tavern-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/community-tavern-chicago-3,4,"The tuna tartar was chilled perfectly and the chips were amazing i could not stop eating them.i was planning on giving the brie to my date to eat (i try to shy away from daily as my body doesn&#39;t like it).we will definitely be back.the entrées were pretty good.the big waste, and it always is a peeve of mine, was the bone marrow..i thought the food was delicious! we had a party of 4, but none of us were particularly hungry so we ordered 3 entrees to share..parking aplenty in this great, untapped area."
drews-on-halsted-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/drews-on-halsted-chicago,4,"Both the two crab cakes and small salad served with it were paired well together.portion sizes were pretty good.i had ordered one of the dinner package menu and my friends had ordered two grilled beef tenderloin (which i&#39;ve had before - delicious).very reasonably priced, solid service in a nice ambiance, however brunch was by no means memorable...yum!.overall, the food and experience were excellent this time.the food and service is excellent."

blackwood-bbq-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blackwood-bbq-chicago-5,4,"They have an interesting way to have your meat in the form of a sandwich or salad! my cousin tried the beef brisket salad.the brisket was tender and had a nice flavor, even without the sauce.i ordered the pulled chicken salad, which you can get unlimited toppings on with their mac n&#39; cheese.maybe thats good since they taste funny but if ya like em not so much.5/10.the alabama sauce was good but certainly was not bbq- it was like a yellow tomato color but seemed like it was mayo based.the breading on top is the perfect salty crunch and the noodles are super creamy.choice of pulled pork, chicken or beef brisket entrees or sandwiches with your choice of sauce.for my side, i had the baked beans which were also very good.we walked in, line wasn&#39;t too long."
sink-swim-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sink-swim-chicago,4,"Their food and drinks were both equally delicious..the meal ended up being pretty pricey, hence the four stars.a very young seafood restaurant-bar.i can appreciate the decor and design of the space.we were seated right away by a friendly hostess.in addition to the oysters, we ordered the gin cured salmon, shrimp toast, halibut cheeks, and the octopus pasta.just perfect.i know sometimes the first time is really off, so i guess stay tuned for the final verdict!.sometimes this conflicts with our desire to try popular eateries."
fish-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fish-bar-chicago,4,"They were all full of life and made the experience a great one.the fish is then topped with cheese and their special tartar sauce packed with a punch..drink prices were on the expensive side but typical for downtown chicago.for sides, if you like spice, go for the spicy slaw.especially on a beautiful night out on the patio (that&#39;s how i felt).however, the manager came out to speak to us.can&#39;t even list my favorite thing because they blend.my boyfriend really enjoyed his redfish sliders but thought the clam chowder was way too salty.i liked this place, but it doesn&#39;t hold a candle to burger bar."
habanero-baja-grill-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/habanero-baja-grill-chicago-5,4,"Chef amado and i worked together for years at xoco and i must say i was sad when he moved on:  it makes me happy that he has made a new home to fill with his generous spirit, high standards, and the authentic aromas and flavors of mexican street food.first, nothing tasted fresh.for a place in the loop though it&#39;s pretty decent.the place is small and there are only a few seats so get there early or take your order to go.they have a lot of ingredients to choose from and by far the most awesome part is that it comes with avocados and avocado dressing (i asked for it on the side, of course).atmosphere: 7/10service: 7/10food: 8/10.come in for quick food, not authentic food.the only thing is that i would be super thirsty the rest of the afternoon.oh, and cashier was pretty rude.enjoyed the shrimp, which is not offered at a lot of assembly line places."
city-pool-hall-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-pool-hall-chicago,2,"But it has been years since i&#39;ve picked up a cue- but just the smell of chalk sent me back to another place and time.granted i didn&#39;t shoot pool or eat anything.tucked away in river west where there is no pretentious crowd you can enjoy getting to know your date and practicing some hand and eye coordination.they offer healthy alternatives like a house salad with all the trimmings instead of fries.we will definitely be back here.the beers are cheap, the food was good, and the pool tables were decent."

pizanos-pizza-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizanos-pizza-chicago-2,3,"I am in no way a pizza snob and i have been known to think that pizza others dont  like is ok..it was just a simple sausage but the cheese (a higher fat content i&#39;m told) and the sauce made the simple pizza so delicious.tl;dr - a great deep dish experience in a neat location!a great deep dish pizza chain (a smaller chain with 6 restaurants) from the malnati family!we arrived at the madison &amp; state location on a cold and snowy night, and we&#39;re quickly made comfortable by the warm greeter and ambiance.for pizza, we decided to go with a simple small sausage deep dish.the pizza itself is a miniature whole pizza pie with crust all around (about 6&#34; diameter) which is awesome if you love a bit of crust in each bite.the crust was buttery, the sauce tasted fresh and extra tomato-y.we went with a classic - the thin-crust pepperoni.how hard is it to make pizza? isn&#39;t this a pizza place? they really could have had someone make it but i guess that would be too much to ask.the restaurant is pretty much across to millennium park on madison."
via-lima-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/via-lima-chicago,4,"Ceviche trio was underwhelming and at $26..the fries and side salad complemented it well too.delicious peruvian food at this new, pretty restaurant in north center.it was ok.the starters were the best part.our waiter was extremely knowledgable about the menu and funny..our server was nonetheless of great help and had a very friendly and jovial demeanor.that means i&#39;ll be going back with his family in tow, and some other friends."

calumet-fisheries-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/calumet-fisheries-chicago-4,4,"I would try the smoked salmon next time around.it would be a 5 star review if it was food alone but the score got knocked down bc of the location (so far south), their cash only policy, and no place to eat (everyone in line at the same time also ate in their car).if you&#39;re ever in chicago and want to venture out from the city, this place is definitely worth the trip!! it&#39;s location is kind of random but not too hard to find.i definitely want to come back and try other things on their menu like the smoked shrimp.4 starts for a lot of not-homemade items like the coleslaw, potato salad, and sauces.other than that you might want to bring your favorite hot sauce as well.the fried clam strips and smoked shrimp were awesome.nothing special, but delicious nonetheless.also this place has had the same owner and remained in the same location since 1948.the best thing was the cheese bites and that is very sad."

glenns-diner-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/glenns-diner-chicago,4,"The only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because the last two times i was there for brunch, service was ridiculously slow.given the breakfast was good, i imagine the morning crowd fills the restaurant.my friends &amp; family always enjoy all you can eat alaskan king crab leg tuesday&#39;s.happy holidays to everyone who is reading this review!.all you can eat crab legs? i mean game over.i had the shrimp and grits.i came with a large group of friends for a birthday.the wait for a table would&#39;ve been 30 minutes, but bf and i were really hungry so we sat at the bar.very delicious, high protein meal.how can i cram as many tables and chairs in this restaurant without violating the safety code? hmm."
lawrences-fish-and-shrimp-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lawrences-fish-and-shrimp-chicago,3,"We&#39;ll be back, i&#39;m sure..was in the area recently and had wanted to try this place to see what they had to offer and had wanted to check a different place out for seafood.crab cakes were decent, fries needed more seasoning, and hot sauce seemed watered down.for nearly 31 years i&#39;ve been a customer of this place and even when i was a kid my mom would bring me and my sister here for their half order of fish chips.gumbo tasted like tomato soup and was a little salty.we were boating on the river so the dock was very convenient.i love the little wax-lined bags the oysters are placed in so it&#39;s not messy- also there was very minimal grease anyways which is a huge plus!.if you order the dinners, it will take a shorter time.they also changed their oysters."
city-cafe-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-cafe-chicago-2,2,"Absolutely loved the pancakes they served here.it&#39;s a very homie down to earth atmosphere! small and a bit crowded but that&#39;s fine..service was fast and friendly, and the food was pretty good too! the beans were delightful - a little spicy, a little cheesy, and possibly the best i&#39;ve ever had.a fantastic diner with great service and value."
döner-men-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/d%C3%B6ner-men-chicago-4,4,"Will definitely try to track down their food truck to get the currywurst again!.i got the döner box just because it seemed like it was a good combination of everything they had to offer.the truck itself will certainly catch your eye and the menu (large w/ big pictures and helpful descriptions) helps draw you in.i can&#39;t wait to try something else..both the entrees we tried were great..i enjoyed this very much, as all flavors and ingredients worked well together.i was at the christkindlmarket and stumbled upon donerman&#39;s stall."
ajida-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ajida-chicago,3,"I really can&#39;t understand how this place got a 3.but there is flavor,  just light..i can tell you it had udon noodles and chicken swimming in a pork and chili broth.your cost?fourteen dollars total..the shoyu ramen is definitely my favorite! i&#39;m excited to head back and try all the other entrees out!.shoyu ramen was edible, but the service wasn&#39;t acceptable for a downtown lunch location.came in for lunch with a coworker, we were both jonesin ramen.our server ross was charming and amusing."

slims-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/slims-chicago,4,"Very happy i found this place!! the italian beef was so good! the service was so fast and the staff was very inviting and friendly.wow, all this time i thought slim&#39;s was little more than a neighborhood hot dog stand.order them with the pretzel roll.the chicken looked fresh and had a nice breading.we came in around 20:30 hour, and the workers were busy prepping a ton of pick-up and delivery orders.it&#39;s a nice place to pick up a quick bite to eat for a very reasonable price..yes squidgy is a word."
tip-top-inn-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tip-top-inn-chicago,1,"This is the 2nd time i have been in the last few weeks.should probably be listed in the menu as what we usually call lox.i was looking for a place to watch the nba playoffs and i happened to pass by tip top inn! the decor was very nice so i decided to stop in.drinks were good, server was excellent and the food good! had he calamari a d burger for a pre concert meal."

broken-english-taco-pub-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/broken-english-taco-pub-chicago,4,"The food on the other hand, not so well.it was not at all busy and yet service was very slow..prices below are per normal:$8 (al pastor and carnitas tacos)$8 (traditional guacamole with chips)$10 (margarita, $40 for a pitcher about six drinks worth)$6 (pacifico beer)who knew you could find the most authentic yet still unique mexican taco join in the loop? this is mexican fusion done right.we got the 6 taco special for $20, which lets you mix and match any flavors you want.but need you serve it without draining any of its juices?broken english taco pub is a nice addition to an otherwise socially-dead loop after dark, but would i rush to go back? probably not anytime soon.i came here with a friend, and although we enjoyed our food, the prices felt very expensive for what we actually received..don&#39;t go here.we arrived just before the lunch rush and were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes."

reno-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/reno-chicago,4,"Right off the logan square blue line.the staff was friendly and competent, no complaints there.street parking is basically impossible, but there&#39;s a parking lot northwest of reno near the subway station.i liked it.we waited.i had the sparkling wine which really fizzled, almost like a science experiment and he had the whiskey sour with egg white.of my three visits, the lunch stop made the biggest impression on me.as an aside, they had a curry bagel i would like to go back to try."

vora-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vora-chicago,4,"It was also very greasy and just altogether not worth it..the bao was great but the rest of the items like shumai, taro cake, and others were just a bit plain and boring.definitely coming back for the shabu shabu (hot pot).service was meh.i ordered the shrimp wonton soup and the sesame chicken for pick up.it was fabulous..also the bulbs in the bar area&#39;s wall look like eyeballs from far away.stephen our server was very polite."

cafe-el-tapatio-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-el-tapatio-chicago-4,4,"Oh, and be careful, their salsa is very spicy!.much like a egg role is a barometer of a good chinese place i think chips are a good indicator of how good a mexican place is.the food never ceases to satisfy us! we came in for their brunch, i had the eggs over easy with chopped steak tacos which were perfect and served with potatoes! the chips and salsa is awesome! the salsa has a garlicky taste which is my favorite.stay thirsty and hungry my friends.full disclosure--i had brunch at takito kitchen earlier in the day yesterday.this beats garcia&#39;s in lincoln square imo, and is about equal to campeche for my personal fav mexican within chicago.serious yum.steak fajitas are my favorite but the carne asada is pretty bomb as well.but their food- i love.as for entrees, i have had the tacos del mar and the tacos de mar de cortez and have never been disappointed."
