The fried pickles were good but they were spears and I would have liked pickle chips more.I can get the same quality out of a can of tin fish from the grocery store.if you're ever in chicago and want to venture out from the city, this place is definitely worth the trip!! It's location is kind of random but not too hard to find.The smoked salmon was good.The smoked shrimp was partially rotten.The ambiance:calumet fisheries is a small seafood shack with an outdoor smoke house."dosirak-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dosirak-chicago,2,cs441.ksharma@gmail.com,"Sad to say, it didn't live up to the korean food i am used to on the north side of town.It's the best you will find on Taylor Street (since it's the only place on Taylor street) but it has lots of room for improvement.I ordered the dolsol bibimbap.the food was a bit bland and I hated the cafeteria trays.But the flavor was definitely lacking for this dish.I went here for lunch with my co-workers, and i'll be back again! There aren't many tables, but we found one and were immediately seated.I really hope this place does well, but I personally think there needs to be some improvement with the quality of food.Flavors were very lacking."old-town-social-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/old-town-social-chicago,4,cs441.ksharma@gmail.com,"For sunday brunch this morning, with the place half full it still took 30 minutes to get 2 burgers and sides, and even then one burger didn't come with all its toppings..burned pieces.

they're the kind of people you could, like, actually be friends with.The ribs were some of the best i've had, and the lamb was to die for.County bbq has a wide selection of starters and sides that can be shared amongst the group."rivers-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rivers-chicago,3,cs441.ksharma@gmail.com,"This is a good lunch spot to go during work, it definitely has a business feel to it..this is a classier dining, with an equally professional service staff.Service was also attentive, and waiters seem to immediately appear once you've cleaned off your plate.If it's nice out, you can usually find an indoors seat, but that's a waste of nice weather.I've had better, i've had worse, but it is on the waterfront and its covered patio means it will get work from the wacker/loop business crowd looking for reasonably-priced burgers and salads.The bar food is a little cheaper than the dinner menu, so i stuck with a plate of slides.It was rather hot outside - a fan supply would have been nice.Overall pretty good place which is very conveniently located in the loop near both union station and ogilvy station."kumas-too-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kumas-too-chicago,4,,"I don&#39;t feel like it is half as fun and inspired as the original, but like i said, great if you want a phenomenal burger with out all the heavy metal bells and whistles.the fries were mediocre, limp, and just plain ordinary.it had to have beenbomb.my order was simple: buffalo chicken tenders &amp; french fries.i would definitely recommend anyone to come out if they&#39;re looking for a good local burger.i had the kuma burger with egg &amp; bacon and it was sooo flavorless and bland compared to the correct way to make it au cheval.we ordered various burgers, all cooked medium.at the least.badass burgers.couldn&#39;t get enough of it and you can be sure i will be back at kuma&#39;s too before the month ends to get this one again."truenorth-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/truenorth-chicago-2,2,,"The wasabi wrap was so good, not even over exaggerating!

the server is very professional and took it back to the kitchen to have it added.the dishes were either spectacular and worth every penny, or overpriced and mediocre.unfortunately, the pad thai was underwhelming.the atmosphere in the restaurant was nice, casual, and romantic, and it was very busy.i liked the food, but the price point is a little hard to justify."pizzaiolo-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzaiolo-chicago,0,,This is a go to place of mine for dinner with a friend.sunset-pho-caffe-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sunset-pho-caffe-chicago-4,3,,"Upon being seated and being presented with a wine menu, we knew this was going to be a unique experience.there&#39;s also a pretty elaborate dj booth, which tells me that this place might have karaoke nights!the food is great.sunset pho is a fascinating place- it feels like an 80&#39;s sports bar that has been transformed into a vietnamese restaurant with a smattering of eastern european fare remaining on the menu.we also ordered the crispy noodles with seafood which turned out to be really good as well.speaking of try, the pho and banh mi are exceptional !

they have a wide selection of eggs, pancakes, skillets, french toast etc.the food was fine, maybe not quite as well prepared as our first visit.prices were very reasonable.extensive breakfast menu.you can even see bits of the charred bacon on the cheese where it lay originally.i should have ordered a regular omelet just to be on the safe side, but i was feeling a little adventurous that day.the wife&#39;s crabby benny ($12.the portions here are huge, and we barely made it halfway through our dishes.the next time i visit i will be sure to try an omelette.that being said, this is probably my favorite spot i have ever been to."blackwood-bbq-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blackwood-bbq-chicago-5,4,,"I would describe blackwood as an upscale chipotle.i&#39;ll definitely be back again soon!.lots of sauces to choose from.the brisket is incredible in the salad.sides were tasty as well, with cornbread the standout/service was quick and particularly friendly.the brisket was delish and we tried all 6 sauces with it.i ordered a 2 meat special which was brisket and pulled pork along with sides and beer.if you&#39;re close by and need a quick bite its by no means bad i just wasn&#39;t knocked out of the park by it.99.blackwood is amazing - lots of bang for your buck."smack-dab-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/smack-dab-chicago-3,1,,"I made a special trip to smack dab, because all the rogers park people i know keep raving about this place.smack dab between the pub [i had to use it], the supper club, and the glenwood sunday market, sits this sassy coffee and pastry counter, serving cheap but tasty fruit filled/laced/inspired goodies."persona-wood-fired-pizzeria-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/persona-wood-fired-pizzeria-chicago,2,,"When they were making my pizza, i asked for additional sauce because it looked very skimpy, but the young lady told me it would make the crust soggy so i decided against it.that, or they totally got me by cutting into 8 slices instead of 6.i wish it was smaller and cheaper.tried the prosciutto pizza and it was very good."pork-and-mindys-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pork-and-mindys-chicago,3,,"First off, the presentation is absolutely beautiful which makes me a happy lady.the tzatziki, banana peppers, and other ingredients that topped the lamb pita were tasty.overall, average food with fun decor.everything was fresh and full of flavor.the bacon was nice and crispy.we arrived early on a weekend Â (1130am) thinking the place was going to be popular and super busy.the staff was really friendly and answered questions we had.i had the pleasure in meeting jeff mauro, truly a class act and we spoke for a few mintues.the interior has very super bright lighting.i&#39;ll certainly be back with a creative menu like the one at this restaurant."the-dock-at-montrose-beach-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-dock-at-montrose-beach-chicago-2,4,,"This spot is great at night when they have live cover bands.as a pole myself, i have to say, do try the pierogi appetizer - they&#39;re amazing!

Â we ordered the special which came with sausage, peppers, onions, and mushrooms.very slow service, wanted to like this neighbourhood spot but nothing impressive.the salad was seriously so good with the zesty italian dressing which paired super well with the pizza.also, if you&#39;re going be prepared to wait for 45 mins for your pizza.i&#39;ve been here a few times and they didn&#39;t knock my socks off, but didn&#39;t disappoint.we always pre-order our food, so we do not have to wait 45-minutes to one-hour for our pizza.huge coffee mugs and tasty sweets such as tiramisu.if you&#39;re in chicago and you&#39;re looking for traditional chicago style pizza.appreciate the waitstaff&#39;s willingness to allow us to plug in phone chargers; power is at a premium during these conferences!."
