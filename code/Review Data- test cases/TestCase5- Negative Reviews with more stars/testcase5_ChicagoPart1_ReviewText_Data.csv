the baklava was great - it was less sweet and more cinnamon-y than most and very moist.They also take a maximum of two credit cards for a table.We were expecting chicken with strong lemon flavor, and what we got was a big drink of vinegar.."bombacignos-j-and-c-inn-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bombacignos-j-and-c-inn-chicago-2,4,"The best beef in chicago hands down!!!

great value too.Was suppose to get the dorayaki ice cream for desert from our combo, but they said they ran out and didn't bother to give us options to choose something else and just gave us the cheap smores which was a little irritating.Example, the promotion at the time i visited was that you could receive an order of edamame when you showed that you follow them on instagram.."tre-soldi-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tre-soldi-chicago,3,"Food is great! waiter esteban has a great personality.The salads where delicious! Â drinks were incredibly strong!!!.For my entree i had lasagna which was good, but not memorable.I've had my fair amount of pizzerias here in chicago and this one was definitely up there.Love the service and the atmosphere!.."greenriver-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/greenriver-chicago,3,"I wish i could sit outside and experience the awesome view of the city.It is perfect for date night, business dinners (we took my boss one night), and catching up with friends.You cannot go wrong with these choices.This was the real star for me as it also came with green beans which i happily ate (i hate green beans).It's located in the outpatient building so the lobby was pretty quiet when i walked in at 6pm and i was worried the place would be dead.If you know what i mean.I'm not even an oyster fan, but these were so fresh and delicious that i couldn't help but eat them..."potsticker-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/potsticker-house-chicago,3,"Lol.I can't help but compare this place with homestyle taste by the fact that they're a block from each other and they're both not cantonese.We have waited 2 hours for just one dish.Delicious.Very authentic northern chinese food.The dumplings weren't spectacular, but the skins were clearly handmade and pleasantly chewy, a simple dish done right.The sesame chicken however was very vinegary both in aroma and taste.The quality of service at this place has really dropped as it has become too popular for its own good.Once, we accidentally ordered the pork belly with cellophane bean noodles, which comes with chunks of succulent fatty meat - it was very flavorful and we polished off the pot.You will love it here.."ramen-misoya-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ramen-misoya-chicago,3,"The bowls are big and satisfying.Perhaps i am not a good ramen person!? Â  i still think that the ramen that i had in japan are a bit lighter and more palatable.Really really spot on.I also ordered some gemaicha tea and it complemented the food great!the place is a bit small and the way they have distributed the tables it would make it difficult for groups of more than 4-5 to sit together, but i bet they would be very accommodating.The reason for my poor rating: i had the octopus balls and they were to 'smokey' for my taste.Delicious ramen.The service is really great.Service was nice.The noodles were okay but everything else was a disappointment.Service is fine, place can get pretty packed still.."guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-chicago,3,"My kids inhaled it last time we were in.Maybe they are so focused on infusing flavor into the chicken that everything else gets shafted?though the sides were forgettable, i'm definitely coming back for more bird! Â also, the space is pretty well ventilated so i did not return to work smelling like grease.Pros:- all of the food came out piping hot!- the dark chicken (leg and thigh) was very juicy- chicken skin was super crispy and had kick in the seasoningcons:- mac n cheese was bland and uneventful- fried okra was also bland, it would have been great if they put some kick in the breading but tasted like frozen ones from the supermarket :(- cole slaw and beans were good.This place does get pretty crowded so you might want to give yourself ample time to eat here during rush hour.."joy-district-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joy-district-chicago,5,"Ask to see our host and she'll remember which she did but the door douce still didn't care.My eyes were happily pleased to see the artwork that surrounded the walls and my excitement grew as we made our way up the elevator to the rooftop.That rooftop space is quite the commodity in summertime in chicago -- i hung out here w/a couple of my friends during a weekend afternoon and it was a fun time.I highly recommend this place!.I just came back here this past weekend for drinks and we went up to the gorgeous rooftop which is now open.This has been our go to place this year for everyone's birthday! carmina, jenna, katherine and john are amazing hosts! they always made sure me and my group of friends had everything we needed and constantly checked up on us.We danced, drank, and had a great time.First time i came here was with a friend for dinner and it didn't disappoint! it was a friday night and i wasn't aware that they had a club on the top floor (you could say we didn't leave it at just dinner!) as soon as we walked in the service was great, everyone was kind and helpful.I don't normally write reviews but charging a guy $40 to get into an empty bar is ludicrous.."kimski-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kimski-chicago,5,"Drinks are top notch and perfectly crafted.The matcha donut didn't taste like matcha and was too dry and dense for my tastes.Amazing! Â we ordered one of each thing on the menu.Seating inside is limited, there is a adjoining bar with plenty of seating along with tables & chairs outside.Being that this place is brand new i asked for a recommendation and was steered towards the scallion pancakes w/pork shoulder and i was not disappointed.Came here with a few friends and i got the maria's standard.Don t recommend:/.I tried a few dishes from the menu, but it wasn't anything special.Prices are on the higher side (compared to their sans-fusion version e.We ordered the 'special' that wasn't special at all.."kentones-drive-in-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kentones-drive-in-chicago-2,4,"I live down the street from this place and go there every morning for my cup of joe and omelet! Â it is one of the few dinners that has a small town feeling in such a large city like chicago.Love this place!.Could've been a bit more generous with the cheese on the cheese fries.Definitely a place for the working class to pop into and grab a bite.Terrible for environment.Stopped in while working in the area, had the shrimp dinner & i must say it was excellent.Perfect frioles.Lots of menu options and an array of beverages to choose from.."torta-haÃ_s-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/torta-ha%C3%BCs-chicago-2,5,"There's not a lot of seating here and you order at the counter - think of it like your local sandwich shop - but we were immediately served chips and salsa once we were seated.Just finished splitting the carnitas and cuban tortas, both of which are excellent, and can't wait to go back.Fair for the price in this type of establishment especially when you consider free chips and salsa with free refills.The tortas were excellent.The service is out of this world and they make you feel so welcome and cared for.Every time i am in there, there seems to be regulars in there which makes me happy because with all of the turnover in restaurants in the neighborhood, it gives me hope that tortahaus will stick around.For the torta, i paid nearly $12.Awesomely amazing! the tortas here are on point without a doubt.Even in a city rich with inventive hybrid cuisines, a german torta heated up in a repurposed pizza oven stands out as something special.."
