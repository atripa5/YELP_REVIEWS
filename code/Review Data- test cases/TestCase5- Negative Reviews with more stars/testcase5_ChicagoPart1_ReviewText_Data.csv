allende-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/allende-restaurant-chicago,3,"Their taco prices are much cheaper than other restaurants but certainly adds up because you have to pay for each item.95 they are priced amazing.their kitchen is all up front, and you can see the ladies behind the counter hustling all hours that god sent their way; there&#39;s something to be said about that as it lets you know they keep a clean shop.rabbit: you&#39;re not mexican?get the tacos.i&#39;ve tried most of the meats and while the asada can be a bit greasy, it&#39;s pretty standard in terms of chopped mexican steak.i felt like i was in the or of a hospital.it literally tastes like nothing.also the place is spotless!!!all of the burritos are awesome! my favorite was the bbq pork.the lengua tacos on the other hand were delicious.love how authentic it is."

brightwok-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brightwok-kitchen-chicago,3,"Great environment, but sadly i can&#39;t say the same about the food.i ordered the creamy cashew with chicken, carrots, kale, and bok coy.it was surprisingly really tasty &amp; the portion was pretty big! i don&#39;t feel guilty eating this at all and will probably come back again before i leave chicago :).during the lunch rush the line can get long, stretching easily to the door before wrapping back on itself, but no one seems to mind.but the vegetables themselves were uniformly chopped well and tender-crisp.not greasy, quickly made, and with a great flavor.the food is very flavorful.this is a classic wok restaurant, but it has brightened things up for sure.the concept is something we will be seeing a lot of: given some sauce, protein, and veggie options you can create a different stir fry every time."

ruxbin-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ruxbin-chicago,4,")the venison was good; ours unfortunately ended up closer to medium than medium rare, but the preparation with the ramen risotto was comforting.well, a shared dinner is essentially a dinner format where you can choose a bunch of different menu items, and share it! no more ordering two different things on the menu to just take one bite out of it.definitely stop by, but keep the expectations in check.my husband and i went here to celebrate our anniversary and we are so glad that we did.i also had the octopus and salmon for appetizer and found it to be equally blasé.it was off the main floor so it felt like you were eating in your own private room at home.had that squid been really good, this would have been a wonderful dish.this is vegetarian, and if you had quizzed any one of the 4 carnivores at our table - none of us would have known any different.the octopus is phenominal as are the desserts and jackfruit pulled pork.upon entering, i realized that it is a very small space with limited seating, so no large parties allowed."

mortar-and-pestle-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mortar-and-pestle-chicago,3,"Ate brunch here on sunday.everyone is super nice and attentive.this place is delicious.will be back again!.most breakfast items are on the rich and/or creative side (foie gras french toast!) but there are so many spots even within a few steps of this place where you can get a more conventional breakfast (stella&#39;s and the bagel, to start) that it makes sense for this new place to stake out a more creative territory.i know it&#39;s reletively new and they are just starting out.the vanilla pancakes were fluffy and i loooooved the thyme butter flavor with the orange zest.the service is awesome, and admittedly, the biscuit really is worth getting.i&#39;ve come two times so far.i was impressed with their regular breakfast items- best scrambled eggs i have ever had!."

the-burger-point-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-burger-point-chicago,4,"The fries are disgusting.prices were a bit high but the burgers were well worth it.they fry them extra crispy like i like all my wings and they always withstand the car ride home when i get them to go.there was an incident that occurred here the other day.got the savage burger but swapped mayo for siracha aoli and it was a good decision.now i just need them to deliver to my neighborhood and i will be most happy!.although our wait time was lengthy and our ordering process was slightly frustrating, things started to take a turn for the better when the new owner made an appearance at our table and apologized for the wait.average is 20 mins for a burger.i&#39;ve been meaning to write a review on burger point, on 19th state, but hadn&#39;t gotten around to it.but so slow it will make me not come again."
pizzeria-del-mercato-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-del-mercato-chicago,3,"The owners were also very friendly so i definitely recommend checking this spot out!.as it stands, the food at this place is inexpensive, and it wouldn&#39;t hurt them to be a tad more costly.this place is amazing.when we walked in there on a friday night there was surprisingly a lot of families with kids present.first off, it&#39;s snugly within the west loop neighborhood a few blocks west of all the trendy restaurants in the meat packing district.it was perfect for 45 people and 10 kids.we got there at 11:15 a.we made reservations for saturday night but upon arriving, realized it&#39;s a super casual spot.i&#39;ve been looking for a place like this since moving here and this is it.great salads and soups, too."
the-bongo-room-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bongo-room-chicago,5,"We went the sunday after christmas and only waited about 15 minutes to be seated.the wait for a party of 4 will average about 45 min to an hour on sat.fantastic breakfast with amazing service.packed with people and super busy, our waiter seemed anxious to get our order in, but there were so many options it took us forever to decide."
perennial-virant-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/perennial-virant-chicago-3,4,"Our group of 5 came here for dinner monday night and to entertain our out of town friend.love this place.i had the smoked salmon tartrine which was a piece of everything toast with cream cheese smear topped with  greens and salmon in a light vinaigrette.great drinks, good food, lovely service during an early dinner.and as always the food is wonderful.however, when we got there, the waiter seemed surprised but then said the chef would just make me a vegetable plate.friend politely mentioned it to the waitstaff and they said they would take care of it and then offered no compensation or replacement beyond offering us champagne, which we declined due to it being a sunday night.it was cooked perfectly, but it just wasn&#39;t as exciting as the menu made it sound.appetizers a bit skimpy for 6, wish our waiter advised us.the salmon was done perfectly, the glaze a perfect additional taste added to the fish."
atotonilco-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/atotonilco-restaurant-chicago,3,"I thought once i moved to the south, i would have amazing mexican food just steps away from my front door and ultimately become the big girl i&#39;m destined to be.this isn&#39;t a 5 star restaurant so don&#39;t get bitchy.my favorite place in the world! but as others have mentioned, it has gotten overpriced.the torta bread was light and tasty -- not like the heavy chewy stuff at some places.that really disappointed me.hands down the best al pastor tacos in all of the land!!!!have eaten at three different locations and all have been spot on.horchata is good..the food is great! i love the gorditas here."
coopers-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/coopers-chicago,3,"The pizza tastes like a plain old cheese pizza.the place was quite busy, but i don&#39;t recall any horrible service that time.great beer selection!music wasn&#39;t blaring loud.pricey but really tastes like banana bread! so good!.the place was dead and it took forever for the waitress to come by and take our order.nice outdoor patio on the east side of the building.we each took half of the pizza home.had i to do over, i would have gone across the street to the fish place.we stopped here recently when we had tickets at theater wit."

thai-spoon-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-spoon-chicago-4,5,"The service was great.the egg rolls were terrible, filled with some sort of disgusting slop.place is clean, service was quick and pleasant.thai food is not authentic.the food is very good despite the central location near michigan ave.we will definitely be back again when visiting chicago."
cafe-bionda-chicago-6,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-bionda-chicago-6,3,"Went here twice while in chicago and loved it.limited al fresco dining.the atmosphere was chill and welcoming, good wine list.i told the waiter at the end of the meal and he said we should have told him earlier.great food is a must for me when dining out but service &amp; atmosphere make the experience that much better..the hostess seemed a bit flustered and informed us it would take 20 minutes.with a special work project in the south loop this past weekend, i thought it was an opportunity to meet with my handsome son (who works at a river north supper club) for dinner before both of us had to go to work.then my order&#39;s were wrong.overall, this place is solid and consistent!."
giordanos-chicago-16,https://www.yelp.com/biz/giordanos-chicago-16,4,"She was friendly and very helpful.it&#39;s much better if you let them toss it rather than take dressing on the side.great chicago style (deep dish) pizza, great salads!.i was never really a fan until my friend took me here.a little while after getting done with the bruchetta, there it was, the moment of truth, our deep dish pizza finally arrived.equally as good cold as it was warm the night before).i recommend this place to everyone staying at the nearby hotels.horrible.now, i am wondering if i will be the victim of credit fraud."
davanti-enoteca-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/davanti-enoteca-chicago-3,5,"The portions smaller.came for a late lunch.why does this place have any stars? food is a disaster and service is non existent!.we finished off with the chocolate pistachio cake, which was tasty but it was really hard (frozen), wish maybe that could have been slightly more warmer..all in all, a terrible experience.in fact, it wasn&#39;t memorable at all.comfortable interior environment, come too early only get breakfast menu.the space is cozy and casual, yet good for a date or dinner with friends.our prosciutto and arugula pizza was filling but more doughy than expected for an italian pizza."
uptons-breakroom-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/uptons-breakroom-chicago,4,"I never eat vegan and this place is wonderful.hands down the best breakfast sandwich you will find in all of chicago.stoked to try out more menu items!.just had the banh mi sandwich with avocado and a side of brussels sprouts.oh, and the brussels sprouts side turned my wife into a lover, not a hater, of that much maligned vegetable.however, because there is such limited seating, we&#39;ll likely take out (and take out a lot!).i frequently buy upton&#39;s meat substitute products at the grocery store, but had yet to be to the breakroom."
high-five-ramen-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/high-five-ramen-chicago-4,5,"Both are equally delicious.the noodles are on point here not to mention the broth, you can add extra toppings just to make you ramen even more delicious, i personally recommend the half spice ramen along with tasty  drink they call &#34; the pain killer&#34; if you have any doubts go check this place out, but be careful though  , you may fall in love with this place.the place only sits around 15, so of course there was a wait.for a basement ramen shop underneath the green house smoked meats, the soup base was surprisingly more flavorful than i anticipated.nyc where you at?the ramen was amazing and i washed it down with whiskey.i don&#39;t get it.the wait time can be long, but the key is to go on a weeknight, and pass the time with a drink upstairs at green st meats.it&#39;s one of the darkest broths i&#39;ve seen and it was on the saltier side, which i actually preferred.thanks for the great service.the food came out fast and the service was good."
jerk-taco-man-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jerk-taco-man-chicago,4,"Stick with the chicken.people travel from different states just to try the jtm.the messed up several customers orders and even bumped a girl a head of me because a worker wanted her number.the wait is very long.i went between 11:30-12 on a friday and the wait wasn&#39;t long.so of course i visited jerk taco man on word of mouth.the flavors of the seasoning mixed with the sauce it&#39;s cooked with &amp; cilantro locks in incredible flavor.perfect locale though, it&#39;s core customer base values quantity over quality.the steak is delicious and the jerk sauce is so tasty and definitely has some kick to it.here us the chicken taco with less cheese and an extra shell."
arbella-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/arbella-chicago,5,"I tried their grapefruit negroni and some kind of tequila/lime cocktail, both were fantastic.the funky chicken was more balanced for me.it will not disppoint.their food menu is small, but the taro taco and the short rib bao are quite tasty.when we walked in, we were pleasantly surprised.wait staff was pleasant, knowledgeable, quick, etcc!would recommend this to anyone!!."
dolo-restaurant-and-bar-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dolo-restaurant-and-bar-chicago-3,3,"It&#39;s my new favorite place for dim sum in the city.we ordered the mango tenderloin, string beans and hot n sour soup! the portions are really big so be sure to come prepared to share! the small soups are really big (enough for two) and the main dishes are easily shared by 2-3 people.i like that they add oranges and other citrus fruits to the sauce.the sauce was not i expected.the room was pretty small for 12 people, but we still managed.the great thing about this place is that they close late! i work 10 minutes away from here and sometimes i leave work pretty late.service pretty bad."
wise-owl-drinkery-and-cookhouse-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wise-owl-drinkery-and-cookhouse-chicago,4,"They have a new menu, new prices, and new attitude.very good upscale bar food, friendly bartenders and a good location right near the racine blue line stop.my type of amazingness.this is not a traditional fried crab cake.&#34; not my bag of lipton; so i probably won&#39;t come after patio season is finished.love this place!!make sure vanessa is bar tending she makes the best mixed drinks, i love the wise owl had 3 wise owl&#39;s &amp; was only going to have 2.went here for lunch and had a great experience.food- this is my opinion is where there is still some improving to do- but they have come a long way.then we had the chipotle bbq wings.it wasn&#39;t too crowded given it was a playoff game for the cubs, which was nice."

eduardos-enoteca-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/eduardos-enoteca-chicago,3,"We went to eduardo&#39;s for the first time since it has opened and we were quite pleased.i would really recommend the brussels sprout salad and the squid ink pasta (always yummy).my friend ordered the spicy italian sausage pizza and i ordered the black ink linguini.and they feature a seasonal menu.i understand they are a small place, i know i&#39;m going to wait, but she was so rude about telling me this i almost left.the shrimp caesar salad was absolutely fantastic! definitely will be returning.good food, good service, good atmosphere.reviewing for sunday brunch:very intimate little spot in gold coast - indoors could probably seat 25-30 people so i wouldn&#39;t recommend this spot for large groups."

estrella-negra-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/estrella-negra-chicago,3,"This was a great blend worthy of being featured as an entree, no doubt.the guacamole was average, very creamy but not memorable.oh, and this is part of what i&#39;ve been calling the &#34;walk western&#34; path - starting down at challengers comics (or coming off of the 606), hitting margie&#39;s or gbd for something sweet, hunting to get a piece of your childhood back at toy de jour, looking for oddities at sideshow gallery, getting dinner at estrella negra before ending up at logan arcade.go to logan arcade for a few hours then cross the street for some of the best mexican food you&#39;ll ever have.tamales had delicious masa, pork was okay, spinach and artichoke was also just okay.they run a clean and professional place with some cool paintings on the wall.i ordered the coconut crusted avocado and empanadas sampler they were amazing with very unique flavors.i must say though the location is not the best.small place but have had some excellent empanadas, steak, burritos and more here.they have great food! split the el sol empanadas with a friend and try the la escalera mango salsa enchiladas entree."
real-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/real-kitchen-chicago,3,"From the first tasting, all the way through the final plate was cleared, nick&#39;s team was professional and nothing but the best.but this is for me a great location for takeout with easy in-and-out parking.they change their menu weekly, but you can check it on their website.it was nice to relax at home and not have to go out into the cold until the next day.points for flavor, freshness, &amp; house made sauce.i&#39;ve walked by this place 100 times and finally tried it.we had a turkey sandwich, jambalaya, and the carrot salad.i like the idea of this place -- gourmet food to go that you heat up yourself.not satisfying in the least."
chilango-mexican-street-food-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilango-mexican-street-food-chicago,3,"Their quesadillas are huge and absolutely delicious.husbands tacos were great, and i loved my chicken taco salad.bonus was the hottest salsa (green?) was decently hot.al pastor is good.the banana empanadas was delicious.everything else was fantastic..this made me believe that i wouldn&#39;t like the nutella version.my favorites are the al pastor tacos and horchata.chilango has taken the win for my new favorite place for mexican food in this area."
beezzee-fresh-food-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/beezzee-fresh-food-chicago-2,4,"The small salad was still huge.i had a very nice salad at beezzee today.great place , a pleasant surprise..if you like fresh juice this is a cheaper route than many other locations.stopped in here for a quick lunch before the cubs game."
nuevo-leon-restaurant-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/nuevo-leon-restaurant-chicago-2,4,"My food was cool to warm.don&#39;t argue with me just apologize and be more careful next time.when you first sit down you get chips and salsa and soup for free.weekends have love music.so, this is my third or fourth time eating here and i have to say that this place is a bit over hyped.it was a big one 2 and everyone freaked out.the carne asada is always superb.it was opened 50 years ago."
más-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/m%C3%A1s-chicago-4,3,"I really like this place! their tacos are excellent and their wait staff and bartender are amazing! i do wish they keep having some specials for tacos, like some new items i mean! i have tried all their tacos and want to keep going back to try some new ones.i note that they progressively got smaller.the flavor of them are incredible.overpriced, limited options, mediocre food.i loved the variety of chips, not typical tortilla fare.the overall bill was kinda pricey but it is definitely a fun place to go on a double date.whatever chips they serve with this starter.the place was empty upon arrival yet it look literally 5-7 minutes to get seated.we had a great time and this experience was the complete opposite of what i had previously experienced.while at dinner here the other night, i kept trying to understand this place&#39;s &#34;thing&#34;."
epic-burger-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/epic-burger-chicago,3,"We&#39;re lifelong loyal customers of epic burger now, and it doesn&#39;t hurt that their food is so good!.the burgers here were much better than i expected.their fries were different but good.awesome burgers.great customer service, but just don&#39;t want to be pressured into writing a sugar-coated review.they bring the food to your table.i do appreciate the concept, but find epic burger overrated (and overpriced) for a burger..the only thing that keeps it from a 10, is the price in comparison to fatburger (you get a bigger burger for a cheaper price at fatburger.i only eat turkey burgers."
jake-melnicks-corner-tap-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jake-melnicks-corner-tap-chicago-2,3,"Good beer selection.the corn bread was a joke.believe it or not this is a local haunt of people who like to go out and they live on the streeterville/river north/gold coast area borders.both platters were so awesome - we left feeling stuffed and happy.if there is any question, just ask the bartenders who are really knowledgeable and want to help find the right drink for you.they do however give an insane amount of fries which took me awhile to finish.nothing tops off texan bbq but this place rocked my world tonight! the barbecue is nice and smoked to perfection! as i forked it, the meat was so tender, juicy and the barbecue sauce is very tasty.there are much better options in this city.just went randomly to this place after i realized that the giordano&#39;s nearby way too crowded."
river-roast-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/river-roast-chicago-3,3,"Even some salt and pepper couldn&#39;t salvage the lack of flavor.there was a large chunk of oily fat on the pork.for a drink i ordered the chenin blanc from south africa (obviously because i&#39;m partial to south african wines.they bring the dish to the table and carve it in front of you.service is great, drink menu is great, food is out of this world.thank you for our night out in chicago, we will definitely come back and hope to be able to enjoy the city view.we started off with the trio of toasts, which has a toast with avocado, one with bacon foie gras and another one (can&#39;t remember now)! i&#39;ve never had foie gras that i didn&#39;t like, but my favorite was the avocado and i still wasn&#39;t overly impressed.it was absolutely divine."
leons-barbeque-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/leons-barbeque-chicago,3,"Had the rib tips for lunch a few days ago and was thoroughly impressed.wish that i could have gotten more fries, but who cares when you&#39;ve got leon&#39;s rib tips.loved this place and their hot links.the fries didn&#39;t seem that crispy but when lathered with the bbq sauce from the ribs, i didn&#39;t really give a damn.unfortunately, the original owner sold his product for unknown reasons but he had a gold mine!!!  the sauce is the best and should be marketed.both came with fries that were just as tasty."
podhalanka-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/podhalanka-chicago,3,"Podhalanka is like sitting down in somebody&#39;s polish kitchen and having dinner.i grew up eating and cooking polish food but my colleague did not.they do not serve liqour but feel free to bring your own.09/15 - this place is awesome.i felt like my aunt agnieszka was cooking--just for me!.the guy behind the counter was super pushy and tried to serve me and my friend things we hadn&#39;t ordered even after i ordered.it&#39;s not a fancy place, but the food is inexpensive, plentiful, and homestyle, served by little polish women.i think this place is kid-friendly and it was a fun meal.don&#39;t let them pick the food for you! expensive and not worth getting.you can see the employees (who i am assuming are also the owners) take pride in their restaurant."
lavash-mediterranean-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lavash-mediterranean-grill-chicago,3,"It is a nice, small restaurant with killer doner ( you probably know it as gyro).com.i gave it a chance since i was hungry and by the area.i stopped in and tried their combination plate.thank you for wasting our time.will definitely be one of our regular go to spots.they&#39;re not the best i&#39;ve ever had, but they do the trick for $8! the portions are huge, so you really do get a good value for your money.good super sweet dessert."
joy-yee-noodle-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joy-yee-noodle-chicago-2,5,"I accidentally forgot to ask if my soup was shellfish-free.we agree the soft shell crab roll as appetizer.joy yee seems to be really popular.(3) some of their appetizers are pretty good- i&#39;m a fan of the fried shrimp shumai.the bubble drink is 5 stars, i love the bubble durian avocado so much though honey dew green tea is good toothe food taste mediocre for asian food  that is why i gave 3 stars only.joyee&#39;s drinks are fresh, tasty, and fairly quickly made.not only that, but they have a vast array of helpful suggestions on what you might like to order that includes pictures! definitely helpful for the indecisive or bubble tea newbie.love the drinks! triple berry freeze with leechy popping boba is my fave.it&#39;s located inside chicago&#39;s chinatown square mall and the business is supposedly the first to sell bubble tea in the midwest.i used to like them because their quality was great but its gone down hill lately."
summer-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/summer-house-chicago,5,"My advice - skip the meal, order dessert, and hang out at the bar for a pick me up atmosphere on a drizzly day.since my first review 2 years ago, i&#39;ve been back to summer house many, many times.had the steak frites the last time i was there - it was a great choice!.but it is just awful.the french fries also are made mcdonald&#39;s style (thin, crispy, and salty) which was a plus!nice ambiance, prices were reasonable, no complaints on service.the service is generally very efficient and that&#39;s how i would describe this place efficiently run.the space is beautiful and bright --i have been to santa monica and i really did feel like this place captured that vibe.the quality was fine but it wasn&#39;t like the greatest thing i&#39;ve ever eaten before.as for the food, it tastes relatively healthy."

el-che-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-che-bar-chicago,5,"We loved everything about this place.fire cake for dessert was well worth the indulgence.i believe it&#39;s call &#34;al asador.the gnocchi was too small a portion sizes for the  $22 price and the beef short ribs only were 3 pieces for $32.the support staff were like ninjas, our tables was cleared and reset in no time! the room was energetic."
kameya-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kameya-chicago,5,"I would rather pay less for a smaller portion.it was exactly what three stars means, a-ok; not bad, but will probably look elsewhere for sushi.the food was amazing and very delicious.the sushi are out of this world and the service is always very nice.from the server who remembered us after only one previous visit to the fresher than fresh sushi and perfectly-prepared succulent ramen, this is a little slice of japan heaven right here in lincoln park.the fish is so fresh, the sashimi sliced perfectly, and the broths in every ramyun have just the right amount of seasoning.there were a lot of noodles.."

ignotz-ristorante-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ignotz-ristorante-chicago,5,"I love the fact the the owner roger walks around and greets every table.it was a light sauce, not a typical &#34;american&#34; italian restaurant, it tasted very authentic.chicago has so many well established italian restaurants all over different neighborhoods, there&#39;s so reason to go to any chains or somewhere downtown.try the calamari! only place i&#39;ve had it in the city that does it just right.overall we had a good meal and our server, lisa, was very nice.pork chops were off the hook! o_o.he makes you feel at home and always makes sure that your dinner or event is nothing short of perfect.shout out to the chef! had the chicken parmesan and gnocchi.just a small place in the middle of a block with a almost hidden entrance.we had lasagna, it was so salty we couldn&#39;t get through more than a bite each and we had a spicy seafood pasta that tasted like bland tomato sauce with a lot of crushed red pepper in it."

giant-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/giant-chicago-2,3,"We had the zucchini, uni, pici, carrots, potatoes and bavette, and finished with the blueberries.good service.the fact that someone has to physically move the table into the middle of the restaurant so i can get up to even go to the bathroom is unacceptable.we had the crab, broccoli, eggplant (must get), tortellini, and ribs.atmosphere is really nice too - cozy and crowded but you can hear the other person across from you."

beatrix-streeterville-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/beatrix-streeterville-chicago,4,We were happy with our choice to eat here.however maybe the other tables were all reserved.they looked delicious.we were so addicted to both locations; at some point that we used to go all weekends.i had the branzino and shared the short rib.this review is only for the coffee shop since that&#39;s what we did on out first visit.i like that the menu has lots of options from healthy (lots of hearty salads) to indulgent.we both ordered a specialty juice that were also great.
