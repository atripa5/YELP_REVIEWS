southport-and-irving-sip-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/southport-and-irving-sip-chicago,5,"We went there last week for my birthday.the fries were not overdone (was worried based on other review) but seasoned and cooked very well..drinks do take some time to prepare, but that is understandable given what you finally receive.i absolutely love the location, the atmosphere and the ambiance.the place is absolutely fantastic! really nice atmosphere and good food.i ate it all and was perfectly full-- not overstuffed.they offer a variety of choices, but almost all with the same flavor profiles.the only reason i&#39;m giving sip four stars is because even with a mostly empty restaurant, we still waited over 40 minutes for our food to be served, which was weird."

farmers-fridge-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/farmers-fridge-chicago,5,"Some of the salad entrees ordered from a restaurant tend to be &#34;dressing-heavy,&#34; but i actually would like more on this salad.not ideal, but i&#39;d give it another try.the salad was fresh, the amount in the salad was perfect.it was also only $8 (north napa salad) and that&#39;s pretty cheap for the loop area.had the napa salad, yesterday, and it was remarkably fresh!  it was packed with flavor, the fruits were fresh and the dried cranberries added a nice tinge of sweetness.the portions are big and will fill you up, not to mention you&#39;ll feel great after eating it since the food is so healthy! only docked a star since it&#39;s on the pricier side.it was so fresh and tasty.their machines are located throughout chicago and offer some of the freshest, tastiest and healthiest salads i&#39;ve had, and definitely the best salads i&#39;ve had from a vending machine.please improve the label!!.fresh, quality ingredients and a rotating selection keep me coming back."

simones-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/simones-chicago-2,4,"The server was friendly, but super slow.i was so disappointed! my husband also hates that he always has to specify that he has to specify that he does not want sweet potato fries mixed in with the regular fries (which is the way they come by default for some reason).i&#39;d come back to enjoy a few drinks in the bar atmosphere, but will go elsewhere for food.this place is awesome any day of the week.came here on a thursday night  with some friends.would be a one star but it is probably the coolest design for a bar i&#39;ve ever seen!  service was average at best; drinks were barely potable and definitely not as creative as the design of the place..small beer list.the food was delicious and reasonably priced.i&#39;ve been coming here from the start.i have to give a shout out for correcting a mistake in style! when we got inside not only did the waiter richard get us all new drinks but the manager rob came over personally and gave us all shots on the house and said how sorry he was i work in customer service and they get an a plus for customer service in my book absolutely recommend! great job gustavo!.love the chicken pasta special for lunch - please bring it back.divvy bikes right out front!.we met only a few days before the horrific stabbing, so it&#39;s kind of surreal.the restaurant itself appeared clean, in good condition, had some cool art on the walls, and according to my neighbor, almost everything is made of recycled materials (urban legend, truth? idk), but i would at least believe that about the booth benches for sure..i like having the mix!  i also sometimes have the side salad instead, which is also very good.still like to come to slaughterhouse once in a while.i always order the empanadas which leave you very satisfied."

pacos-tacos-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pacos-tacos-chicago,3,"So my recommendation is to order 2 steak tacos and 2 barbacoa tacos with a jarrito of your choice.i recommend the al pastor if you like spicy.they stack the meat on top, you get much more meat than the average taco place.i love their salsa nice and spicyred or green doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s all goodi usually get full with twothey offer a variety of mexican sodas and some other regular sodasit usually doesn&#39;t take long to get your food i guess that maybe on busy days it might take longer but it is worth the wait.if you&#39;re around midway airport and need a quick bite, you definitely need to stop by.can anyone help me find the holy grail of tongue tacos! because i think i have!.they also have tamales, barbacoa, carnitas and chicharron every weekend to go and make some barbacoa tacos at home.the salsa is just spicy enough for us pros but not too spicy for those who can&#39;t handle the heat.the salsa verde and roja are very good.average food and service.40! the steak was a little too tough for me.decent (overall pricing).prices are decent and service is fast!."

alinea-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/alinea-chicago,4,"Over the past two years, i&#39;ve really taken the opportunity to taste everything i can, learn to distinguish flavours.is it the norm in hospitality industry that when you see a guest struggle with taffy in her hair that you ignore the problem until she asks?  or is it the norm that when you get taffy in your hair you&#39;d automatically know that you shouldn&#39;t use the hot towels provided to you and go straight to the bathroom?.so don&#39;t be afraid to ask again, what something is or how did they do that?with the presentation of all of the food you will be entertained by all of your senses..to die for..but i guess thats what makes this 3 star michelin restaurant unique in its own way.not once was i genuinely asked if i enjoyed the food.when you consider the concentration of obscene wealth in these structures, the $385 price tag (plus $150 for the lowest tier of wine pairings) is completely proportional, ja?  with service and taxes added on (everything is prepaid), the total of $1,400 is like fast food pricing for a billionaire.were my expectations on the food met? maybe not."

lao-sze-chuan-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lao-sze-chuan-chicago-2,4,"I ordered the governors chicken and it was mostly the dough they cover the chicken with before they fry it...all in all, still a very good restaurant here in the heart of chicago&#39;s chinatown.sadly for me, ambience was about it.we ordered the mapo tofu, dry chili chicken, string beans, and lemon shrimp.i actually initially thought it would be impossible for this place to live up to the hype.if you are visiting chicago and love chinese food, this is a must visit restaurant.would have recommended as a place to eat in chicago a few years ago, but now it is average at best.we shared szechuan green beans (delicious and garlicky), 9 story pagoda chicken, pork fried noodles, szechuan beef, and some pork dumplings in a spicy chili sauce.plus, don&#39;t go to their bathroom, disgusting!...the spicier the better.i got free tea and kimchi with my order and the service was good, helpful waiters.must have if you are in groups of 3 or more.came here because i felt like dunking plant and animal products into boiling hot liquid and eating it.he seemed to be a manager and took very good care of us....why would you offer a check-in offer if don&#39;t want people to use it?horrible customer service!!the food is also nothing special.no cookies of fortune and you pay for the rice.another group next to us ordered additional food and the server forgot all about it.therefore, expecting good service from an authentic chinese restaurant is like expecting donald trump not to make a mockery of the election process.awesome service and fast too.shrimps are big not scampy, never tried the hot pot here looks really good but i don&#39;t know why i have never tried it supposed to be a specialty here, now i deduct a star for a reason, the service is horrible, and i mean horrible they don&#39;t come back they bring you your dinner before your appetizer, they don&#39;t bring you the check they don&#39;t give you water unless you ask they don&#39;t give you a refill, sometimes they run out of rice, ( run out of rice! ) had a real bad experience here one time when they were down to one chef and it took forever for us to get all our food, i was ready to walk out luckily my family convinced me to stay, but i keep coming back luckily a lot of the staff know us so we tend to get better service than other people but still sometimes it&#39;s the same old lao szechuan, still i keep coming back and i&#39;m not the only one this place has been closed down twice reopens every time people know about it and they still pack the place, it&#39;s really simple food is so damn good service is so damn bad gets closed down reopens, people come back i come back place is so damn good lol!!.no need to come here if you only order orange chicken..in the end, they didn&#39;t charge us for it, so that was much appreciated.the prices were good and the portions were large which i&#39;m used to having in a chinese restaurant..no such luck.keep in mind that the region where the food comes from (sze chuan) cooks a lot with spices and peppers.i don&#39;t understand why we need to wait for such a long time if they are not even cooking it during that time."

(if sunny) large open space and plenty of room for people.that was delish! it&#39;s pretty spicey! the tortillas tasted homemade.i totally dig it but for people searching for those sweeter margaritas, i would not recommend it.the steak taco was tasty and priced fair like starbucks?!i believe people do not come for the food..the expanded seating and to go areas help with the overcrowding and wait a bit.it took us forever to flag down our waiter for the bill."
