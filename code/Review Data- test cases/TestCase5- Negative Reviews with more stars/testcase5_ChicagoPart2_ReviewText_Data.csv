community-tavern-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/community-tavern-chicago-3,3,"It&#39;s over this insanely delicious creamy risotto that could stand alone as a meal (if given more of it that is).the homey/trendy balance flowed through the food with bold complex flavors punctuated by a keen eye to presentation and style.service from peter was excellent! (i&#39;ve since shredded my receipt, so i hope that was his name!we started with cocktails, my wife had a very nice cotes du rhone, and i had a sidecar.come for a drink early, enjoy hearty food, grab a dessert and call it a great night!.perhaps i&#39;ll see you there?.our entrees were also fabulous: the tomahawk grilled pork chop and the flank steak were cooked perfectly and accompanied by savory side dishes, some of which were ala carte.we&#39;ll be back for sure."
rockwells-neighborhood-grill-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rockwells-neighborhood-grill-chicago-2,4,"It&#39;s a wonderful neighborhood joint.good beer selection.rockwell&#39;s is super cozy and comfortable.i no longer need burritos, samosas, pizza or regular old eggrolls because this dish is everything.great neighborhood bar and restaurant - family friendly, nice patio, good food, always interesting beer selections.these might just be my favorite burgers.price was right."
mahalo-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mahalo-chicago,3,"Mahalo hit it dead on and it was so delicious with just the right amount of rumalso had the pina colada and was great as well!food: spam meatballs were so yummy, and surprisingly big.my one and only complaint is the waiter did not tell us the burger came with fries haha.the decor is great, with the light blue and white color scheme, cage/wire lights, and pineapples galore.the drinks are delicious and strong!wicker park needed a cool, upscale place like this.and the bill, all-in, was about $50, which seemed like a lot of money for very little satisfaction, other than the very solid staff.nice atmosphere.love the vibes of this place! everything from the surfboards on the wall, multi-color palm tree wallpaper, and neon sign saying &#34;mahalo vibes.i love pina coladas and it did not disappoint.it was nice being able to sit inside and then go upstairs on the patio.i had a day off today and decided to find a new place for lunch."
vora-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vora-chicago,4,"Shabu shabu is not a dish.being taiwanese i was really looking forward to trying a taiwanese restaurant in chicago.i was right.it&#39;s delicate, it&#39;s good, but it&#39;s at a definite markup.and three times out of four, it had been disappointing.good luck.the first time i came here the food was awesome (thai coconut chicken soup, pineapple fried rice) and the owner came over and gave us a bottle of desert sake, so i was in heaven.shared a nice conversation with paul and the mgr alex."
urban-counter-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-counter-chicago,3,"Ordered a veggie burger combo.but, when you order something you want to get and you want it right.yeah i said it."
calumet-fisheries-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/calumet-fisheries-chicago-4,5,"I definitely want to come back and try other things on their menu like the smoked shrimp.you really won&#39;t find a place like this anywhere else, so if you like smoked seafood, this is a good spot.i wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the fried oysters, but i bet there are someone else&#39;s jam.fried shrimp very delicious.great job to all those that run this place!.chubs: favorite!!! but they are seasonal so we didn&#39;t have them this visit.this is why you go to calumet fisheries.good smoked trout, salmon, sturgeon, shrimp, with a variety of sides to choose from.i also didn&#39;t receive fries at all, and realized this as i was too far away to turn back."
idof-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/idof-chicago,4,"Overall just a great place to get lunch! i recommend getting their chicken with pita bread and red pepper hummus.the layout you follow to get your food, drink and suffers as well, and i wonder if they&#39;ve eliminated a few menu offerings here that other locations have?  they also don&#39;t offer check-in specials like my neighborhood idof has.if it is good enough for him, i figured, why not! the lentil soup is to die for!! make sure you get the lemon wedge with it.the falafel isn&#39;t bad and the fresh laffa wraps are great.not to mention that they always give me a cold burrito, and then i have to rely on a microwave to heat it up!if you are in the area and tired of all the chain restaurants, (i.they have really stepped up the game as of late."
yum-dum-truck-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yum-dum-truck-chicago,3,"Pork belly baowich &amp; korean chili chicken baowich $3 each - both baowiches had very good baos ~ soft and yummy.they brought bao, dumplings, and rice balls for 20 people.then i have to down like a liter of water after each bite.i would definitely and totally recommend this food truck to anyone who loves baos and likes a twist to the traditional kimchee and noodles.the tray had liquid in the bottom and the dumplings were wet soggy and fell apart when i tried to eat them.the baowiches and kimcheesey rice balls travel perfectly (unlike some of our other catered lunch options, where things like curry or tacos can get really sloppy en masse), and the portions are perfect."
takos-koreanos-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/takos-koreanos-chicago-4,5,"I just love love this place..i ordered 3 different tacos (galbi, bulgogi, shredded pork) and they were a little on the small side for what they charge, but they were still tasty.i&#39;m just really disappointed because it&#39;s an awesome concept; the delivery was very disheartening, for they ruined two really good cultural foods.they played kpop as background music :).tried tk the week it originally opened and we liked it - they were still getting their bearings so any mistakes were forgiven."
standard-market-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/standard-market-grill-chicago,4,"My friend and i were in the area, and decided to grab a bite after the cubs won!we were initially drawn to the spot because of the seating.the shrimp bisque soup is amazing!  happy hour is every day which is a plus and the royal blush is my favorite drink so far.i&#39;m a fan of the sweet potato fries as they are larger than most.and the wine list is decent as well.we had over 3 people tending to our table, and it wasn&#39;t even busy! my steak sandwich was very fatty and had little meat on there; no where near the $14 i paid for it.i did get a fee order of sweet potato fries with my order though which we enjoyed! i don&#39;t think i would order food here again.the food was good, but the service was so terrible i wouldn&#39;t recommend this place to anyone!.you place your order and they give you a beeper and you can seat yourself.everything was great.ask for my guy josh - he&#39;ll take care of you!."
pearls-southern-comfort-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pearls-southern-comfort-chicago,4,"(seriously, do not miss this!) also, the four-cheese mac &amp; cheese that came with my wife&#39;s catfish was outstanding, and definitely made me wish that i&#39;d ordered a side of it to go with my po&#39; boy.the blacken catfish was perfect and not too spicy.the food was delicious also.it&#39;s deserved of a visit for sure if you want to go south, but don&#39;t have the time for a flight to new orleans.i don&#39;t know what they put in the butter on the cornbread, but i wouldn&#39;t be surprised if i found out the main ingredient was crack.well done crew and chef, loved my meal and the spicy bloody hit the spot.they all agreed it&#39;s one of the very best restaurants in chicago.just tried this place and the food is just ok and the service is slow and poor.i got the smoked pork po-boy and it was definitely something to get again.it seemed very classic to me (not knowing)--a tight mix, well done, that lasted through and complimented my meal."
new-england-seafood-company-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/new-england-seafood-company-chicago,4,"See you soon, love e.i cannot recommend this place unless they fix these problems.unfortunately this restaurant seems to be stuck in a continuous downward spiral.no frills, great quality seafood spot.don&#39;t think i&#39;ll go again.having gone from miami to key west trying various samples of key lime pie, sorry to say that this did not compare very well.overall, we had a wonderful experience and the food was great.the hubs hails from maine - therefore i bring a lot of opinions about lobstahs and their friends to the table.i also thought the lobster was too cold, even if served as a lobster salad roll.walked in around 6pm on saturday and noticed the place had 3 tables filled."
rock-bottom-restaurant-and-brewery-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rock-bottom-restaurant-and-brewery-chicago,3,"Highly recommend jalapeño pretzels!  we will come back!.convenient location for post-work dinner and drinks.the pizza wasn&#39;t all that great tasted a little bit salty but the nachos were really good.great place to go after work..it&#39;s hard to find anything that&#39;s superb, but all the dishes (i had most, if not all, of the appetizers and a number of mains since we were ordering for a couple of large groups) are acceptable and will fill the void in your stomach, and go well with beer.)  clear amber, medium head.get a side of mashed potatoes, grilled seasoned broccoli, or fresh fruit.the beers were all pretty good.i am like a fiend for club soda so this was a pretty big disappointment."
azteca-grill-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/azteca-grill-chicago-2,4,"Haha! it&#39;s the little things.had this delivered for the first time tonight.they expedited my order and delivered within 20 minutes and it was delish! definitely will only call direct from now on.we can&#39;t say enough about this wrigleyville gem! amazing mexican cuisine and faster than any other delivery in chicago.remember to check in for the free chips and guac!.not the best food, they do weird things like only selling their sopes in sets of three, refusing to sell them a la carte, but their service is lightning fast!!  i mean delivered within about 15 minutes on average.so, admittedly i have had some late night food in this area.prompt service.the guacamole was delicious!.they threw a fit when we tried to use 2 credit cards and the third person tried to use cash."
the-loyalist-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-loyalist-chicago-3,3,"There&#39;s some great stuff going on in this basement bar - much more relaxed than most west loop bars while still being a destination stop.fresh, bright and refreshing.after glaring at us (everyone at table agreed it wasn&#39;t reasonable) and getting the manager, who also acted annoyed, they brought out the burger which was fine.an all-veg entree would be a nice addition."
hopsmith-tavern-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hopsmith-tavern-chicago,4,Seemed like a great casual place to catch some games and drink some good beer or cocktails.i was aiming for brunch on a sunday.i had a burger and mac and cheese.he&#39;s running a tight ship here with great servers and peeps behind the bar.food is great.tried to go here with a few friends.it only seemed to get more crowded as the night went on.i would still recommend this bar but be careful ordering tap beers may be old..full of crap.
fennel-and-iris-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fennel-and-iris-chicago,5,"I am always apprehensive about dining out with twin 7 month olds because people tend to be less then friendly when i walk in with two babies.my girlfriends and i make it a girls night out and this is the perfect place.we came here on a friday for brunch.i would come back again in a heartbeat!.everyone was so friendly and accommodating!  the food was wonderful and presented beautifully!  prices were great!  i will definitely be back!.for a private event though, great space and super great service.she packed up all our left overs at the end of the night.we had the scrambled eggs, blt, frittata, and they gave us oj for the prosecco we brought in."
county-barbeque-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/county-barbeque-chicago,5,"They were too similar, all were very vinegary and very peppery and the spicy was not spicy at all.very good!  highly recommend this joint..they have tv&#39;s on the wall at the bar, and music playing.i&#39;ve always always orders from here in the passed its my to go to bbq place that near today i ordered the bacon pieces i opened up the container and there&#39;s literally 10 pieces of fat that are a dime size big more maple sauce then anything.i tried the brisket for my main dish with macaroni and cheese, garlic fries, and a hot link for my sides.amazing! can&#39;t stay away!!! am becoming a regular here!! love everything here! i want to live here.my group of friends and i arrived with minimal expectation and left not only full, happy, but also impressed."
el-nuevo-taco-loco-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-nuevo-taco-loco-chicago,4,Portions were generous and the meal comes with a side of rice and beans (also very good) for $9.i did the burrito suizo per other yelper&#39;s recommendations and loved it.the rest of our food was great.highly highly recommend.
the-orbit-room-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-orbit-room-chicago,4,"What a difference a few years makes!i&#39;m convinced orbit room has one of the absolute best patios in chicago.orbit room, the absolute best of whatever you want whenever you want it.it may look like a dive bar from the outside, but it&#39;s actually a clean, comfortable place inside!  met a friend up for a drink and conversation and we felt right at home.i alerted our waitress and she and a couple of other staff helped me look.haven&#39;t been late, but there seem to be a lack of pretentious hipsters, jock douchebags, or alcoholics.other than that, this place was pretty decent..no one else on the patio noticed these little girls.well lit and spaced to allow for many to check out what&#39;s going on.our waitress was nice she took proper care."
cemitas-puebla-chicago-11,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cemitas-puebla-chicago-11,4,"I ordered the carne asada cemita to go.at a hefty $9.the chips and guacamole ($7) were both delicious.the service was good, food was good and the environment clean &amp; friendly.but, upon noticing how tiny these tacos are, i was thrilled that it was wrong bc they gave me an extra fish taco.yum!.also, none of the salsas went well with that cemita in particular.she admitted fault (something most people don&#39;t do in general) and then offered to refund both the tacos.overview: fun option in an area that doesn&#39;t have a ton of fast casual places like this, but food is just okay.for that reason, it remains to be seen how viable the place is; it isn&#39;t fancy enough to draw people willing to pay more, but it&#39;s a little too pricey for hungry neighbors to make it a frequent stop."
reno-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/reno-chicago,4,"The pizza was good, but was a bit too thin for personal taste.we came in to reno as a party of 10, and although the restaurant is pretty small, reno accommodated us with a large picnic-style table.i don&#39;t think i&#39;ll try this place again.got seated at a window table, and was quickly brought water by one of the busboys.very good food.so naturally we ended up there within the hour.i liked it.and i don&#39;t think i ever will."
the-breakfast-lounge-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-breakfast-lounge-chicago,4,"No refills, no silverware, she screwed up every order, chicken was inedible..this place fails to deliver on food and service.for the  people rating this place &#34; awesome&#34; or &#34;blows away eggsperience and yoke&#34; you guys must be smoking that crack; this place was horrible!  let me start off with my coffee which wasn&#39;t even hot and which had a long hair in it.minus the b&amp;g.the service and overall experience was quite horrendous.now the dilemma is how do i convince my husband to come to this place again.from the moment i walked in the door, i was greeted with smiles.when we entered midmorning there was nobody there l, most of the tables were dirty and had not been cleaned off even though there were a number of waiters standing around.definitely not a place we will go back to."
shokran-moroccan-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shokran-moroccan-restaurant-chicago,4,"Ask for a spot in the back - the little room with visions and curtains).their couscous was superb and the bread appetizer / olives were suprisingly savory.had the chicken tagine with saffron + lemon.others in my group tried the lamb fez and liked that one also.it&#39;s as authentic as anything i had in morocco, and the service is just as wonderful.i came here with my boyfriend and we didn&#39;t have reservations which is highly advised because its always full.i visited this restaurant with my friend who was in town from morocco.it&#39;s sort of like shredded/crumbled sweet and savory chicken wrapped in phyllo dough but it&#39;s oh so much better.i needed some omega 3 fish oil, and this dish provided a swimmingly delicious experience.went on a friday evening with a mate of mine and enjoyed everything."
cafe-urbano-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-urbano-chicago,4,"I love the abuelita mocha on ice, i&#39;m addicted.but the cubano was amazing.great first visit, i&#39;ll be back.i&#39;ve been twice- once for just a latte and once for breakfast and a latte.kinda sucks.the food is amazing and fairly priced as are the drinks.great coffee drinks, friendly, helpful staff, and good food! i&#39;d recommend stopping in for a quick coffee on the way to work, or stay for breakfast and get some work done here.quiet cuban music plays as a cool breeze blows across at least half an acre of hardwood floors and furniture.the guy warmed up my pastry for me and i also had a macaroon.."

janes-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/janes-chicago,5,"We both had the frittatas.this place has great vegan/vegetarian options.giggle.i&#39;ve been here twice, breakfast both times, and had excellent food and service! a little spendy but nothing that i wouldn&#39;t expect from a non chain, non greasy spoon.)*steak (albeit luke-warm) was tasty.the food was absolutely amazing! my husband said that the goat cheese stuffed chicken breast was one of the top 5 chicken entree&#39;s he&#39;s ever eaten.apparently, one of the women was just on a vacation, and now she&#39;s super busy at work.had a lovely dinner there last night.i will, however, go back for the food!."

ciprianis-pizza-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ciprianis-pizza-chicago,3,"If you love deep dish pizza, you must try ciprianis.my family and i have been ordering from ciprianis for years.very good.ordered a large sausage and large cheese pizza as carryout.it arrived very hot, and was loaded with cheese.ninety percent of the pizza i eat is from vito and nicks,  the other ten percent comes from la madia,  spacca napoli,  or similar places.i grew up on this pizza.probably my favorite pizza around.best pizza place in the midway area by far."
glaze-teriyaki-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/glaze-teriyaki-chicago,4,"5 overall, mostly dragged down by the sauce.tofu tasted great! so did chicken breast and salmon.not many places offer tasty healthy options.everything is fine, except the bowl of teriyaki.if so, maybe there should be someone to walk a dummy like me through the process, or at least make eye contact.however customer service needs to be addressed at this location.the meat on its own was sooo salty!  good thing the sweetness of the teriyaki sauce tempered the salty taste, but they can totes ease up.i was told from the proprietor (nice guy, sounds like they sent him from their nyc location to get this place going) that it&#39;s byob, which is peeeeerfect.good service as well.it seemed like this sort of order entry mistake had potentially happened several times today, and it was too much for this girl to handle, because she just said &#34;oh well!&#34;, shrugged her shoulders and walked away through the door into the back room."
blackies-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blackies-chicago-4,5,"Prompt service, clean, did not smell.drinks: i haven&#39;t gone to blackie&#39;s without having a drink, but i think i fell in love with this place on my first visit when i tried their watermelon shots! they were strong, tasty, and only $1! on my birthday, i visited blackie&#39;s and just had a few standard drinks, until i looked at the drink menu.great food, drinks, and service.i don&#39;t bite unless you are on my fork! grrrrrr ;) ha ha.i have been here twice and have been impressed with their dinner specials and the bartenders.the servers and bar staff are very cold and often take a while with checks or checking on you.i haven&#39;t been here for food, and not sure i would necessarily eat here, but for a bar option in the printers row area of the south loop, blackies isn&#39;t too bad afterall!i had been hesitant to try this place because it doesn&#39;t look the most inviting from the outside, despite the fact that it has actually been in business a long long time according to their signage.and sunday we take a brunch , the food again is nice , delicious , service great , price wonderful.awfully slow when you&#39;re in a group with 5+ people, even more if you&#39;re each on separate checks."
sze-chuan-cuisine-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sze-chuan-cuisine-chicago,4,"Quite pricy but the probably the smallest size i have ever had in a szechuan restaurant.as others have commented, when you walk in the decor is quite modern and gives you some false hope.remember! never order the spicy crab.i love love this place! is the best! if you have a group if friends, it is the best place to go! price is very good too.there&#39;s an upstairs too so this place must be huge, but on the main floor, the tables and chairs are so close to each other, you would have think this place was cramped.my boyfriend and i went late on a friday night and there were about four tables total.the food was full of flavor and spice.everything was good, the food came out fast and was reasonably spicy.that means 99% of the menu items are spicy.."
andiamo-pizzaria-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/andiamo-pizzaria-chicago,4,"Just went with my family - the pizza was excellent , we also had the pasta pomodoro and spaghetti with clams , and the chicken breast with grilled veggies.we ate here.we ordered the rustica and the diavola pies.the pasta was perfectly al dente."
pork-and-mindys-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pork-and-mindys-chicago,4,"Their sandwiches are unique and delicious.got the chuck - soooooo good.it was pretty good, but i was expecting warm, bacon crumbled up in big crisp chunks.no beers.my friend got 3 different mini sliders (plenty of meat) and she liked the chicken on the best.and after trying some of the bao to the pork, the blt tasted even better.both items were pretty tasty, also pretty small, would have liked a larger portion for the price.definitely have had better pork baos elsewhere in chicago.finally had a chance to go back, and p&amp;m was exceptional.the tot-tine was quite tasty - the gravy and mozzarella worked really well together."
tip-top-inn-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tip-top-inn-chicago,3,"I would definitely be back.third owner in the past year &amp; the renovation has removed practically all character of this formerly venerable bar, established in 1896.friendly and welcoming neighborhood bar; good selection of flavorful, fresh and well prepared food, including fish and chips, juicy burgers, herb roasted amish chicken, taco trio."
ajida-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ajida-chicago,3,"Shiromaru hakata ramen with chashu (pork) was sooooooo good! soup base and the ramen noodle itself very much comparable to famous ippudo (too bad chicago doesn&#39;t have it).they make the noodles in-house--that&#39;s a big plus.i ordered the shiromaru classic to and the broth was rich, creamy and flavorful.the pork belly slices were thick, tender and slightly crisp on the outside.i can tell you it had udon noodles and chicken swimming in a pork and chili broth.price.the display window for this place is overly glossy and weird and chinatown-looking and unappetizing but with a groupon, i decided to try it anyway.i&#39;ve been here three times and i have never been disappointed with the food or service.the shoyu ramen is definitely my favorite! i&#39;m excited to head back and try all the other entrees out!.but it doesn&#39;t matter, you&#39;re supposed to have pork in ramen, not chicken!

red-door-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-door-chicago,5,"Dununun dunununununununun batman! great patio although service was so poor.that said, the service was incredibly slow and inattentive, despite the fact that we were one of 2 tables in the restaurant for dinner.doesn&#39;t say anything, just throws it down and leaves.sunday brunch offers bottomless $12, mimosas too! try the croque madame with frites.the scene is chill and the cocktails are always good.i give this place 3 stars because of service.also for brunch they offer bottomless mimosas, my favorite! food was decent, but honestly does the taste of food really matter when you can drink as many mimosas as you want? i&#39;d certainly go back!.then i realized most of the chips were left over were just little broken pieces of tortilla chips.i love the bulgogi style steak and kimchi with eggs.seating on the patio was in the shade which was amazing because it was really sunny that day."
angelos-wine-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/angelos-wine-bar-chicago,5,"Generally speaking, we were happy with our experience.and i&#39;m not even that in to wine.boyfriend got the croqutte sandwich and he thought it was bland and didn&#39;t taste fresh.they only settled this claim after it was filed in court and they were forced to cut a check weeks later..i have yet to dine in, but i love angelo&#39;s take out menu.the calamari was amazing!!!  pork belly mac and cheese is a must have!!  service was excellent, the staff was very friendly.i will definitely go back to enjoy that place again.again another fancy touch from a relatively low-key place.i don&#39;t remember the name, but it was paired with a dessert wine and the combination was out of this world."
cheesies-pub-and-grub-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cheesies-pub-and-grub-chicago,4,"The location is very convenient to the red line and about a 10 minute walk to wrigley.i ordered delivery this past weekend and was extremely disappointed.a little overpriced, a literal sandwich with cheese and mac for $7.went here with my roommate post-bars, so as you can imagine we were pretty thrilled to be fed, and of course we can appreciate a place that caters their hours of operation to the less than sober.also has a bar in the middle if you&#39;re a drinker.this is my favorite casual spot in chicago.it combines my two childhood comfort foods, mac &amp; cheese and buttery grilled cheese sandwiches.to top it off it is supposed to come with tomato soup/sauce.that the leadership of the cheesies franchise is so personable and down to earth.ultimate comfort food! my friend from out of town heard about the grilled cheese at cheesie&#39;s and wanted to check it out before leaving."

via-lima-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/via-lima-chicago,4,"Airport chaufa (?) was great, and the roast chicken was solid but definitely needed the sauces that came with.pretty good wine list.causitas are literally just beautiful layer cakes of whipped potatoes, avocado, hard boiled egg, and shrimp.the place was empty so the atmosphere was pretty lacking.you can even bring your own bottle of pisco and get a full pitcher of pisco sours for the same price of a single cocktail at lima.the drinks were amazing.i would def eat there again.it&#39;s unusual and delicious.it was served with 2 sauces that were great for dipping the chicken in, as well as the french fries (which were not typical french fries -- they are these amazing thick wedges of potato that are nice and crispy on the outside).overall my experience at via lima was great and i will definitely come back."

the-southern-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-southern-chicago,4,"I&#39;m not sure i&#39;d pay for this again just because the music was mediocre and service got really slow closer to midnight so it was hard to get drinks at our table.after the point she made when i ordered it, i opted to just eat around the edges and forego the fries.we were seated at a high top table near the &#34;wall&#34;, which was actually a rolling door that would be open in warmer times.despite there being a consistent flow of people, the southern is still amazing enough to their customers to routinely offer a groupon for one of the best brunches in the entire city! not only does their chef possess a certain ingenuity in crafting his southern inspired menu, but the food is fresh and delicious.the sandwich was large, and super crispy and flavorful.i can&#39;t speak about the food and will never be able to because we will never be coming to this joke of a restaurant again..thrillist told me that the southern was one of the best places in chicago for mac &amp; cheese.next time will probably get the fried chicken sandwich.the service and decor was great!  overall, the food was bland."
