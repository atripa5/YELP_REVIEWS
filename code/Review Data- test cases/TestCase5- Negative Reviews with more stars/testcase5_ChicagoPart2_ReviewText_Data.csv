takos-koreanos-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/takos-koreanos-chicago-4,3,They just became a more soggy sweet rather than the  dry sweet like before..overall the quality of food was great and service was excellent.i should&#39;ve just ordered a second.tried tk the week it originally opened and we liked it - they were still getting their bearings so any mistakes were forgiven.
pizanos-pizza-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizanos-pizza-chicago-2,4,"I went here with my friends for dinner and we ordered our food.check this place out when you are in the loop..had the walk up to counter ready pizza.would not go back!!! my family of 5 went in for dinner and the wait time was about 30-45 minute wait for a table inside and wasn&#39;t even that busy.nice friendly staff, clean restaurant good locations..tortolenni  soup was nasty too, tasted like hot salad dressing...we spent all of the next day vomiting and shaking in our hotel room..along with these ingredients, there is a thick slab of mozzarella - i think they bury it under the deep dish ingredients right on top of the crust.he was absolutely perfect.dont grab your customers food just because the place is busy and you want to get more people in.also had the hot wings which were great as well.what a great guy!! he was a great waiter and so friendly..props to you pizanos! you are ultimately my favorite chicago deep dish! and actually my favorite pizza (deep dish or thin crust)the sauce full of crushed tomatoes, basil and garlic was what made the pizza! the buttery crust was awesome as well.check this place out but maybe do a comparison to see which place you like better.i give a thumbs up to our palatable pie topped with garlic, basil, and sliced tomato.and she&#39;s not sarcastic at all- she literally means that this is the best pizza she&#39;s had in 7 1/2 decades on earth.and was waiting on us to leave so she can go home.similar to lou&#39;s without all of the accompanying hype.we ordered a &#34;canadian&#34; type pizza aka pepperoni, mushrooms and bacon.ambience: old school italian feel.i&#39;m glad we took her advice!we started off with a few pops and beers, and an order of calamari ($13.thanks to the management staff for providing us a most wonderful and exciting experience.chicken was hard and dry, would never get it again, especially when giordano&#39;s has amazing chicken parmesan for a fraction of the price (i think, don&#39;t remember the exact costs).the server daniel was polite and we had a good laugh when he said this pizza is nothing like ny style.the small deep dish was plenty for my wife and i."

drews-on-halsted-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/drews-on-halsted-chicago,5,"Decided to give it a whirl last friday evening.avoid this place.the only thing keeping me from rating five stars is that the a/c was out when we visited leaving the dining area very hot.one of the best caesar salads i&#39;ve ever has.overall, i wasn&#39;t wow&#39;ed, but i would eat here again.quite personable.)i got the three course meal, with shrimp, roasted chicken, and lemon sorbet.4 stars for the wonderful and accommodating server.congratulations on the name change!  been coming here for years and was happy to see that not much changed except the name.a group of friends and i came here for brunch on a sunday mid-morning.very disappointing.the only reason this is not a five star review, is because it did take a few extra minutes for our waiter to approach us, than we are accustom to, other than that it was a great experience! once our waiter did come to our table, we found him to be very helpful and knowledgeable! we started our meal with an appetizer of drew&#39;s tequila shrimp, a very good start to the meal! my partner had filet mignon, which was very tasty, it came with garlic mashed and asparagus.when i explained what was wrong, the staff told me someone else had a prior experience and tried to make me wait 15 minutes for the owner to return to explain what was wrong.it was a very pleasant surprise!."
harvest-moon-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/harvest-moon-chicago-2,4,"Atmosphere is very dark and more of a bar feel.the manager did come by later and gave us a nonchalant apology, saying something about them being slammed the day before because it was their first day offering brunch.we enjoyed all of our european inspired dishes (pierogi with caramelized onions, thanksgiving-style turkey schnitzel), balanced with healthy apps like a triple-grain salad (faro! barley! quinoa!) and balanced cocktails..this might be my new spot.farm to table is a great concept.their beer list is great including craft brews from illinois based breweries.what happiness this place brought me.a nice twist on thanksgiving dinner."

sophies-chicago-9,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sophies-chicago-9,3,"I may keep it on the list, but this won&#39;t be a go to spot..there were probably two other people eating at the cafe and a fashion clinic going on in the private room."
