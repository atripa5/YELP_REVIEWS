dunlays-on-clark-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dunlays-on-clark-chicago,07/31/13 , 2 ," Dropped by here with some friends after 9 holes of golf. We were all feeling a little worse for wear after a long night out followed by a horrific round of golf which included several balls landing on the roof of a nearby building and several more ending up in lake michigan.One of my friends had the healthy choice (yogurt, fruit, granola) while the rest of us opted for the Dunz Omelette (mozzarella, provolone, italian sausage, bacon, carmelized onions). The omelette was amazing. While we waited, we snacked on an order of the beer cheese and chips. The beer cheese has some jalapenos in it to give it just the right amount of kick.Our waitress was attentive and kept our glasses full the entire time we were there. She may have been a little simpathetic to our condition.The food was great, and service was excellent. I will definitely be going back here some time soon."
the-glunz-tavern-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-glunz-tavern-chicago,09/30/14 , 1 ," Housed in one of the first brick buildings built in Chicago after the fire, the building is awash in original detail and/or historic artifacts. Built in 1883, from the original tin ceilings, wood floors, imported German stained glass windows and other fun stuff, the place has the authentic cham of yesteryear Chicago while being a comfortable, contemporary community treasure.Tuesday is half price wine night. Oh and BTW, the family owned House of Glunz Wine shop, also a treasure, is the oldest continually operating spirit house in the nation, so they have a great selection of interesting and reasonably priced wine (and beer).The food blew us away. Best described as a contemporary twist on classic German food as well as some hearty salad and fish options, everything, and I mean everything, was sensational. The food had a real authentic home style taste that only pride, talent and slow cooking can achieve.We had the roasted brussel sprouts, a beet, goat cheese, pistachio and caraway seed salad, sauteed red sauerkraut, and s salmon vegetable fish dish that were as home style delicious as it comes.The home made strudel was the final blew that brought the much sought gustatory orgasm we all desperately seek in our dining experiences.My final bit of advise, listen to Stephanie and order whatever she says. She's delightful and knows her stuff."
naansense-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/naansense-chicago,02/11/14 , 1 ," I was lucky enough to catch the last day of the $5 deal (entrée, side, and drink)! The line was insane because of this but worth it.I got the brown rice bowl (comes with naan) with chicken in vindaloo sauce and red pepper chutney with all of the toppings: pickled onions, cabbage slaw, farmer's cheese, chickpea noodles, mixed greens, quinoa salad, tomato and cucumber, and roasted vegetable. It was delicious. If you like spicy like I do, then the vindaloo and red pepper chutney is for you. Honestly, I should have gotten a 'cooler' chutney (garlic yogurt) because my mouth was on fire, although I enjoyed it...but hot on hot is def a dangerous combo. The chicken itself was moist and juicy and the toppings were quite fresh. However, the veggie samosa was just okay and find Bombay Wrap's samosas to be much better.Their service was splendid. Even though the wait in line was around a half hour that afternoon, the staff was very friendly and did the best they could, as the line did move along. They ran out of naan for a quick second and reassured us that fresh ones will be out in a minute, in which it did. They ran out of cups, so we got to choose whatever was in the fridge (I got Vitamin Water). Forks ran out but was replenished quickly. Again, great service. I could tell they were a little overwhelmed by the increasing number of customers but that didn't stop their friendly demeanor and smiles and hustle & bustle.The atmosphere was not the most comfortable because it was so busy, as the line of people draped along my table, and pretty much all the tables, as the place is somewhat small.Nonetheless, delicious Indian food with American styled options, affordable prices, and great service. Also, dietary restriction friendly place!"
taza-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/taza-cafe-chicago,04/18/14 , 1 ," Taza and its surrounding restaurants were smack dab in the middle of our work buildings, so my best friend and I came here a couple of times for our weekly lunch date.Taza is a tiny little cafe that makes really great, cheap lunch food! I've tried both the gyro and falafel sandwich, and both are deeelish.  The falafel here is amazing- I don't know how they make it differently from other restaurants, but it is crispy and delicious on the outside and smooth and almost creamy on the inside. The food is fresh and delicious and you can get a quality lunch here for under $7!"
trattoria-no-10-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trattoria-no-10-chicago,08/24/14 , 1 ," CHICAGO, IL: Trattoria No. 10 was a delight to attend.  Located in a cool basement away from the humidity, the upscale dining area was quiet and classy, with handsome waitstaff.We were treated to a menu with many items that looked delicious.  I had two menu items, see reviews below:Beet 'Ravioli' Antipasti: (4 stars) This dish was playfully served and very good.  The 'ravioli' are really large, thin slices of red and yellow beets with goat cheese in the middle.  Like six beet/goat cheese sandwiches.Day Boat Scallops: (4 stars-$32) These scallops were a mixed bag: the scallops themselves were five-star.  They were perhaps the most moist and succulent scallops I've had; juicy, marinated, yet plenty firm, they were awesome.  The rest of the plate was 2-star: overly acidic salad greens without much to them paired with five baked potato wedges that were devoid of flavor.  If they had been seasoned and served with some ketchup they would have made average potato wedges, but as they were they were just lousy.  A few bites were all I could muster."
havana-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/havana-chicago-2,10/01/14 , 2 , I very much enjoyed my lunch at this cozy spot. They have a lunch menu which has many varieties and is very afford-ably priced which is super great for the nicer restaurants. I ordered the 3 Enchiladas with steak. They were nice and moist with strips of beef and covered with both a red & cheese sauce. This also came with white rice and black beans. I finished 1.5 enchildas and took the rest to-go.I would totally come back and try more from this tasty adorable place.Did I mention that the staff rocks! They are all about enhancing your dining experience at Havana. So refreshing! :)
the-silver-palm-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-silver-palm-chicago,12/22/10 , 1 ," I went to The Silver Palm for one thing and one thing only - the three little piggy sandwich.  Just take a look at that monstrosity! (And I mean that in the best possible way).  Intrigued?  So was I...The three little piggy sandwich is not for the faint of heart - featuring the 3 piggy trio of double smoked ham, pork tenderloin, and bacon - this study in porcine goodness is smothered with Gruyere cheese.  Oh, you want more?  Throw a fried egg on the whole shindig!  This sandwich is a two-handed, three-napkin meal.  Just as a frame of reference, five people (including three big guys) shared 2 sandwiches.Such a complex sandwich could be overwhelming, but Silver Palm's does a great job of balancing this creation so you are *almost* pushed over the top but instead linger right in that happy state of comfortably full.  Combine that with the old rail car decor, and you've got yourself a winner.  If you're in town, grab an eating buddy and check out Silver Palm's!Pork, pork and more pork. And cheese. And egg. It's good."
el-milagro-tortilla-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-milagro-tortilla-chicago-2,05/07/14 , 2 ," This is the first place I took my sister to when she visited from Texas. Houston has nothing on Chicago when it comes to Mexican food, and I have the privilege of living in arguably the Mecca of Mexican food in Chicago. El Milagro being a microcosm of that. They embody everything she misses about food in Chicago.She took my suggestion and ordered the steak burrito. Not only is it the best burrito in Pilsen, but maybe of all time. Because it's hard to top grilled arracherra stuffed into a giant tortilla with other fillings for under $5. You will assuredly get hungrier when looking at all the delicious food behind the glass, and may become indecisive on what to order. No worries. It happens. I'm pretty sure it's hard to make a bad decision.It could be a madhouse depending on what time you come here, and they do close earlier than some places, so be cognizant of their hours. They have a little store connected to buy tortillas, chips, etc. which is cool.If you're coming to Pilsen to chow down, it's imperative you add this gem to your list."
pierogi-heaven-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pierogi-heaven-chicago-3,10/07/13 , 2 ," Came here as a stop before catching my train and I must say it was pretty good.They have lots of different pierogis topped with onions and bacon with a side of sour cream. I don't remember what I got for flavors (I asked the person to pick), but I do remember liking the veggie one better than the meat.Overall, it's a bit pricey, but good. I would stop by again if I was back in that area."
goddess-and-grocer-chicago-6,https://www.yelp.com/biz/goddess-and-grocer-chicago-6,06/29/14 , 1 ," I remember when this place first opened, many years ago. It was the first concept like it in the area - it was something new to the area. It was tiny. The big communal table inside made things so homey. Just a few offerings, but the cutest shop you had seen.Skip to several years later, and this gem just moved across the street, expanded it's shop and it's offerings, added a rooftop deck, and like the neighborhood with it's new facelift, this grocery doubled it's cuteness and tonight I got to enjoy it on a lovely summer evening.After a family dinner at Silver Cloud with Victoria F, we stopped by GG for yummy gelato and sorbet dessert bowls. Small size for $3.50 and a large size for $5.50. I sampled the salted caramel and the mango sorbet was delightfully fruity and tangy and so mangoey. I didn't want to stop eating it, even though I was extremely full.The new space is gorgeous inside. The upstairs outdoor porch where we ate felt private, even though we shared a long farm table with another couple, and we sat and chatted for hours on a more than lovely summer evening.Great dessert stop. They have beer, desserts, deli, pre-packaged goodies, clean bathrooms, great decor, and a super nice staff on board.I miss the city - a lot. It was lovely to visit an old time favorite in a new space in a newly developed neighborhood.GG, I love you!!"
ignotz-ristorante-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ignotz-ristorante-chicago,10/28/14 , 1 ," For me service is king, I would sooner go back to a place that has okay food and great service then great food. With so many restaurants around ..... come on, I could make great food at home. I go out for the whole experience. So when I find a place that has great service and great food. WOW!!! what a treat.The place looks great. Just a small place in the middle of a block with a almost hidden entrance. You can't go wrong with that. Within minutes the owner came over and shook our hands and talked to us. I have experience this before (although rare) and most time the person is like a robot and just coming over because they feel they have to. Not this guy, he talked to us for a while and I asked for some recommendations on dinner. He was really nice and came over a couple times to make sure everything was good. The rest of the staff was the same, we were celebrating a couple birthdays and even the people that took our plates and filled our water was asking about our birthday and wishing as warm birthday wishes. Our server was also extremely nice and helpful. the place is small enough that they ask everyone to sing happy birthday with them. How much more friendly can you get? Again the service was great.The food is all around was delicious. We were a party of 6 and we tried a little bit of everyone's food. I ordered the chicken cacciatore, which is what the owner recommended and he was correct it was amazing, the only flaw I could see was that it didn't have any pasta. Some pasta would have been great because the sauce was amazing, and a little pasta to soak it up would have been ideal. Something to remember for next time. Also the baked rigatoni was out of this world. Seriously, I was waiting for this to be an disappointment, it is so easy to mess up but not here. The sauce was creamy and the noodles were perfect. With the sausage, mushrooms and onions WoW, I wish we could have brought some home. Now, the best for last was the homemade gnocchi. I feel sorry for my friend that ordered it, because I don't think he can ever have gnocchi again. They were pillows of heaven with the greatest vodka pasta sauce ever. No other way to describe them.At the end of the meal they come out with chocolate covered cherries, is this really necessary?..... YES!!!!! By this point in the meal I am already sold and I will coming back often but in case someone isn't sold yet boy these cherries are going to do it for you. How perfectly simple and so delicious.I need to finish this review so I can go back."
fabulous-freddies-italian-eatery-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fabulous-freddies-italian-eatery-chicago,10/02/14 , 2 ," A local hotspot that does casual Italian well at a decent price. I was definitely in the minority when I skipped the pizza/sandwiches/hot dog variety and chose to try the alfredo pasta. I obviously wasn't expecting gourmet fare, but I was full and satisfied by meal's end. The fries are great!"
brgrbelly-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/brgrbelly-chicago-3,08/25/14 , 1 , I went to leadbelly for a burger club monthly excursion.I am notoriously a positive reviewer of burgers overall but I gave the leadbelly burger my lowest score ever by quite a few points.The bun was the best part of the burger which is really sad.I ordered my burger medium and I got it much closer to well done.The meat was a weird texture and about an inch thick.I did enjoy my toppings but overall the burger was Meh.The fries I got were the parmesan and garlic and they were mushy.Our whole group (8) got burgers and fries and no one was impressed.For all the hullabaloo when this opened I was hoping for a lot better.I complained about the 7 mile trek out there and there is no way I will be returning.
pastoral-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastoral-chicago-2,07/28/14 , 1 ," Suzie Q's Fun Facts:'Pastoral' or a 'pasture' refers to land upon which sheep or cattle are grazed.=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=After the debacle that was Park Grill (see my Yelp review atyelp.com/biz/park-grill-…), since it was already past 2 pm and my mom and I still hadn't eaten lunch, we turned to my phone's Yelp app to guide us to an alternate food source.Within a few blocks in every direction of Millennium Park, Yelp told us that one place, with a single '$' and four star average review, stood head and shoulders above its neighbors.So mom and I headed to Pastoral as fast as our hungry legs could carry us.To our surprise, though, Pastoral wasn't a restaurant or really, even, an eat-in cafe. This little storefront is more like a combination gourmet grocery store, deli case and take-out counter.But that's OK, because we were just a block away from a gorgeous park on a gorgeous day, so a picnic was in order. So we picked up sandwiches and drinks and ate them next to 'the bean' on picnic benches.Mom and I shared:BLUE PIG N' FIG: 'Jamon Serrano, blue cheese, local fig and black tea preserves, whole grain Dijon mustard and field greens $10.05'Verdict: Had a nice sweet-and-salty flavor profile. I liked the unexpected pungency lent by the mustard. The Jamon was a little too tough and salty for me, though.SINFULLY HEALTHY: 'Roasted local turkey, Fromager D'Affinois, mango chutney, whole grain Dijon mustard and field greens on cracked wheat  $7.99'Verdict: Satisfying and delicious turkey sandwich with a welcome touch of sweetness lent by the chutney. The portion of the turkey was generous and the combination of ingredients was just right.If l lived in Chicago, I have a feeling I would visit Pastoral often. As it is, having returned to California, I guess I'll have to make due with the more expensive alternatives here."
francescas-on-taylor-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/francescas-on-taylor-chicago-2,06/22/13 , 1 ," I came here last week for dinner with the boy. We arrived an hour late, which they handled graciously. Side note, this is why you don't go TV shopping before dinner. Men take forever to make up their minds!We ordered 2 appetizers and a pasta to split amongst us. The calamari was tasty but the sauce wasn't very flavorful. We liked it better when we dipped it into the tomato sauce that came with the mussels. We ordered the linguine pasta with seafood. It was cooked well and it had a nice spice to it.The boy had some questions about wine before ordering. But it became apparent that the server didn't know what we were talking about, so we just stopped talking and ordered. The wine wasn't great. But I mean that's what we get for ordering glasses of wine rather than a bottle right?They have live music at 9PM on Thursdays which was nice. Overall, my experience was a bit average. There wasn't anything that stood out or would have me coming back again. As a matter of fact, I was looking longingly at Davanti Enoteca during the entire meal because I wanted some of that linguine with crab. Yum. Francesca's has a more traditional menu and sorry but that's just not me.By the way, there is 'valet' parking across the street for $10."
the-drinkingbird-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-drinkingbird-chicago,08/14/14 , 1 ," This joint has slowly but surely become my default date spot in Lincoln Park. Besides being one of the most cleverly and tactfully decorated bars in Chicago, the drinks are top notch. The bar caters to just about anyone. The retro 1950's/60's decor is really cool - complete with awesome neon signs, mood lighting, and cool bar stools and tables. A TV also lets the sports fan catch the game at the bar.The cocktails are my favorite part - the list is simple and not too long, so those who are undecided can quickly make up their minds. For those who want to order off menu, the bartenders know their shit and have been able to make anything I ask for. The wait is not long and the place is never too packed. Specials are also great, with half-off craft cocktails on one night, split of champagne and oysters for $12 on another night, etc.I would try the food, but who are we kidding, I usually end up eating at Pequod's on the same trip as the Drinkingbird."
mannys-cafeteria-and-delicatessen-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mannys-cafeteria-and-delicatessen-chicago-3,12/14/14 , 1 ," Ahhh Manny's... a landmark for all things Chicago.From the exterior signage saying 'Chicago Since 1942' to the caricatures of 'Da Bears' accents serving you from behind the cafeteria line...this place is def a must visit spot for tourists and even for young locals looking to experience a piece of true vintage.If you remember the Daley era, many politicians then paid regular homage to this place and probably brokered the City's future in the back room. Manny's proudly displays photos on the walls of some of the local elected officials. One photo you can't help but to notice is of a Chicago nobody, that rose to ultimate political stardom, with his big naive smile before he left for Washington in '08.The 1/2 corn beef sandwich and soup is very popular. The meat is fresh, not salty and perfectly tender. The matzo ball soup, other than Max's, have the best seasoned broth and matzo's amazing thick:fluffy ratio. Truly a science. Don't stop there. Add a potato pancake and a pickle. Push for the side pasta and finish off with a slice of cherry pie all within an arm's reach.And as you roll out of this historical treat, you can smile knowing that there are still places like Manny's left where you and your grandmother's generation both have shared memories."
ceres-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ceres-cafe-chicago,07/31/14 , 1 ," This is great if you're an alcoholic, or if you're drinking to forget something.  Not that there's anything wrong with that!  We've been there!  I like it twice a year after something bad has happened.  Otherwise, I like slightly finer things and I'm okay paying for that.  No knocks."
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,10/01/14 , 1 ," Dropped in for my first full-meal visit (had the shakes before) thanks to a recent Groupon offer, $30 for two burgers and two shakes.  Given the normal menu prices, I thought it would be a good time to drop in.Whoa.  I very rarely give five-star ratings on my first try, so I want to come back one more time just to make sure what happened really did happen, but we tried the Hot & Smokey and the Big Shoulder Blues...both burgers were sensational.  Although I fought too much with the skin on my hot link on the Hot & Smokey, there was a hot link SANDWICHED IN-BETWEEN PULLED PORK AND A CHEESEBURGER.  Yes, this was the only meal I had yesterday.  Fries were good, but my wife reported that the sweet potato fries were a disappointment.  Also disappointing--the root beer float we ordered was essentially served frozen, so you couldn't actually drink it without pouring more root beer onto the float.  (Root beer bottle was not granted with the original order, FYI...yes, I'm a shake snob.)  The second shake we got, a plain chocolate shake, was very well spun and thick, just the way daddy likes it.I will go back to make sure these burgers are as good as I think they are...a very happy surprise that this was so good.  I know, 600+ Yelpers can't be wrong, but with burgers, I have trust issues."
the-big-state-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-big-state-chicago,10/18/14 , 2 ," Cash only at the moment, but still, pretty good food. Can't beat three tasty pescado tacos and a soda for $4.50. Imma definitely be back for the mexcian hot dog."
rapidito-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rapidito-chicago,09/10/14 , 2 ," After trying out Colombian hot dogs in Miami, I was always on the hunt for them in Chicago.  Finally I discovered Rapidito offers a really similar option, if not identical.  On a Sunday afternoon, I decided to give this place a try with a couple of my friends.  The restaurant is quite small, but it didn't seem to be a problem because there wasn't much customers dining in.One of my friends and I decided to split an order of the Hawaiian Oinker and a Colombian hot dog.  The Hawaiian Oinker is sliced white bread topped with pineapple, smoked ham, cheese, avocado, and potato chips drizzled with pink sauce.  I enjoyed the different flavors and textures of this dish.  The sweet and savory gets me all the time.  The Colombian hot dog (cheese, pulled chicken, potato chips, ketchup, mustard, pink sauce, honey, pineapple sauce, and a hard-boiled quail egg) on the other hand, was a disappointment.  The hot dog was a lot smaller than the ones offered in Miami, but the most important part was the taste wasn't on par.  The Colombian hot dog had no balance between the dog, bun, and sauces.  All I felt like I was eating was a bun with sauce slathered all over it.  Another disappointment was that the chips were soggy and taste kind of stale.Overall, I wasn't too impressed with Rapidito.  Prices were kind of expensive for small dishes and the service wasn't the best because their employee didn't know how to work the credit card machine for over 10 minutes.  It was just way too much trouble and out of my way for just average food."
grand-palace-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-palace-chicago,08/29/13 , 1 ," Real home style Chinese cooking without the excessive MSG.  They offer whatever they're able to buy that day from the market, so the menu is different all the time.  This is a family run mom and pop place, so when it gets busy, you can expect slower service.  So don't say I didn't warn you."
la-casa-de-samuel-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-casa-de-samuel-chicago-3,09/02/13 , 1 ," I was not impressed by this place at all! I went in with a large group and a live band was playing. Even though the restaurant was mostly empty, we were seated right in front of the band so we had to shout to be heard. The server could not understand our orders (we tried in both English and Spanish) and we resorted to pointing at menu items. Most of the items we got were painfully overcooked and not very flavorful. A fried ice cream dish was literally grey because it had been burned and then left sitting out so long it had a leathery skin coating. Perhaps it was an off night, but I won't be returning to find out!"
osteria-langhe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-langhe-chicago,06/01/14 , 1 ," This was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. I've found my new favorite Italian place in the city -- not just the neighborhood. Thankfully it also happens to be a few blocks away.The wine recommendations were spot on, the food was devine, and the service was friendly and thoughtful. I am still basking in the afterglow of the Plin -- perfectly al dente, pillowy, creamy, buttery, thymey -- just so freaking good. I loved the light and fresh octopus, while my wife devoured the cauliflower and nettle flan. The steak was cooked just as we ordered and the reduction and fondue accompaniments were fantastic. We were in a rush, so no dessert, but I can't wait to go back. It's not going to be long before the word gets out."
90-miles-cuban-café-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/90-miles-cuban-caf%C3%A9-chicago-4,11/19/14 , 1 , Small sister restaurant to the much larger 90 miles on Armitage. Great for lunch- food is AMAZING! And they have some good weekly sandwich specials too that go until 5pm. Work is only 5 mins from here- looks like I found my new favorite lunch spot!
ub-dogs-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ub-dogs-chicago,06/24/14 , 2 ," This was my first taste of Chicago! The Chicago style hot dog served as a warm and friendly ambassador of this lovely city.The service here was great. The cashier very politely oriented this weary traveller to the menu and ordering system.The only other Chicago style hotdog I had was at shake shack back home in New York. And for years, I contemplated whether it was authentic. After having the real McCoy, I can sleep at night."
honky-tonk-bbq-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/honky-tonk-bbq-chicago,10/20/14 , 1 ," Dusek's quoted an hour long wait for a weekday so here I am at Honky Tonk BBQ, which turned out to be a pleasant alternative. It was bright and a lot quieter, so you can actually carry out a conversation.We had the 1/2 chicken, brisket deluxe plate, fried green tomatoes and extra corn muffins. The tomatoes came out piping hot but not greasy at all. Loved the corn muffins. And the brisket was melt-in-mouth tender. Only letdown was the coleslaw, which wasn't very flavorful. Prices are right and service was great too. How could I have not tried this place earlier?!"
carbon-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/carbon-chicago,09/08/14 , 2 ," Came here for the third time since it's right by my house. This place was also on one of the FB buzzfeeds of one of the must try burritos in the US so I decided to try it. Buzzfeed recommended The Mother Clucker. It was pretty good and tasty. I had mine with wheat tortilla (ask for it!). In it was a lot chicken breast, cilantro, onions and that tequila lime sauce. Chicken was grilled very nicely--but it was also $11.50.Free parking with patio seating.Fresh and healthy.Serves alcohol but not a full bar."
troy-mediterranean-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/troy-mediterranean-grill-chicago,08/18/12 , 2 ," Troy is an ancient city, as many of you already know, but it's actually located in Turkey.  So it makes sense that Troy Mediterranean Grill is a Turkish restaurant.  When my girlfriend decided one night we'd eat here, I was excited, because I love all things Turkey and want to live there one day as it is a beautiful country.To start, we got a healthy serving of bread as part of the meal which was very good. At other Turkish places in the states, I have gotten stale-ish bread many times, but this bread was not stale and was very good.  For the appetizers, we ordered Mucver and Haydari, which are favorites of mine brought on by my last trip to Istanbul. I also ordered Ayran (yogurt/buttermilk-type of drink) and my girlfriend got the lentil soup. Mucver are fritters made of zucchini, dill, feta cheese, egg, flour, etc.  The ones here were good and had a healthy serving of the yogurt/dill/garlic sauce on the side. The Haydari is definitely the best I've ever had, which includes anything I've had in Turkey (I typically have had Haydari with many meals in Turkey). It goes great with the bread.  The lentil soup was also good from what I had.For the main course, I ordered the Iskender (Yogurtlu), which is another favorite of mine.  Iskender is typically lamb that is layed over bread that's been soaked (I think?). It has tomato and yogurt sauce in it all melding together to make a great dish.  The one I had here was very good and just as good, if not better, than any I've had in Turkey.  My girlfriend had the Lamb Kebab which was great, and our friend with us had the Steak (Filet Mignon?) Kebab. Again, very good and you can tell they're using very good meat here.We struck up a conversation with the owner, who was a really nice and genuine guy originally from Turkey.  He even offered us some Turkish tea at the end, which was good!  He also gave my girlfriend some extra soup when she wanted it in a to go container. Very nice guy.  The only thing I wish they had (so far), is Apple tea. That stuff is amazing, but it's probably not easy to get in Chicago.Overall, this place was very good and possibly the best Turkish food I've had in Chicago.  It's also BYOB, which is great! If you walk by this place and pass it up, then I feel bad for you. It's great food! I will definitely be back. The rest of their menu looks great."
pita-heaven-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pita-heaven-chicago,09/06/14 , 1 ," I ordered from here a couple times.The food is ok. Not that great but definitely worth it. I love the cream soup (I think that's what its call, my husband is the one who always order it for me). The chicken noodle soup is also ok. I always get it everytime I'm too tired to cook dinner.Their hot appetizer, the stuffed grape leaves is definitely to die for (well, at least for me!). Ooo and their grilled octopus is YUMMY!For entree, my kids love their mediterranian chicken. For me, I love their veggie panini. My husband loves their chicken panini.For dessert, I simply LOVE their rice pudding because it wasn't too cinnamon-y taste. I just can't stand too many cinnamon. My kids love their choco cookies (oh well, they're kids!).The staff is definitely friendly. The restaurant atmosphere is cute.Overall, if you want a greek food but you don't want to pay much, just go here.Will definitely go back here again and again."
handlebar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/handlebar-chicago,11/03/14 , 1 ," Remember the food you liked when you were a kid? There's a Dairy Queen near the corner of 73rd and Taft Street in Merrillville, Indiana, and all through high school and college, I'd go there and get a sloppy joe. Oh boy, was that thing good. Big fresh bun, and a huge pile of sloppy, messy, delicious meat. It was fantastic. I loved it.In the intervening years, I became a vegetarian. When I drove by that Dairy Queen, I'd think of that sloppy joe with fondness, but I never went in. What, me eat dead animals? Not a chance.My friend Jean suggested we go for dinner at Handlebar. I knew Handlebar's reputation, but had never visited. Before agreeing to go, I checked out the menu online. I zeroed in on one item -- they had a sloppy joe. It was made from 'carne de soya.' A taste memory filled me mouth. OK, Jean, Handlebar it is!Although located perilously close to the hipster heaven of Wicker Park, we were able to find free parking on North Avenue. Granted, we went on a Monday night, but hey -- first impressions count.Entering the restaurant, we saw a bar off to the right, and about half the tables were occupied. We stood at the entrance, taking the lay of the land for a minute, and giving all those oh-so-young diners an opportunity to wonder why two age 50+ women were there. A host greeted us and said, do you prefer to eat indoors or outdoors?This was the Monday in late October where the daytime temperature had reached 73 degrees. We sat outside, under a canopy. It's a very pleasant space. Since it's in back of the restaurant, there are no car or bus fumes to swallow along with your dinner. Quieter, too.We each had a glass of red wine. Sorry, I can't tell you what kind, but we both were happy.Then, the main course. When my carne de soya sloppy joe arrived, it looked right. It smelled right. I had added avocado to it, for an extra cost, because I thought it would be the perfect fit with a spicy sloppy joe. This sandwich was fantastic. It fulfilled all my dreams. It was everything my 17-year-old self had enjoyed, and which I had craved ever since. Messy, hot, spicy, delicious. My mouth is watering for it right now.I chose a side order of garlic mashed potatoes, and it was scrumptious.Jean had a vegetable stir-fry that was a special that night. She enjoyed it. It looked good, and I'll try to load a photo of it. She was very, very happy with her meal. It wasn't a sloppy joe, so I don't really care.Very satisfied, very happy, comfortably full, and oh so happy we came. We'll be back. I may even try something different on the menu. Well . . . maybe not for a while.Handlebar is proof that you can be a vegan and still enjoy wonderful Midwestern comfort food."

the-reservoir-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-reservoir-chicago-2,02/06/13 , 2 ," I like it here.I was lured here to be a ringer on my friends' trivia team.  See, The Reservoir does a theme every week (one of the rounds is a different, fun theme voted on by trivia teams the prior week) and last night's theme was Game of Thrones.  I may or may not be a super fan of the show.  I fully realize I'm outing myself as an uber-geek to the greater Yelp community, but whatevs.So anyway... Trivia night. It's a cool situation.First, the trivia guys are totally fun, cool, super cute and really fun.  They also keep a pretty good pace, which is much appreciated.There are 6 rounds and the winning team of each round gets a free shot.  First time I've seen that and I was loving it.  Winning team takes a $50 gift card.The categories are great.  Famous quotes about Chicago?  Obviously the trivia team-elected special category each week.  Picture round, music round... they've got it covered.  The questions were challenging, but not so outrageous that nothing could be answered.So while trivia rocked, I'm not sure I was in love with the food menu.  Everything seems kind of pricey and there's not a lot of diversity on the menu.  I mean... I paid $7 for a little side of truffle/parm fries I was planning on splitting with a friend that were undercooked and not that good.  Good for my diet, I guess.  On the upside, they do have bottomless mac and cheese on Tuesdays and word on the street is that it's tasty.One recommendation: Get the old fashioned they have on the menu, but be a dick and substitute blood orange bitters for the chocolate bitters.  The reason?  Blood orange ANYTHING rocks and chocolate bitters just seem weird."

I like that you can order almost everything a la carte to get a sample of several items. Favorites are the La Gringa Quesadilla (al pastor, chihuahua cheese and pineapple), Shrimp tacos, and Chorizo tacos.  Love their salsas, the salsa vercde is addicting."

osteria-la-madia-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-la-madia-chicago,12/10/14 , 1 ," This is my friend's absolute favorite pizza place in Chicago and I was glad to get a meal here on my short visit!La Madia's definitely got a cool, sleek vibe. The lighting is dim and you feel like this could easily be turned into a happening lounge late at night with its modern, tasteful decor and a bar area that looks like the place to hang out. Yet you the kitchen is pretty visible, mostly out in the open, separated from the tables by a low counter. I had a full view of the pizza oven.Our reservation was for 5:30pm on a Monday night, which was unnecessary as only a few other tables had customers. We had a very professional, responsive, and efficient server, and overall had a great dinner here.PIZZA* Parma Classic (red. arugula, prosciutto di parma. $19) - 4.5 starspic:yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m…The best pizza of the night in my opinion! I tend to like reds so I may be biased, but even for a red I thought the prosciutto was sharp and complemented the arugula and fresh tomato sauce really well. Their crust is thin and soft with a crisp, though not quite as fresh-out-of-the-oven as I'd prefer. The outer crust could've done with being a little more stretchy when I pulled it apart, but this is me being picky on a 4.5 star pizza!* Wild Mushroom (white. smoked mozzarella. $16) - 3.5 starspic:yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m…Not a huge fan of white pizzas, and not a big lover of mushrooms, so this wasn't a winner for me flavor-wise. But it was well made and I will say the mushroom wasn't too overpowering and had a fairly well-balanced flavor. Overall I found it a bit bland though.* Moroccan Spiced Lamb Sausage (white. mint pesto. $17) - 3.5 starspic:yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m…This was my pizza and it wasn't as impressive as I'd hoped! The sausage wasn't very spicy, and its texture was a little chewy, reminiscent of chain-restaurant delivery pizza.ENTRÉES* Tagliatelle (foie gras meatballs. $14 half) - 3.5 starspic:yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m…This was exciting for me because foie gras isn't allowed in my home city of SF anymore. I couldn't really taste the foie gras to my disappointment though - if I hadn't been told what this was, I would have thought it was just regular meatballs. The tagliatelle was not as wide as I've had at other restaurants, but had a texture that was balanced between being soft and al dente. I found the sauce to be a little plain, and rather watery. It was nice to have the option of a half order.Menu:yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m…"
northdown-café-and-taproom-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/northdown-caf%C3%A9-and-taproom-chicago-2,06/05/14 , 2 ," Really exceptional service from Bo,Great bartender,  offers awesome beer knowledge and customer service.  I felt like a REGULAR even though it was my first time there.  The food was absolutely delicious.I kinda built my own grilled cheese,  and it was fantastic,  the 'tomato soup' is more of  a thicker paste, when I tasted it with a spoon,  I wasn't in to it.  But when I dipped my grilled cheese in it,  I was all in!The French fries are addicting.  They are so good!  I'm still thinking about them.My gf went with the macaroni and cheese with bacon and broccoli she really enjoyed it.It's a really cool looking bar, I love all the beer taps.They have a huge beer selection.Really clean washroom."
busy-burger-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/busy-burger-chicago,06/26/13 , 1 ," I walked by Busy Burger and saw their catchy shirts and signs raving about their burger, so I raised my expectations quite a bit coming in. What I had was pretty much the definition of a mediocre burger. For context, I would rate Shake Shack and Five Guys well above this in taste and they're the same price. The burger was overcooked and fairly dry. They had a special sauce which was interesting. I might come back here if I'm craving a quick bite to eat, but I would never go out of my way."
dmk-burger-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dmk-burger-bar-chicago,12/18/14 , 2 ," This is by far the best burger experience I've had. My turkey burger was succulent, fresh, and clean tasting. To add, it was  just big enough for me to be satisfied. I also shared  the bacon Mac and cheese with my fiancé which was also good. However, I didn't necessarily need the Caramelized onions at the bottom. My fiancé had the cheddar and scallion fries which he loved. They were just okay to me. I didn't get a chance to taste his bison burger but he says that was phenomenal too. We also bought two craft beers that were new to is and very tasty. For a burger joint, DMK definitely has top notch chefs and quality food. I can appreciate the grass fed animals and healthier options like bison.The atmosphere is dark and they played some really soulful music which was a pleasant surprise.  We sat at the bar to avoid the communal style tables. I suggest you go midday Monday- Thursday to avoid the crowd that other reviewers mentioned. We waited maybe 10 minutes for our food.If I lived closer, I'd probably frequent more but since I don't, I'll keep it as a special treat!"
emperors-choice-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/emperors-choice-restaurant-chicago,08/29/14 , 2 ," When my cousin from Taiwan came to visit, I had to rack my brain as to what food would be good for him to try. I suggested maybe we can try American Chinese food to which he responded with 'Huh? What's that?' And so I embarked on a journey to find what would be a good American Chinese restaurant for me to take out for him to try. I ended up here at this restaurant because it was closest to me at that point in time.I got the orange peel chicken, kung po chicken, and black pepper beef. I absolutely love the orange peel chicken. It's not as sweet like how most restaurants make it. You can really taste the orange when eating this dish. The kung po chicken and black pepper beef are also very good. All these dishes were a hit with him.  And of course, American Chinese food is not complete without fortune cookies so we also had them.Service is decent enough. I was ignored the first few minutes when I arrived at this restaurant but once I was seated, they were pretty attentive."
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,08/23/14 , 1 ," I had some doubts given the fact that the waiters or the chefs are not Japanese. However as the food appeared on the table, I started liking the restaurant. The uni was very fresh; although it's $4 a piece. The sushi selections within mori awase were pretty delicious and generous. To top things off, this is a BYOB restaurant without corkage fee - which is a big plus when you have cheap friends.To sum up, there hasn't been many good and authentic Japanese restaurants in Chicago besides kai zan. Tsukiji is definitely not like the tsukiji in Tokyo but it gave us a new choice for semi authentic japanese restaurant."
birrieria-zaragoza-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/birrieria-zaragoza-chicago,06/08/13 , 2 ," Had a GroupOn here for take-out and see why they did the GroupOn, you definitely want to come back.  First, the server at the counter was incredibly helpful.  She quickly realized I was a newbie and walked me through the options and how to best use my Groupon.  Then, when I was waiting for the goat, she gave me a free sample of the meat, tortilla, consomme and fixings so that I could see the best way to enjoy the food.And the goat is great.  It has a lot of flavor, especially the pieces still on the bone.  As others have noted, they make the tortillas in house and they are wonderful fresh.  By the time I got mine home, it was not as special but the goat still was.This is a really unique restaurant with excellent food and even better service."

Very dark/Great music!  I think what made it for us was the great bartender with the 80's CHIC jeans, she was very accommodating and treated us RIGHT!  They have an old 'Gas Pump' tap system that is kinda cool and nice bathrooms.  The kicker is they have homemade Fireball, this is a must try.. just don't 'Deep Throat' it! get dat did"
podhalanka-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/podhalanka-chicago,05/26/13 , 2 ," My wife's comes from a Polish ancestry but we had never been to a Polish restaurant and wanted to try a good one in Chicago.  We chose Podhalanka due to the good Yelp reviews and the fact that it was located on Division St and we wanted to go out to the bars in the area afterwards.Podhalanka is like sitting down in somebody's Polish kitchen and having dinner. We didn't really order - they just brought out a sampling of all kinds of Polish food family style. We had cabbage soup, white borscht soup, perogies, polish sausage, blintzes, mashed potatoes, stuffed cabbage, potato pancakes - a whole Polish feast!All of the food was very good and felt very authentic. The stand out dishes to me were the cabbage soup, perogies, and the blintzes. The soups were very flavorful and had sausage in them.  Everything was fresh and tasted good.Although some could find the pushy service off-putting, I just found it added character and was fun.  After we were done it ended up being about $25 per person including tip, which was more than I had expected to pay - but not bad for the amount of food we got.  I would have liked to know what we were going to pay before we had ordered however...One last thing - it's BYOB, so be sure to bring your own beer or wine!"
tarantinos-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tarantinos-chicago,06/30/13 , 2 ," My boyfriend and I went here for an anniversary dinner a few weeks ago.  It's very close to home and I'd always wanted to try it but the menu was a little too pricey for just any day.  We went on a Tuesday, which was lucky because they had half price bottles of wine!  I ordered the black linguine for dinner, which was okay.  Maybe it was the quality, or maybe I just overestimated how much I like muscles...the texture became a little overwhelming after awhile. My boyfriend got the chicken parmesan and definitely liked his dish way more than I liked mine.  Overall: good, but I wouldn't go back for two full entrees again."
range-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/range-chicago,10/27/14 , 2 ," I met a friend at Range for brunch on a Friday before we went to an afternoon movie and it was the perfect way to start the day!    The restaurant is located in the heart of Lincoln Park/DePaul neighborhood.    This farm-to-market restaurant has a great ambiance and good service.   Now, I have to admit the restaurant wasn't busy by any stretch of the imagination on this Friday mid-morning but you can just tell when the atmosphere and attention to detail will serve you well.For brunch, I had the 'pork & salsa benedict' - two perfectly poached eggs on pulled pork atop a slice of potato served with an arugula salsa verde salad with pear pomegranate vinaigrette dressing - yummy yummy!!For a restaurant to excel as a farm-to-table concept it requires an extensive network of local, organic farmers to provide the chef with great ingredients for his creative dishes.  I can't wait to return to see what new items the chef has whipped up next time!"
lou-malnatis-pizzeria-chicago-10,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lou-malnatis-pizzeria-chicago-10,01/19/11 , 1 ," This Lou Malnati's Pizza location recently catered a lunch for us at one of our sites.  I have not dined in, so my review is only for delivery.Food: We ordered several thin crust pizzas & each and every one of them was excellent! The pizzas had a crispy crust, and the toppings were plentiful.  These are their largest pizzas and serve 3-4 people.   We also ordered a small tray of garden salad (serves 10) which was also very fresh, had plenty of veggies, and came with several different containers of dressing.Easy ordering: The manager on the phone was very friendly and knowledgeable. I called the day before since I wanted to give them a heads up on a large order.  She had no problems processing my tax exempt order, we were able to pay over the phone, and were set to go. We were also able to order soft drinks from them - good selection of Coke products.Delivery: Fast and reliable! The food got there on time & was very fresh! The pizzas were fresh out of the oven & the driver was very friendly and was on time despite a snow storm. Also - they provided us with plenty of plates and utensils at no additional cost.However, here is the absolute BEST part: this location which is located on the West Side in a neighborhood that many consider blighted gives ALL of its profits back to the community to benefit children's educational and recreational programs! How awesome is that?On top of that, it provides jobs to many area residents. This was the main reason I chose this place to order from.If you are nearby - stop by for some great pizza! Or if you need pizza delivered at home or for an event, call this Lou Malnati's location! I will definitely try and cater more events through them. I wish more businesses would follow their example in giving back to the community."
gios-cafe-and-deli-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/gios-cafe-and-deli-chicago,03/20/14 , 1 ," From the outside, Gio's looks like a corner store.  Inside its a little bit different.Came in on a Wednesday night and was lucky to find a table.  The place has about 8-10 tables so its easy to see why it can get packed.  Walk in, seat yourself and immediately someone comes out to serve you bread to start your order.  Our waiter was very helpful.  Told us everything that was on the menu and they also have about 8 other specials on the chalk board as well.Now to the food.  I order the Chicken Parmesan, which was delicious.  Chicken was breaded perfectly and cooked perfectly.   And the portion size is huge.2nd plate ordered was the Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp.  Pros - Shrimp was great and so was the pasta sauce.  Cons - It needed more shrimp.  It was basically a plate of Fettuccine and 4 shrimps.Funny part about our visit is we saw the couple next to us order the calamari and it looked delicious.  So our waiter decided to give us a small order of it (their order was huge) and its definitely one of their specialty plates.   You can almost order that and 1 dish and be satisfied for 2 people.Don't forget its...BYOBBYOBBYOBBottle of wine or some beers if you are there for lunch, you're good to go!  Also check Groupon for a deal as well."

Excellent wine service as well."
aquitaine-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/aquitaine-chicago,11/10/13 , 1 , Three stars is a stretch. I had the Groupon which did indicate selections had to be made from the prix fixe menu. It was clearly the 'Groupon menu.'  I'm not a fan when my selections are limited. The check listed what the actual cost would be so I saved $10 which was not a deal considering the quality of the food. My salad was overdressed and the soup was disgusting. While my salmon was decent it was floating in an overly salty broth that added nothing to the dish. My amber cake dessert was pretty good.One last note - the restaurant is touted as a French bistro but the music was inconsistent with the setting.This was a Groupon that I wish I did not purchase.  Just crossed Aquitaine off my list.

Took a long time for the doors to finally open, but it was well worth the wait. Came here for Sunday brunch with a friend and was completely blown away by the food and service. This little gem is family owned, and as our server described the dishes on the menu are what his mother used to make for them growing up. The entres have a slight Mexican influence but are pretty American otherwise.I definitely recommend checking this place out. Try the salmon breakfast sandwich, it was incredible."

The salad and sandwiches are good, nothing to write home about, but fine for a quick lunch. The bakery portion isn't huge, and I've only tried the limoncello cake as far as their pastries go, and I thought that was a little too sweet for me, would have liked a touch more lemony vs sugary taste. I'll probably try a few other baked goods at some point and update then."
the-rosebud-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-rosebud-chicago,11/19/14 , 1 , Decent Italian food but not impressed altogether for the price. I've been twice and haven't enjoyed it as much as other Italian restaurants in Little Italy.

My boyfriend had the thai basil chicken, which was not very good. It was also chunks of chicken sauteed in veggies. We had both thought it was going to be ground chicken with better seasoning. The spring rolls and yom kha soup that we started with were good though. Everything was quite flavorful, even the disappointing thai basil chicken.To mix up your noodle game, try the sweet and savory golden (egg) noodles or the wide clear noodles in the pad khee mao.

oasis-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/oasis-cafe-chicago,05/03/13 , 2 ," Was wondering aimlessly looking for something to eat in the loop, accidentally glanced down and saw sign for Mediterranean food and the first thing that popped in my mind was 'falafel' and my mind was made up to go to this place. It was weird for a second that I had to walk thru a few jewelry stands to get to the Oasis.The menu which seems like a hundred items listed and pictures, plastered along the drink refrigerators - It was overwhelming for a moment but I had a taste for lamb and just scanned the menu for those four letters.It was a good choice, I got a sampling platter with lamb morsels on top of yellow rice, the meal included a warm pita, four crispy falafel and a heaping of hummus. All this delicious food for under $10.It was so good, I literally licked the plate clean and wanted more. The Oasis is a hidden gem, literally speaking buried behind the jewelry stores on Wabash Avenue."
cafe-jumping-bean-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-jumping-bean-chicago,01/09/13 , 2 ," One of my favorite hidden gems in Chicago. The sandwiches and coffee are good, inexpensive and made fresh everyday. I would come here on lunch all the time when I was working at a local Pilsen law firm, and the staff started to get to know me. They were always extremely welcoming and would always ask about work and how things were going. Only downside is it gets extremely crowded around lunch time. We would go at 12 because otherwise it's impossible to find a table.I miss going there so much that after I left my job, I have gone back a couple of times. The simple things on the menu such as the turkey sandwich is just so good. Highly recommend if you're in Pilsen and want a break from Mexican food."
twisted-spoke-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/twisted-spoke-chicago,01/25/14 , 1 ," I recently visited Twisted Spoke for a friend's birthday dinner. The first thing that struck me was the decor. They've really run with the biker theme and it kinda felt like I was stepping onto the set of Mad Max...in a good way. The staff was a wonderfully pleasant group of black-haired hipsters who gracefully accommodated our large group of hungry revellers.First, I must say I enjoyed my food and especially my drinks, but I want to return for brunch as it seemed like more of a brunch place. Then again, isn't everything in Chicago? So, I'll withhold a fifth star until I'm able to sample their fare in the light of day. However, the food was really good. I split an order of the spoked mussels and a shrimp po' boy with my friend. I usually wouldn't order a po' boy this far north but was encouraged to do so by a native New Orleanian. The mussels were excellent. They're steamed in bloody mary and it was so good. I wanted more bread to soak up all the sweet juices. The sandwich was pretty good. Not the best po' boy I've eaten. The batter on the shrimp was a little off. Too crispy. Also, I didn't really like the fries.The best thing I had was the Naked Bloody Mary. It's a deconstructed bloody mary made with heirloom tomato juice. It was so good. I can't describe how good it was. It was like biting into a fresh tomato at a farmer's market. I also had a Bloody Franco and it was good although I'm still on the fence about cold chorizo as a garnish. I tried sips of the Road Rash and Delivrance. Both were very good, too. You get a beer chaser with each bloody which I absolutely love.In short: I'd love to go back again.

south-branch-tavern-grille-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/south-branch-tavern-grille-chicago-2,07/02/14 , 2 ," I am giving this slightly higher than average reviews for one reason- location.South Branch does attract a certain douchy 'too cool for my own good' clientele on the average sunny afternoon- but once you swallow that pill its a great little place.  The food and drinks are good- the prices are fair.  The location in the heart of the financial area makes it perfect for anyone looking for a business lunch, lunch date, or end of quarter drink-fest.I have been many, many times and will keep going back.  I get buffalo chicken wrap often (and tots) because I know exactly what I am getting every time.  Its good stuff, and worth the price.Good service too."
noodles-in-the-pot-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/noodles-in-the-pot-chicago,07/02/14 , 2 ," Have to give this place 2 stars.  So far had the crab ragoons, spring rolls, pad Thai and pad see eiw.  Service is always fast.  I like my food super spicy and they haven't made it spicy enough yet but you can always add your own hot sauce.  The pad see eiw is better than the pad Thai but can't decide between the apps cause the spring rolls have cream cheese in them. Byob sometimes I feel like it's a bit too greasy.. But most Thai is."
bari-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bari-chicago,10/06/14 , 2 ," Bari's has great Italian sub sandwiches. The neighborhood is full of small Italian restaurants and stores. I find the to be very lucky to have places like Bari's in their neighborhood. Shops like Bari's make the area look rustic and comfortable. I love their Italian and turkey sub, the bread is hard but quality hearty Italian bread. Their grocery items are pricey, but they sell you products you can't find in just any store. So I do buy some of their Tomato sauces, their lady fingers and whatever else I can try that won't break the bank totally.  I prefer going there when the place isn't packed with customers lining up to order their Bari's sub. The are fast and good at what they do and I say ' keep doing what you're doing Bari's!' They are #1 on my list for authentic Italian sub."
artopolis-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/artopolis-chicago,08/10/14 , 1 ," Came into Artopolis for a light snack and drink. Was kind of saddened to see Greek Coffee blacked out on the menu...so I went with a Iced Cafe Latte instead and split the galaktoboureko with my family.The galaktoboureko was interesting. It was a lemon custard wrapped in phyllo. We were surprised that it was brought out warm...which probably explains why the phyllo burnt on one end. First bite, pretty awesome. There was a good balance of textures from the flaky phyllo to the smooth lemony custard. But ultimately, we found the dessert to be much too sweet, from the added syrup they put on. And because we let it sit in the syrupy topping, it became ever more difficult to separate and eat.The atmosphere within Artopolis was nice and laid back. The upstairs loft seemed mostly occupied by students from UIC, while the lower central seating area seemed occupied by tourists and 'regular' customers fraternizing with the staff. The staff really doesn't seem to mind if you sit hours on end either. My family and I spent a good chunk of time planning out the next leg of our Chicago adventure here - including laying out the CTA map and all."

palace-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/palace-grill-chicago,08/21/13 , 1 ," Sometimes plans have to change last minute and when you have a dog in tow, there's no turning back and taking her home, at least not if she's my dog.  That's what happened this past weekend.  As we're pulling up, yelp comes through and informs me they have a patio and there on their fence was a big sign saying 'patio open!' and no sooner do I say 'but do they allow dogs?'..there in the corner 'a dog friendly place', or something like that.Look, not only do they allow dogs, they're really great about you having a dog.  There are a few water bowls on the sidewalk, the first thing they ask you is 'would you like a cup of water for the pup?' (and yes, I heard them ask this to others who sat down after us) and then they tell you how adorable your dog is.  Which, if you've ever seen my dog you know is the truth.Moving on.  The patio is small, yet I'd say there were at least 10 tables with adequate room between them.  The food is typical diner food, yet it alllll looked good.  My desire for a skillet went out the window when I saw the word 'gyro' in an omelet.  Surely they have a gyro plate then, right?  Indeed they do, and I saw at least 4 other people order one.  They don't skimp on ingredients.  If salami is in your omelet, you're not going to have to dig to find it.Everyone was pleased with their food, the waitresses couldn't have been any friendlier and it was nice seeing at least 3 other dogs come and go while we were there.  Oh, and there's all the Blackhawks stuff.  I guess that's cool.  I mean,  enjoyed this place so much that I'm willing to look past that part."
eduardos-enoteca-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/eduardos-enoteca-chicago,03/27/13 , 2 ," I stumbled upon Eduardo's on accident while looking for a place to grab lunch with a friend.  The place is pretty small, but had a modern and cozy vibe to it.  As we walked in, we were greeted and then escorted to our table by our waitress.  She gave us water and asked if we would like anything else to drink; they offer a full bar.My friend ordered the spicy Italian sausage pizza and I ordered the black ink linguini.  The sausage pizza was cooked with sweet peppers and caramelized onions in a roma tomato sauce.  All the ingredients complimented each other well.  The crust was also cooked just right.  My linguini was served with shrimp, bay scallops, and zucchini in a spicy tomato sauce.  I can't compare this pasta because I never had black ink linguini before, but this one tasted delicious.  The only thing I didn't like was that the linguini was stuck to each other and formed chunks.  I'm not too sure if it was because it was homemade or the inexperience of the cook.  But nonetheless, I still enjoyed the pasta.So if you are in the mood for decently priced Italian food, then check this place out.  They don't offer a parking lot or valet, but you can find ample parking on the streets (just with the high prices of downtown.)  I also can't say anything about the crowds for dinner, but the lunch crowd wasn't bad."
potsticker-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/potsticker-house-chicago,08/08/14 , 1 ," Wonton with Chili Oil is one of those sublime, simple dishes that is only available in true Sichuan establishments. Once I see that on the menu, and throw in some proper Xiaolongbao (soup dumplings), life is definitely good.These Wonton with Chili Oil were positively swimming in a atomic concoction of Chili Oil and other secret ingredients. The taste was sensational and the spice level was at the perfect sweat and endorphin inducing level many know is the key to life and happiness.The service was friendlier than many similar establishments but somewhat haphazard, as various staff members brought us dishes, forgot silverware, took empty plates when prompted, etc.Finally, the prices are so low that I felt a bit guilty after the whole experience. For those that found the place less than perfect, I agree this is not a 5, 4, or even 3-star building but I wasn't expecting that so therefore, I wasn't disappointed."

Fortunately, we came across this lovely Restaurant, TAVERN AT THE PARK.We got there right before the lunch rush and we were able to get a nice table outside. The food was delicious, the portions were very big for a lunch menu, but we were hungry so that was great for us.The Fig and Prosciutto Flatbread was phenomenal!!!! We also had a Cup of prime rib chili, which was good, the duck egg rolls although great in flavor, lacked a little in the amount of meat, and last we had warm goat cheese starter, which was just ok.The service was really good, and the white sangria was even better!!! The prices are a little up there for lunch, but the portions make it worth it, so go there HUNGRY!!!"

I always thought that they didn't take Debit cards due to not having a sign up, so I just always passed it up. Well this particular night I decided to stop by, since my sis was in from out of town and wanted a Chicago Style Hot Dog. They were good for that, although the original Chicago style has neon relish and poppy seed bun, where as they didn't, but it was cool.We still were able to get a good meal and enjoy our Chicago heritage with a few good times thrown in for good meausure. I am telling you, there is nothing quite as good as having a Chicago Style Dog with the correct fixings and just being able to pay for your meal using a credit card because many don't do that.  I am definitely a fan now, and will be back to Jackys now that I know they are open relatively late, and since I am an insomniac, this is good. REAL GOOD!"
ciao-cafe-and-wine-lounge-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ciao-cafe-and-wine-lounge-chicago,11/13/14 , 1 ," This is a very intimate and cozy place with delicious food in the West Loop/West Town area.I came here a couple of years ago and loved it. Fast forward to last night as I made my long awaited return. Not a very big place but it has character with the lighting and intimate setup. There are regular dining tables, couch seating, hi-tops and a fireplace along with the bar.The menu itself isn't very big as its just a few appetizers, maybe 4 pasta dishes and some flatbreads and empanadas. I decided on their signature dish, the Rigatoni that comes with a delicious cream sauce and sliced spicy italian sausage. Comes in a really nice sized portion and difficult to stop eating as it is so damn good. I even starting sticking my fork in my girl's plate lol. We got the tiramisu for dessert and I have to say that it was something special. They also have a pretty good wine list that mainly consist of dry wines.I was told they have live jazzy style music on Fridays and Saturdays so I def plan on returning for that. They also have pretty cool board/card games to play while you wait on your meal."
paramount-room-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/paramount-room-chicago,11/11/14 , 2 ," Fun, quirky little spot. It is fairly difficult to find and extremely tight, but that's what contributes to the charm it possesses. It's one of those places I'm glad most people don't know about. The food is among the best bar/pub grub in Chicago. Hell, why not call it a 'gastropub.' They have tempura fried green beans with a Sriracha dipping sauce - the most unique offering here and by far my favorite must-order item. Their pork belly bites are also excellent. The waygu burger is delicious as well, and it is offered with tempura green beans instead of fries! I've also done oyster happy hour here, which features a rotating menu of always-fresh oysters. This is hard to find in Chicago!Great beer list. Consistently rotating list of unique, hard to find brews, from IPAs to saisons to porters. Also, the cocktail list looks promising as well. Beer flights available if you want to sample some different varietals.Only beef with this place is the tiny size of the upstairs bar and dining area. The downstairs lounge area is very cool. In fact, one of the most aesthetically pleasing in Chicago, but only opens during peak hours."

Service was great, and it showed right off the bat when our host gave us tips as we took our seats. Every restaurant should do this - FYI the paella takes 45 minutes to make, these are the 2 best items on the menu, we specialize in our Rum and our Mojitos, etc - very helpful tips before our server even got there! My favorite dish was the Oxtail - so tender and the sauce was delicious. I also loved the Chivo (goat stew), beef enchilada, and coconut mojito."

I cannot remember just how I got introduced to this place, I believe it was through yelp but can't say for sure. What I can say is that I'm definitely glad I found it.They had me at Tom Kha, soup that is. My absolute favorite soup, and this place does it spot on. Having had this particular soup at several Thai restaurants, I can say this place does it the best. The flavors danced on my tongue like they were teenagers at a rave party.  And it was the perfect precursor to my main course.When the pad kee mow arrived to the table it looked like just about any one you'd get at a restaurant like this, But the flavors were explosive, unlike many restaurants out there. I had no regrets about ordering it.After that wonderful main course I had to try the Thai custard and boy was I glad I did. It had just the right amount of flavor. It was warm most and delicious. I will definitely be back here, it's become my go to Thai place."

My guy even said it might be top chinese food or definitely one of the top chinese meals he eaten.The razor clams were good. Try it. Their crispy chicken is always good.

park-tavern-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/park-tavern-chicago,03/16/13 , 1 ," Plenty of tv's but nicer than a sport's bar.  This is a newer bar near United Center.  Perfect for before a Bulls or Hawks game, or to just hang out and watch a game.  I love the decor, woody, but not cabin.  I don't particularly like the layout b/c the bar is in the center and there are three different dinging/drinking areas.  It felt a bit awkward to me.We were here for a Yelp even and all the servers and bartenders were really nice.  The manager was kind enough to answer all of our questions about the bar, about the food, everything.  We enjoyed ourselves.I enjoyed the food, especially the sliders.  The only thing I didn't like was the bbq chicken tenders, as I felt like I was eating a banquet frozen kids meal. They were really bad.  The buffalo chicken chicken tenders looked better but I didn't have a chance to try them.Would definitely come back before a game."
perennial-virant-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/perennial-virant-chicago-3,05/01/14 , 2 ," Compared to the general restaurant population, this place warrants a solid 4 stars. Compared to other restaurants of this caliber, I'd say it deserves a 3. I got to try a wide variety of their foods (3 appetizers, 2 entrees, 1 side, and 2 mini desserts).- Cheese platter with blueberry preserve, candied walnuts, fruit and nut crostini, and chef's honey ($17): we got a selection of three cow's cheeses and they were all decent. None of them blew me away, but at least there wasn't one that was repulsive (yes, that's happened to me before during a $160 prie fix menu course). My favorite was the blueberry preserve, which had whole pieces of juicy, sweet blueberries. So good! The candied walnuts were also another favorite.- Goat Cheese Gnocchi with marinara, cotechino sausage, pickled spring garlic ($14): good, but not amazing. The gnocchi were little pillows of cheesy goodness, but the overall flavors of this dish were rather uninspired.- Flash fried baby artichokes: These were definitely good, but the exterior leaves of the artichokes were SO hard. It literally felt like I was chewing on woodchips (had to spit out a few of them). So that was a bit distracting.- Pan-Seared sea scallops with smoked beet puree, candied blood orange,champagne and vanilla vinaigrette, roasted escarole ($32): I adore scallops and rush to get them every time I see them on the menu. The $32 price tag made me hesitate this time, but figured might as well, and waited with high expectations. Maybe the flavors would blow my mind. Or maybe the scallops would be the size of my palm. Nope! I got three, medium sized scallops (basically each one was costing me $10), and they were good but DEFINITELY overpriced.- Grilled bone-in pork chop with fermented black bean puree, pickled tomatillo salsa verde, chow chow ($28): I tried a couple bites, and they were good. Solid flavors and the meat was tender. Definitely a more fairly sized portion than the scallops (still bitter about that).- As a side, we ordered the mashed potatoes with bone marrow butter: probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. So flavorful and rich, I would definitely have ordered my own if we didn't order so much food + I didn't want to clog my arteries- We ended the meal with a cookies and cream ice cream sandwich and 2 chocolate chip cookies: both good, but not anything particularly special.Service was definitely solid. Our waitress was quite knowledgable about the menu and checked in frequently without being intrusive. The interior is also wonderful - it doesn't give off too much of a snobby vibe that a lot of higher-end restaurants do. Rather, it was relaxed and almost felt like I was in a summer home on a breezy island (something about the color scheme and the curtains).Basically, food here is good. Not enough to justify spending this much money, but still solid. Hence, 3 stars overall."
scofflaw-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/scofflaw-chicago,07/11/14 , 2 ," Funky name, awesome place.Came for after-dinner drinks on a bitter Chiberia night and Scofflaw's potent elixirs warmed me right up.I sipped on the flag finder, some of hubby's liar's tail, and the swizzle. So good and smooth that after 1 or 2, you're like 'I'm good,' til you try to get up without assistance. If you do more than a couple, you'll earn yourself a ticket on the Hot Mess Express! These drinks are sneakily strong.Prices are great and people aren't douchy. There's usually seating at the bar and if you're early or lucky, cute tables and quirky chairs.This place makes me love living in Logan and I will be back to try their new summer cocktails."

travelle-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/travelle-chicago,07/06/14 , 2 ," Travelle has been on my 'brunch list' for a while, but I had dinner there yesterday and it was very good.I started with the bour-jito, substituting vodka for the bourbon. The flavors didn't work for me, but since that's not how the drink was intended, I'm willing to assume that it would've been awesome with bourbon.Anyway, the potato and leek flatbread was delicious.  There was mustard on the flatbread, and I don't think I've ever had that particular combination of flavors.  Definitely get it!!!  The piri-piri chicken was very good too, super tender and lots of flavor.  It was actually a little too salty for my tastes, but I'd rather have more flavor than less.I wasn't in love with the desserts: we had the nutella baklava and pistacho honey cake but I'm not generally a fan of baklava or pistachios, so that's not surprising.  I was a huge fan of the appetizer and entree though and am still planning to come here for brunch."

The place is old and the dining room is old, the place looks like it run down.But the customers seem loyal, the food is Junky Fast Chinese food. The owners do their job they seem very mellow about what they do, and that's fine. So I will add one more start to the fact that I know I'm getting some very Americanized fried rice and i keep going back for it so there is something they are doing right."

Fat Willy's is the real deal.After seeing them on TLC Best Food Ever, I had to try the ribs since they take two days to prepare. I thought it was blasphemous to brine the ribs but the flavor of these ribs were spectacular. There was the smoke ring, the meat pulled off the bone easily, and they were charred well. Normally, I'm a sauce kind of guy but these ribs didn't need any since they were great on their own. All the preparation paid off because the taste was unlike anything I've had before. The prices are steep at $26 for a full slab of ribs but when you are offering something this good, you can justify the price.This place gets packed quick but there's an outdoor patio and ordering take out is swift. For the sides, you have to get the mac and cheese. It's everything you want - super cheesy and artery clogging with a crunchy topping. With poutine, chicken and waffles (Sundays only), and po boys on the menu, it's no wonder that you can easily become the fat kid at the table and order several items."

litehouse-whole-food-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/litehouse-whole-food-grill-chicago,12/25/14 , 1 ," I'm going to preface this review by saying I've never actually eaten in the restaurant - my experience with Litehouse is exclusively through delivery and catered events. But I can say I love it.One of my favorite parts of this restaurant is that everything is completely customizable. You pick what toppings and the meat and whether you want cilantro or not. Which may not seem like a huge deal, but one of my friends HATES cilantro which means most Mexican restaurants are not options when we order delivery together.Whenever I order, I order the the Fire Blazed salad with chicken, romaine lettuce and no tomatoes in addition to the Southwestern Wrap on a spinach tortilla with cilantro and guacomole but no tomatoes. See how specific you can get? It's great! Orders come wrapped in foil which makes for easy transport for leftovers. I find that half a burrito and half a salad is a perfect and satisfying meal.Meals are delivered usually within an hour which is fine by me. I one day hope to actually eat in the restaurant, but until I decide to change out of my pajamas, I'll just continue order delivery."
riccardo-enoteca-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/riccardo-enoteca-chicago,11/15/12 , 2 ," First day open.  A great place.We stopped in for wine and small plates before dinner at Riccardo Trattoria across the street.  The decor is unimpressive.  Good, but not special.  The tables are a bit crowded together, and the decorations are also nothing special.  It's not nearly as classy as Riccardo Trattoria across the street.  Neither is the wine list.  I expected a great selection of Italian wines - I got a nice selection of wines from everywhere.So why come?  For the food!The menu has appetizers, cheeses, Italian meats, salads, pizzas, pianinis, and a long list of small plates.  But the small plates are not that small.  And the selection of Italian dishes is terrific.  At reasonable prices.  We shared cecina garbanzo crepes and burratas with fresh tomatoes.  Both were delicious, each large enough for four of us to share.Note:  Only one of the five medium sized thick crust pizzas has meat.  This is NOT a Chicago pizza parlor.  It's a truly Italian enoteca with a giant selection of small plate foods.Attentive service, nice setting, and great food.  This is not a destination restaurant, but for anyone coming to the area it's a great choice."

dos-riccos-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dos-riccos-chicago-5,11/25/14 , 1 ," This place is merely awesome!The location is very close the Midway Airport, about two (2)-minute driving distance south of the airport.  However, walking to this place from Midway is feasible.Be careful while you're driving because you most likely will miss it!  The exterior is extremely nondescript.  They do have a private parking lot; there are two (2) vehicle spaces available.  Nevertheless, the rest of the parking lot is up to you at what position you would like to park.  Thus it's a free-style parking, like a long program in figure skating.Once you've overcome all of the difficulties prior entering into the restaurant, you will experience one of the most amazing fusion dishes you would ever find in the city of Chicago limit.  We ordered the avocado rolls, two (2) fried bean tacos, and two (2) orders of horchata.  Let me tell you.  You have to try all of them if you get a chance.  The horchata was super on point!  It's one of the best I've had, comparing to the ones I've had in Logan Square and Albany Park.  The avocado rolls were crunchy (very creative use of the wonton wrappers), and the avocado paste was rich and creamy.  By the way, the southwestern dipping sauce for the avocado rolls was so delicious.  We dipped the tacos with it as well.  The bean tacos were filling even though there was no meat in there whatsoever.Vegetarians will enjoy themselves in this joint.  Some items on the menu have the 'VF' as the indicators that they can accommodate your vegetarian requests if you desire.  The service was friendly.  The young man behind the counter knows all of his regulars.  This place is a GEM in the neighborhood.Forget the generic airport food.  Get your orders to-go since you get these gourmet-quality items at very reasonable prices.  If you have time, there are a few tables to sit down and chill."

golden-thai-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-thai-chicago,07/02/14 , 1 ," I love it! So good. I have done both delivery and had great experiences with each. They were super accommodating with a couple of substitutions that we asked for. I highly recommend the first: adding BBQ pork to the Golden Thai fried rice. The meat is delicious and so is the rice. Also the basil fried rice is great, though I think the only difference is pineapples. So good.We got the Pad See Yew both with plain noodles, and with the crispy noodles. It's hard to say which I like better. The plain wide noodles here are thin and soft and delicious. The crispy ones are fried. Mmmm. They also use regular broccoli, vs Chinese. This works for me.Green curry was amazing, cashew chicken was out of control good - and something I don't normally get. Bonus points for having variety on the menu, while still nailing the fan favorites. Egg rolls and potstickers also tasty. Oh, and the Tom Khar soup!I really love this place, can't wait to order from here again!!"

asian-outpost-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/asian-outpost-chicago,10/04/14 , 1 , Loved the food and the atmosphere of the place.Felt kinda bothered at the fact the manager/owner didn't acknowledge our table at all thru the night...but their food could take away the small negative.

But all the others were good!Our server was really nice and attentive. And her advice of picking the cheese and chicken enchilada for the moles were right on...I really loved chorizo, so I asked her if one of the 6 enchilada can be chorizo and the chorizo flavor did overpower the moles that goes with it, just like she had adviced...the cheese and chicken ones were more mild, so the moles flavour comes through...and the chocolate mole was on the chicken enchilada while the pecan one was on the cheese enchilada...lolthe special grilled pork dish and the new rebozo soup were all really good and flavourful too...love the slightly creamy horchata...Such a hidden gem! :)"
butcher-and-the-burger-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/butcher-and-the-burger-chicago,04/30/14 , 1 ," Not to sound dramatic, but this was one of the best burger experiences I've ever had! I walked in and immediately felt comfortable; the restaurant, while small, had a ridiculous amount of character. From the exposed brick to the counter with pull-out stools, The Butcher and the Burger delivers a great atmosphere.However, atmosphere is nothing if the food sucks. Thankfully, Butcher lived up to the positive reviews and made my taste buds dance. I ordered the house-blend beef cooked medium and seasoned with the Chicago steakhouse seasoning. When I bit into the burger, it was obvious they use high-quality meat; it was flavorful, juicy, and seasoned perfectly. The skin-on fries were a great addition to the burger as well.My favorite part of my Butcher experience was the staff. I was greeted with a smile and didn't feel uncomfortable at all when I admitted I was a newbie. The gentleman, Mark, who helped me was funny, outgoing, and friendly...he even checked on me a couple times and refilled my water glass.Highly recommended!!"
bangers-and-lace-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bangers-and-lace-chicago,10/13/14 , 2 ," Went to Bangers & Lace on Friday night for some yummy beer and delicious sausages. We arrived about six, which turned out to be just early enough to grab a table before it got a lot busier.The décor is fun. Lace and taxidermy collide to form a warm cabin-like feel. Mixture of high tables and regular. And one long table in the center for some communal seating. We sat in the back at a low table and immediately set out to order some autumnal beers. I'm not normally a fruity beer drinker. I typically think it's kind of embarrassing to order a pumpkin spice beer or an ale with blueberries floating in it, but 'tis the season. So I tried a peach wheat beer - kind of sour but tasted much better once I had some food to eat with it.Speaking of the food...I wanted to order the ENTIRE Snacks section but felt that my friend would judge me hard. So instead we ordered the Duck BLT, the Hot Links, and an order of Fries.Order the Duck BLT. Order the Duck BLT. Order the Duck BLT. Have I made myself clear? Because I really want you to order the Duck BLT. It was so delicious. Perfectly balanced flavors. I just really want you to order the Duck BLT.I thought anything wrapped in a puff pastry had to be good, but really the Hot Links were just 'eh'. A lot of snap to the sausage. The puff pastry was fine but nothing special. And the 'fire' sauce that came with it was VERY hot. So you find yourself trying to get some kind of balance going between the ridiculously hot fire juice and sour cream just to get down the 'just okay' hot links. We actually didn't even finish the order and, between my friend and I, that's just unheard of.What can I say about the fries? Except that they were wonderful! The Taleggio dip was a perfect match up to these deliciously fried potatoes of delight.So why only three stars you ask? You say they have an interesting beer selection, a Duck BLT to die for and fries that delight. What's the draw back? Well, the Hot Links I mentioned were not great. But, it was really because it was so loud I couldn't even hear the person I was out with talking at all. We found ourselves in one of those uncomfortable conversations where you are yelling across the table and constantly repeating everything you say. I hate saying 'huh?' but I said 'huh?'...a lot."

henrys-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/henrys-chicago-2,09/24/14 , 2 ," I will give this place 5 stars because the Killing Floor drink is amazeballs and because the fried oysters kick ass as well. I love all jalapeno infused tequila drinks and the combo of watermelon and lime with it was perfect. (Just a tip don't get the jalapeno cocktail from South Branch--- first time I didn't like a jalapeno infused drink) My girlfriends loved my drink so much they each ordered one for themselves. Had the frozen strawberry margarita too, which wasn't bad but not as good as Killing Floor.Ordered the sriracha ginger oyster slider and the aioil oyster slider--- both were pretty legit. I wish there was no bread though so I could enjoy more of the oyster. But I guess that's why it's a slider! Had the fish taco too---- SO MUCH FISH for $3.50. LOVED IT.I would definitely come back for more food. It's really loud in here though. But our waitress was awesome-- very sweet and helpful with suggestions. Also, there was a huge group of drunkies at the table next to us. Witnessed the birthday girl fall out of her chair, followed by the guy next to her fall out of his chair. I doubt it was a furniture defect. They ordered the s'mores plate which included a tiny grill so you could make your own s'mores--- not so sure it's safe to serve that to drunk people. I was surprised though that the staff didn't kick out those two drunkies though... I also think the birthday girl puked because I saw them using a lot of paper towels to clean up the floor later.But how nice is the staff then if they don't even kick out people that drunk? I mean, sucks for them to have to put up with that shit, but that's how good their customer service is! I think they felt bad that we had to sit next to the drunkies, even though it was a good show, so they sent us some free shots. So nice of them. Love."

Oh and it's BYOB!!The chef/owner was a sweetheart.  She was so warm and friendly.  It started to rain while we had dinner and we took a cab to the restaurant so she offered to take us back to work.  WOW!I will definitely return.  The food was delicious and the service was great.  You also don't find too many home cooked Brazilian restaurants in Chicago."

mfk-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mfk-chicago-2,12/05/14 , 2 ," I love that MFK is so close to my apartment -- I'll become a regular here if they can maintain their quality.Some might call the 750-square-foot room cramped; I call it adorable. That said, you may need to seek another venue if what you want is a quiet evening or romantic date (unless your date is blessedly easygoing).I praise the kitchen for procuring such fresh Japanese sea bass for the ceviche, an especially -- and deliciously -- tart rendition set atop guacamole on three little squid ink tostadas. The ensemble of Belgian endive matchsticks, radicchio, quince segments, blue cheese and a showering of chopped pistachios is fantastic, but you have to enjoy bitter flavors to like this salad. Dollops of white bean purée serve as placeholders for tender pork and veal albóndigas, which, for a play on spaghetti and meatballs, should be ordered with the fideous (vermicelli) with asparagus and bell peppers in a spicy saffron sauce. The pasta, though tasty, is not anything special; I feel that serving it in a gratin dish with a crispy broiled top would improve it vastly and make its price of $12 a little more appropriate.Although also a bit overpriced (and crying out for some fresh or whipped cream), the crumbly, buttery Basque cake hits the spot and is the lone dessert offering,"
sushi-dokku-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-dokku-chicago,11/07/14 , 2 ," The only disappointment I have is that living just blocks away, I didn't try this spot sooner!  We started off with some tuna truffle thing...not very large size-wise but very tasty.  Then we moved on to some rolls and my favorite was the Godzilla.  Lovely presentation and lots of flavor.  Was a little bit pricey but definitely a good go-to sushi spot if you're looking for a nice night out."

We sat at the bar for well over 3 hours and thoroughly enjoyed our time! We started with both the salmon spring roll and the yellow fin tartare. The spring roll was super fresh and inventive - I favored this over the tuna. Next up was the brussel sprouts - HOLY HELL! You MUST get these. The preparation on them is so unique!! For our final round we had the cauliflower gratin and the steak - both were amazing. I could have licked the gratin plate clean. The crunch on the outside of the steak, and I usually don't eat steak, was seriously to die for. Roger our bartender took great care of us and Zoe (the chef) even stopped by to make sure we were enjoying everything. What a nice touch!I can NOT wait to go back to Ada street!!!!"

We came here for a super early lunch -- I'm talking 10AM --  almost a late 2nd breakfast. There was hardly anyone here and we got seated right away. That's a good thing, because I hear this place gets pretty packed around noon.We shared the pork belly gyro and the Cocido (mixed meat pot) for two. Both of these were very flavorful and unique from anything we ever had. The bread which they serve with the Cocido is so damn fresh and seems like they baked it in house, though I'm not sure about that part.The atmosphere was really casual and, best of all, not pretentious at all. The waitress was very friendly and efficient. The food was delicious and had a 'home cooked' feel to it.If you come here, be sure to check out the downstairs kitchen. You can see the chefs grinding up meat and preparing sausages from scratch. They're extremely friendly and willing to explain what they're doing. So awesome!"
ara-on-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ara-on-chicago-2,11/19/14 , 2 ," One of the best sushi places I've tried. We had dinner here on a Monday night and it was pretty empty. No reservations needed if you want to come a weeknight I presume. It's beautiful inside and I was excited to eat here.What we ordered:Drink:2010 Melipal, Malbec - $44 wine. Someone else at our table paid for this.....but it was some GOOD WINE!Appetizer:White Miso Soup - PERFECT to have because of the freezing weather outside.Sushi:ARA ON CHEF SPECIAL - The potato crisps on top is what makes this sushi roll good.OCTO SAKE - Lots of flavor!190 S. - My favorite out the three. The soy paper was a great alternative to the usual seaweed wrap.This was a restaurant we decided to try on the whim and wasn't on our 'to-do' list of places to eat while visiting Chicago, but I am so glad we came here!"

They were so tender and flavorful. The peanut sauce and cucumber salad had flavors bursting in my mouth. So delicious.Entree: lunch special chicken pad Thai. The most amazing pad Thai I've had in ages. Noodles were fresh and soft. Good amount of chicken in the dish too. Peanuts on the side, which I appreciated. Both dishes were presented aesthetically appealing to the eye.Atmosphere: nicely decorated. Very zen like design (which I appreciated). Bathrooms were very clean and have a modern look to them. The whole atmosphere was comfortable and appealing.Overall, a great experience. Enjoyed the food so much that I can't wait to go back."
tufanos-vernon-park-tap-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tufanos-vernon-park-tap-chicago,10/28/14 , 2 ," Meh, this place was just ok. I appreciate the charm. There is no sign for this place and it is pretty difficult to locate. Definitely trying to be a 'local gem.' However, the food wasn't all that great; just ok. The sausage and peppers were awesome as our appetizer, but my entree, the linguini and clams with white sauce, was too salty. I'm aware clams are salty by nature, but this was a bit overwhelming. I had to order extra Peroni beer to help me deal with it.Further, the service leaves you with something to be desired. They make you pay $5 for valet parking, or else you'll get a $70 parking ticket in the neighborhood's permited streets. Our server was absent throughout most of our meal. When I asked for a menu, she rolled her eyes and told me to look at the chalkboard. I didn't bring my glasses, so it was a pain in the ass for me to read across the room. Once we had ordered, getting the waitress's attention for more beer, extra olive oil, and the bill was nearly impossible. When we stood up and waved to get her attention, surprise surprise: another eye roll! Sorry I'm making you do your job...The place shuts down at 10:30 p.m. Yelp says 11 p.m. They might want to update their Yelp listing, because we began being shooed out and had no clue as to why. Lots of people often consult Yelp for these sorts of matters... I will most likely not return, as there are plenty of better Italian options in the enormous city of Chicago."

All on warm corn or flour tortillas just like mom used to make...if your mom was Mexican.It's not exactly the number one spot to dine in on account of it being a little dingy, but if you do decide to there's a patio outside and they have Chalula which is always a plus. If you're up for a cheap place to chase away what ails ya this is a pretty good choice."
papas-cache-sabroso-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/papas-cache-sabroso-chicago,06/20/14 , 1 ," So, this is how they do it in on the southern end of Humbolt Park? Small and quaint on the inside. If you can get a seat outside during the warmer days, who cares about the inside?But you will care about the food.I had the half chicken dinner with rice and frijoles. I admit that it was definitely good, but I have a feeling it was tempered. It's unfair to rate Puerto Rican food after you've been to Puerto Rico or even after you've had some Puerto Rican dishes in cities like New York City. The portions are large, so you can't complain about there not being too much.The restaurant has a constant flow of people coming in and out. That's an indication that they're doing something right. I'll have to check them out to see how they fare with their other menu offerings."

xoco-bistro-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/xoco-bistro-chicago,08/14/14 , 1 ," The Salud sign is finally gone! Opening night was suuuuper packed as expected. The two of us were quoted a 45 minute wait, but luckily found a spot at the bar, because after we sat down it turned into a 90 minute wait and I would have gotten hangry. Hangry Tiffany is not someone you'd want to cross paths with in a dark alley.The space definitely seats more hangry bodies than the River North location, and thankfully does not use the same bottleneck-causing wait-in-line ordering system -- it's just a good ole fashioned wait for the hostess to seat you, or first-come-first-serve at the bar, where the full menu is available. At the bar you'll see a line of pretty little taps all on a row. The first three are tequila/mezcal based cocktails like the Xoco margarita. The rest are beers on draft. I went with the 4 Rabbits Mango cuz it's 3% alcohol and I'm a cheap date.We started with the bacon fat caramel popcorn which needs no explanation. GET IT NOW. As well as the queso fundido which is full of queso and....fun.Other than the tortas, apps, and churros you'll find at Xoco One, the expanded menu adds a handful of caldos, which all sounded delicious, I'm sure you won't go wrong with any of them. BF chose the pork belly one and scarfed it down. Rick Bayless is a master of flavor, shown in all his sauces and soups. Fun fact, if you didn't already know, Bayless just lives up the street in Bucktown. His house has an amazing garden, which you can pay $20 to get a tour of (google it). Said garden provides many of the greens for his restaurants! Why hello arugula that I just saw on your garden!There are a handful of additional desserts as well. The peach blueberry parfait was a hit -- fresh fruit, coconut mousse, rum soaked sponge cake, lime zest!Service was a little slow but it was their first day. The staff knows the menu well and are very friendly.And guess WHAT they offer brunch on weekends, it's all my dreams come true!! I'll be the one at the bar scarfing down a plate of chilaquiles this Saturday, I will see you there or I will see you another time."
el-ideas-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-ideas-chicago-2,08/30/12 , 1 ," O.M.G. I've had my fair share of tasting menus / fine dining over the years but I must say the overall experience at El Ideas takes the cake. It was spectacular. The food was out of this world. Was it the best food or the most creative I've ever put in my mouth? Not quite.  But it was damn close. I'd say top 5 meals I've ever had. My husband took me here last Saturday to celebrate my birthday.Some of the highlights food wise:Purple salmon with beets and a Pinot Noir gelCanadian Poached cod with clamsBlack salted cod with homemade picklesBacon cured Sturgeon with shaved fat back (my fave of the evening)Duck pate with duck prosciuttoBison tartarTamarind chili sorbetRicotta gnocchi with chorizo Bolognese (my husbands favorite)NY strip steakOk that was almost all of it, so you get the idea. 14 courses of perfection.I think what really sets this place apart is the atmosphere. It was the exact opposite of pretentious. Totally informal and just so fun. The place is really small and you basically sit in the kitchen, which is great because you are encouraged to talk to the chefs and help them plate. There is only one seating per night, so the chefs prepare a course, serve to everyone at once, and explain it. They were all so funny, and when they explained the dishes it was the epitome of informal, swearing, saying how f'ing awesome the piece of fish is, etc. We loved it.Probably the coolest part was the music. They had a laptop set up and were playing music off iTunes. The selection ranged from remakes of Tom Petty classics to Ginuwine and Color Me Badd. Again, total perfection.Service was stellar. Everyone was so nice. The dinner flowed smoothly, we always had clean plates, full glasses, you name it, they excelled.El Ideas is BYO. Our biggest error in coming here is that we didn't bring enough booze. 2 bottles of red over a 4 hour dinner somehow just evaporates. The couple next to us brought a cooler complete with the recommended pairings: Champagne to start, followed by a white, then a red, and finished up with dessert wine.I can't wait to go back. But make no mistake, when I do, I will come with the 4 bottles of wine I clearly need."

taqueria-traspasada-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-traspasada-chicago-2,02/22/14 , 1 ," I was very underwhelmed by this place. I ordered the steak, pork skin, and beef brain (feeling adventurous at the time...). I wasn't impressed by the steak but the pork skin was packed with flavor. If you're into something fatty and hearty and aren't counting calories, I'd go for that option. The beef brain one was kind of gross. I'm all for trying new things but the consistency was rubbery and it was hard to shake the feeling that I was ingesting brain. But at least that's one more thing to check off my bucket list.Also, the owner or guy working the counter seemed a little pushy. I asked him for recommendations and he gave us a curt non-helpful answer... okay... won't make me like this place anymore. What's the rush really?Also, the prices seemed a little high for a hole-in-the-wall tacqueria dive place. I mean, I'd rather pay the $3 for a taco at the Big Star than pay $2.50 for a mediocre taco in my opinion."

Hello!My husband, friends and I spent a lovely Friday evening here recently. Our starters were good but split between 6 of us, I only had a little taste of each so not the best judge. My pasta stood out, however. Tagliatelle in bolognese sauce= excellent. Finished with the tiramisu which was some of the best I've ever had.  We probably overstayed our welcome while finishing our multiple bottles of wine, but you couldn't tell. I never felt rushed. Our server was patient and attentive. In the corner of this restaurant, I felt like we could have been dining in one of our own homes."
the-bristol-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bristol-chicago,11/14/14 , 1 ," Awesome experience at The Bristol on a Friday night with some girlfriends. We were easily able to make a reservation for 4 at the beginning of the week. Upon arrival, we were seated immediately in their upstairs area which is really cozy. We immediately loved the ambiance. Our waitress came over to take drink orders. We all started with different cocktails and loved them all. The Bristol's cocktail menu is inventive and unique, don't skip on these when you visit! The eustis was my fave.To start, we went with the monkey bread and duck fat fries. The Bristol's menu is designed so that you basically cannot skip these items, and you shouldn't. They were both incredibly tasty and easy to share among four. From there, we picked many plates to share, so we could try as many items as possible. The black pepper brisket was a standout, as were the kielbasa stuffed mushrooms. Although we didn't really know what the cardoon graintee was, we were pleasantly surprised with the thoughtful flavors and sauces going on in there. Additionally, we ordered the pasta with rabbit that was rich and delicious. The only main we sampled was the half chicken. I almost never order chicken out, but convinced my dining companions that Yelp had told me this was a 'must order.' It was really delicious. Super flavorful, there's a reason this item remains on their menu season after season.Of course four ladies were going to order dessert. After reading an article that Grant Achatz's favorite dessert was The Bristol's basque cake, we had to order it to see what the fuss was all about. We also went with a dessert that our waitress described as 'snickers on crack.' And that's what it was. It tasted exactly like a Snickers...on crack. Which was a lot of awesomeness. Price point is high, but you're paying for quality, thoughtful dishes. All of the ingredients are from family farms and full of intricacies. Overall, a lovely dinner. I highly recommend going with friends and sharing some plates."

I already knew it was going to be good since that's my moms name :)The space itself is cute and cozy. There were fellow church goers dressed up and quite a few families. The place was packed and as a walk in we had a 20 to 30 minute wait. This isn't the type of place you go when your in a hurry. When we sat down we were given the best biscuits I have ever had. They were warm, buttery, and pretty much melt in your mouth. That had to have been my favorite part of brunch.The service here was also good. For brunch I ordered Pearl's omelet which came with a side of hashbrowns and pancakes. The food in my opinion was just okay, but for the price point it was excellent. I would go back just for the biscuit, but plan on visiting again to try other items on the menu. They also have a buffet special and desserts i would like to try."

There's also room to grow, and anointing five stars to a restaurant that has yet to hit its ceiling seems premature.After overwhelming demand, Parachute switched to a limited reservations policy, which is how I was able to actually snag a date night here (with a kid in hand, casual trendy no res places, as awesome as they can be, are somewhat a challenge). Even with the reservation time and early arrival, we were seated roughly 20 minutes late. Aside from the minor speed bump, service was impeccable. We had a fantastic waiter and amicable hostesses.Parachute is located on a grungy street in Avondale with nothing, and I mean bupkis, around it. I imagine it's how Logan Square looked five years ago. The upside is free, and plentiful, parking. The galley-style restaurant would not be out of place in East Village, with its open kitchen view and stylish decor. Predictably, lighting is dim.The menu is best described as Korean with a twist. The menu, both in composition and taste, reminded me of Chris Shepherd's masterpiece in Houston, Underbelly. Kim and Clark stay faithful to the Chicagoan's love of salt as a spice, but add a heavy dose of Korean influence, both salty and spicy.I started with the 'Number 1', a mescal-based cocktail, while the wife opted for a housemade lemonade. For small plates, we went with the the market oysters and bing bread. The oysters were a mite small, but tasty and fresh, and the soju granita was refreshingly good. The bing bread, as evidenced on Yelp, is one of Parachute's calling cards. It was the best thing we ate all evening, with a crispy exterior and a soft, plushy interior that melted in our mouths. Asians tend to be big fans of the pork-scallion-bread combination, and this was no exception.Our first main was the other house specialty, a pork belly and mung bean pancake. It's completely bold and in your face. Mung bean tends to be a muted ingredient in Asian cooking, complemented by other goodies. In this case, the kimchi and black garlic sauce combination gave the dish an unbelievable tangy taste that subsided through the bites. That became a common theme in Parachute's dishes: the last bite is better than the first.Once you get over the overwhelming taste palette, your tongue settles down and enjoys the flavor harmony. But there's a hump to get over, particularly if you're not a fan of Asian cooking. Our next dish was the dolsot bi bim bop. I'm a huge tripe fan, and actually found the dish's barbecued tripe to mute the inherent texture of the meat too much. Also, paying $17 for bi bim bap goes against the parsimonious Asian bones in my body. However, I do consider this a great dish to share, and an easy way to get people to try tripe. Plus, charred rice. Absolutely delicious and one of my favorite things on earth.We ended with the hot pot, just a whale of a dish. Upon ordering, our waiter strongly advised we cut one, if not two, dishes from our order. We wisely complied and wished him thanks after. This thing is big enough to feed a small army. Unlike the other dishes, which start salty and mellow out over time, the hot pot starts light but amps up in flavor as the broth settles in. The bone marrow plus crab combination is unfairly tasty. If it weren't for my wife's utter love and devotion to all things hot pot, this beast would be size and cost prohibitive. Give it to a table of six, though...To wrap up, there were bites of each dish that I absolutely loved, and others that made me question the flavor profile thrown together. To the extent that Parachute can iron out the latter without compromising the former would elevate it from good to great. Also, get the bread. Back to the Underbelly analogy: it may hurt to pay for bread, but it's so, so good. Worth every bite."
la-cantina-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-cantina-grill-chicago,10/27/14 , 2 , I went here a couple times with my friends and I like the food here and the drinks. I get the 3 steak taco special without the beans. The guacamole is really good to The service is good and the waitstaff is attentive in making sure our needs are met. I have yet to try some other dishes. The restaurant is not that big so fitting a big crowd would be tough but a small crowd it's great. You can come here any time for a date night or nah occasion. This is in the heart of the south loop neighborhood and not that far from where I work at and my coworker get carry out from time to time.
hing-kee-restaurant-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hing-kee-restaurant-chicago-2,09/16/14 , 1 ," Okay, being from Cleveland my options for soup dumplings is zero. ZILCH. NADA. NOOOOOOO OPTIONS!! So of course when I go to a bigger city that has a wider variety of Asian cuisine options, I go crazy. It's all good to me, even if in reality they may not be that good or the best I've ever had. So, yes. I am saying the soup dumplings here perfectly satisfied my constant soup dumpling craving.p.s. I also tried a noodle soup bowl, which I was told they are known for. I was not into it at all."
bite-café-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bite-caf%C3%A9-chicago-2,03/27/14 , 2 ," Simply put, this is no ordinary pub/cafe/restaurant. The first time I ate there, I had dinner. They have great mussels and potatoes. I can't remember what I had the first time, but it was so delicious I chose this restaurant for my birthday dinner last year.The braised pork belly was perfectly cooked and tasty. The duck confit was delicious. What makes their entrees so great is that they prepare the dishes well, choose quality greens and starches to go along, and tie it all together with thoughtful sauce and flavor combinations. The menu is New American with different specials like risottos and braised meats.Another time I came back for brunch and was happy I did. The Challah bread french toast was a good start and big enough to share. The pork hash was filling and so yummy. The right amount of spicy Hollandaise and tender pork shoulder paired well with the roasted and slightly sweet butternut squash. I can't wait to go back and try the other dishes.The service has always been good and though the space is a little small, the decor and atmosphere make it feel warm and cozy. Even when it was busy for dinner, I thought the service was friendly, quick, and helpful with suggestions and answering questions about the menu. I highly recommend trying this restaurant if you are looking for a place for quality New American food executed well--oh, the prices are cheap compared to other restaurants of this class."
cafe-bionda-chicago-6,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-bionda-chicago-6,05/23/14 , 2 ," First impressions are lasting...Reservations were under my friend's name. I arrived first and was greeted by the hostess who clearly doesn't love her job and has a nasty attitude, 'Ummm, I don't see a reservation for so-and-so. I have one for Amy, John, Renee.' My straight faced response said to her, 'That's not the name I said so what purpose does it serve to rattle off everyone else's name?' She just looked at me, no word on whether they were too busy to accommodate a party of two, no apology for the mix up, nada. THEN she walked away. WTH! Another party of two walks in, she comes back to the stand, asks if they are walk-ins, grabs two menus and is about to seat them! Hold the heck up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm honestly on my best behavior so I keep calm but step up like 'Hi there, remember me, party of two, missing reservation, you weren't just about to seat those two walk-ins ahead of me were you?' The manager is standing there at this point, like no, we'll take care of you. The hostess trying to save face was like 'of course I was going to seat you first, you were here first.' Don't try to be cute now... I couldn't keep quiet and said, in front of her manager, still in a calm tone tho ;-) 'oh really, because you just motioned to them without even acknowledging me and the reservation mix up. But thanks for tending to me first, I appreciate it.' And there were MAD tables in the back. Unnecessary delays and rudeness. Sheesh.She seats me in a corner, I move to the middle. No mention of who my server will be, no enjoy your meal, nada. If my friend hadn't picked this place I would have left. Not to mention she was late so I had no motivation to give this restaurant a shot at this point.Guy was the name of our server (spelled differently but I can't remember how). He seemed a little awkward in the beginning... like he interrupted our conversation a couple of times to see if we were ready or wanted this or that. That's not a bad thing of course because he was attentive, but his approach was bit off-kilter. The turnaround. He provided good input on the menu and made suggestions on some of the tweaks I wanted. I ordered the Rigatoni Alla Vodka and added spicy crumbled sausage. Best decision ever and I thank Guy for co-signing on my choice! The food was FANTASTIC. It came in such a large portion and it did not disappoint. I enjoyed my leftovers equally as much the next day! My friend ordered the whole chicken... yup... a WHOLE chicken. The presentation was kind of like whoa... messy in a way. They literally split the chicken in half and spread it on a large oval plate. I tasted it though and it was very tender and flavorful.Bottom line: I would absolutely ORDER OUT from here again. The food was yummy!! I would be very reluctant, however, to dine in again. A friend suggested eating at the bar instead... perhaps that would help with the restaurant experience.Tip: You get a sizable portion of bread and tomato marinara sauce when you're seated... save some bread to dip in your pasta!!!Tip: There's a parking lot in the back. Who knew??"
old-jerusalem-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/old-jerusalem-chicago,04/28/13 , 2 , $7 for q shawerma that was chocked FULL of meat. I have rarely encountered such a problem where I've been wishing I had more tatziki. They cut no corners and the shawerma came in a fully enclosed pita pocket that was fresh so none of the mess encountered when some ppl give you just a wrap. House made hot sauce. Super flavorful tabbouleh.Really impressed here. Humble mom and pop. Good for price point.
52eighty-rooftop-lounge-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/52eighty-rooftop-lounge-chicago,07/07/14 , 2 ," You can probably count the number of perfect weather days we get in a Chicago summer on your fingers and toes. Well...with one of those days I totally recommend a visit to this rooftop.It's chic, has great views, comfy furniture, and an outdoor TV. Pair these features with some really tasty upscale bar snacks and you've got yourself a pretty fantastic Sunday evening out if it's not raining. And if it is you can bring the experience inside and sit at the bar which is under shelter.The food menu flaunts unique flavors including some awesome scallops, ceviche, and a foie gras peanut butter and jelly sandwich (yes, you read correct) that'll knock your socks off. The cocktail menu is small, but clever with some interesting spins on their bubbles.It's a bit pricey, but you can chalk it up as being an altitude tax. After all...everything is a little bit better at 29 floors up."
yan-bang-cai-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yan-bang-cai-chicago,11/30/13 , 1 ," Extremely authentic Si Chuan style restaurant. This small ma and pa shop reminds me of the local places I visited while living in China for several years during the 90's. Not only was it great cooking but wonderful service with a smile that you don't find in Chinatown.Highly recommended, give it a try and check out some of the unique things offered on the menu."
la-palapa-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-palapa-chicago,10/25/12 , 1 ," I had wanted to try this place for the longest.I was there on Tuesday with a friend. It was a gloomy, rainy day and me being like cold blooded animal depend on the sun to be happy. Driving by, I tell my friend that we should stop and eat there. I was hoping that the beach atmosphere with the umbrellas and the beach like restaurant would do the trick.We get and the parking lot is a little odd, with only a few spaces. We were lucky to find parking right in front of the restaurant.We get in and are greeted immediately. Find a table and check out the menu. I was hoping they would have piña rellena but they didn't so. We ordered empandas de camaron as app. I had the filete relleno and my friend ordered the langostinos.I have been to many Mexican sea food restaurants and some go really crazy with the seasoning. It is seafood, and the seasoning is to complement the natural flavor of the main ingredient, not to kill it and overpower it to the point that you don't even taste the sea food.We get the empanadas and they were so good. Crispy on the outside and so flavorful and moist on the inside. They come with a chipotle mayo that was too sweet for my taste. But they also have some killer habanero salsa on the table that went perfectly with the empananas.Did I mention that they give you complementary ceviche?? They do and it was good.After a little bit they came with the entrees. I was a little worried that my food was going to be over-seasoned. Oh great surprise that food was perfect. I could palate the distinctive flavors of the fish, shrimp and crab. All very rich in flavor with tomatoes, cilanto and onion, mouth watering.  All accompanied by salad (Mexican restaurants have a funny concept of salad: lettuce, tomato and onion, LOL), fries and rice. The rice was the best of the 3 sides.I had a chance to try the langostinos and they were perfectly seasoned and flavorful.I can't wait to go back on a hot day, bring some beers and imagine that I'm on a Mexican beach.The service is nice and attentivePrice wise, it is not cheap, but no sea food place is so..La Palapa. good food, good service and BYOB"
freestyle-food-and-drink-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/freestyle-food-and-drink-chicago-4,09/20/13 , 1 ," I have been here a few times this summer most of the time just to chill out after work meet people I know or just to hang out.This place was Aja a while back and now it is FreeStyle which is an interesting name.The best time to come here is on Wednesday,Thursday, Friday after 5:30 PM. During that time one can experience the happy hour they have which lasts till7PM. The Dana Sliders are good. If you are not a big spicy food fan you may want to take note that it does come with Jalapeno's and so you can ask themto take it out so you dont erupt in a ball of fire on the corner os State and Erie.They have a few types of sushi that are pretty good and that are musts for happy hour.The citrus salmon sushi that has that sweet and sour kick to it that feels just right.And the 2nd would be the Hamachi roll with cucumber,  asparagus  and something called Yuzu sauce on top that makes it have that extra kick when it is in your mouth.I thought it tasted like a a lime flavor which makes it quite interesting because Yuzu is not a lime at all.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu…While on my last visit I was double fisting water and diet coke and that I am not a huge drinker, the drinks here are pretty good.People like the martinis here. The outdoor seating area is a huge asset to this place.They have a reisling from California here for $7And I have enjoyed  the Raspberry Caipirinha which was $11. It also has a lime flavor in it which makes it taste quite good and refreshing on a hot day.The food is relatively inexepensive happy hour or no happy hour."
half-shell-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/half-shell-chicago,09/02/14 , 2 ," If you don't want to spend an arm and a leg for seafood, this is your place.It's a little restaurant that you have to walk down a few steps to get to - like a basement.  The atmosphere is divey, very casual customers and a few tables and bar seating.  It fills up quickly.CASH ONLY - the owner uses this really old school cash register (the thing is seriously ancient).  It's a no frills kind of place to just get your seafood fix and hang out - try their crab cakes and oysters!"
epic-burger-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/epic-burger-chicago,10/01/14 , 2 ," I do appreciate the concept, but find Epic burger overrated (and overpriced) for a burger.  My burger was overcooked, almost rubbery, and had no flavor. I came for the halal burgers, and despite halal offerings in the Loop not being very plentiful, I do think better tasting and cheaper options are available. The milkshakes though (I got a PB-Chocolate Malt) were really good!I'm not sure if I just got a bad burger, but I'm not too keen on returning any time soon."
pizzeria-del-mercato-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-del-mercato-chicago,08/26/13 , 2 ," Whenever I hear of a near place with a WFO (wood fired oven) I admit I get a bit excited. Unfortunately, my excitement and decision to walk here from work to grab a quick bite with a coworker turned out to be a bust.First off, it's snugly within the West Loop neighborhood a few blocks west of all the trendy restaurants in the meat packing district. Decor is nice, but there is something weird with the booth seating. Just felt kind of weird... not comfortable, but not uncomfortable.Service was good with refilling the water... Only problem is that it took quite a while for food to come out. A good WFO should kick out a pizza in at most like 5 minutes IF there is very little heat and also depending on the type of pizza you're cooking. With Pizzeria Del Mercato the type looked to be classic Neapolitan which really should only be in the oven anywhere from 45-120 seconds. Counting all the people there before me (and didn't order) there were roughly 6 people. For a really slow lunch the pizzas should have been knocked out in at most 4 minutes per pizza. I noticed the fornino (oven person) tending the oven quite a bit (maybe it wasn't up to temp?), but not a lot of pizzas being put in. So yeah... bad going if you're trying to cater to a lunch crowd and especially if waits increase for dinner.The pizza itself is what disappoints me the most. It looked gorgeous, but the crust lacked a puffyness from good rise and fermentation. There was also quite a bit of crust.. I learned that the mozzerella is made fresh in house and I can say I enjoyed that part, but the sausage on my pizza was a bit dry. Back to the crust, it felt like either the dough was overworked or didn't have enough time to rest before use. Either way, the result is a flatter crust with more chew. The last part I would like to touch on is the charring of the pizza. It was actually a bit too blond. I didn't see any classic leoparding on the bottom of the pizza that is a good indication of a hot floor temp in a WFO and not much color on top. I saw the fornino dome my pizza where they lift the pizza up close to the dome of the oven where it's the hottest... it's essentially like putting the pizza under a broiler. I didn't think it was domed long enough though.Will I be back? Possibly... Right now they still need to work out the kinks."
bistrot-zinc-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bistrot-zinc-chicago,02/15/14 , 2 , Went for Valentine's day. Good thing we made reservations because it was very full.Escargot (7/10): I've had better escargot in other French restaurants. Cooked well but overloaded with garlic.Lyonnaise salad (7/10): Missing a acidic element. Need more citrus. Greens were too bitter.Puff pastry with chicken stew (9.5/10): Dish of the night! Too much puff pastry and mashed potatoes overwhelmed the stew. Almost perfect!Braised beef short ribs (6/10): Sauce was too salty and the short ribs weren't fall apart yet. Needed more cooking time.Chocolate mousse (7/10): A bit too over whipped. It affected the texture. Also the chocolate had a very bitter and sour aftertaste.Service (7/10): Our waiter was slow to come back to our table. Just an inconvenience when we wanted to order and such.
south-kawa-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/south-kawa-chicago,09/08/12 , 1 ," I'll never eat here again.  Our server was so rude that she completely ruined our dinner experience.First off, this place is BYOB so my husband brought some quality German beer.  Our server gave us a PLASTIC cup.  Seated right next to us were rows and rows of nice wine glasses, and she gives us a plastic cup?! WTF? When he asked if he could have a wine glass instead, the server looked annoyed and said they're not supposed to give wine glasses to those who bring in beer.  However, after we insisted on a wine glass, she begrudgingly let us have one and said she'd inform the manager.For those who don't know, SK has a $25 AYCE sushi special all day, everyday.  Our server initially informed us that we have to eat every piece of fish or else they charge $1 for every piece of sushi not consumed.  No problem, that's how it usually is in most AYCE sushi places.My husband and I can eat A LOT of sushi, and we were both starving.  We initially ordered 6 rolls and a handful of nigiri.  When the server came to get our order, she told us that 6 rolls was too much and she was crossing off two of them to start with. Um, okay... shouldn't that be for us to decide? Whatever.  Anyways, we got our rolls and nigiri and finished EVERYTHING, except for some of the rice from the nigiri.  I feel that many of the nigiri pieces we ordered had too much rice, so I pushed about a third of each piece aside.When the server came back, she explained that she should charge us for the rice we didn't finish, but she was going to let it slide this time.  I stated she told us that they charge for each piece of FISH we didn't finish, NOT rice.  She said that nigiri rice is special, and that if we ordered a second round, she would charge us for not finishing the rice as well.  Again, WTF?Although we probably could have eaten another roll and a couple more nigiri, we were so turned off by service at that point that we just wanted to leave.  In addition, the quality of sushi seems to have gone down since the last time I came here, or maybe I just didn't enjoy it as much because of the rude service.  Anyways, sad to say, but I'm never coming back here.  I'll just go to Hing Kee in Chinatown when I want my cheap sushi fix."
mak-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mak-restaurant-chicago,09/29/14 , 2 ," MAK is great for when you're craving basic Chinese food in large quantities but still want to keep it healthy. I ordered the MAK chicken bowl. I wanted some tofu too, and the guy at the counter was kind enough to let me do 1/2 chicken and 1/2 tofu.Pros: VERY generous portion (I could've made it into 2 meals if lunch wasn't my first meal of the day when I dined here). Brown rice is an option. So is quinoa!Cons: If you want more than 1 veggie side for your bowl, it's an extra $4. Sad face. That's definitely way too much for such a small amount of veggies. I could buy at least a pound of (organic) veggies with four dollars. When I was close to finishing my bowl, there was at least 1/3 an inch of sauce at the bottom of the bowl. I know it probably came from the veggies and tofu, but eating stir fry rice isn't so fun when it gets soupy.The chork is an interesting concept. I reverted to a spoon and chopsticks after 30 seconds, though."
turbo-tacos-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/turbo-tacos-chicago,09/29/14 , 1 ," I stopped into this place on a whim prior to heading into a show across the street at the Concord.  Dangerous move, getting Mexican right before heading into an hours-long event at an enclosed venue with no re-entry.  But wound up having zero regrets!The Chorizo Tacos were so good that I had dreams about them during my booze-soaked slumber that night.  Couldn't stop thinking about Turbo Tacos so I went back the next day and ordered a Chorizo Torta.  Also a top-notch piece of cuisine.  Some of the tastiest chorizo I've ever eaten.My friends all enjoyed their meals as well.  And the staff were super friendly and lightning fast with the service.  Price point is extremely respectable as well, helping to earn that all-important 5th star.Not sure when the next time I will ever be in the area is.  But if I don't have time or $$$ to go to Wasabi instead (ultimate Ramen house across the street), I will definitely hit up Turbo Tacos again!"
han-202-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/han-202-chicago,11/11/09 , 1 ," Even this shellfish-shy guy loved this place! Yes, I'm hesitant on creatures from Under the Sea who wear a shell, but with some playful ribbing and understanding from my dinner partner, Han 202 and I got along just fine!The place is sleek and sexy, slightly modern with warm touches like colorful pillows and muted lighting and paintings. Perfect for a date with your Current Crush, or catching up with a small group. It's BYOB, and the waitstaff will kindly chill your bottles if needed, while you eat.You know the drill by now: Five courses, $20.Soup-Fresh Vegetables- veggie stock base with sliced zucchini, tomato, carrot, tofu was satisfyingSalad-My Beef with Lemongrass and Green Apple salad was excellent. The beef was so tender and I loved the marinade.My partner's Cucumber Crab Meat Salad was cool and refreshing! See, I'm coming around to shellfish!Appetizer-Uh oh...Shrimp all over the place! For the shrimp lover, there's 5-6 shrimp options.I chose King Crab Rangoon, which could have been served on the dessert course! Two big triangles of deep fried, creamy crab rangoon, with a sweet drizzle, dare I say slightly chocolaty? Yum, incredible!The Seared Scallop was like eating a steak for seafood lovers. Served with a pat of sprouts, with a plum reduction sauce, it was also excellent.Entree-I got the Monk Fish with Black Bean Sauce, while very good, was the dish most like something experienced at lesser Chinese restaurants. My dining partner's Spicy Red Snapper served on the bone, was surprisingly good and had just the perfect amount of jalapeno spice to it.The current dessert was vanilla ice cream with lychee fruit and did not disappoint. Service was top notch all night. We weren't rushed to finish our courses, and enjoyed a leisurely fun night at Han 202."
cafe-orient-33-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-orient-33-chicago,09/19/14 , 2 ," There's no excuse for not giving Cafe Orient five (5) stars.  I will break it down for you why that is:1) no need to tip: it says on their website.  Seriously, there's no chance to leave any tip; there's no line to write down the amount of tip on the merchant copy.2) service is outstanding: did I say that you don't tip in this place?  Yeah, but the service exists.  It may be slow because the person who took your order will be the very same person who serves you.  You can help yourself with water and tea on the condiment table.3) the people are SO nice: it was the husband today, but the wife is so also cool.  My hubby did the takeout orders with them twice before.4) free wifi that actually works: the password was underneath the cash register, so pull out your I-pad and start yelping while you eat.5) delicious home-style Korean food: don't expect anything fancy, but the stuff they cooked comes from their love for customers.  yummy that is.  I usually stick with the dumpling rice-cake soup combo.  By the way, if you have any question, don't be shy to ask because the owners always patiently answer any question you have.6) ask more rice if you want!7) there's a plenty of magazines for you to peruse.8) the entire place is very clean.9) cheap: the entire bill came to under $15 for two (2) meal combo and one (1) can of melon milkis.10) the ambiance is relaxing and comfortable.P.S. They did politely to ask you to put away your dishes and trays.  Do so since you didn't tip.Well-deserved five (5) stars.  If you live in Albany Park, you should try it out.  I wouldn't recommend you to go out your way to come here because it's meant to be a neighborhood restaurant that exists for your convenience.  They now serve home-made bubble teas."

davanti-enoteca-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/davanti-enoteca-chicago-3,11/08/14 , 2 ," Love this place! Large variety of charcuterie, cheeses and wine. The space is cozy and casual, yet good for a date or dinner with friends.The food was pretty tasty, meant for sharing but portion sizes were decent and very reasonable prices, I'll say 2 per person should be more than enough.Everything I tried, the charcuterie, the cheese, the bruschetta with bacon jam and pear mostarda, prosciutto pizza and chicken liver pate were really good! Must items I would recommend the honey comb focaccia, the warm kale salad, the cacio e pepe and the crunchy torta bacio for dessert, simply amazing!As far as the service, it left much to be desired, it's a bit slow, hard to get a hold of the server and to get your check when you are trying to leave.Still food, ambience and prices were pretty solid to give it only 3 stars. I'll be back."
rajun-cajun-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rajun-cajun-chicago,12/01/13 , 2 ," Comfort food at affordable prices? Come at me yo!But seriously, their dinner plates (meat+vegetable dish+samosa and wrap) can even make the poorest college students happy. A crap ton of food for like $10? I only wish I found you earlier.Anyways, their butter chicken is made fresh, so get that. Their tandoori chicken is extremely flavorful, and despite it looking like it's been sitting stale for a while, it was surprisingly tender. You can't go wrong with any of the vegetable dishes, but the eggplant one was my favorite.Oh, and their samosa was among the best I've had, with a perfect breading to filling ratio.Oh, and they've got mango lassi.One last thing though, there's not really any 'Cajun' on the menu. They pretty much had fried chicken and labeled that as Cajun. I didn't have an issue with this, but just beware, in case you were expecting Jambalaya or something."
real-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/real-kitchen-chicago,01/17/14 , 2 ," We went the takeout route, and I'm completely sold by the concept. Three of us were tired, hungry and devoured the carrot ginger soup - a little kick, brimming with lots of flavor, aromatic and absolutely delish. After that, shared the most decadent yet fluffy mushroom artichoke lasagna, gratin mushroom potatoes, and beef short ribs so tender you could cut the large portion with a fork, and accompanied with the best mashed potatoes we've ever had. It was nice to relax at home and not have to go out into the cold until the next day. We were satisfied yet stuffed and there were enough leftovers for a lunch for 1. For all of $37.00, which included two San Pelligrino grapefruits and a warm, delicious baguette, Real Kitchen is a steal. I'm sold!"
balena-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/balena-chicago,08/25/14 , 2 ," I've been wanting to come to Balena for awhile and was finally able to go there for one of my 6 birthday dinners.Location - 5 starsBalena is located a short walk from the North/Clybourn red line stop so it's definitely easy to get to (no need to drive and worry about parking or pay for valet).Cocktails - 3 starsI went to order a Tanqueray and Tonic while I waited for the rest of my friends to arrive and thought I had walked into the land of What The HELL Did You Say, when I was told that they didn't have Tanqueray. I settled for a Ketel One and Sprite, which was good and strong, but didn't make up for the fact that they didn't have the one gin that I like.Food - 4 starsThe food was so good and I can definitely see why people rave about this place. The Fennel Sausage Pizza and Mushroom Pizza are must tries!Service - 2 starsOur waitress had an attitude that made me think she was from Lake Forest and being forced to work here by her parents for the summer. The fact that she failed to bring me my birthday dessert, but made sure 2 people sitting in my section got their birthday dessert definitely didn't endear me to her.Balena would have received 4 stars from me, but the crappy service knocked them down to 3 stars. I'll be back to try more dishes, but hopefully, I'll receive better service."
joy-yees-noodle-shop-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joy-yees-noodle-shop-chicago-2,12/19/12 , 2 ," Restaurant ReviewA Joy Yee lifer! Simply put I enjoy the vast menu offered by Joy Yee with the large portions that usually leave enough for two meals. Although not everything is 'amazing' You can't go wrong with the stone bowel rice and noodles. I would have to recommend thai basil fried rice, stone bowel rice, and udon on a cold winter night. The main attraction always for me is the mango fruit freeze with tapioca balls. Nothing beats a fresh fruit smoothie where they don't just mix up powder for your smoothies. All and all if you want inexpensive chinese food of good quality Joy Yee is the placed to go.Pro- Very large pan asian menu, overall prices are respectableCon- Limited delivery area, not all items are delicious but always hard to tellHidden deal- 10% discount for UIC students if you show your icard"
ceviche-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ceviche-chicago-3,12/30/14 , 1 ," This is place is the sister restaurant of 'Ay Ay Picante' on Elston in the Albany Park neighborhood.  Currently, they share the identical menu items as you would see when dining at Ay Ay Picante.Hubby and I visited Ay Ay Picante on the Christmas Day, by accident, and had a great impression on the restaurant and menu items they offer.  We both tried different seafood dishes this time: arroz con mariscos and picante de mariscos.We received a good service from the young man at the restaurant and generously rendered us some fresh bread with that 'legendary' green sauce.  Yes, that green sauce is merely amazing.  It's creamy, garlicky, and delicious!As I mentioned on my Ay Ay Picante review, their portions are large enough to take home.  A typical seafood entree runs in between $16 to $20. I know it's somewhat pricy, but purchasing a groupon will certainly help with the cost.  The 'Ceviche' restaurant in Logan Square offers a groupon deal as well;  it was $16 for $30 worth of food and beverage purchases.  The balance came to $7.15 after the groupon, before tax and tips.  Yes, this is how we 'do' (incorrect grammar, but I'm just trying to be cool and modern).If you like any kind of seafood and like it done with a bold flavor, I will totally recommend Ceviche and Ay Ay Picante."
tio-luis-tacos-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tio-luis-tacos-chicago,04/04/12 , 2 ," I'll maybe go with 2.5 stars. Recently came with my friend for lunch. We ended up ordering nacho without beans, my friend ordered a breaded beef lunch special that was suppose to come with fries and I ordered the 3 tacos special with no beans. So, they basically ended up screwing up all 3 of our items. First, the nachos came with beans which were underneath and they basically stuck all the chips in them. My friends was suppose to come with fries (main reason she ordered the dish...I know she crazy, but they gave her beans and a salad. They ended up giving her fries when she asked. My plate ended up coming with beans when I specified no beans (if you read my other posts, you would know I don't LIKE beans.)  Tacos were just meh.We felt the waitresses were rushing us even though it wasn't busy and language was not a problem. Maybe they need to start writing down the orders.Irked my friend a bit when she got the check and they charged her $1.95 for the fries. Let's just say for the price they charge, they damn need to put more than what they gave.Sorry to say, they don't seem to be as good to me anymore. Maybe if I return, I'll get the steak burrito and just get carry out."
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,05/04/12 , 2 ," PLEASE NOTE, I DON'T INFLATE MY RATINGS!Alright fellow Yelpers...Olive Mediterranean Grill is not a bad place.  It is not extraordinary, it isn't awful.  I am comparing this place to other restaurants who serve similar Middle Eastern cuisine.Their chicken and beef is marinated nicely, it really isn't bad.  It's flavorful.  I just found the entire sandwich relatively bland.  The hummus isn't all that great, I'm sorry to say.  While hummus, by definition is impossible to screw up, it's not hard to make hummus fantastic or incredible. No effort.Their pita bread is alright, just alright.Their pricing is excessive for what you get and for the quality of the food.  A middle-eastern food chain is a good idea, when the competition moves in, OMG (Olive Mediterranean Grill) might step it up.I can think of other places to go in the city that are better in quality, and price.Try Sultan's Market in Bucktown."
white-palace-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/white-palace-grill-chicago,11/10/14 , 2 ," My mother used to read me a picture book called 'The Little House' when I was a tot. It's about a house in the country that, over time, gets surrounded by a city. But when it was built, the owner declared that it could never be sold, even for gold. (You can hear someone else's mom read it here:youtu.be/YqlOJKt4-RA.)This is my impression of White Palace. It's been there forever, and whoever owns it gets a big tip of my sombrero for not selling out. Moxie is worth an extra star. It's one of the few independent businesses in the area, after being surrounded by every chain store that you ever find in the suburbs (can you say Marshall's, DSW, Michael's, Best Buy, Home Depot, Bed Bath Beyond, Staples, Nordstrom Rack, whew, I've gotta stop... Though I'm giving you a pass, you over-priced gem of a goody-two-shoes health nerd, Whole Foods!). And it's a classic diner with consistently tasty, value-priced large portions, especially good for breakfast. (And the perfect antidote to a trip to Whole Foods, I might offer.)I've been coming here since I moved into the neighborhood more than ten years ago. In fact, I used to phone ahead for comfort food takeout on the way from a god-awful job in the north suburbs. I NEEDED that open-faced roast beef sandwich on white bread with mashed potatoes and a lot of gravy as a mommy replacement to soothe my nerves. In fact, one night the counter guy had accidentally made a strawberry milkshake. Did I want it? Hell yeah! And that's exactly how it tasted. Hell yeah!On a Saturday afternoon at around 2 or 3, I sat at the counter and the waitress offered me the Sun Times, the perfect read for the occasion. I had the skillet with corned beef--long, sandwich-style strips of corned beef, rather than the little cubes of beef and potatoes, which I also appreciate, but this had those crispy hash browns that I can't get enough of. Yum. A good afternoon was had by all.I only hope that this place doesn't end up like The Little House in the picture book, whose owner's granddaughter finds it in disrepair in the middle of the city and moves it out to the country. I love this place, but not enough to move out of the city to partake in its haute cuisine."

We wandered in a couple hours before catching our flight home and boy were we pleasantly surprised! We asked to purchase a t-shirt as a souvenir only to be told they didn't have any at that time but... 'would you like to go down to the speak easy?' ummmm hell yes, we would!We ordered a couple beers while they 'got the key' and then the fun began! A private tour and awesome experience below the building to where this speakeasy was found.Great bar that I'll surely return to!FUN FACT: the only all wooden building in Chicago since the fire code ordinance."
turquoise-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/turquoise-restaurant-chicago,07/06/14 , 2 ," Arriving well before sunset, I sat outside to enjoy the nice weather. Warm bread and a spread of eggplant, red peppers, and olive oil came to the table. Turquoise Café has a neon sign in the window that says, WE BAKE OUR OWN BREAD. They do a superb job and the light smokiness of the spread was a nice start. Where I knew the dining experience was going to be top was with the diver sea scallops served with lettuce leaves shaped to hold mini tomato salads and situated atop dollops of creamed avocado wasabi. I have had tender scallops at numerous restaurants. However, cutting through the scallops at Turquoise Café was like slicing through a cloud. You would not think something so cloud-like would burst with flavour either, the way those seasoned scallops tasted. My next starter was a bowl of creamy lentil soup. If I sound like a broken record when I say that Middle Eastern and Mediterranean restaurants serve the best lentil soup, I apologize, but anyone who slurps a bowl of the lentil soup will corroborate my statement.For the main dish, I ordered lamb chops over a medley of vegetables consisting of potatoes, brussel sprouts, broccoli, mushrooms, and asparagus tips. Greeks are not the only ones to prepare lamb worthy of wanting a second dish and Turquoise Café produces a plate of tender lamb even when it has been requested to be cooked well. After delighting myself completely with the succulent chops, I told the server that I would have dessert and coffee, but required some time to pause. When the wait was over, I had kazandibi with Turkish coffee. Leave baklava for the non-adventurers. The creamy custard of the kazandibi topped with a light caramelized sugar crust and further topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and then garnished with berries is a 'must' dessert option."

I love the fluffy moist egg white (up charge $1.50 for egg whites only) omelets here!!! They were out of mushrooms so we were allowed to request a substitute vegetable. Found out that Windy City Cafe has over 30 kinds of bread, including marble rye and multigrain, you can choose for your toast! No up charge for tomato slices or a 1/2 cup of fresh fruit instead of potatoes with your eggs!! Love this.The husband's omelet was soft without brown edges anywhere, just the way he likes it!  I love not listening to, 'No one can properly cook eggs anymore! The test of a good chef is how well the eggs are cooked.' while trying to enjoy my meal!Lovely and on a tropical Chicago Monday afternoon.Now, that's how I like it!!!!"
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,09/19/10 , 1 ," If you're not from the city manage your expectations here.  This is an inner city experience.  The cast of characters you'll encounter here will certainly be interesting and may be frightening.Cash only my friends.  Take out only.  Don't even think about eating in here.  No delivery.  Everything is fried and the breading is extra thick.  Some people think it's too thick.  The place is a dump but clean.  Its located in a scary lonely street at night but there are probably a couple of police officers inside getting a pound of jumbo to go.  A real bare bones place but the food is great.  If I'm not that hungry I get a order of fried clams, a bag of chips and a pop.  Otherwise I'm a pound of jumbo with two bags of chips and two pops.  Occasionally the frog legs.Here is how it goes at Goose.  Don't mess with the staff.  While you're still in your car get the money you expect to spend out and put it separately in your pocket.  When you pay you won't have to pull out your entire wallet or a wad of cash. Walk in.  Look at large menu above counter.  Smile for the ten security cameras. They've been robbed a couple of times.  When the guy looks at you tell him the main thing you want. e.g. Pound of jumbo.  Half pound of regular.  Two order of clams.  That's it.  Get it.  Small talk is unnecessary and unwanted.  Stand to the side and enjoy the show.  Usually a great people watching experience.  Now when they tell you your order is ready tell them what kind of pop you want and what kind of chips.  Tell them whether you want the hot or mild sauce.  It's included in the price but extra sauce costs extra.  Don't take too much time.  You should have decided what you wanted while you were waiting for your order.   The hot sauce is hot and the mild sauce is mild.  Don't ask about it.  I always get the Goose Island sauce.  Yeah it's extra but I like it.  Now reach into your pocket and only grab the money you put aside earlier.  Just pull out what you need.  Pay and get out."

It's the only place in Old Town I could probably PITCH A TENT and camp out at for a few hours. Between the tasty eats, STIFF drinks, and awesome music it deserves a FULL SALUTE as far as I'm concerned.Although they're known for burgers I did some cajun shrimp tacos and a few Old Fashions on night one and honestly you never would have known it was their first night open. The staff was super friendly, food was delicious and came out quick, and they have $5 Fireballs all day everyday.Also notable was the music selection which was fantasticly random. If you ever play name that tune it's the perfect place to exercise your skills in that department.Definitely going to be back for more in the future. Overall a great addition to Old Town and yes you're probably going to hear a boner joke or too if you come here."
lyfe-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lyfe-kitchen-chicago,04/01/14 , 1 ," Welcome to sales and tourism! (sarcasm)LYFE kitchen is an interesting place that makes me think less like a restaurant and more like some odd form of showroom. On one hand, there are a lot of choices. There are a lot of different menus that cater to different dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten free, etc), which can give you a lot of options for whatever you may plan to eat. That being a plus, as well as something you'd expect from a health-focused/healthy focused restaurant.What's sales-y/tourist-y is the way they handle people who walk in and basically have no idea where to get a menu and/or order, who have to get helped with a 5 minute explanation/pitch on what LYFE offers. It's equal parts hilarious and disturbing to be anywhere in the vicinity after you've already ordered from LYFE to watch it happen.The food choices themselves are good however, and the food is actually pretty well made. It is also notably healthy portions, which means in this case 'healthy for your body' not 'healthy for your eyes'. So portions can tend to be a bit small if you're looking for a meal to feel very full from. In reality, should we be eating that much? Probably not. So I suppose if you're coming to LYFE for healthy food, you're in the right place in many manners of perspective.All that aside, the food here is actually well seasoned, tastes great, is very fresh, and I think the photos speak for themselves. Just keep in mind that it is a bit expensive and I wouldn't ever consider this a regular place to visit as much as a 'once in a blue moon' kind of place. I'd much easier go to Karyn's Raw."

three-aces-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/three-aces-chicago,07/27/14 , 2 ," Eh, this place is okay. My BFF was in town, and we intended to go to the Bongo Room in the South Loop, but it was closed for one day only. I drove into the city, so we made a reservation for this place, hopped in the car, and were there super fast. Paralleled just down the street, although there's a lot across the street if you're so inclined.It was super empty for Sunday brunch, and I think brunch just isn't their thing. There are basically no sweet brunch options (remember, I was dreaming of Bongo Room pancakes that morning!), and as a non egg eater, I settled on a friend chicken biscuit.We started with sunflower seeds, which were delicious! Salty, savory, with a little heat. Would recommend these! My sandwich was disappointing. The chicken was just okay, and the biscuit was dry, dense, and cold. I ate a few bites and then ignored it, favoring the delicious fries that came on the side. My BFF and her friend both got burgers and seemed happy with their choices.I think this place would be better for dinner, but I'm not a fan of the ambiance. It's nothing they've done wrong, but it's a bit 'harder' or more alternative than I prefer- sort of reminded me of Kuma's, which I don't care for either. If you like that sort of vibe, though, you'll love this place, and the food is good."

beezzee-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/beezzee-chicago,01/10/13 , 2 ," In college I once spent all night on a very slow bus from Barcelona to Paris and when that bus made its destination, I was immediately smitten with Paris and the first thing I ate was a crêpe from a food stand and I could see the Eiffel Tower in the distance.  That is the kind of love affair I have with these fun pancakes.  I spent 16 years teaching French and each of those years, I made crêpes for my students on Mardi Gras and even that grueling task did not take away my love for these treats.I was therefore very excited when my daughter chose this place for our first stop on our trip to the city last Friday.  My only regret is that we didn't share more; I was saving room for whatever else we encountered that day.  She and I split a turkey, spinach and cheese savory crêpe that was formidable!  For our sweet, we partook of the Beezee original with nutella, strawberries and whipped cream.  We took turns eating as we were accompanied by my one month old granddaughter and when I had finished my half of the crêpe and it was time to swap it for holding the baby, I seriously had fantasies of eating it all.Not only was the food divine, the restaurant was clean and cozy.  We sat in the back so as to not disturb anyone with the baby.  The woman making our food was super friendly and even cooed over our little one.  Yes, it's the perfect restaurant.I can't wait to come back and I recommend you rush over here as soon as possible.  But when you're here, I would get my own crêpes, these were really too fabulous to split!"
athenian-room-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/athenian-room-chicago,01/28/14 , 1 ," Our friends highly recommended the Athenian, and so we went with them one snowy evening in January to try the much-praised Kalamata chicken. For both me and my husband, it was a disappointment: chicken absolutely soaked in vinegar is not something that appeals to either one of us. We were expecting chicken with strong lemon flavor, and what we got was a big drink of vinegar. The Greek fries, underneath the chicken, were so soggy by the time they reached the table that they were really inedible. The chicken was also served with a salad, which was rather bland. If I ever found myself at this restaurant again (and for me, it wouldn't warrant a second trip), I would request the 'juice' on the side of the chicken, and I would skip the salad altogether.I like a glass of wine with dinner, and so the whole idea of walking next door to order a beer or cocktail mid-dinner doesn't sit well with me. I am really puzzled as to what kind of license the Athenian has, and why its customers can't BYOB if they can go to the bar next door and bring back a drink. I would infinitely prefer to bring my own bottle of wine, rather than leave the table twice to refill my drink. (Above all, I would prefer the waitstaff to bring me another glass or bottle, but...)In terms of bright spots, we ordered two portions of taramasalata, which was actually very tasty. Service was also extremely attentive; our waitress was friendly and very prompt to respond to our needs and requests. The restaurant itself has an intimate feel to it, and was very warm, which I appreciated! The prices were also very, very reasonable. Our bill, for four people, was $68 (not including drinks, of course).Still, I have had amazing Mediterranean food, and this was not."

Our server (I forgot his name, but I know he said he's been working there for 6 months) was awesome. He knew the menu, gave us his recommendation on which pizza we should try and had a good personality.Now on to the pizza. We decided to go with our server's recommendation and got the pepperoni and ricotta pizza. The pizza was good and flavorful, but didn't knock my socks off like I was expecting. My dining buddy mentioned that she wish there was less crust on the pizza (she wanted more sauce, cheese, meat).I recommend giving Coalfire because the pizza was good and the service was great. However, if you really love think crust pizza, you may want to hit up a couple other places in Chicago that have AMAZING think crust."

However, recently it hasn't been...umm...to my taste.-Creative drinks with funny names: They are not the best drinks you are going to have anywhere in the city, though most are really good. I would highly recommend the Peanut Butter Koopa Troopa! Seasonal drinks in particular tend to be hit or miss.Negatives:-Limited seating for how popular it is, especially near the outlets. Really difficult to find multiple seats together.-Really loud (doesn't bother me, but could be a distraction)-Difficult to find free parking if you are drivingSo clearly, the pros outweigh the cons!"

As we stepped inside Wood, we were immediately welcomed by the warm and cozy decor. The restaurant is long and narrow, there really isn't a ton of seating. We arrived around 11:15 and the only remaining seating was at the bar, I would recommend a reservation if you have more than two people or don't want to sit at the bar.To start, we ordered the house-made focaccia which sounds fantastic. However, instead of being light and fluffy focaccia, it ended up being rather hard and crumbly. The raspberry jam and cheese that accompanied it was delicious, but the focaccia itself was a disappointment and I would not recommend it. We both ordered the corn beef hash for our main dish and it was fantastic. This is an incredibly hearty dish filled with potatoes and corn beef. The only downside was the really fatty pieces of corn beef, but they were easy to cut off. Other than that, the corn beef and potatoes were flavored so well and the two eggs on top made the dish. We didn't partake in cocktails but they looked delicious. The coffee was very tasty and heated us up well. Overall, a phenomenal atmosphere and great main dish, I'll definitely be back!"
potbelly-sandwich-shop-chicago-26,https://www.yelp.com/biz/potbelly-sandwich-shop-chicago-26,12/03/14 , 1 ," This was my last meal before leaving Chicago. I kept seeing potbelly everywhere in Chicago and just had to try it. Potbelly is located right after the security checkpoint. The MDW airport has one security checkpoint for the entire airport. The line was crazy long. As I waited for about 45 minutes all I could see was the Potbelly sign at the finish line.I ordered 'A Wreck' in the 'Bigs' size. As my last meal before a long flight, why not? The Bigs is 30% larger for less than adding 30% the cost. This comes with Salami, Roast Beef, Turkey, Ham & Swiss Cheese. I got this with everything on. The greatest bargain is it just cost me $6. What a steal for airport food!Definitely worth the stop if you have time before a flight."

Seat yourself and he said first come first serve?We sat ourselves on a sticky, unbalanced table.We waited about 5 minutes before we were greeted.Where I had to ask if the table could be wiped down.The menus were really sticky as well.I went with the mule and my friends went with the gimlets.The drinks were really delicious.I really enjoyed sitting outside.Our server seemed un interested in us,  I felt like we had to flag her more than her actually popping in.No small talk nothing.  She's a blonde with a pixie.We ordered guacamole,  calamari,  and bruschett a,All amazing.We asked the server for a salad about 20 minutes after our apps,  and she told us they already had last call.(Which we weren't told)She then said she'd ask if the kitchen could throw a salad together,  and literally never came back,  until they closed the patio.Even when closing the patio I felt like they were really rude.Why would you bring me a full drink ten minutes before you close the patio, then say everyone has to drink up.It was awkward.Food and drinks really good.Service.  Pretty bad.This could have been a 5 star."
sweetwater-tavern-and-grille-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetwater-tavern-and-grille-chicago,09/08/14 , 1 ," Stopped in here during our last visit to Chicago and it is a neat place with a cool atmosphere. I would describe it as a trendy sports bar and grill. It was fairly busy when we stopped in, which happened to be during the second-to-last World Cup game on July 12th. However, they immediately cleared a table and we didn't even have a wait. The tvs are plentiful and are spread all around the bar and dining area so we were able to watch the end of the game while we dined.Our waiter was prompt and courteous. He took our drink orders right away and we ordered the cheese curd appetizer. The fried cheese curds were really, really good! My fiancée and I each ordered a different burger. He opted for the Sunnyside Up and I had the Sweetwater burger, we each had a side of fries. The burgers were amazing - cooked exactly how we liked, juicy, and flavorful. They do not skimp on the fries, and they also had great flavor and texture. It was a good thing we were very hungry when we arrived because the portions are quite large and we barley could finish it (knowing we weren't able to take leftovers we just chose to be gluttonous haha).Prices are reasonable ($11-$13ish for burger and fries). They have a full bar, drink specials, and specialty cocktails. I heard they rotate menu items as well.They have a nice patio area which would be fun during the warmer times of the year.I definitely recommend stopping in here if you are out and about on Michigan Avenue, especially if you are in the mood for burgers. You won't be disappointed!"

Its way closer to work then I had assumed, which is great, and I think I will become a full-on regular.  I did the flight, which was a mini falafel, steak and chicken, all in their own pitas, and it come with piping hot french fries.  SO DELICIOUS and as other people said, so much food!The steak was the highlight for me.  The spicy falafel is truly spicy, as is the hot sauce, so look out!"
grandma-js-local-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/grandma-js-local-kitchen-chicago,12/08/14 , 1 ," I'm sure you can tell from my previous reviews, that a restaurant's atmosphere makes a big difference to me as a diner.  Grandma J's and its diners are a bit too hipster for my taste, which is why I just can't give a full five-star review.  This place is in the middle of nowhere and it's always packed.  You'll definitely wait more than 30 or 45 minutes on a Saturday or Sunday after 10, especially if you have a party larger than two, so just prepare for that.  And there's NO WHERE ELSE for you to go nearby to wait (i.e. to have a beer or watch football or something), so plan on just standing outside in the cold.Cash only also makes this place incredibly annoying instead of charming, so keep that in mind.  At least there's ample parking available for free.  Only redeeming atmospheric quality of this place.  The servers are pretty curt  and clearly annoyed that their restaurant is constantly full and diners have all kinds of annoying dining preferences like gluten-free vegan nonsense.  The general feeling in the place is 'hurry up and order and eat so we can get more people at this table', which doesn't make me feel comfortable.  Sigh.  The people just don't make this place worth it.The food, though, was really good.  I appreciate organic, free-range, local meats and whatnot, and they are clearly prideful of their purchase of these kinds of items.  The breakfast sandwich was excellent and everything comes with potatoes and meat of some kind, so indulge away.  My family really enjoyed everything they ordered (we were a party of six) and the coffee was refilled promptly.Prices are reasonable but, sigh, it's cash only.  I won't come back here on purpose, but would definitely go with a friend if they suggested it.  Maybe my next experience will be better.  At least the food was super delicious."

All I want was a Chicken Caesar Wrap.I guess the website and the sign on the door doesn't mean anything."

The serves are always helpful when it comes to providing information on the menu options, they keep your glass filled with you beverage of choice and they truly seem to enjoy working there.When the burgers come out they always look like something you'd get at a 4th of July BBQ, but they taste delicious. I recommend the Hickory Bacon Cheddar Burger with the creamy caramel milkshake.Just know that this place gets packed on weekends with people coming from the zoo so it's best to make reservations."
alegrias-seafood-chicago-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/alegrias-seafood-chicago-chicago,05/12/14 , 1 , Absolutely the best Mexican seafood place in Chicago!! I go there quite often and I am never disappointed with their food... I've tried anything from the fish and chips to the Chapuzon de mar and their famous Langostinos (must try!)The place is BYOB so thats always a plus. The staff is very friendly and now that there is a second floor the wait times are not as bad (15/20mins). Its a great place to go and have an awesome meal!

This review is solely based on their delivery service and their food.I love love love their Fire Cobb Salad. They put so much love into the salad. Who doesn't want bacon and chicken strips in their salad? *sigh* I'm craving for this salad just by writing this review!My kids love their appetizer, jumbo chicken strips with teriyaki sauce. My husband loves everything from this place. We have tried almost everything from the menu. yes, we are frequent delivery customer!Their delivery also fast, although i did have one bad experience but it was solely a bad service from grubhub. I placed an order through grubhub and 15 minutes later i realized that i forgot to order something for my kids. So i called the restaurant right away and they said they haven't received any order from me! I was extremely mad. Later i found out that grubhub have a delayed order system. Basically, when you place the order online, grubhub didn't send the order to the restaurant right away. And in my case, i guess grubhub probably forgot.Long story cut into short, since that grubhub accident, i usually call the restaurant to place the order. Or ask my husband to stop by to grab dinner for us.Will definitely go back here again, maybe twice a week now?"
jaks-tap-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jaks-tap-chicago,05/02/13 , 2 ," Ah, Jaks. Where the sound is deafening, the beers are great, and the food is decent.So overall this place easily earns a 4, but it definitely gets a 1 for loudness.  Let me explain: this is one of the loudest bars I have ever been to. It's fairly busy and it's understandable, but holy crap. I can barely hear people a foot away! This is beyond loud and into 'incomprehensible'.Now let me get back to the good parts of Jaks:you have a awesome and rotating alcohol selection, you have some decent food options, and you have service that ranges from awesome to crap. It's entirely luck of the draw. Over the 10 or so times I've been here I've had people who can't even handle glasses without having their hands inside them, and also awesome waitresses who I wish I knew outside of Jaks just to hang out and introduce to my circle of people. Woe to anyone who gets the bad service here, because it's *BAD*. On the flip side? it's pretty rare.Also, it's basically a sports bar with plenty of TV's to catch up sports, as well as having a fireplace to stay warm in the winter.Oh, and parking. Parking here is a bit of a nightmare that is easily remedied: you're just going to have to go up and down a few side streets to find a place to park. There really isn't a lot in front of Jaks.good? food and beer, convenient locationokay? service is hit or missbad? don't expect to have a meaningful conversation here"
chicagos-home-of-chicken-and-waffles-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chicagos-home-of-chicken-and-waffles-chicago,05/13/14 , 2 ," Let's double down on the fried chicken reviews, shall we? I just posted one for Chicago-famous Harold's, so why not another for the commonly known preeminent chicken and waffle house of Chicagoland?Unfortunately for this place, like Harold's, I grade on a Houston curve. And I've not had better chicken and waffles than at the Breakfast Klub, a Houston institution. But let's talk Chicago. The place is in the corner office of a small strip with some apartments atop, in a not un-quaint part of Chicago's south side. The brownstone architecture around the neighborhood is, in fact, rather nifty. Additionally, this restaurant's proximity to Cellular Field, with not much else nearby besides chain food, makes it a particularly good pre-game stop if you're going to a Sox game.But it's all about the food, and Chicago's Home has good, but not great, chicken and waffles. Like Harold's, this location suffers from the absurdly small chicken. A quarter meal with a waffle sets you back above a Hamilton; there's no reason to be stingy with the bird for those prices. Unlike Harold's, the chicken here is decently good with a nice flavor--think mild at Church's or Popeyes.The waffle is wholly disappointing. it's soft and soggy, like an Eggo waffle that's been exposed to too much frostbite and can't shed the water weight in the toaster. The waffle requires copious dunking in the syrup, a big no-no.Beyond the chicken and waffles, Chicago's Home has an extensive menu, and we helped ourselves to some red beans and rice and greens as sides, both tasty. I'd been particularly craving red beans and rice, after having gone on multiple diatribes about how impossible it is to find proper cajun food in Chicago (and no, Heaven on Seven does not count). So just having a red beans and rice option was good enough for me to like it.There's some complaints about the wait time, but we came entirely off-peak and had no issues with service or wait. The place is clean, there's street and lot parking, and the food is good, if not spectacular."

Always a plus :)  Food came out Lightening Quick and the portions are misleadingly large if you go with a skillet which is what everyone gets.

medici-on-57th-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/medici-on-57th-chicago,08/06/14 , 2 ," I wish the staff had been wearing their 'Obama eats here' tshirts I was told happens quite often at this place, because that would have made me even happier ha ha This place is great though, and I will definitely become a frequent diner here I can tell.You walk in, and you already feel like you have escaped the hustle and bustle of the work life. It is all wooden interior, very calming and rustic. Love it. They also have a huge deck upstairs that if it hasn't rained recently and is warm enough, it looks like a perfect spot to grab lunch or dinner. It was closed when I just went, so I need to go back soon to check it out!And food wise, the menu has too many great options I had to have my server choose between a big salad covered in bacon and cheese and such, and the tuna steak sandwich served with this ginger mayo sauce...Very different options, but my server told me the tuna steak, and I am glad she did! It was the largest tuna steak sandwich ever too for $12. So tasty and so so filling! And my friend got their house salad and added chicken and it is also a great, full size for a meal and she loves it and orders it all the time. I saw one of their mini pizzas come out too, which also is now on my radar for next time in addition to their burgers which looked very tempting on the table near us! Definitely need to hit the gym and come back here!"
folklore-argentine-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/folklore-argentine-grill-chicago,11/10/14 , 2 ," The atmosphere in this restaurant is spot on.  Gorgeous, warm, inviting, a tad dark in the evening as each table is lit by candlelight and the overhead lighting is minimal. It's certainly romantic, has great decor, and floor to ceiling windows at the front of the restaurant.  It is also in a great location in Wicker Park, and offers a walkable neighborhood for after dinner.The food is the problem.  The salad was so basic. Literally served with raw onion and a large slice of tomato, and although it is supposed to be served with mixed greens on this evening we received all kale. If you don't know about kale, it is bitter when eaten raw.  I was not impressed. Hubby's steak was overcooked and not well seasoned. My stuffed chicken was ok, but not anything I would order again. The best part of my meal was the squash, the best part of hubby's meal was the potatoes.Our waiter did not come to our table for probably 15 minutes. The people seated after us had already placed their order before we even received water. Once our waiter finally came to our table he thought we'd already given our order for drinks and food.A tad too pricey for all that drama."
feed-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/feed-chicago,11/08/12 , 2 ," Girlfriend took me to feed for steak night.  We got there right when they started serving, 5 PM- the early birds.  For fifteen dollars you get a hangar steak and 2 sides.  The steak is smaller but that means there's crispy edges in every juicy bite.  The tail end was so caramelized and lustrous.  The blue cheese butter was tangy, rich and satisfying.  For sides I got macaroni and cheese and French fries.  The fries were handcut- damn good.For dessert I got one banana bread pudding for there, 2 to go, and 2 slices of confetti cake to go as well.  The server asked if I was stocking up the for week.  Not that I won't pay $$$ for good cake, but my point is when do you get a piece of good cake for 3.50.  You got to stock up."
aloha-eats-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/aloha-eats-chicago,02/15/14 , 2 ," My friend and I came here for a late dinner.  We each ordered off of the Mini Plates, which comes with a smaller portion, a scoop of rice, and a scoop of their Mac salad.  My friend had the Mini Short Ribs - this was marinated well, a little sweet but savory at the same time, but a little too fatty.  I had the Mini Hamburger Steak, which was their miniature version of an authentic Hawaiian dish - on-the-premise, hand-made hamburger patties covered with gravy.  The meat patties were extremely salty  - the gravy was fine, and eating with the rice seemed to minimally offset the saltiness, but it was just too much salt, even for me!  I wasn't a fan of the mac salad as I think it might have gone bad and had a funky taste to it.  Aloha Maid (that comes in different flavors) was actually quite refreshing and nice - don't forget to ask for a cup of ice; the Strawberry-Guava was wonderful.+overly salty!!!+Aloha Maid beverages - Strawberry-Guava"

The Boarding House was everything I had hoped for and more from the minute I walked in. I had the pleasure of finally dining here last night with my mom and sisters for a GNO (girls night out if ya were wondering). The food, ambiance, service, and overall experience were impeccable! First things first, to add to our initial excitement, Alpana herself actually came and greeted our table! She was so fun and personable, and by her taking the time to come over to us really shows that she takes pride in her fabulous establishment.Let's talk food and drink. Gourmet all the way baby. Most of us chose wine, because let's face it, if anyone knows wine, it's Alpana. I went with the Malbec which was absolutely delicious and complimented my meal perfectly. Not to mention, I was feeling pretty groovy after 2 glasses (giddyup).  For a shareable app, we went with the Buratta salad which was a fantastic blend of creamy, fruity and nutty. For dinner I opted for the grilled flat iron steak. Ok..this was..hands down...one of the most tender steaks I have ever eaten in my life. True statement. There was not a bite left on my plate. Oh and the butterball potatoes that accompanied my lovely steak? oh laaawd, amazing. Lucky for me, I was also able to taste the lamb chops and the scallops. Perfection, all of it...Dessert, of course, wasn't a hard sell as they have many options that embody this beautiful fall weather here in Chicago (i.e. pumpkin/carrot cake, bread pudding, etc) We finally decided on the flourless chocolate cake, which again, did not disappoint. It was so decadent!All in all, the Boarding House is a must see. It's sexy, classy vibe and killer food can't be beat. And the fact that we were able to chat with Alpana, was just the icing on our (flourless) cake! ;)"

I was there with a couple of friends and I ordered la chicharito, one of my friends ordered la Cuau, and one more. And I tried all 3. They were really good, maybe too good, therefore the 4 stars. Contradictory ha? That is me, maybe next time I will order a lighter torta and take half to go, then maybe 5 stars. lolUsual drink menu. Mexican bottled soda and horchata, strawberry and lemon water.

This year, we'd made reservations for 9:30 PM. After looking for parking for 20 minutes, we arrived at Ciao on the dot at 9:30 and were completely disregarded. When we said we were here for a reservation, we were told there were plenty of ppl in front of us. There is no place to really wait in this small restaurant so we kept getting bumped into by the staff. What's the point of a reservation then? We were seated past 10 PM.When we finally got our table, 30 minutes went by without anyone coming to bring us water, utensils, bread, or take our order. Finally, I got frustrated and got one of the waiters attention, who was surprised no one had gotten to us yet. He brought us out bread, but no plates or utensils. They were clearly understaffed and overcrowded and not prepared for this many people.30 minutes later we finally got our food. My gnocchi was not as hot as it should've been. You could tell it'd been sitting there for a while. I again asked the waiter for utensils and extra bread. The utensils came, but no bread. I AGAIN had to ask the waiter for more bread and finally 30 minutes later we got more bread, after we were both finished eating.We left past 12:30 because of the slow service. I'm very disappointed in Ciao this year. If they cannot handle this many people, they shouldn't take this many reservations. Or turn ppl away at the door that don't have reservations.We will not be returning next year for our yearly VDay at Ciao."
nookies-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/nookies-chicago,02/24/14 , 2 ," This is your typical diner. I went here before checking out the Chicago History Museum. Nookies has diner food and diner service. Absolutely nothing outstanding or something to make this a must try. The only reason I can think of why it has such a high Yelp review is because everyone in the neighborhood rated it. If this was in my stomping ground - I might give it one more star - might.The staff was friendly and very quick to step. We were seated immediately on arrival. As I said, it was typical diner food with typical bad diner coffee. I had the trio breakfast which is a sample of three types of pancakes. The only one I really liked was the carrot cake. I also had a lemon seed pancake (Meh) and some kind of plum pancake (pass).Every neighborhood should have a diner. But unless you live in the neighborhood, go somewhere else. You will not be pleasantly surprised at Nookies."

xian-cuisine-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/xian-cuisine-chicago,12/31/14 , 1 ," My husband and I decided to give this place a shot. We saw the pictures on yelp and thought the interior looked really nice so we were kind of shocked when we walked into the restaurant and it was completely different than the picture on yelp. We aren't big on ambiance anyway, but don't come here thinking it will be some fancy place with a nice wooden interior like the photo on the yelp profile. It's pretty bare bones but that's fine with me.We had the celery and wooden ear cold dish to start. We also had a pork sandwich and  a lamb sandwich. The lamb sandwich was better than the pork sandwich but the seasoning still needs a little work.  I had the lamb with handpulled noodle soup and the noodles were a really nice texture, but I found the soup itself to be a bit bland. Once I added some chile oil it was a bit better. My husband had the lamb intestine soup and he seemed to enjoy it. We also had an order of the xi'an cold noodles. I actually really liked the cold noodles and thought they were refreshing and light.Everything we ate was fine, but we have been to Xi'An Famous Foods in NYC and this pales in comparison to that. However, for Chicago, this is a welcome addition and is pretty good. I am sure it will improve with time as well. The prices are very reasonable. Make sure to bring cash if you don't plan on ordering much, because they only let you use credit card if it is over $25."
ameer-kabob-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ameer-kabob-chicago,03/28/14 , 1 ," This place is a couple blocks from my house but easy to miss as you cruise down Milwaukee. Just north of Augusta on the west side of the street. Absolutely nothing to look at and maybe looks sketchy, but don't be fooled.Once inside, again nothing to look at. Ordered the chicken kabobs and were told it would be 15 minutes. Downside - that's a long time; upside - its fresh. The result: a really good chicken kabob that was fresh and very tasty. The rice and pita were standard but this is a good place with fresh meat so I'll be back!"
312-chicago-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/312-chicago-chicago,09/11/14 , 1 ," If it weren't for the sheer sky-high prices at 312, for lunch, no less, this place would definitely get 5 stars from me. It's just difficult to give the full 5 accolades for a Loop venue that isn't exceptionally decorated or carefully, strategically located.We started with Caesar salads, which were phenomenal. Probably the best I've ever had. Partly because there's a grand anchovy in the middle, surrounded by the freshest romaine, the perfect amount of cheese, the best dressing, perfectly toasted croutons. It was all around fantastic and worth $8.00. The Melanzane sandwich of breaded eggplant, provolone was delicious, just maybe not $15.00 delicious. Same for the Pollo Panini. Both sandwiches had interesting flavors and were substantial in size, it's just the price tag that seems ridiculous.For dessert we split the Fruta di Bosca that our wonderful server, Alli, suggested. While we agreed, the mix of fresh berries, mint, ginger gelato was magnifico, I'm not sure $10 for a teaspoon sized scoop of gelato wasn't anything but highway robbery. But notwithstanding the lunchtime HIGH prices, the meal was yummy and a 1/2 of a sandwich with tasty fries was more than enough for now, especially with the salad, and will carry over for tomorrow as well."
angels-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/angels-chicago,11/26/11 , 2 ," The hubby and I went for dinner on a Saturday around 6pm.  The place was so deserted I thought I would see a tumbleweed roll by when we walked in.  But the waitress who was sweeping assured me they were open and to grab a seat anywhere.We had arestaurant.comcoupon and needed to spend $35.  So we went all out.  I ordered a XX (Dos Equis) beer.  Our waitress brought out chips and salsa right away while we reviewed the menu.  The chips were okay, but they could have been so much better if they were hot and fresh because the salsa was good and spicy.The hubby went with a taco flight while I went with the Molcajete.  The taco flight was four small corn tortilla tacos, one of each; chicken, beef, pork and shrimp.  I had the shrimp one (the hubby is scared of seafood) and it was really good.  The Molcajete is similar in presentation to a chicken fajita skillet dish.  It came out bubbling hot in a black stone cauldron.  Word of wisdom, don't wear white if you want to order this.  It was literally boiling and spattering hot grease from the sauce.  And it stayed hot forever too.  It came with a side of rice, re-fried beans and a plate of steamed corn tortillas.  It was beyond good.  I would order both of these dishes again.  The tacos were really tasty and full of flavor and the Molcajete was like nothing I've had before.In order to reach our dinning minimum we had to order dessert too.  Oh darn, well if I must.  The hubby went with a chocolate shake and I had a scoop of cinnamon ice cream; $3/each, not a bad deal!"

Hangover. Cold. Good day. Bad day. Week day. Rainy day. Hot summer day. Frigid day in February. You name it, Green Apple will brighten your day with a bowl of their piping hot and refreshing pho. I've had many o' bowls of pho and am confident in saying this is one of the best. Why? 1.) the broth. It's all about the broth. The fat content appears to be lower with a lighter, less-guilt ridden taste to it; 2.) location - despite being geographically located in one of the most hustling and bustling areas of Chicago, you have this way of being a hidden gem via your second floor location in the atrium of a downtown corporate building (I like to pretend I'm the only one who knows about you) For $7.50 you make my day every time I visit.Also available at Green Apple: other varieties of pho, smoothies and juices, complimentary water jug and plentiful shared seating with the other 5 to 7 restaurants in the building."

(i.e. Valentine's Day) because the food will take forever.  They have a small kitchen that they can't knock out a ton of food at a time.   But the food they do knock out if top notch.Big fan of the fried ravioli and chicken vesuvio.
pump-room-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pump-room-chicago,03/05/14 , 2 ," I came across Pump Room based on some recommendations from friends to make my Chicago trip even more memorable. This definitely did not fail. From the moment we arrived to the time we left, it was an awesome experience!FOOD/DRINKS - 5 Stars: We ordered so many amazing items:- Raspberry Lychee Bellini: I'm not big on bellini's, but since there was lychee, I was all over it. This was really tasty.- Basil Jalapeno Margarita: This really had a kick from the mild start with the basil to the spice from the jalapeno contrasted followed by the coolness of the margarita. It really had your mouth jumping.- Sour Cherry and Yuzu Soda: I drank this during my meal and how could I not have this? Cherry and yuzu are two of my favorite flavors and they're married together in a soda?!?! Awesome!- Bread with Olive Oil: They provided complimentary bread with olive oil for dipping. This was a nice start to our meal.- Tuna Tartare: Now this was not what I expected and I mean that in a good way. Throw whatever you normally think of tuna tartare out the window and try it here. It's so delicious especially with the ginger dressing and the crunch from the spicy radishes. You can't go wrong with this. I wanted to order a second one, but I had to control myself!- Seared Scallops: This was really good. The scallops were perfectly cooked and had roasted pumpkin seeds and squash spaghetti, which was a surprising treat.- Grilled Beef Short Rib: This was amazing! It was so tender and it just fell apart. The Asian pears and red wine glaze gave it an extra pop of flavor. The creamy mashed potatoes definitely appeased my craving for potatoes! Overall, this dish was mouth-watering and delicious!- Peach Cobber: I love peach cobbler so when I see it on a menu, I'm quick to order it. This was just so freaking good! The bourbon ice cream definitely brought this to a new level.- Deep Dish Molten Chocolate Cookie: Now who goes and makes what's practically a chocolate chip cookie cupcake? Pump Room does! Yes, it's all that delicious cookiness with a center that oozes molten chocolate. Mix it with a bite of ice cream and you'll be in heaven! This is a must try no matter how full you are!SERVICE - 5 Stars: The service was truly impeccable. The moment we walked in, everyone was extremely friendly. Our waiter was amazing. He helped to give plenty of recommendations, answered our questions, was animated, very funny and of course extremely personable.ATMOSPHERE - 5 Stars: The atmosphere in here is very classy, elegant, and relaxed. It felt very throwback modern, yet chic with the decor of the restaurant. I can see why this place is very popular with people. The vibe is very social and I loved the overall atmosphere. It was relaxed, people chatting, laughing, etc. Also, the bar area is pretty cool and laid back. I actually wish I arrived earlier to enjoy a cocktail or two before dinner.RECOMMENDATION: I truly loved everything that we ordered at the table and I'm so glad that I saved room for dessert. I can't wait to come back to Chicago because Pump Room will be on my list of places to eat at again. Everything from the food, service, and atmosphere was amazing and I hope they keep it up! So, if you haven't figured it out already, make your reservation and enjoy all the deliciousness Pump Room has to offer!"
estrella-negra-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/estrella-negra-chicago,10/16/11 , 1 ," Was I simply that famished or were Estrella Negra's la Garza nacho cheese fries with sliced jalapeño peppers just that damn tangy, creamy and scrumptious? I'm sure it was the latter because I wasn't the only one loudly moaning at our cute, front window bistro table. Though I do confess that this _was_ after sipping down nearly the entire bottle of '09 Catena Reserva Malbec in their vibrant, cozy basement. (It's slightly reminiscent of Hungry Brain bar, see pics).I could have happily called it a night during the apps course because along with the fries, la Calavera goat cheese tostadas topped with black beans, salsa verde, tomatoes and sour cream almost made me jump up and start sloppily dancing the Cabbage Patch haha. The crispy corn shell tasted freshly-made and I could have sworn there were bits of chilled avocado mixed in. This was a great blend worthy of being featured as an entree, no doubt.Finally we ordered the shrimp mango salsa enchiladas and la Bandera empanada sampler, with both the spinach and artichoke and chorizo and corn varieties standing out. I think the mango fruit was fresh but kinda did funny things with the bottle of Carmenère we opened next.Thanks to Yelp, we received a complimentary chocolate chip tamale, flanked with some of the best custard ice cream I've had. Though it was an intriguing effort... I'd be tempted to skip the tamale portion next time, as the ice cream portion was just that good!"

Midnight Moon Strawberry Moonshine and Ginger Beer. A delicious cocktail served in a mason jar. Refreshing and tasty, the perfect pairing with my Fried Chicken taco and Al Pastor Taco.Hold up, you want me to rewind that? Yes, I said Fried.Chicken.Taco. It's crispy, it's fresh and delicious. I needed more of the smoked chipotle sauce because it was so good. But otherwise a seriously good taco. The Al Pastor was excellent too. Smoky, sweet and tender. I'm glad they put some pineapple in it as that is what al pastor is all about!  Their corn tortillas are fresh and hand made, and you taco connoisseurs know that it totally makes a difference and sets the bar high.Their menu is full of unique tacos--like sweet potato, roasted beets, grits and kale--along with steak, tilapia, carnitas. Totally worth a return visit and work my way down the menu.Sweet service, nice clean digs. Fun and casual."

You see them cooking the food. And you see what you are going to be eating.My wife had a chicken taco. Her taco was huge, and she loved it. She doesn't much like cabbage, but the cabbage on the taco was different, and she loved it.I ordered a chicken burrito, and it was fantastic. The flavor profile was superb.

tuscany-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tuscany-restaurant-chicago,11/05/14 , 2 ," Not my cup of tea.  Old school Italian with, in my opinion focus on volume versus taste.  If you're coming in from the suburbs and going to a sports game at United Center, they will get you fed, filled and out in time to make the game but don't expect the authenticity and flavor that comes with slow preparation and quality ingredients."
frontera-fresco-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/frontera-fresco-chicago,11/11/12 , 2 ," After hearing so much about Rick Bayless, I made it a point to stop at one of his establishments while I was back in town to see what the hype is all about and, by golly, the deliciousness hit me like a sack of bricks!Do not be fooled by the unassuming lunch counter on the 7th floor of Macy's. There is a line for a reason. I ordered the grilled steak torta when I was there; the steak was perfectly tender and seasoned and topped with a layer of creamy avocado and melty chihuahua cheese as well as a medley of other fantastic flavors I don't quite recall but is cited on their online menu as cilantro chimichurri, poblanos rojas, and black beans. *DROOLS* I proceeded to wash it all down with a refreshing mango lime agua fresca, which was equally wonderful.Although Frontera Fresca's tortas are on the pricier end as far as sandwiches go, it is money well spent. You really get the quality behind the name here. Plus, it's not like the next best alternative in the loop is any cheaper.As an added bonus, the view from the food court is really nice granted you grab a seat along the perimeter of the open atrium(?) area. You can look at people shop on the floors below and appreciate the fine interior architecture of the Marshall Fields building."

acadia-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/acadia-chicago,12/04/14 , 2 ," Came here to try ramen Sunday after hearing about chef McCaskey's win at Ramen fest.

Effort in providing value for $$.Pricing -- it's comparable to its neighbor across the street and its brother, The Gage.Venue -- seating can be tight if completely filled.  Warm and comfortable with a touch of romantic tavern.Service -- pleasant, informative and knowledgeable.  Always helpful by saying, there is a plug at the end of bench.The best way to enjoy Acanto is...thou shall not over eat.  Do not expect a big bowl of pasta...you go further down the street for that.I look forward to checking out the lunch menu on or after Aug 25, 2014.  Hello 'Fluff'!  *wink*"
kaiser-tiger-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kaiser-tiger-chicago-2,12/11/14 , 2 ," I planned my company's holiday party at Kaiser Tiger and had an awesome experience. First, Kaiser Tiger is not just a a restaurant, it's truly an event space and I can't wait to check out their beer garden once the weather gets nice! Holding our event during the day was perfect for Kaiser Tiger because they don't open until late afternoon, we had our choice of space and the entire first floor to ourselves. The event planner, Tracy, has tons of industry experience and does not let any details fall by the wayside. We went to tour the space before committing and discuss our set-up options, which was very helpful.Concerning the menu, Kaiser Tiger has tons of options that fit everyone's needs. Although they specialize in the beer and bacon categories, all of the food we had was great. I highly recommend the garlic hummus and bacon wrapped dates to start. For lunch, our huge spread included several of their sausages, all tasty, and a 'Bomb.' This flavorful dish is sliced and made into sandwiches. This was a huge hit amongst my coworkers. Kaiser Tiger takes a lot of pride in their handcut fries and brought them out on trays with their various dipping sauces for the group. These are a must-order, the perfect side to go with your bacon and beer.Our holiday party activity involved working with a company that rents casino tables, dealers, and all necessary materials. This concept worked great at Kaiser Tiger because the side room had more than enough space for our seven casino tables. People could play, eat, drink, mingle, it was seamless and everyone enjoyed themselves. Overall, highly recommend planning your holiday party at Kaiser Tiger!"

millers-pub-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/millers-pub-chicago,11/28/14 , 2 ," Came here with colleagues after working a convention, and this place really feels like a typical spot for an after work gathering especially for out of towners. Old school charm with stained glass decor that I assume is retained from decades past, and photographs of celebrities who have visited.I never order meatloaf, but that night I was craving something savory and soft, so I got the Baked Meatloaf open-faced sandwich. It was very good... simple, definitely savory, and not too salty. The serving was humongous though - it honestly could have been three meals for me.I also tried a bit of the Seafood Combo Platter. I liked it but since all the seafood is fried, this dish seems like it may be better as an appetizer. It would have been too much for me if I ordered it as an appetizer.This restaurant is a safe choice, it was very busy when we went on a weeknight.

berghoff-restaurant-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/berghoff-restaurant-chicago-3,09/13/14 , 2 ," Although the Berghoff Cafe is located underground, the experience is as bright and cheery as if it were located on street level. I came to BC for the first time to celebrate a birthday. The cafe is only open for three hours on weekdays, so its great for downtown workers and tourists in the area. The cafe is not a bistro by any means: Its cafeteria-style, where you line up, grab a brown tray, give your order to the staff, and proceed to pick up your order and pay for it at the register.The cafe is known for its meat sandwiches, piled high with sliced deli meats on your choice of bread (i.e. white, wheat, flatbread). They also have their own house-made potato chips, and many sandwiches come with a free side of these chips. I'm not a fan of the chips: I find them to be overly-browned, often soggy, and poorly salted. However, their other sides (creamed spinach, loaded potato salad) measure up.There are tempting slices of apple strudel near the register, and for a drink, I recommend the house-made root beer. You can upgrade your root beer by making it a float with vanilla ice cream.I ordered the gyro, which comes on toasted white flatbread. The flatbread is smeared with a creamy sauce, layered with lettuce, tomato, and of course, a generous topping of gyro meat. It comes with a side of the chips. For me, this was enough for lunch for two days.If its your birthday, you get apple strudel and two scoops of ice cream as a treat. The staff bring it over and help sing happy birthday to you. Its quite the generous display of hospitality for a place that has a cafeteria-style set-up.Only gripe: Menu should be updated with new prices. Gyro is listed as $6.75 online, and its $7.75+tax in cafe. Still a great value."

You get your choice of meat: pulled chicken, pulled pork, or brisket in a sandwich, platter, or salad. Genius idea for sure!What I tried:MAC AND CHEESE!!!: WOW WOW WOW. I don't even like mac and cheese that much but this was amazing. I could have eaten a whole big bowl of this stuff. Just try it.Brisket: I'd suggest getting the fatty version because it's more juicy but regardless this is pretty good, flavorful, and tender. And you get a really good portion of meatCornbread: also pretty good. I'd definitely choose the Mac and Cheese over this though but it is still good!Cole Slaw: a little more vinegary than I'm used to, but still solid. I mean you need some veggies after all this meat.South Carolina BBQ: This was my favorite bbq sauce. It's definitely very different from the usual BBQ sauce, this thing is good!

The Winchester is one of those places that truly deserves some lovin'.Despite the place being new (And it's so new they don't have a weekend liquor license yet. It's BYOB in the meantime... [wish I knew that before coming in!]) As soon as you walk in, you feel as though you've stepped into this 1960s-Dusty Springfield-Midwestern chic diner. You open the door, and you see charming tiny oddly-shaped terra cotta pots sitting on wooden shelves. Look to your left and right, and you see adorable soft white ball-shaped chandeliers and light brown wooden furniture. There is a bar to the left of the restaurant. The right side of the restaurant are mostly doubles, 4-tops, and some high tables with chairs. There is plenty of natural lighting thanks to an abundance of windows.I went to The Winchester on Saturday for a late brunch. The Yelp page said it was closed on weekends, but it was indeed open. I asked the hostess and manager about this. They said that was incorrect and that they'd notify Yelp. (This might be because they just started weekend breakfast/brunch service two weeks ago according to one of the hostesses.) Anyway, there was a steady stream of 20- and 30-somethings (and even a few families) dining in. Indie rock, rock, and (I wanna say) some hip-hop were piped into The Winchester providing a diverse set of beats.Our server was this model-like creature with the voice as soft and gentle as a radio disc jockey. You know, the calm kinds you'd hear at midnight right before they play some Air Supply or REO Speedwagon. I asked about their beverages and specifically the cocktails... and that's when our server dropped the bomb: 'No liquor... yet!' *collective sigh from my friend and me* So instead of booze, my friend ordered the passion fruit dream green tea ($3) and I ordered the apple seasons soda ($4). I highly recommend this. It's cold-pressed and incredibly fresh. It resembled a more fashionable version of Martinelli's cider.For food, my friend ordered the eggs benedict ($16) which came with petite waffles, braised bacon, creamed kale, and apple. Overall, the dish was fantastic... BUT (and this is a big 'but')... the eggs were overdone. Rather than having that luxurious runny yolk, the yolk was powdery and a little too firm for her liking. However, the flavors were so good together my friend was forgiving of that egg faux pas. I ordered the fried black rice ($9) which was -- not to be dramatic -- absolutely 'life-giving!' The rice was al dente and mixed with this rich coconut curry sauce. It also had butternut squash, julienned carrots, and peanuts which made the dish quite hearty. On top? Well, what else? A classic fried egg! (My yolk was runny unlike my friend's poached eggs.) I am well aware this is just rice with some simple ingredients, but sometimes these simple ingredients can make a dish extraordinary -- when executed with precision and thought. I loved, loved, loved this -- and even more astonishing? It was $9. Frankly, this plate tasted like double the cost. Knowing it was only $9 aroused me even more. 'Mmmhmm!!' And lastly, because it was a weekend, what's a weekend without breakfast meat? I ordered a side of sausage ($2.50). These delicious discs were a tad on the dry side, but the flavors made up for its 'meh'-ish consistency.The Winchester is such a gem, and I genuinely hope this stays around. Their ingredients are fresh and locally and organically grown. Their food is truly reflective of the New Midwestern cuisine blossoming in the heartland's favorite city: Chicago."
go-4-food-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/go-4-food-chicago,12/25/14 , 1 , Good food but be forewarned that portion sizes have shrunken so you're paying $12-$17 per plate for very little. Our waiter also failed to mention that unshelled shrimp is $3 more than shelled or that they charge per person for rice.
zeus-restaurant-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/zeus-restaurant-chicago-2,12/13/13 , 2 ," Let me say that I was quite hangry (hungry + angry) as it was taking a really long time for the food to be done the first time I came here.However, once the food came, it was delicious and I was really pleasantly surprised by how good it was. The gyro meat was the best I've had in Greektown and the chicken was super flavorful.I can't see myself going anywhere else next time I'm craving a gyro!"
roti-modern-mediterranean-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/roti-modern-mediterranean-chicago-4,12/09/13 , 2 ," One thing I didn't expect coming here is that it's a fast food joint. Think Qdoba or Chipotle with Mediterranean food. That being said, it was very tasty.I had a rice plate with veggies, hummus, cous-cous, tomato-cucumber salad and pita. It's a ton of food, and I didn't even come close to finishing mine. The cous-cous was my favorite. Kinda sweet with raisins. I would have liked a bigger piece of pita. My S.O. had the beef & rice plate and enjoyed it.Pretty affordable and yummy. I think ATX needs one."

Don't complain of the price if you head upstairs to have lunch, there is always the Macy's food court in the basement. This 'food hall' is only open from 11 AM to 3 PM Monday thru Saturdays. There are multiple individual stations from salads/soup, noodles by Takashi, Marc Burger, and Frontera Fresco. Usually this place i bustling at lunch and slightly more expensive than McDonald value meals. Check out my individual reviews of the restaurants to get more details!Pro- great high class lunch options, quick service.

kurah-mediterranean-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kurah-mediterranean-chicago-2,11/23/14 , 1 ," Upscale Lebanese-inspired Mediterranean tapas in the South Loop? YES!We had reservations for 3 at 6:30 but were late and there wasn't too many people inside so we were seated right away.The décor of the restaurant is really interesting. It felt like I was in a middle eastern café, but had a nice modern touch to it. It's a small space but it was used efficiently, yet not uncomfortably. There's an upstairs as well!Our server gave us a run-down of the tapas-style menu and explained how certain items come out in no particular order, and that to get enough food for everyone we should order a lot of different things. She was very helpful and polite, great service!Here's what we had:-Hummus: This was fantastic, hands down probably the best hummus I've ever had anywhere, period!-Falafel: Thick, seasoned well and still piping hot, fresh out of the fryer with a just-as-yummy dipping sauce!-Kifta kabob: Unique spices and flavors with a little kick.-Beef and Lamb Shawarma: Similar to the Kifta above but more mild.-Eggplant flatbread: Also really great, the olive relish was amazing, it reminded me of a light pizza but with more exotic flavors.There was also rice and various veggies served with the two meat dishes, which had a special seasoning on them as well, much better than your average rice accompaniment, I was picking for every last grain on the plate!I tried a recommended Lebanese red wine, the 'Massaya' which went great with our meal, it was unusually tasty and I might look into obtaining a bottle for myself!We also had dessert which consisted of Turkish coffee and cheesecake balls. The coffee was very strong, just how it's supposed to be! The cheesecake balls were also decadent.Overall we really enjoyed everything we had. The only problem I have is the price to portion ratio. We spent a little over $30 each after taxes, drinks and tip, but were not exactly full after everything was said and done. If you really want a lot of food here, I do recommend getting at least 1 'shared plate' per person and at least 2-3 other items.Other than that, I thought the food at Kurah was fantastic. Unique Mediterranean cuisine in an upscale setting, I think you will be hard-pressed to find anything similar.I do recommend and will most certainly be back, solid 4/5!"
four-moon-tavern-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/four-moon-tavern-chicago,04/28/12 , 1 ," Came back here on a recent Friday night - we stayed from about 10 pm-1 am and there were a decent amount of people in, but not so many that it felt crowded.  The crowd is lively and easygoing.  We managed to snag a table in the back, it's a bit quieter and more subdued back there.  We had several good beers from their solid list, but the best thing about this place is the flippin JUKEBOX!  Stones, Joni Mitchell, Tom Waits, Mumford and Sons, Elvis, Black Keys, and....wait for it....FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS.  Playing 'Inner City Pressure' and 'It's Business Time' basically made my night.  Also the jukebox is hella cheap and you can actually hear your songs played.  How novel!All the food specials on the wall sounded uber delicious.  I know I liked my pizza last time so I will have to return for more food.  We're so glad to be back in the neighborhood, because this place is still pretty awesome!"
ruxbin-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ruxbin-chicago,01/27/14 , 2 ," My friends LOVE Ruxbin, so I was excited to give this place a whirl. Unfortunately, while I enjoyed the food, nothing outstanding or amazing comes to mind.+Sure, they've got a neat bathroom that's got a darkroom door and endless music posters.+Yeah, you can have your bottle of wine delivered to your table, since they're BYOB-only.+OK, the food and service are pretty good.Maybe I've become jaded with my food experiences (woe is me, I know), so nothing spectacular happened here. Definitely stop by, but keep the expectations in check."
fork-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fork-chicago-2,07/11/14 , 2 ," This joint was selected as a girl's night out venue, and it did not disappoint!They have a lovely outdoor patio, so get there early and park your butt at one of those tables to enjoy the food, vino, and people watching.A friend ordered the sangria, and we were so enamored with its unique cinnamon-y, clove-y flavor, it was wonderfully unique and delicious.  Then, we had the wine flights.  Oh, the wine flights.  At one point there were so many glasses of wine at our table that there was hardly room for food.  I'm OK with that!  The server was really attentive and very knowledgeable about the wine, which I truly appreciate.For food my friend ordered the bacon-wrapped dates which she reported to be amazing.  I also had the asparagus flatbread (very tasty) and the mushroom grits.  The grits were outstanding and included a poached egg.  There's nothing more delicious than creamy grits with a heavenly, perfectly-poached egg sitting at the very top.Like I said, the service was very attentive and helpful and I will absolutely be back!"
tabaq-restaurant-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tabaq-restaurant-chicago-3,08/19/12 , 2 ," A solid 3.5 stars if it was possible.  Cabbie fare.  Dive.  Curries & naan with decent biryani.It was a random Monday night and I thought I was headed into the city to meet a friend for a few drinks.  Unbeknownst to me, he needed to feed as well.  Frontier was closed as were so many other spots I wanted to go to, since we were driving past, my buddy suggested here.  My buddy is a fan of cabbie joints, I can't say that I'm much of one.  The place is open 24 hours and there's a Middle Eastern kabobs and shawarma joint next door that is also open the same hours.  This place gets cabbie traffic often and you can see a few parked in front.The distinct smell of bathroom disinfectant was detected as we entered, though it was heavily masked with the smells of curries.  That one detail was enough to send me running but my buddy persisted that we try.  See, cabbie joints, much of the time are not that great.  It's substandard food, always available and the cost to me is typically paid with discomfort and a lot of gas.  Moving on.  There was a language barrier that dude was trying to sell me.  Probably horse shit, since I specified I was ordering for my buddy and I WAS NOT EATING.  I told this dude three times what the order was and that I wasn't eating.  It's cafeteria style, so you place your order and when its ready, pay upon pick up.  They might fill the plate off the line and serve it up immediately, depending on the options chosen.  My buddy got his stuff and paid.  Then indicated to me that the counter guy was calling for me.  This dude prepared a combination platter of curry, naan and a plate of biryani!  He's motioning like I ordered it.  I didn't.  After some back and forth, I took the damn plate and paid twice as much as my friend did.  Good thing he paid and once I looked over the food, a part of me was cuisine curious.I want to tell you that I hated it.  But I didn't.  It had taste and a nice level of spicy to it.  The mutton curry could have had more meat and less bones but in a cabbie joint, this is expected.  Between the curries, Mutton curry was best.  We also had some chicken curry which was a standard good.  The naan was prepared fresh and hot.  The biryani was that tri-colored bullshit but it had a good flavor to it and was moist, although it had too many bones.  Often times tri-colored biryani sucks balls because it lacks moisture, enough paste that gives it flavor and meat.  Restauranteurs think that a customer would be wowed with its color.  Which is why biryani is best ordered at a 4 or 5 star restaurant or at someones home, its seldom tri-color then.  Despite what any Indian person tells you, (because we all think we know better) in my experience the best biryani is made by some Muslims, some Vellore Tamilians and if you like it hella spicy, peeps from Andhra.  This is a Muslim joint and I'm telling you, this one time I tried it, it was pretty good.Earlier I mentioned cabbies galore and what else? Well within the restaurant is a stairway leading downstairs to a prayer room.  It happened to be Ramadan when we dined.  During Muslim holiday / fast, their eating times are observed and food is served accordingly.  A home made sign was made and posted in the window.  I mention this factoid mainly because I realize that some people may choose to avoid a place due to the practice of religion.  I say, if you are willing to try, say a prayer and dig in.  While we ate we could hear their prayers recited as well as echos from the satellite television news speaking of current affairs happening abroad.  At the front of the restaurant is an odd placement of a counter with an attendant selling what looks like aftermarket cell phone supplies.Their attempt to 'catch-all' business."
table-donkey-and-stick-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/table-donkey-and-stick-chicago,03/10/14 , 1 ," There is something wrong here. With all the fabulous food in Chicago, how does this place hang?You know the ingredients that are added simple to be whimsical and different but without a purpose? That is the epitome of this place. Everything is weird - not weird in a good way (like hmm, that looks interesting, I should try that), but weird in a way where you get to an ingredient in the dish and change you mind and move to the next.We met two other couples here on a Saturday night. The restaurant is pretty small and lacks charm or warmth. We ordered soft pretzels with the cauliflower cheese sauce that were delicious and enjoyed a bottle of brut rose (our first choice of wine was not available) as we pondered the menu. Nothing was jumping out at me, and even the descriptions had me worried.We started with a cheese plate for the table and some roasted carrots. When it came to entrees, my husband ordered the steak, and I got the sweet potato soup and planned on having a bit of his.Soup was an elaborate presentation that felt flat on the flavor. There was sweet note, and a crumbly smokey substance, but nothing that impressed me. I grabbed a piece of my husband's steak and cut through gristle and fat. The meat was low quality and cold when served. It was served with a smokey kale that I enjoyed, but other than the leafy garnish, we were both highly disappointed. There is no room for sub-par steak in Chicago.One of our dining companions had the duck which he took one bite of and declared he didn't like it.Since none of us were particularly thrilled with our meals, we ordered a carafe of wine and looked at the dessert menu. There was three desserts and all were odd. One had celery, one had pig parts, and the other had gorgonzola. WTF? That is not a dessert menu, that is a joke. The waiter mentioned they had walnut maple ice cream and we ordered it, only to be told they were out. We ended up ordering the celery dessert which was straight up gross. I'm a food lover and I have a sweet tooth and I couldn't stomach this. We ordered an aperitif and again...out! Who does the ordering here? Why put it on the menu only to explain to guests that you were actually mistaken?I may be missing the point, but this place is not good. I haven't had many bad meals in Chicago, but this nears the top of the list. Did I mention it was expensive? $180 for our portion (2 people)...yikes!"
francescas-on-chestnut-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/francescas-on-chestnut-chicago,12/16/13 , 1 ," Both times I went here it was originally to go to the wine bar, but it was closed for private parties. The good - the calamari  the beef carpaccio (best thing I had here)and the salmon. The second time I had pasta with asparagus and shrimp and it was OK. I wasn't all that blown away by it. I personally prefer Forno over this place, but if you're in the hood and looking for Italian this will hit the spot. They have a happy hour deal that features a $5 menu until 7 PM. I will be back again to check out the wine bar in the basement - fingers crossed it will be open this time!"
naf-naf-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/naf-naf-grill-chicago,10/31/14 , 2 ," There MUST be something good going on inside because I can NEVER get in this location. The line is ALWAYS out the door and spills onto the sidewalk.  I give them a generous 3 stars today, only because I can only imagine how good they are.  They will probably receive five once I can confirm it.  :)"
the-burger-point-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-burger-point-chicago,10/18/12 , 2 ," Finally came around to trying Burger Point! Service can be a bit slow but it was no biggie. My friend and I each ordered a burger with an order of fries and drink; it came out to approximately $12 per person. It's not exactly cheap considering you can also get a burger at the nearby McD's for half the price. BUT, BP serves their burgers with grass-fed patties. That's quality for you health-conscience foodies out there!I had the six ounce gobbler. It may not sound like a lot but that food baby dragged me home and knocked me out cold on the couch for a good two hours. The burger was a pile of turkey patty, Philly cream cheese and cranberry reduction sitting atop a 100% whole wheat roll. It sounds oh-so-healthy as it slaps mounds of calories onto your diet. Mmm...waters my mouth as I recall the burger... Basically, if you enjoy Thanksgiving/turkey dinners, you would enjoy this burger. And while you're at it, it won't hurt anymore to get the combo with fries! Although I wish the fries wouldn't be so thin and stringy."
homestead-on-the-roof-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/homestead-on-the-roof-chicago,11/18/13 , 1 ," Wish I'd gone when the weather was still warm so I could sit in their outdoor terrace, because it looks so adorable. But at least they're open during the winter months too!Started out with the Devil Within cocktail, which was too syrupy. The food was much better. As other reviewers have mentioned: get the walleye! It was beautifully cooked in a light citrusy sauce. We also shared the bread basket, frika, short rib sugo, clam bake and chicken skins. I was a bit wary about the chicken skins, but it was wonderfully crispy and not at all greasy. The spicy sauce it came with had quite a kick but absolutely addictive. The sugo (pappardelle) tasted nice but was a bit too rich...if I had to finish that bowl by myself it'd have been difficult. Clam bake was way too salty and the clams were chewy. The frika was quite refreshing but the bread basket seemed over-priced for what it offered.For desserts, we ordered one of everything: beets, pear, pistachio and apple. The chocolate components that came with the beet ice cream were nice, though beets in desserts is still something I need to get used to. The pear was paired with ginger flavors, which is a classic combination, but the delicate pear flavor disappeared under the over-aggressive ginger marinade. I thought the pistachio and apple desserts felt kinda flat.In summary, although I love the farm-to-table concept, some of the dishes here were out of balance and could use a bit more finesse. Nevertheless, I'd happily return for the walleye and maybe the duck two ways?"
coyotes-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/coyotes-restaurant-chicago,03/30/14 , 2 ," I have only been here once, but the steak quesadilla was delicious!  This is the perfect place to hit up after being out on a late night in Pilsen"
takito-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/takito-kitchen-chicago,09/02/14 , 1 ," Came here on a Friday at 8pm with a reservation for 5 ppl. The place was only half full. So, if you are looking for last minute dinner plans with no wait, this is a good option. They have a little outdoor seating section that works well for large groups since they are pretty much like picnic tables. Very low-key, casual atmosphere they've got going on.I had the cucumber margarita, which was nice and refreshing and not overly sweetened. The elotes is really good, but the cost is pretty steep at $5 for one ear of corn. I would pass on the salsas. It was more like a puree. I would've liked them more if it had more texture and was chunkier. We had the tomatillo pistachio and the tomato hibiscus ghost pepper, which wasn't even hot. The masa crackers had cute luchadore  mask imprints of on them, but I would have preferred something lighter and less dense to eat with the 'salsa.' The barbacoa taco was my favorite and was the most flavorful. The crispy fish and the fried chicken taco were okay. And the alaskan king crab taco was very bland, skip that. I'd like to add, these are the smallest tortillas I have ever seen.. ever. However, they do fit a lot of filling onto each tortilla. I was stuffed after 3 tacos."
