burnt-city-brewing-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/burnt-city-brewing-chicago,02/17/14 , 2 ," The wait for Batter and Berries across the street was over an hour... no way that was happening.Although Atlas didn't have brunch food, the menu still looked good and there was plenty of space for 9 people!To sum up this gastro-pub: great beer, huge portionsHalf-orders of mussels and oysters can easily be split among 2 people.Grilled oysters were perfect - you can still taste the fresh oysters, but kissed with the flame and delicious vinaigrette.Sausage mussels should be renamed to jambalaya with mussels on top so if you want to be stuffed, order this. There's barely a broth to soak the bread in, mostly rice.Jambalaya is also barely a stew, more of a rice dish (but still good).Bahn Mi pizza is more exciting than it sounds - turned out too dry.Fried pickles are good - they fry the entire spear.Poutine is a huge appetizer, great for sharing.Wings are goodChili is good (they put dark chocolate in it!!)Bloody marys are good at first but I got tired of mine halfway through, probably not mixed well enough."
the-southern-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-southern-chicago,11/19/14 , 1 ," Went here last night with a friend for dinner. We had a reservation and were seated right away. It definitely looks like it would be a blast in the summer where you could sit in the outdoor courtyard. This was not a lovely summer night, however. It was downright frigid out. But no worries, it was cozy inside. We were seated at a high top table near the 'wall', which was actually a rolling door that would be open in warmer times. There was a little bit of a draft but it wasn't uncomfortable.Enough of that - the food! So good. Everything we ordered was divine. We started with the mac and cheese, which is enormous. Bring your appetite! Creamy with a crunchy crumb topping. We had to force ourselves to stop eating it so we'd have room for our dinner.She had the shrimp and grits. I had the fried chicken sandwich, which a special. The chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Because we had the mac and cheese to start, I wasn't overly concerned with my side. So I just got fries thinking I would eat a couple and move on. They were super yummy too!The cocktails were nice too. I had an Old Fashioned, which hit the spot as my liquid dessert.I can't wait to go back in the summer, but I might not be able to wait that long!"
chicken-works-and-salad-company-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chicken-works-and-salad-company-chicago,07/15/13 , 2 ," After a pretty stressful day I stopped by Chicken Works because I love chicken. I love a well prepared chicken and having it chargrilled and marinated well that will pick my day up anytime. I got the soup and sandwich special and then got mac and cheese as well since all their sides are homemade.It does take a little time since they're cooking the chicken when ordered. The pita was tasty, maybe not so healthy with the mayo they put on it but at the point that it hit my lips I didn't really care too much about it. The soup: chicken and rice that bland, diner staple was really good, with the cream texture not drowning out the decent chicken pieces in there. The mac and cheese though, was just okay, but from the looks of the other customers the dirty rice is the side dish to get."
county-barbeque-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/county-barbeque-chicago,01/31/14 , 2 ," Love the southern huntsman meets revolutionary chic decor.  Black walls and plaid accents contrasted with re-purposed lighting fixtures and real, weathered & worn All-America flags for art deco on the walls.I ordered a Bottoms Up draft beer, a rotating special, while the hubs went for soda.  Eek, ain't no fountain drinks it's soda from a can!  At $1.75/can I would rather drink the booze.The hubs ordered the special pulled pork sandwich (non-traditional menu item), it came with mustard BBQ sauce, B&B pickles, slaw and side of fries.  I went with the Kansas City burnt ends brisket, thinking it would be a big ol' manly plate of meat.  It was served with slaw and B&B pickles.  Our food came and I was initially surprised by the smaller than expected portions, the brisket was 1/3 the size of the sandwich.  Since when is southern comfort/BBQ fare served in a smaller portion?The burnt ends were okay, but far from 'burnt'.  They were more chewy and fatty ends.  Maybe it was too early in the day and the true burning crusts start accumulating by the late afternoon?  I tried the trio of homemade BBQ sauces with my brisket and was left disappointed in all of them.  They were too similar, all were VERY vinegary and very peppery and the spicy was not spicy at all.  Ultimately, I preferred the brisket sans sauce, but the smokey BBQ flavors were pretty mild IMHO.  The hubby's sandwich was okay, but it was also smaller than expected.  The fries were fresh, but I thought they tasted not much better than McDonald's fries at the very best if you added parsley flakes.Overall I left longing to go to St Louis for some Pappy's, it is without a doubt a hard BBQ place to live up to and this wasn't a good substitute."
cafe-bella-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-bella-chicago,08/13/14 , 1 ," I purchased a restaurant certificate and my husband happened to be on the Monclare neighborhood doing a service call, so we drove here for a quick lunch.  The atmosphere was welcoming even though it was a bit dark.  We ordered a salmon sandwich, steak fajita sandwich, and a large chai tea.  First of all, the chai tea was to die for.  It kinda had a similarity to Mexican horchata, which I like it a lot.  It had just the right balance of chai and spice to it.  The salmon sandwich was made to order.  The ingredients were fresh.  I can specifically tasted the avocado.  I like the fact that there was a strong emphasis on using fresh veggies and ingredients.  It was filling for me while I wasn't feeling over-stuffed!  There was a free wifi available and I asked the server the password.  It didn't work for me, but the food came quickly so it didn't spend much time on playing with my I-pad mini.  I will be back whenever I'm in the Logan square neighborhood."
fulton-market-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fulton-market-kitchen-chicago,05/10/14 , 2 ," Drinks were averageFood was pretty good-great presentationMusic was good-live djLounge areaCool new spotService was awesome-manager was great!Space is actually kinda small/medium (High ceilings make it feel bigger)To be honest we went there to check out the space and the ambiance and to be honest it was alright- maybe my expectations were too high. Yes there is unique art on the wall and some key focal points but nothing AMAZING... felt a little let down by the space. Pictures def make it look more interesting than it actually is-which is why I gave it a lower rating.Will we be back? Eh, maybe. I've experienced it. Nothing particularly enticed us to want to come back"
leghorn-chicken-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/leghorn-chicken-chicago,04/11/14 , 1 ," If there's such a thing as a hipster chicken sandwich shack this is it. Don't wear the attire though unless you want to be busting through your skinny jeans cause these babies aren't easy on your waistline.For 6 bucks you get a deliciously fried breast or thigh with your choice of pickled brine or Nashville hot sauce on a bun or biscuit. Between the birds, the greasy fries, and hush puppies it doesn't take a nutritionist to conclude that it aint health food. However if you're hung over or just don't care about getting diabetes then Leghorn definitely satisfies even the most intense of comfort food cravings.They're BYOB and cash only with an ATM on site so grab a 6 pack and your bankcard and be prepared for some Looney Toon like tastiness."
bread-and-wine-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bread-and-wine-chicago,10/23/14 , 1 , It was great.  Had the feel of high end places in Lincoln Park where we used to live.  Wine selection is great and prices are not that bad either.  I really enjoyed the decor and the staff was very helpful.  Nice size parking lot with free parking to boot!  Highly recommended.Burger and Pork Chop were both excellent!  Chocolate Mousse!!!
thai-bowl-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-bowl-chicago,12/11/13 , 1 ," This is a very reasonable Thai place near UIC. Their pad Thai and most other bowls we tried are pretty solid, service is fast if not courteous (but hey, it's a small cheap lunch restaurant, what do you expect?).Prices are okay.I wouldn't go here for a real dinner, it's a quick and solid place to get warm food at lunchtime."
glenns-diner-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/glenns-diner-chicago,03/24/14 , 1 ," This place is awesome!! Went in on a Saturday night at 7pm without a reservation and got a seat at the bar with only a 15 minute wait. The wait for a table would've been 30 minutes, but bf and I were really hungry so we sat at the bar.The calamari appetizer was okay, very different from other calamari I've ever had. The taste and texture was a bit like mozzarella sticks.Bf had the Scottish salmon which was perfectly cooked and had a nice honey mustard sauce on top. I had the New Orleans BBQ shrimp. OMG this dish was amazing!!!!! It had a perfect balance of flavors! Make sure you get all that flavor off the bowl with the flattened bread.Service was alright, our waitress could've been more friendlier but the food was amazing, so that part is forgiven. Can't wait to go back for brunch and other dinner entrees!"
derby-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/derby-chicago,11/23/13 , 1 ," BURGER BINGE WEEKYelp and several Chicago locations were holding a Burger week that included $5 burgers with a Yelp Check in.The Derby was one of those locations offering the special. The promotion was great because it made me want to go out and try new places and the Derby made my list.When you walk in you first will notice that the bar is really beautiful. The bartender also greeted me immediately. That is great customer service.  Across from the bar is a line of comfy booths that are built up a little higher. I like this personal touch because it gets you off the floor and your table above the 'ass line'. Don't look up that word cause I'm sure I just made it up. The 'ass line' is the area in a crowded bar where your face and food meet the ass of a complete stranger. I hate those places. So don't worry The Derby Booths are above that line. That's 5 stars alone!Our waitress Rebecca was really nice. She made sure we all checked in on Yelp before she gave us out deal. She was funny as I tried to secure a strong enough signal to actually check in. Those Metal Ceilings in bars can make cell phone coverage hard. She was just about to let me go then I finally got checked in. There was a countdown that informed me I had 4 hours to use the deal. I felt like Jack Bauer in 24 but I knew I wasn't going to need that much time to enjoy the burger here.So I put my order in for the Derby Burger. Which is a Hand crafted chorizo/beef blend patty that is then topped with pepper jack cheese, pulled house smoked Carolina BBQ pork, bacon, coleslaw and onion strings on a pretzel bun. I also suggest a fork lift because your gonna need that to get it into your mouth. Normally the burger is $12. It also comes with a choice of side. I went tater tots and the rest of my group went Mac'nCheese. The tots were fantastic and perfectly cooked with a nice crunch. But I did hear some big time compliments for the Mac'nCheese from my table. So next time I'm going there.Now on to the burger. I actually ordered it Medium which was cooked perfect. I am normally a medium rare guy but raw chorizo worried me. I could hardly taste any difference in the meat meaning the chorizo did not over power the beef but complimented the meat mixture. I really liked that. The toppings were fantastic too. I also forgot to mention they threw on lettuce, tomato and red onion. Yeah I really needed that fork lift and possibly a crane to lift the burger. I decided there was no wrong way and I grabbed the burger by both hands and dived it.  All I can say is Wow! All of the toppings blended into this perfect flavor explosion. I was also amazed at how well the bun held everything in. I only had a few pieces of pulled pork fall out and that was it. 5 stars to the chef for building this beauty of a burger.There were also drink specials too on a Tuesday. Corona in a bottle was $3. So I decided to grab a few of those. I love beer specials in a bar because it just makes me feel good. Beer is good but beer on sale just tastes better. There was also a giant margarita special for $8 with a Corona tipped in it. Those are the latest craze.Rebecca our waitress was really good. She knew the menu and kept our table full of drinks and food. I also met the GM and he was a nice guy. We talked about the room next door. There was a guy playing acoustic music but I could only see him & not hear him. I loved that the rooms were sound proof from each other. On a side note there's acoustic music here on Tuesday night. Our side of the bar had regular music on and plenty of games on the air. The poor Blackhawks did not fair that well tonight. The high altitude of Colorado is no place to skate competitively.This place was great because of the amazing food, fun staff, comfy booths and quantity of TVs on the wall. I would come back to hang and eat. The bar is located near DePaul but it wasn't packed with college students. It seemed more classier then a college bar and looked nicer. So I am glad Yelp ran a Burger Week Special because if they hadn't I would have never found The Derby."
janes-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/janes-chicago,11/05/12 , 1 ," I finally returned for dinner this past weekend and it was excellent. I love the dim lighting, with candles and exposed brick. Its such an intimate atmosphere, and the fact that the tables are right on top of one another (only downfall of the evening) as I found myself easily distracted by our dining companions next to us! Focus, Kori!On to the food, I had the scallops, which A. were cooked perfectly and B. were paired with this awesome green curry risotto. It was creamy, but not overly heavy. I ate my entire plate. My date had that porkchop and it was huge with a whopping pile of mashed sweet potatoes underneath. He was also a member of the clean plate club.Our waitress was super friendly and attentive, but not in a pesky way, which was nice as we leisurely drank and ate our food. I will definitely be back to Janes for either brunch or dinner, they definitely have an excellent thing going there."
uncommon-ground-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/uncommon-ground-chicago,03/31/14 , 2 ," Uncommon Ground is dumb.Every time I'm dragged there, I roll my eyes.  You pay a 50% premium for their local, organic, tofu nonsense.  Exceptional food is worth an exceptional price, but Uncommon Ground's food is just run-of-the-mill.My lady and I showed up for brunch around 1 p.m. on a Sunday.  The place was moderately busy.  We waited 45 minutes for our food.  Literally.  45 minutes.I ordered the burger, which was fine, but fairly bland.  The only reason it tasted like anything is because I ordered bacon with it.  My burger came with a lone lettuce leaf and three sad, wilted, soft things that were supposed to be 'pickles.'My girl's hash browns were cold.  Think how long it takes for freakin' *potatoes* to cool down.Our server was nice and apologetic, but seriously, this restaurant is a joke.  On our last visit, our server disappeared between taking our order and dropping off the check.  We had to flag down bus boys to get water refills and condiments.If you have a raging vegan boner for Whole Foods, enjoy your 45-minute wait.  If you have the ability to separate marketing from quality, there are a million better restaurants in the city."
lulus-hot-dogs-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lulus-hot-dogs-chicago,08/18/10 , 1 ," I went to try out Lulu's on my quest for the best Italian beef sandwich in Chicago and Lulu's gave me a pleasant surprise. I was expecting it to be a place where the hot dogs are good (which they are) and everything else kinda sub-par but I was wrong. The beef was so fresh and juicy. The sandwich was stuffed with beef, not like the skimpy ones you see at Al's Beef. The seasoning was amazing. The service was great as well. They remembered us when we came back the next day to feed our addictions. They also have a hot dog special with two everything hot dogs and fries for under 5 bucks. Who can beat that!? I will definitely be returning many more times. I am no longer going to waste my money at Al's (or leave with greasy hands because Lulu's has a bathroom unlike Al's). Lulu's here I come! One word of warning... they sometimes close earlier than 1 am on the weekends... I learned the hard way and had to settle for a burrito on Friday :(."
rivers-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rivers-chicago,07/21/14 , 1 , Came here after work with my office and it was a good time.It was such a beautiful day we insisted on sitting outside but the thing is they do no reserve outdoor seating-lame. So the 15 of us scrambled to find a table big enough to accompany us outside; we did at about 6pm as people started to end their after work drinks/dinner.Also weird they didnt have a specialty cocktail list- invest in that.The view was also very nice- its always nice to sit by the Chicago river in the middle of the loop. Although as time went on maybe around 730-8 it started to smell fishy...talk about appetizing.One thing that stood out was the Terkayi Meat and the buffalo chicken bites!! TRY IT!!!
el-metro-chicago-8,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-metro-chicago-8,12/06/14 , 1 ," Average tacos that are overpriced.Ordered six tacos and the elote dish. Got six tacos with zero elote dishes. Nobody else was in the restaurant at the time, so there should have been little confusion about my full take-out order. Later, I realized that I did not pay for the elote, therefore, no overall harm done.The fish tacos were good, but at $4, I was a touch unimpressed.This place is a cash only business, which is frustrating.The decor on the inside of the restaurant is fun.I will be back a couple of more times to try the rest of the menu. Hoping for better results next time."
weather-mark-tavern-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/weather-mark-tavern-chicago-3,04/19/14 , 2 ," Wow. WOW! I like sailors, and I like cocktails. And I like fish frys. BOOM!!! Weathermark has it all!Went here for the first time yesterday. A couple Mount Gay Rum and tonics and ALL YOU CAN EAT FISH FRY! Cruzan Rum battered Cod with red cabbage salad and homemade dill tartar sauce. DELICIOUS! Also some bottle  beers are on special for $3.The fish was battered with a delightfully crispy batter. Not heavy or overly oily. And the fish . . . mmmmmoist, plump chunks of delicious Cod. Big fan of cod. With plenty of Malt Vinegar and homemade dill tartar sauce - so good. Steak fries, crispy outside, moist inside. Perfect. ALL YOU CAN EAT, bring us three more filets, please! Oh, and more of the dill tartar sauce - that stuff is out of this world good.The red cabbage salad was delicious too, dressed in a savory mayonnaise type dressing, but not overdone. Not some throwaway side salad coleslaw, I'd order this by itself.Friendly place with a sailing theme. Real sails separate couch areas for groups of friends to gather and talk about DUMPING THAT FLYING JUNIOR, BABY!! The owner was a friendly guy, and very proud of his establishment, rightly so.Fun for seasoned sailors and rail meat alike, I'll be back."
old-town-social-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/old-town-social-chicago,07/31/14 , 2 ," We went here for some drinks on a Wednesday night after our The Second City comedy show  and ended up closing the place down. Not a whole lot of people, and since the place is quite large, we felt like we had our own comfy enclave. I love the decor and dim lighting and would love to come back for group meetings, after work drinks, pre-gaming, post-gaming, a nightcap, or raging when it gets more crowded on the weekends. It's large enough to support big crowds, providing various areas for you to post up.Cool cocktails, rotating local-ish beers on-tap, and other liquors to satisfy your heart's desire. The food was pretty good from the late night bites menu. Duck wings and the mini Chicago dogs were highlights for me. I wish they did tacos late night but the wings and dogs were good enough for a snack. They also had house-made charcuterie but I did not like their take on a Mortadella. It was too dry and thick-sliced for my taste.All in all a cool spot to get a drink and some food at. Great neighborhood bar or if you're in the Old Town or Lincoln Park area!"
kumas-too-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kumas-too-chicago,04/13/14 , 2 ," All of the joy of the original Kuma's with none of the wait!Well to be fair, not ALL of the joy. The charm and personality of the original location is obviously missing. The music isn't blasting AS loudly, the art on the walls is slightly less bondage-y, and there are no TVs playing gorey/sci-fi flicks. There's no feeling of triumph when finally, after 90 minutes of agony, your name is called because your table is finally ready.HOWEVER, sometimes, when you don't have a whole evening to wait patiently for that glorious burger, you can look past all that. Especially since, in my humble opinion, the food, drinks, and service is PRECISELY the same as the original locale. I've come here a handful of times since they opened, and everything has been just the way I love it - truly medium rare burgers, packed with the familiar, metal-named toppings, the delicious potato chips and homemade ketchup, etc. I've come here with a group of 6 - a horrifying possibility at the original location - and waited 15 minutes ON A FRIDAY NIGHT. WHAT?! Seriously, WHAT?! It's amazing.I brought an out of town colleague here on Wednesday night and we were one of maybe 10 tables in the place. It was a perfect way to show him the best of Chicago without being out till midnight. He got the Metallica and loved it. I got the special of the month, the Valkyrie - a burger with battered, deep fried pancetta, herbed cream cheese, bruschetta and fresh basil, and it was AMAZING.I'll always love the original Kuma's, but this is a great way to get the same food for an extraordinarily shorter wait."
standard-market-grill-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/standard-market-grill-chicago,09/06/13 , 1 ," I was really happy to see a new restaurant occupying the fantastic spot right at Clark and Fullerton. Being as I live only 1 block away, it would be amazing to have a restaurant I'm in love with! I have been here 3 times (all of which I sat at the bar). Last night I finally tried the food. I don't care much for their concept of ordering at a counter. If you sit at the bar you can avoid that altogether. However, it is annoying to see a line forming to order food while you're trying to enjoy a nice glass of wine.I do love the ambience a lot! This will be my destination for cocktails. Plus their water station is to die for.The service has been great most of the time. We did get ignored for about 15 minutes one time but ill write that off as 'working out the kinks' since they're new. Management noticed the issue and bought us a round for being patient. Props.Their menu will work for the neighborhood. My friend had the lobster roll and I tried the chicken sandwich. The pretzel roll was amazing and I loved their cole slaw. My friend liked her sandwich as well.Overall I like what they've done with the space. It's very appealing."
tank-noodle-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tank-noodle-chicago,09/15/14 , 2 ," Little Vietnam is part of the Uptown District of Chicago which is just beneath Rogers Park, the most diverse unified region in the country.Yet there is nothing diverse about Argyle. Pho, Viet market, Pho, electronics store, Banh Mi bakery, Pho, florist, Viet market, Pho...Argyle is laid out like a pattern blanket in which every fifth stripe is a Pho restaurant.Of such restaurants, the one that has attracted the most attention in the yelp-sphere [probably, in part, because of it's travel-channel fist bump] is Tank Noodle. While Tank Noodle may have a menu the length of a short novella, it is clear that most people come for the Pho...I ordered the standard Pho, Beef noodle soup combination with sliced beef, brisket, tendon, bible tripe and meat ball. The meat was tender and in good proportion. The broth...full of flavor, aroma and fat.To wash down this satisfying, albeit unorthodox, brunch, I ordered So Da Chanh Duong, sparkling lime juice over ice.One noteworthy complaint...While I do not expect a chic and modern ambiance when I indulge in a bowl of Pho, I would prefer a clean experience.The entire stack of soup spoons at our communal table seemed like they could have used another run through the washer."
ajida-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ajida-chicago,08/28/14 , 1 ," This was the first time I was introduced to 'fancy' ramen, as my friend calls it. It was delicious.The place is a little small and pricey but the service was quick and the portions are huge. I would like to tell you the name of my dish but I have no idea. I can tell you it had udon noodles and chicken swimming in a pork and chili broth. Perfection. I do wish there was more protein, but that's just me. I would absolutely come here again."
blackies-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blackies-chicago-4,12/15/14 , 1 ," I haven't been here for food, and not sure I would necessarily eat here, but for a bar option in the Printers Row area of the South Loop, Blackies isn't too bad afterall!I had been hesitant to try this place because it doesn't look the most inviting from the outside, despite the fact that it has actually been in business a long long time according to their signage. Inside, however, they actually have pretty nice looking wooden tables and a full bar and a friendly bar tender, which is really all you need for a little neighborhood spot. They have different drink specials every day too, like $12 house bottles of wine on Wednesdays I think? And then $1 watermelon shots and other bottled beer specials too. We were here late in the night and there was a large group of people who clearly had been there for quite some time, counting down all together as a happy group for their group shots which I loved. And on game days, this bar is also usually pretty packed as people eat/drink on their way to the game and there is a decent after work crowd here too.Plus in nice weather time, their patio is set up which is dog friendly, which is also something you have to love about the printers row area of the southloop."
horizon-cafe-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/horizon-cafe-chicago,12/12/14 , 1 ," One of my friends lives down on LSD, so I yelped (is to yelp in the dictionary yet?) his address and ended up finding out that this gem was located just around the corner from his place!We entered the establishment around 12:50, and there were a few people in the diner but it was not crowded. The restaurant was smaller than I expected.Horizon is a typical diner serving breakfast and lunch. My friend decided on the Spicy Jalapeno Jack Burger, which was served with a side of fries and option for soup (he upgraded to the chili, which looked excellent and ended up being so). His burger was cooked medium to his liking. The fries were crinkle cut and the entrée also featured a side of cole slaw.I decided on breakfast fare, which is my go to option at these type of places. I ordered the vegetarian delight omelet (I smell omelette as such, but their menu has it listed the other way). I had it prepared with egg beaters, and I also opted for a side of fruit in lieu of hash browns. There's also an option for toast, but I upgraded to the pumpkin pancakes. My only complaint for my meal was that the fruit on the side was super small! As for the omelette and pancakes... they were fantastic! I prefer baked omelettes over pan fried ones, but this one seemed to be the latter. It still was quite large and loaded with veggies (Spinach, Mushrooms, Onions, Tomatoes, and Green Peppers). The cakes were very tasty as well. Two pancakes, not too small but not overly large either.Aside from the previously mentioned small fruit bowl, our drinks were empty for most of our meal, which was a drag, but it's not going to put a huge damper on my overall experience.My friends live around the corner from this place, and I definitely believe I'll be back in the future."
johnnys-beef-and-gyros-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/johnnys-beef-and-gyros-chicago-2,08/13/13 , 1 ," Beautiful restaurant with really reasonable prices!  The vibe is kind of 50's style diner, but more mod and fresh.  The food is excellent.  Lots of classics with a twist like the greek style fries (lemon, feta) or the cheddar bacon fries. Some of our favorites are the chicken pita and gyro.  Everything is fresh and the portions are pretty big!  Don't skip the chocolate chip cookie for dessert...it's pretty good!We are personally not brave enough to try the Big Daddy Burger, but if you are,  there is a photo wall of fame that you might be able to get your picture on!  It's two burger patties, plus toppings, plus gyro meat!Located on Lincoln at a great intersection across from John Barleycorn making it super easy to grab food and go.  There are also a few dine in tables.My only complaint is that you have to be super tall to check your teeth in the bathroom mirror after you eat!  Or maybe just taller than 5'4'...."
calumet-fisheries-chicago-4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/calumet-fisheries-chicago-4,06/02/14 , 2 ," I recently heard about Calumet Fisheries and really wanted to check it out.  This Saturday proved to be the perfect opportunity to drive down from where I work on the South Side and have lunch outdoors.  The place definitely looks like a shack on the side of the road, and I wouldn't have ever stopped inside if it weren't for the rave reviews.  We ordered fried oysters, clam strips, smoked salmon, and a few smoked shrimp.  They forgot a couple of things that we ordered, but we were ordering pretty sporadically between the one counter for fried food and the other for smoked seafood.I love, love, love seafood and especially smoked salmon.  It was pretty amazing!  The shrimp were great as well.  I wasn't a huge fan of the fried oysters, but I bet there are someone else's jam.I'm happy I got to check this place out!"

taco-joint-chicago-3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/taco-joint-chicago-3,11/15/14 , 1 ," First visit to Taco Joint and definitely not my last. Went with a friend who lives this place. We were told there was a 25 minute wait so we decided to grab spots at the bar and eat there. Strawberry hibiscus margarita is on point. We started with some guacamole while deciding what tacos to get. I went with a carnitas taco , the pancita (Saturday taco) and the baja fish taco. They were all well seasoned and flavorful. I actually ended up ordering a second carnitas taco and a second pancita they were so good. Also decided to give their dessert donuts a try and went with the tres leche donut. It was just meh. I was expecting it to be warm but it was cold and just ok.The service was ok. The bartender wasn't a great conversationalist but definitely made an effort. Overall, a good experience. Next visit, I'll skip dessert and get an extra taco."
primebar-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/primebar-chicago-2,09/12/14 , 2 ," The interior of the place was decent, a little fancy.  Seems like a good place to grab a few drinks after work.  Lunch was even pretty busy, but we luckily beat the rush at 11:30.  You sit at communal tables if you do not have a reservation.The burger was just terrible, I got the fried egg burger with bacon, thought it would be a nice juicy treat.  It was the driest shit ever.  I ordered it cooked medium and it came out well-done.  My two co-workers got the grilled cheese sandwich, which wasn't so much a grilled cheese but an egg sandwich with some cheese melted into it."
lems-bbq-house-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lems-bbq-house-chicago,10/28/11 , 1 ," This is my favorite BBQ place in the world!!!I've tried BBQ in so many cities at so many restaurants I can't even begin to list them all... but NONE have compared to Lem's BBQ rib tips. It's a destination for me whenever I'm in the Chicago area. I can't tell you how much I turn into a mindless zombie when I enter the city. It's like Aliens have cranked up a thought capturing machine and I...MUST...DRIVE...TO...LEMS!!! I can't control myself, it just happens.Lem's is not for the faint of heart because it's kinda in the hood, but it's been here for over half a century!!! You enter in off what would best be described as a back alley (just across from  an AA meeting center). There is almost always a random group of older guys standing around the streets talking about whatever old guys who stand on the street talk about.  Amazingly, they do have a decent sized parking area for such a tiny establishment. Once inside, you'll notice the thick bullet proof plexiglass with a turnabout they place your food in when you order is ready for pickup. No real seating to speak of, so plan on eating your Que in your car or back at whatever location you are staying.I'm a creature of habit, and when I like something, I order it almost every time. I have ONLY had the Rib Tips (served with GREAT steak cut fries), so I can't comment on any of their other offerings. But the Tips are SO GOOD, why would you want anything else? Do your taste buds a favor and stop in, but be forewarned: Lem's doesn't open until 2pm and is closed on Tuesday's."

vora-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vora-chicago,07/14/14 , 2 ," This place is right around the corner from my house and my Ashton Martin dealership (Lol..J/k). I can't believe I never noticed it before. The door is set a little farther back though. When we entered it was pretty much empty. The set up is so cute and trendy. I also like how you can see the chef preparing the meals in the back.Okay this is going to sound really ghetto, but I must start with the water. It was ON POINT! LOL...having infused water is not hard to do, but it does make a big difference. I have never asked for more water so many times. It was infused with cucumber and lemon. So good and refreshing!Our waitress was great. The menu has quite a bit to choose from and she explained the dishes and told us the ones that were really popular. My friend ordered the seaweed salad and a hand roll (can't remember which one) to start and she said both were tasty.In order to try more of the menu we each ordered the $15.00 Dim Sum box. The thing I was looking forward to the most (pork slider) ended up being a little too bland for my liking, but everything thing else featured in the box was pretty yummy. I wish I could tell you the names, but except for the fried roll and dumplings the rest of the names escape me. I will be visiting again because I want to try the pork belly rice."

Ñ (from Wikipedia):  Nobel Prize winner in literature Gabriel García Márquez expressed 'The 'Ñ' is not an archaeological piece of junk, but just the opposite: a cultural leap of a Romance language that left the others behind in expressing with only one letter a sound that other languages continue to express with two.'So, fitting.For the first time in all of my Chicago nightlife endeavors...I felt...content? fascinated? at ease? expressive. excited.Drinks: Join my Fantasy Cocktail League, here's my draft lineup: La Negra, served in a martini glass...basically a blackberry, blueberry, rum-laden blend of buzz.

Just overall...genuine, non-pretentious, hidden, somewhat secretive...(not so much anymore, but still)...and real people.Location: absolutely unassuming, typical 'diamond in the rough,' a stone's throw from California/Belmont intersection (Avondale). Cabs are hard to come by, keep that Flash number in your phone, ours arrived moments after calling one in (+1 Flash).Sexy. It just is. As overused as that word is...it fits. A great after dinner cocktail spot...La Negra must be on your list, I implore you."
beat-kitchen-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/beat-kitchen-chicago,02/24/14 , 1 ," So disappointing! We were walking around after our cake decorating class looking for food, and this place looked interesting so we stopped in. Right away, this place screamed chaos. There were kids running around everywhere (apparently there was a kids show in the back on Sunday morning). We couldn't tell who worked there and who didn't (the guy who sat us was carrying a baby on his back....?). The atmosphere was very divey - it seemed like more of a bar atmosphere than a restaurant.We waited a while to be seated. Finally when we were seated, we waited....and waited....and waited. No one ever came to the table! The menu had a few things that looked different/interesting (like their mango chimichurri breakfast potatoes), but nothing worth waiting around for.When we asked another couple if the food was good there, they said 'it's ok'. Our patience ran out, so we left. Totally unnoticed. Wow."
salonica-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/salonica-chicago,06/16/14 , 1 ," After an hours-long visit to the Museum of Science and Industry, we popped in for a very late lunch at Salonica after noting its proximity and decent Yelp ratings.According to Salonica's website, the diner opened in 1979, and the decor looks like it hasn't been updated since then.  Mind you, I think that's a good thing:  This is a joint with plenty of old-time Greek-diner atmosphere, and it promised hearty good food to come.The food we ordered was a mixed bag, though.  My brother-in-law ordered a basic gyro-and-fries plate, which in retrospect looks like the way to go at Salonica.  The gyro itself was generously stuffed with gyro meat and other fixings, and the handcut fries were solid (I tried some of those).  But the food my wife and I ordered wasn't so great:  I got a chicken kebab platter, which didn't seem like kebab at all but just haphazardly chopped-up, underseasoned grilled chicken breast sauteed with onions and peppers; the smaller pieces were dried out pretty badly.  The wife got a big Greek salad, which seemed to have far more iceberg than romaine lettuce.  She wasn't too thrilled about it.Salonica does have a gigantic and varied menu, so it's possible there are some gems interspersed throughout it.Our server was very pleasant and competent but the fella up front at the register, probably an owner, was almost comically sullen.  But even in this Big City of Almost Impossibly Nice People, I figure that an experience at an urban diner like Salonica wouldn't be complete without such a character.For me, Salonica falls somewhere between 3.25 and 3.5 stars."
the-dock-at-montrose-beach-chicago-2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-dock-at-montrose-beach-chicago-2,10/09/14 , 1 ," One day while sitting at home, sipping a drink on the balcony, I decided to drag my loud family out of my house to walk to the beach. I figured maybe it would tire everyone out and they'd all want to leave after we got back. We walked a few blocks down Montrose and yanked off our shoes to run in the sand. At that moment, in mid shoe rip off, I heard music. Bare footed and tipsy, the family and I ran down to the where the tunes were coming from and thats when I realized that it was The Dock! Duh! I'd totally forgotten about the place!We got there just in time to hear the last 45 minutes of the live band performing and they were awesome. They allowed my 4 year old niece to come on stage and dance with them and she loved it. Here's where my issue came in - the food was okay, but our waitress did a HORRIBLE job at explaining the menu.My Brother wanted an extra patty on his burger but the waitress failed to tell him that they would charge him the amount of another meal (almost 10 bucks) for ONE extra patty!! Maybe they skin, clean, gut and cut the meat themselves. *shrug* We also asked if the kids meal came with a beverage and although she told us yes, that wasnt the case. It didnt come with any drink and it was the same cost as everyone elses. My older niece that is about 27 ordered a meal and drink. Originally she ordered an extra order of fries but then cancelled it. However, we still got extra fries. *sigh* One of my friends ordered the fried fish and it was so bland, I almost took it over to the lake to release it back into the wild. Seriously, it was screaming for salt, pepper, anything!!!Im still a fan but next time will be sure I have a different waitress oh and Ill be sure to warn everyone to leave their burgers to one patty and one patty only!!!!!"
smalls-smoke-shack-and-more-chicago-5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/smalls-smoke-shack-and-more-chicago-5,04/27/14 , 2 ," I feel like I'm always livin large when I walk outta Smalls. Maybe it's because my apartment is probably larger than Smalls entire shack. Maybe it's because they practically know me by name now. Or maybe it's because the food is so damn delicious that I can barely stop myself from ripping open that brown paper bag as soon as it's placed in my hot little Asian hands? We may never know...But I will tell you what I do know. I am addicted to that bibimbop-you don't stoppah! Smalls does a stellar take on this Korean dish of rice, pickled veg & bbq'd meat...or in Smalls' case: BRISKET, yo! Big, flavorful, tender chunks of heavenly smoked brisket. Excuse me while I wipe the drool from my chin...Smalls serves up a mean order of fried chicken also. Served with seasoned fries, not-slaw (aka, pickles) and banana ketchup. The chicken is always cooked perfectly and served piping hot & juicy while maintaining a nice hard crunch on the outside. Admittedly, I can take or leave the fries. Sometimes I like the anise spice and sometimes I'm just not about it but I do dig their banana ketchup.Pulled pork. It's not going to be what you think, probably. Smalls is not your typical saucy bbq joint. You're not going to find anything slathered in bbq sauce. It's all about smoked meats here. That said, the pulled pork is served with a bacon mustard and it's pretty fantastic. Bacon mustard. Get on this, party people!And Ooooooohh...on the TLC tip: Always ask what the specials are including the Veg of the Day. I am a fan of the long beans & yu-choy. Get garlic rice with your bop-you don't stoppah. Smalls also does special wings on occasion and during Lent they did this shrimp toast sammie which was crazy sexy cool.Yo if I need it in the morning or the middle of the nightI ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)My lovin' is strong and Smalls got it goin' on andI ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)2 inches or a yard of brisekt in a bop or on a sammichI ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)So it ain't like I'm braggin' just join the Smalls paddywagon causeI ain't 2 proud.

reno-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/reno-chicago,06/09/14 , 2 ," We came in to Reno as a party of 10, and although the restaurant is pretty small, Reno accommodated us with a large picnic-style table. As others have stated in reviews, the service is spotty, but the pizzas are great.Our server didn't greet us promptly, and she didn't visit the table often, so there were times when we were waiting about 5-10 minutes just to order a beer. The pizzas, though, were fantastic. We had five different pizzas, including the hog, fancy nancy, spanish monster, paulina and hang ten. My absolute favorite was the fancy nancy; the burrata in the middle of the pizza is the perfect unique touch. All of the pizzas came out on time, too, so I give them credit for that. They also have a solid beer list full of local favorites.I'd recommend this place if you're looking for affordable, unique, thin crust pizza. I don't live in the neighborhood, but I'll be back, especially for the 2 for $20 pizza deal on Tuesdays."
red-door-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-door-chicago,09/05/14 , 2 ," I've been here three times. Once for a Yelp event, which left me with very mixed feelings on the place, once for an ill-timed dinner, and once for an actual meal.My first visit, for a Yelp event, was to be blunt a clusterf@ck of epic proportions. I'm not sure where the wheels fell off the wagon, but it was under staffed, over booked and an all-around hot mess. That said, the food I got to try was delicious and the patio, alluring. We returned, finally, two years later and about 5 minutes too late for dinner. Annoying because we learned this after sitting down, perusing the menu and picking out our drinks and dinner. In Red Door's defense, they were quite apologetic and offered suggestions where we could find a meal in the general vicinity.Third time's the charm; we finally were able to bask in the patio and enjoy a meal. We weren't really in a sharing mood and tackled the menu separately. We each started with a drink; the cocktail menu is small and I can't recall exactly what we each ordered (the website menus are out of date), but they were good.He started with the heirloom tomato salad with bleu cheese; a week after our meal, he's still raving about that salad and this comes from a dyed in the wool carnivore. For his main, he enjoyed a full slab of the bulgogi short ribs; also good he reports, but he's not waxing poetic about them a week later. I started out with a dish I tasted at that Yelp event, a bowl of elote. More of a dessert-ish dish with the corn's sweetness complimented by the spice of the chili powder, it was fantastic. It's an ample portion, designed for sharing. For my main, I went with the ahi poke. A delicious balance of flavors - sweet, spicy, fresh. It reminded of the first time I had poke in Costa Rica.The patio about triples the size of the interior and to me is the only place to be. While I quite enjoyed our food and the small, eclectic menu, the patio is what would bring me back. Service was ok, a little too aloof for my liking, but adequate.Overall, 3.5 stars rounded up."
dosirak-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dosirak-chicago,12/05/14 , 2 ," So first let me say cheers for using the Eat24 online ordering system through Yelp! It's the first time I've ever used that and it was a breeze! So, thank you, Dosirak, for making my food ordering such an easy task! Also, the food was ready so quick-- also appreciated!The food was equally satisfying as my experience above! I ordered the mandu dumplings and the curry rice.The mandu dumplings were good! They were served with a black dipping sauce, which was a great addition to the flavor. They were fried (I prefer steamed, but that's just personal preference), and loaded with good flavors inside, which included various vegetables, and I believe beef.The curry rice was a mixture of beef, carrots, potatoes, onions, and of course curry rice! The flavor of the curry was good-- not too strong, but still very apparent. Oh, and the side of kimchi was AMAZING!Overall, the food was good! No complaints! Also, if you are ordering ahead, try out the online ordering-- it's so convenient! It's almost as easy as picking up the phone and ordering that way! Ha!"
lawrences-fish-and-shrimp-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lawrences-fish-and-shrimp-chicago,10/15/13 , 2 , Came here at 4 in the morning and it was still pretty busy.I went straight for the cat fish and didn't regret it for a second.It was crisp and crunchy with a soft inside and tasted pretty fresh.The hot sauce comes in packets which is cool for taking some home but it would be easier if they had some open containers for you to use while you are at the restaurant.I would definitely come back the next time I'm in the neighborhood.
fish-bar-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fish-bar-chicago,06/21/13 , 2 ," I had ERRRYYYYthang on the menu today. Yes. Everything!I got really lucky and was invited to eat at Fish Bar by my friend who was receiving the outdoor seafood feast for four from DMK's loyalty program. I've been to Fish Bar before, and tried several different things. But this time, we tried everything! The feast includes one of every menu item. So we set out and ordered it all. I've posted pictures of most of the items that we ate. It got dark towards the end so I stopped taking pics.I love the freshness of the seafood at Fish Bar. I loved it before, and I love it even more now. Once you dive into the food, for a moment in time you forget that you're in Chicago and you honestly feel like you're on the East Coast somewhere. Especially on a beautiful night out on the patio (that's how I felt).I would list everything we ordered, but there's not point since it was everything on the menu. So, I will list the items that stood out as amazing and those that stood out as just ok. Nothing was bad.Drinks: #1 and #5 were great. #3 not so much (froma girly standpoint).Great: clams, ceviche, cobb salad, surf n' turf, po' boy, dessertJust OK: mussels (too much beer taste), all the fried stuff (not hot and crispy), lobster roll (just missing something...), octopus a la plancha (too soft and chewy)My dinner mates may not agree with me, but this is my review. I will admit that I'm a little bit of an octopus snob (it's my favorite sea creature to eat). And also a lobster roll addict. They were really busy and perhaps that's the reason for some of the lackluster dishes. But it was still a feast to remember.The service was great. We had a main server but also others who helped run out the food and took our orders when ours wasn't around. The only person who was just so-so was the hostess. She was a blonde one. Didn't catch her name. Not terrible, but I would have appreciated more hospitality since after all, she is the hostess.I will definitely return to Fish Bar. They have a seasonal menu, so it won't be long until there are new dishes (and fish) to try."
shokran-moroccan-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shokran-moroccan-restaurant-chicago,04/21/14 , 2 ," Nine of us ambled by at 9 pm on a Friday night after going to a show at a dive bar across the street. Two of our friends that live nearby had never mentioned this place before, and too bad, because we could have come here a few times by now.We got lucky, and we were seated within 15 minutes. And we were treated to some wonderful food. We started with merguez (sausage), zaalouk (eggplant) and bakola (spinach), each with a complex balance of flavors that danced on my tongue. Maybe it danced a little like their belly dancer, whose belly was not there that night.But my belly was there, and for the main course, the waiter helped me choose the salmon tagine. I needed some Omega 3 fish oil, and this dish provided a swimmingly delicious experience. Cooked perfectly, moist with a delightful 'charmoula' sauce.Did I mentioned the waiter being helpful? Yes, I did, but not to the degree that he was: I asked him a little bit about the culture, and it turned out that he was working towards a PhD in comparative religion, and he was a wealth of wonderful stories and descriptions about Morocco and the broader region. History was never this exciting in the classroom."
vincent-restaurant-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vincent-restaurant-chicago,12/25/12 , 2 ," Great idea for a date or meeting with good friends.  Bad idea for a bad date.  Serendipity my ass.  When a date is as bad as it was the other night, I am not sure why I didn't get up and leave.  Mainly because I had not yet gotten to try Vincent and wasn't going to allow a peter pan syndrome gal ruin it for me.  Even after the interesting appetizers and tasty cocktails the time spent on that bad date was no better.  Our waiter was informative and present in the beginning but he was hard to reach after the plates hit the table.  Also, his personality was way to loud.  If he could turn it down a couple notches, I would've been able to relate.I definitely hope to come back and experience their brunch.. if I'm lucky in the future I can bring a good date here and wash away the taste of the bad experience.  Thank goodness I never gave up my digits.  Email is so freeing.The food and the flavors are Dutch.  It'd be wise to do some Google searches of photos or videos on Dutch cooking.  I know some of my friends would not find this appetizing, which makes sense of the reviews either saying its 4-5 star worthy versus those that 'don't get it'."

It's a large sports bar in the downtown/South Loop area that has good food that is reasonable priced and a number of TVs to watch your favorite sports team.If you plan on coming here to watch any NFL games I advise you to get here early because the place gets packed. The only negative about this place is that the pump the music so loud you can barely hear yourself, let alone the person across the table from you. I swear every time I go here I ask the Man or Woman upstairs not to let me lose 10% of my hearing!Brunch Must:* Breakfast Burrito* Wild Berry Bliss Stuffed French ToastDinner Must:* Footlong Grilled Cheese - the triple cheese is my favorite.* Stuffer Turkey Burger - who ever came up with the idea to stuff this burger with Brie is a genius!* The Bear BBQ Chicken - holy wow what a delicious sandwich.I definitely will be back to Scout in the near future."

The goat was very tender and flavorful and the tacos are only $2.00.I was disappointed that everything was served as if it was to go. All the tacos came individually wrapped in a basket and they were greasy so it was a little hard to eat. I would definitely eat their food again but I think I will get take out next time.
sze-chuan-cuisine-chicago,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sze-chuan-cuisine-chicago,11/28/14 , 1 ," The outside looked very modern and inviting. The inside decor also looked great, with chandeliers and nice wallpaper. There's an upstairs too so this place must be huge, but on the main floor, the tables and chairs are so close to each other, you would have think this place was cramped. Guests were having difficulty leaving because chairs were in the way. And most importantly, the service here is absolutely horrible.  When we walked in, the hostess was talking to a table of guests like they were her friends. She saw us, lead us to our table, dropped the menu and walked back to her friends - without a single word to us. We waited for someone to come by to see how we were doing, or to offer us water, but no one came. Servers came to clean the tables around us, but they left us waiting even though we kept looking at them. Finally, we got up and left, which is a shame too because I would have loved to try a bunch of things on their menu. Unless they change their staff, I don't see this place sticking around for long and I might never get to try the food."
