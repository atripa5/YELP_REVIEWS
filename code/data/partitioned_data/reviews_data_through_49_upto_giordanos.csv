I got the roasted grape and taleggio pizza--great flavor, chewy crust, large size. I would get the prosciutto on it next time to add more texture and variety!! Also tried my friend&#39;s mushroom risotto-- nice wine and mushroom flavor, and I couldn&#39;t believe how many shaved truffles were on top!Definitely a date night place.The reasons for the knocked off stars are that the menu items were pricier than I think they could be and our waitress didn&#39;t come to give us our check for 45 minutes!! She never even walked by...eventually the manager came with the check."

This is a pretty popular Italian and thin pizza joint. And I can see why since it was super packed when I showed up.Got front row seats at the bar watching them make some pizzas one right after the other. Too bad they forgot about mine, but my server finally realized it when 45 minutes later, I have yet to see my pizza. But the pizza is the right size for one person. And still have room for dessert.Other than the late pizza fiasco, I like the ambiance. Semi-loud, but you can still have that nice intimate date if you really tried.Caesar salad good, and I would come back for some more pizza."

I sat in the bar with two friends during happy hour. The bar area is small to begin, and it wasn&#39;t crowded. Still, the bartender rarely visited our table. On the few occasions he did, he was abrupt, far from friendly and had a general attitude as if we were bothering him. (Maybe they were missing a server for the bar area, in which case we probably were bothering him). Aside from the $5 wine pours (which are small, even considering happy hour price), I had their house Old Fashioned, which will be far too sweet if you enjoy the regular version. The $5 pizzas are also small (more like two pieces of flat bread) but tasty. The regular menu looks good, and the restaurant was full by the time we left (around 6:30), so I&#39;d probably give them another try, but I hope to avoid the same type of service."

Great prices during happy hr (4:30-6:30 pm) but it only applies if you sit in the bar and lounge area. We had a friendly server with an awesome mustache (didn&#39;t get his name) who gave us good suggestions. Their pizzetta portions are about two slices of the regular sized pizza and only costs $5! We tried the three hr roasted grape and the triple pepperoni and there were very good!. The crust was not as crispy/crunchy as other brick oven pizzas I tried but still good. Dessert of their house made gelato was amazing. We got nutella and coffee flavored. Good job guys!"

Every dish exceeded my expectations! I can&#39;t believe it took me so long to try this place.Highly recommend the Spinach White Truffle fondue and the brick-oven pizzas. I went with the margarita and my husband got the fennel sausage, both were excellent. I&#39;m a bit of a pizza snob, and in my option it&#39;s all about the crust. I was so impressed with this pizza it tasted straight out of Italy.I know they have really great lunch deals, but honestly the full price dinner prices would be worth it.

Overall the place has a chic casual look, a comfortable setting with all sorts of seating options, some booths, low tables and high tops. The place has been around for several years and still looks good.Service is attentive, fast and friendly. We asked several questions and our sever was knowledgeable. So why three stars? The food, it was good, just not hit it out of the park, nothing really served up in a way that rose to the level of the feeling that I needed to return to have it again, I felt I had similar at other places. Don&#39;t get me wrong here, it was good and if I were in the area again I would go again if someone else wanted to go. A destination, not so much.Tip -If you do dine there and happen to like Negroni&#39;s and like them bitter, I suggest you letter your sever know, mine was good but it was lacking in bitters."

Their saving grace was their wine menu which I will say was impressive although not too many of them were available just by the glass.I went with the pea and parmesan risotto which was warm (not hot) and probably re-heated, extremely soupy and lacked any seasoning whatsoever apart from the cress on top which I didn&#39;t like at all. There wasn&#39;t even a hint of parmesan and my server never offered any to grate on top or any black pepper to grind which any decent Italian restaurant would do. I may have chosen badly from the menu with this dish but nothing on there was inspiring me and I wasn&#39;t getting any help from the server.It&#39;s clear to me why it was so easy to get in here and yet RPM even has a line to sit at the bar - in future, I&#39;ll happily wait. The restaurant itself has good decor although they had the big windows at the front open which was a mistake when its 75 and humid outside. The service - from the hostess to the server to the barman does not make me feel bad about giving this place 2*."

Also the broth didn&#39;t had that much flavorParma Classic Pizza - OMG Delicious! I wish we got another one of these. I love Neapolitan pizza, so this was right up my alley.Hot Rum Winter Cocktail - Strong, but sweet.

I was in town for work and needed a place to have a business dinner for 6 persons. After making the reservation online, I called ahead and informed them that we needed a table (and not the counter facing the open kitchen). To my delight, they had set aside a table in their alcove which provided a perfect place to enjoy a good meal and engage in productive conversation.Service was prompt, attentive, and pleasant. Cocktails were a bit on the weaker side. I had a negroni, and it tasted a bit more watered down than the forward aromatics of negronis. The lamb meatballs with polenta were delicious, the octopus nicely grilled and flavorful, the beet salad tasty (though didn&#39;t quite have the caramelized texture that roasted beets tend to have), and artichokes wonderful. The wild mushroom risotto that my colleague had was a hit and the wild boar bolognese blew me away.  Pasta cooked properly (al dente) though the chef had a heavy hand with the salt that day with the bolognese (not to the point of inedibility, but definitely needed to eat it with the tagliatelle).Overall, a good meal and perfect place if you&#39;re nearby at the hotels for a conference!"

We ordered delivery for dinner. I was pleasantly surprised that a semi-fancy River North establishment provided delivery, even if it was through a 3rd party. The meal was delivered 25 minutes after it was placed, and during peak hour. That blew my mind. Now...onto the meal itself. We ordered the Cacio e Pepe (house-made spaghetti), Tagliatelle all&#39; amatriciana, and tomato and bufala mozzarella fondue, which is more like naan and a side of tomato sauce w/ a large piece of mozzarella floating on top. You can choose between small and large for the pastas, and got small for both. There is a price difference of $6. I guess we should&#39;ve ordered one large to compare the portions. Anyways, small was more like child portion, or anti-pasti size. There were tiny bits of bacon in the tagliatelle but everything else was straight up tomatoes/tomato sauce, cheese pieces, bread, and pasta. The meal that cost maybe 3 dollars to make ended up being over $54 dollars w/ tip and delivery charge. That is why i say i had the most expensive Italian meal of my life. We engulfed everything in 10 minutes. The food was appetizing but just really pricey for what we paid for. The portion ordered was just the right amount for two.Warning: 3rd party site charges a dollar extra for everything. It was cool that they allowed me to select options such as &#34;deliver asap&#34; and &#34;free paper plates&#34; even though they forgot the latter, but i&#39;ll let that slide."

For appetizers, we got the mozzarella fondue and the chefs special bruschetta, which was tuna. The mozzarella was not a fondue - it wasn&#39;t nearly melty enough. There was also too little cheese for the tomato sauce or was in. There was maybe one good chunk of mozzarella. The bread it came like, basically a naan, was good though. The tuna bruschetta was just raw tuna on baguette. The tuna was good but it wasn&#39;t really anything special.My boyfriend and I split carbonara and wild boar bolognese. The bolognese was out of this world good. The carbonara was served with two egg yolks on top, but the pasta wasn&#39;t quite hot enough to get that creamy carbonara result. I also thought there weren&#39;t enough peas or pancetta.The service was also slow and the waitress never refilled my wineglass, despite refilling my boyfriend&#39;s several times.The pizza looks great and they do 2 for 1 pizza Monday and have half off pasta after 9pm."

The decor of the dining room is quite nice and cozy - we sat next to the fireplace. We ordered the short rib and butternut squash filled pasta. Both were good although they were way too small for the price we paid. The pasta was offered in both a small and large size for $13/$20. We got the large size for $20 and it was still very small - maybe like 10 noodles; I&#39;m afraid to see what the small portion size would have looked like. The short rib itself was a decent size but the bed of rice it came on was super small. After spending $26 on the short rib and $20 on the pasta, we were still hungry. We asked our server for some bread (why was bread not brought out automatically at the beginning?) which was essential to finish the meal and quench our hunger.Overall, a nice dining room, friendly service, and good tasting food - I just wish the value was better: either the price needs to come down or the portions need to increase."

The restaurant looked about 70% full and they say us fairly quickly.We were a bit indecisive picking a glass of wine. The waitress did not seem knowledgeable about the wine menu and so we tried a glass and ended up ordering another. We had a few questions on the menu (it is the second time we had been to this restaurant and the menu had changed). We were informed that the ahi tuna bruschetta was like a tuna poke bruschetta. So we ordered the Ahi tuna bruschetta and 2 pizzas. Our general experience up to this point was slow, frustrating, unhelpful, and every question felt like it was being met w resistance.Literally 40 minutes later our bruschetta came out (we did not see our waitress for that entire time in between). It was not a tuna poke just 3 pieces of tuna on top of 3 crostinis. The presentation, taste, and overall time to get our food was terrible for what we ordered and incredibly slow. We asked the waitress if she had put in the pizza order yet because the appetizer had taken a while to come out. She said she had not because she was waiting for the appetizer to come out. She then proceeded to tell us about a big party that was at the restaurant who ordered a lot of food (mind you the restaurant is about 60% full at this point). Again the service unhelpful, unauthentic, and there was yet another excuse for a question we had. So we asked to see a manager.The manager came over in the tiny little corner we were in with 4 tables of people around us and asked (in a fairly loud voice) &#34;I understand you are upset that the service has been slow&#34;. We proceeded to explain that the service has been slow, that we felt like every question was met w resistance, that there was just an overall lack of sincerity in our experience.  Without saying so much as I apologize, he caught us totally off guard and goes &#34;can you give me specific examples of questions and the types of answers you have been receiving?&#34; Caught a little off guard I was happy to explain the wine choice, appetizer choice, 40min in between ordering and getting our 3 pieces of tuna, and the general tone, attitude, and resistance we received from the waitress. He then said &#34;oh I am sorry you feel that way what is a fair way to make it up to you?&#34; So we just asked if we could take our pizza to go. He then again apologized and we responded with &#34;yes we are disappointed this has been an awful experience.&#34;This is when shit hit the fan. The manager goes, in no exaggeration &#34;whoa, whoa, that is completely different than what you first told me&#34;. Again, caught a little off guard and get increasingly frustrated and upset we told him that that was exactly what we explained to him. We are now making a scene in front of this entire part of the restaurant and the manager is still speaking loudly with no regard to the other tables around. This manager literally had an excuse for everything that was happening citing the kitchen being backed up, the restaurant being completely full, etc. So we just asked for a check for the 2 drinks and the appetizer. Mind you it is now almost 930pm and we had been there for over an hour.I have never ever experienced such an awful display of customer service in my life. The way that the waitress miscommunicated to the manager our initial complaint, the manager&#39;s lack of sincerity in talking with us, the unauthentic nature of his attitude, tone of voice, lack of willingness to help, and excuse for literally everything that we had to say, as well as making a scene in his own restaurant was infuriating and disappointing.The manager, at this point, did not know how to handle this situation at all, tried to apologize again (little late for that) and so we asked if he could just go get the check. As he walked away the table next us grabbed him to speak w him. Their bill was incorrect and they waited over an hour for their entrees. He immediately apologized and offered to take it off their bill.He brought us our bill for $40 for 2 drinks and the appetizer which we paid and left. I can&#39;t emphasize enough how poorly this situation was handled. It was truly one of the worst displays of customer service and experience that I have ever seen in my life. We were truly disappointed and will not be a returning customer of Osteria La Madia."

For brunch, the restaurant was only half full and it still took close to two hours.

We asked for some hot sauce, wish they had some.4) seared scallops: very creamy and meaty! It was amazingThey gave us a dessert on the house at the end which was a great.

I had the aged grape and cheese pizza and the burrata bruschetta. EXCELLENT. Bread was the right amount of soft and crusty.

The food was decent, the pastas are homemade and solid. The grape and taleggio pizza was great, but the pork belly pizza fell flat. The dessert was sort of a joke- &#34;zeppole&#34; with gelato and Valrhona chocolate sauce is basically nothing more than a limp Krispy Kreme sliced in half and filled with crystallized ice cream and a weird spot of what I assumed was frozen chocolate sauce.I think the part that really made this meal hard to enjoy was the fact that it was about 80 degrees out with high humidity and they had the whole front of the restaurant open with no AC on. I mean you&#39;ve got a pizza oven in the back! The restaurant was absolutely sweltering. Toward the end of the meal my mom actually had to leave and walk back to my parents&#39; place because she couldn&#39;t take the heat anymore.

It *might* be because I had an awesome birthday party here, but everything about the experience was wonderful. Even if you don&#39;t come for an event, and if it&#39;s a small group or date night...you will NOT be disappointed with your experience. Put it down.Let&#39;s start with the private event coordinator, Julie. She is the most professional, friendly, efficient, event coordinator extraordinaire! And she made planning (for my boo) so incredibly easy and smooth. From what he told me, she was quick to respond to emails and answered all his questions and made all the requested accommodations as best as she could. She deserves most of the credit for this beautiful experience (and maybe a little credit should go to my boo. Good job, honey!)We pre-ordered dishes from the menu for the party and we had dinner family style. This was a genius idea, since we all love to try a variety of dishes, and this way, we were able to try all of the delicious dishes that La Madia is known for. I have to say, all the food that we ordered were phenomenal. I can&#39;t wait to go back and dine, again!For starters, we enjoyed the Steamed PEI Mussels, cooked with melted leeks, fresh fennel, garlic, and white wine Brodo. OMG, we all wanted to drink the soup!We had the Beet Salad as well as the Romaine Lettuce Salad. Both were refreshing and delicious. I highly recommend them both! If you had to only pick one, though, I would probably go for the Romaine Lettuce again.I&#39;ve listed the pizzas in order of most to least favorite, but I just have to add this disclaimer that ALL of them were really really delicious! Slagel Farm Wood Smoked Pork Belly (Tuscan kale, garlic, caramelized onion, caciocavallo cheese), Seasonal Wild Mushrooms (smoked mozzarella), Parma Classic (Mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, prosciutto di parma, arugula), and Clam &amp; Fresno Chilies (Pecorino, garlic and fresh thyme). I think some of them are a tie...I don&#39;t know. They were all delicious in their own way!!~I was too full to try the Tagliatelle and Shrimp risotto...but everyone agreed that it was delicious as well. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to go back again soon to try a couple new dishes, as well as a couple favorites that I&#39;d like to eat again.One more note: if you order the limoncelli, it&#39;s pretty strong!

The lighting is dim and you feel like this could easily be turned into a happening lounge late at night with its modern, tasteful decor and a bar area that looks like the place to hang out. Yet you the kitchen is pretty visible, mostly out in the open, separated from the tables by a low counter. I had a full view of the pizza oven.Our reservation was for 5:30pm on a Monday night, which was unnecessary as only a few other tables had customers. We had a very professional, responsive, and efficient server, and overall had a great dinner here.PIZZA* Parma Classic (red. arugula, prosciutto di parma. $19) - 4.5 starspic:yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m…The best pizza of the night in my opinion! I tend to like reds so I may be biased, but even for a red I thought the prosciutto was sharp and complemented the arugula and fresh tomato sauce really well. Their crust is thin and soft with a crisp, though not quite as fresh-out-of-the-oven as I&#39;d prefer. The outer crust could&#39;ve done with being a little more stretchy when I pulled it apart, but this is me being picky on a 4.5 star pizza!* Wild Mushroom (white. smoked mozzarella. $16) - 3.5 starspic:yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m…Not a huge fan of white pizzas, and not a big lover of mushrooms, so this wasn&#39;t a winner for me flavor-wise. But it was well made and I will say the mushroom wasn&#39;t too overpowering and had a fairly well-balanced flavor. Overall I found it a bit bland though.* Moroccan Spiced Lamb Sausage (white. mint pesto. $17) - 3.5 starspic:yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m…This was my pizza and it wasn&#39;t as impressive as I&#39;d hoped! The sausage wasn&#39;t very spicy, and its texture was a little chewy, reminiscent of chain-restaurant delivery pizza.ENTRÉES* Tagliatelle (foie gras meatballs. $14 half) - 3.5 starspic:yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m…This was exciting for me because foie gras isn&#39;t allowed in my home city of SF anymore. I couldn&#39;t really taste the foie gras to my disappointment though - if I hadn&#39;t been told what this was, I would have thought it was just regular meatballs. The tagliatelle was not as wide as I&#39;ve had at other restaurants, but had a texture that was balanced between being soft and al dente. I found the sauce to be a little plain, and rather watery. It was nice to have the option of a half order.Menu:yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m…"

Then onto the small, but highly efficient kitchen that turns out pizzas and a number of exceptional small plates with remarkable speed to pair with carefully crafted salads and cheese and salumi plates.    We didn&#39;t get a pasta, but what we saw flying past our table looked good.  Our main was a tasty Chicken Milano that put two breaded cutlets on a bed of ratatouille and orzo with an emulsified citrus eggplant sauce.  Tasty, inventive.Maybe most notable was the moderate prices for this part of town, or maybe a sign that the competition is fierce with nearby Eataly, Pizzeria Via Stato and Quartino.Despite the frenetic pace of La Madia, the team service approach keeps the place humming, but I can understand some reviews from disappointed diners that fell between the cracks at peak dining hours."

The space is split into two sections, bar side with lots of light and restaurant side with booths and much softer lighting.We both ended up ordering the Chef&#39;s lunch which consists of your choice of soup of the day or salad and a choice of pizza. I decided upon the salad and fennel sausage, onion and gorgonzola pizza.The salad consisted of little gem lettuce, it feels and tastes like a butter lettuce and looks like romaine  lettuce, roasted tomatoes and a house dressing. The salad was crisp and fresh with dressing on every surface of the lettuce, yet it wasn&#39;t too soggy or overwhelming. It was simple and delicious! The pizza was piping hot and a great alternative to Chicago deep dish. All three toppings stood out. The gorgonzola really mellows out in the wood-fired oven. I was worried it would be overwhelming. The crust was thin, light and chewy.I eat a fair amount of food and was thoroughly full after 3 slices. I  also had a slice of my friends margherita pizza and it was equally tasty.

It&#39;s a place we can enjoy great food and wine specials while the kids can enjoy a fun environment and make their own pizzas. The must appetizer is the pizza fondue. It&#39;s fun for everyone, but it disappears way too quickly. You really can&#39;t go wrong here. The pastas are excellent, the pizzas are amazing. We will definitely come back to this restaurant again and again, and recommend it to all our friends.I have only 1 serious &#34;watch out&#34; and it&#39;s not the restaurant, but the valet company outside. BOTH times I have used the valet outside of La Madea, they went through my glovebox and my center console. How do I know? The first time, I realized a couple of days after my visit that they had stolen a small swiss army knife I had recently placed in the bottom of my glove box. The second time, I purposely locked everything up tight before I pulled-up and handed them the keys. When I got the car home, nothing was missing, but I could not help but notice they had unlocked the glove box and the center console. I mean, that&#39;s just stupidity. At least take the time to lock it back up after you&#39;re done helping yourself to my belongings. This way, there is some element of doubt instead of irrefutable proof."

My friend had a pasta dish, that was more expensive than the pizza and was absolutely not a fair portion size for the price. She said it was tasty, but we both were surprised at how small it was for $21.The worst part of the experience was the large family dining near us. I watched carefully, and as far as I can tell, not one employee reprimanded them throughout their visit for the multiple children that were running around, wrestling, and going up to other tables and talking to the guests seated there. I asked our waitress about it, and she didn&#39;t say anything because they were about to leave by that point. It&#39;s so disrespectful of families to have out of control children in this kind of setting, and it&#39;s the responsibility of the restaurant staff to stand up for other patrons. This family was loud, and the kids were way too old to behave this way. There is a big difference between a crying baby, which is very hard to deal with, and a seven year old knocking his 3 year old cousin or brother to the ground repeatedly in between tables of guests.I feel totally neutral about whether or not I&#39;d go back to give this place another shot."

They let us stay as long as we wanted - which was wonderful since we all came from different areas of the state.My nephew organized the entire party, with the requirement that the prosecco kept flowing the entire time. The staff was very good at filling up glasses and opening new bottles. Cinnamon rolls and donut holes were present on every table before we even sat down. Appetizers were brought out as we were just about to sit down. The waiters and waitresses were friendly and courteous.Getting our food was a bit of a problem. They took our orders and then the wait began for the food.  The first table got their food in a timely fashion. Our table did not get food till after the others were done. I understand they had other patrons in the place...but really...our food should have been timed better. The pizzas were baked fresh in a huge pizza oven. These should have taken only 4 -5 minutes to cook and the ovens should be able to bake more than 1 pizza at a time. Knowing that you are having a party of about 30 people, they should have been better prepared in the kitchen.Appetizers that were pre-ordered were very tasty. The pizzas had a great crust and good toppings. The pepperoni with truffle oil was a bit too greasy. Maybe the truffle oil should have been put into the crust instead of on top of the pepperoni oil.  The pressed brioche panini was very small. If we did not have appetizers ahead of time, that sandwich would not have filled anyone up. The brioche french toast looked marvelous.Would not recommend another party there, unless all of the food is pre-ordered. We spent too much time waiting for the food while creating a huge alcohol bill.  We had a great time visiting with family and freinds!"

Although 3.5 stars would be more appropriate.The food has been consistently great on both occasions. There is currently a salmon crudo appetizer on the menu that alone is worth the visit. Between our table of four we ordered almost every pasta dish on the menu and everyone seemed very satisfied with their selection. I personally had the pappardelle with wild boar bolognese, which was delicious. Of course all of the pasta is also made in-house.The only fault on both occasions has been on the service side. While the servers have always been friendly and knowledgable, the wait time for food and drinks is well above average. I would understand if anyone had ordered a pizza that must be made fresh, however that was not the case.Overall La Madia is worth the visit and we&#39;re likely to return.

I noticed they had about 4-5 delivery pick ups while we ate. Lots of uber eats.Our waitress was so, so nice. Helpful, accommodating, polite. She earned a star herself.The pizza was okay. I think part of the issue was that the sauce itself lacked flavor and the meats were too big and fell of the thin crust, medium sized pies. We also got a white pizza but it wasn&#39;t super flavorful. We had the carpaccio to start. It was fine but the arugula was dry and the beef itself could have been different.It&#39;s BYOB so that&#39;s a plus. This place has potential but I think they need to work on the details more.

I&#39;ve always been loyal to Coalfire in West Town but on this Friday evening I decided to venture somewhere a little closer to my hood.Enter La Crosta.  5 star place on Yelp and the pictures looked great.  We walked in at about 6:15 on a Friday night and 2 tables were occupied.  After being seated something just was off about this place.  I&#39;m not sure if it was the emptiness of the restaurant, the quick/semi-awkward service or the incubus playing on the radio through the speakers which didn&#39;t fit the vibe.  Seriously, who plays the radio at a sit down restaurant?Now to the food, we got the bruschetta and one of their pizzas.  The bruschetta lacked the freshness that just about all bruschetta I&#39;ve had have.  By this point I knew this trip to the restaurant was going to be a epic fail.  We ate half of it and stopped to wait for the pizza.When the pizza came, the first thing I noticed was the pool of olive oil forming all over the top of the pizza.  When I picked up my first slice of pie, about half the ingredients slid off back onto the pizza tray.  I then, very frustrated at this point, took my first bite into this soggy mess.  This consistency of the crust literally tastes liked it had been soaking in water.  How is this considered wood oven fired pizza?  What I can&#39;t understand more than this is how is this a 5 star place on yelp??It&#39;s obvious reading through the reviews after dining there that the restaurant puts in phony reviews as there are a ton of newer people to yelp with only one or two reviews making reviews.Coalfire...I will never cheat on you again."

I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because we got there late (9 PM on a Wednesday) or this is just how it is...We started with the bruschetta, which was delicious! No doubt! Decent portion, decent price.We got 3 pizzas.. the Margherita, Due Carne, and Carciofi &amp; Truffle Oil. The crust had a charcoal-y taste but the edges still tasted slightly raw to me. The middles were either soggy or so thin they were non existent. All the pizzas pretty much fell apart. We all liked the Margherita the best. 3 pizzas were barely enough food for the 5 of us. They&#39;re super thin so 1 person can probably eat an entire pizza, esp boys. Idk if I can justify spending $15+ for one pizza for myself though.We wanted the nutella pie, but they were out of nutella. Huge disappointment, but the owner was nice enough to give us a slice of the Death by Chocolate. We all devoured it! It was almost like a chocolate cheesecake.. delicious! Not sure I would ever paid $8 for it though..Overall, the food was decent. Pricey for what you get and not all that mind blowing. Again, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just because we came late but that shouldn&#39;t be an excuse for mediocre quality."

At that level of thinness, a bit more attention to this is needed.Our sauce was also extremely salty, our bad for not telling the owner in advance.

Everything was perfect: the atmosphere, the parking (easy!), the service/attentiveness (love to have independent family-run businesses in the &#39;hood), the BYOB element and of course, the food. I loved it all (and we tried a lot). Pizzas were really, really yummy. My one recommendation is that they more finely dice the garlic for the pizza Bianca. And bruschetta was good but not amazing. I think this place will give Coalfire a run for its money! I&#39;ll definitely be taking the family back."

Sadly, that did not happen.I ordered delivery, and on a positive not it came quickly in order 45 minutes. However, it was luke warm at best upon arrival. A little warmth would have been nice. The next issue was that one pizza was ordered with no cheese.  The cheese came on the pizza. Luckily big chunks of mozzarella are pretty easy to remove, but it was annoying and wrecked the look of the pizza.The due carni was a wreck. The sopressata was pretty good, with a nice spicy heat, but so much it overcame the pizza. But on 8 slices of pizza only 6 had some sopressata. The barese sausage was inedible.  The sausage had a unappealing smell, was gross to look at and tasted terrible. It ruined the pizza.The second pizza was the spicy coppa.  The coppa was decent on this but arrived halfway burnt.The crust of the pizza was decent with a nice wood fire burnt taste to it.  The base was a touch to thin and didn&#39;t hold up to the ingredients.For wood fired pizza this is a miss. There are better options in the city, especially at this outrageous price."

The service was decent, but the food was terrible. My husband and I ordered bruschetta as an appetizer and it was plated beautifully, but it was incredibly salty. We also ordered a margharita pizza with sausage. It had so much olive oil on top that the crust was sopping wet. Each time we went to grab a piece of pizza, all of the toppings slid off because it was slathered in oil. Needless to say we left feeling hungry because we didn&#39;t finish either of the items that we ordered. Utterly disappointing."

I usually prefer a protein on my pizza, but no need...these were filling, hearty, and hit the spot!And to add a cherry on top, Dino was kind enough to surprise us with a new dessert- Bomba- 3 flavors of ice cream, covered in chocolate.Very personable staff, great food- easily one of my fave pizzas now...glad they deliver, and can&#39;t wait to try Due Carni next time!!"

They were very accommodating for our group of 12 on a Friday night. Food is great. We all enjoyed the burrata and bruschetta appetizers.

I attempted to visit Bang Bang in Logan, but to my dismay it was closed when I went. Now, I have had Bang Bang&#39;s biscuits....at Honey Butter Fried Chicken. It was for a collaboration they did and it was frucking delicious. I have also had Bang Bang pie....at Parson&#39;s. Hmmmm. I am just now seeing the pattern myself. Anyhow....So you see, I was familiar with Bang Bang&#39;s delicious offerings. I&#39;ve just never enjoyed them at their actual brick &amp; mortar....until today. This location opened not too long ago. It&#39;s a lot closer to me than Logan Square so SCORE!I met my pal for lunch and I have to say, this could be new favorite lunch spot. They had some acoustic guitar action going on, which was quite nice. I like the mix of cafe tables, casual couch seating and communal picnic table seating.But the biscuit specials! Whoa. They all sounded wonderful. I woofed down my biscuit sandwich which consisted of candied bacon, collard green, poached egg and hot sauce. I&#39;m also declaring the best hash browns ever. A slice of butterscotch meringue pie to-go rounded out my order.Clearly, it was carb day today. But everyday is carb day at Bang Bang and I will be back to represent!"

When I found out they opened a second location closer to me, I was through the moon. Now it only takes me a brief walk and a bus ride - a trip totaling 25-30 minutes - to get my hands on those delectable biscuits. Plus, the lines at the Logan Square shop can get ridiculously long, while the Ravenswood shop has the perfect balance of busy, but a shorter wait time.Since white carbs are my favorite food group, it&#39;s no surprise that Bang Bang&#39;s infamous biscuits have landed on my list of top eats in Chicago. They are soft, buttery and melt-in-your-mouth levels of deliciousness! Plus, I love the rotating selection of flavored butters and seasonal jams that accompany the biscuits.Bang Bang does offer a quality pie selection, but I admit that nothing I have had so far has jumped out at me or caught my attention the way their biscuits have. I think First Slice and Mama Hoosier&#39;s are equally as good - if not better in some areas - hence why I cannot give Bang Bang the full five stars.But the real star at Bang Bang are those biscuits.

Man oh man, it was so freaking good!I walked in and was greeted by the smells of freshly baked biscuits and I already felt I was in store for something special. Their sausage biscuit with lavender blue berry jam, plus an added egg, was ridiculously good. You know those moments when you first taste something and it&#39;s just undeniably good. This was one of those moments. It brought smiles to my face with each bite. I would like to try their other biscuits which sound fantastic too, but I would have to get this one again first next time.Unfortunately, I was not the biggest fan of their chocolate pecan pie, which sounded great. It was very moist, but way too sweet and molasses-y for my liking.

Not too sweet either and it made the flavor of the bacon pop! The gravy was delicious as well combined with the biscuit and sausage. It was hard to keep that all food on the fork.

The sharp cheese on the sausage was a nice flavor hit, but all together it was surprisingly bland. Ditto on the &#34;not so fancy cheddar cheese grits&#34;.

I like biscuits. So it should not be a surprise that when a place that emphasized both in its title opened within walking distance, I would eventually find my way there.The decor of the establishment is eclectic, almost aggressively so. It was relatively calm when we came in, so we had our choice of the communal tables, the barstools, the tiny bistro tables, and the giant leather chairs in front of the low coffee table that, frankly, I never quite understood how people were able to eat from. I ordered the Sausage Biscuit with an egg on top, got our table number and settled down to wait. The food came out pretty quickly, though, since my hot-chicken ordering table-mate got hers about five minutes before I did, they comped us a slice of Key Lime Pie, which, y&#39;know, I&#39;ll take it!As expected, the biscuits were great and the pie was great. The sausage on the sausage biscuit, however, was a little flavorless and dry which was disappointing, but the poached egg on top and home-made jam on the side can and did make up for a lot. It might not be a place for a daily stop, but if the outdoor patio gets approved, I could definitely see it being a large part of this summer."

Have never eaten (since the first time at the original bang bang) such amazing and delicious biscuits. We had the amazing BLT with candied bacon and fresh tomatoes. We had a pie flight of every kind of pie they were serving that day.  We had the grits of the day.  Oh my gosh I&#39;ve never eaten pickled blueberries which were on top of the grits! Along with corn fresh off the cob and some feta cheese. Oh my gosh so delicious. And the staff from the manager to the chef who was busy teaching his next assistant they all rock. Love this location. Bigger. Love the decor. Love the food. Love the people who work there. Loved our experience. Can&#39;t wait to go again.

Couch is long and blue. I&#39;m wearing some new jeans that have really energized me.7:50 a.m. In bathtub. Boyfriend is creaking around, up earlier than usual. He pokes his head in. He says he has an idea. Me: Bang Bang Pie? Him: Well...Me: yes!Actually, he wants ME to go to Bang Bang, collect savory breakfast items (&#34;one savory AND one sweet.&#34;), and return. I get dressed.8 a.m. Small unrelated fight. I refuse to get breakfast out of principle.8:10 a.m. We hug it out.8:30 a.m. Not unreasonable line at Bang Bang. Many baby carriages. The wind is colder than normal, colder than May. I relax outside, unconcerned by the line. Various neighborhood residents shuffle the strollers around, snap them closed.8:35 a.m. Inside Bang Bang. Unlike Over Easy, the atmosphere is surprisingly relaxed. Since Dolce closed, I missed the tin ceiling here and the subway tile to the ceiling. Even though there is a line, it is moving quickly and efficiently. This is not their first rodeo (or location.) Their staff is trained, friendly and efficient. The neighborhood has missed this café. We are happy to have a new coffee shop, excited it also has food, cautious it might all be taken away at any moment. Credit cards are being swiped with no complaints.8:40 a.m. Taking in the menu, the food is a lot less portable then I had hoped. Other than the chicken pot pie, I don&#39;t see any vegetarian savory pies. I hope for more portable savory options in the future. But I&#39;m happy to see carry-out packing is on point: paper bags with handles, they have made it what seems to not be portable food very convenient and easy to transport.8:45 a.m. Already ordering! the owner (or manager) is super friendly and relaxed, makes a point of introducing himself and asking if I live in the hood. I scooped a yogurt and granola from the fridge, don&#39;t miss this bonus material. Otherwise you&#39;ll notice the food is leaning on the heavier side, appropriate for the concept ...Got the fancy grits and chicken and biscuit to go. They have cleared out the space in an intelligent way to make room for waiting and foot traffic. One long farm table mostly occupied by families with many small children, addition to some traditional two tops and the fireplace lounge area. So glad they kept that. The only design decision I don&#39;t really agree with is building a wood facade up to the ceiling around the fireplace. A lot of money for no good reason, covering up the beautiful brick chimney.8:47 a.m. Self-serve coffee? Is this heaven? Also love that they have one huge thing of whole milk. They even have a little carafe of almond milk, acknowledging whatever that means for you.9 a.m. Eating at home, the grits are great - substantial in portion size, I would get some extra hot sauce to go next time, it&#39;s delicious! the collard greens are lovely but I could&#39;ve used a few more veggies. I love poached eggs so I&#39;m glad that is the standard option here. I didn&#39;t try the chicken and biscuits so I can&#39;t speak to that, but I love pimento cheese.9:25 a.m. Excited to try bang bang again, next time I&#39;m just going to go for the classic biscuit and jam, only three dollars, and maybe supplement with an egg.Welcome to Ravenswood, Bang Bang, the most polite neighborhood in Chicago."

Biscuits and gravy are delicious. The gravy is the creamy kind you find on chicken fried steak and is said to be vegetarian. It has a peppery kick and is served over a soft biscuit, with a hard biscuit on the side. Cheesy grits are delicious. The grits have bite and substance and the cheese smooths the dish out. Rhubarb pie has icing, something I haven&#39;t seen before, but when it comes to desserts, pile it on. The crust is crispy and there is some tartness left in the pie from the rhubarb (but not a lot; it&#39;s very very sweet, almost too sweet).Service is very friendly, the kind that calls you by name. The shop is small but has a number of nice features, like a sofa, fireplace, communal table, and a chandelier. It will be extremely cozy during the long Chicago winter. In the meantime, I am sure Bang Bang will make a splash, in Ravenswood or wherever it chooses to open a new location."

I&#39;ve lived in Chicago for two years, but had never heard of Bang Bang Pie &amp; Biscuits. My sister (visiting from NC) and I came in after reading about this place&#39;s s&#39;mores pie on Buzzfeed. Go figure! We had a great experience.When we came in, we got a good look at the super simple menu, were greeted and bantered with by the fun cashier, and we got to set up our own little table and chairs area near the self-serve water/silverware station.Food was awesome. Biscuits were heavy and big, like a buttery, melty pound cake consistency but less sweet. Strawberry jam (my favorite!) was in season. I had the candied bacon too which was pretty great. I would&#39;ve liked it crispier, but it was my first time having candied bacon, so I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s ever served that way.The pie was every bit as good as Buzzfeed said it would be. My sister, a known chocoholic, got the s&#39;mores, and I got the tart, creamy key lime. Both were smash hits for us.Can&#39;t wait to visit this place again in the fall and winter to try out the rotating flavors... I&#39;m hoping for a pumpkin pie or an apple pie. Too cool! Will definitely recommend to locals and tourists."

The service staff seems knowledgeable and very friendly.  The food that was ordered. Which consisted of a wedge and biscuit and a gravy and biscuit we&#39;re good. Although the amount of lettuce could not be considered a wedge. It was more like a one by 4 inch section of a head of lettuce. It did taste good. Just didn&#39;t feel like the value for the money. My dining companion ordered the biscuits and gravy. Which was tasty, although a little bit over spiced with the pepper and I&#39;m guessing the worlds smallest egg on top.The orange juice was fresh. The black flavored iced tea was good although a tad bitter.As for the space. It&#39;s a very charming and very hipster farm concept. The large communal table although very cute. Honestly does not utilize the amount of space they have to offer for people to sit down and enjoy their product . People with laptops , papers. People saving spaces. Another problem with the lack of seating is no fault of the restaurant , but , with the way you order and then go sit down to have your food brought to you. The problem that was happening was that one person would arrive early from their party. Order a drink. Then go sit down at an open seat. And hold the table space until their friends got there to get in line and order what they wanted. The only problem with this is people that were ahead of them in line their food was coming out and they had nowhere to sit. I only noticed it happen twice. And both parties seemed only slightly miffed.So overall. For me three stars. If I lived in the neighborhood. Didn&#39;t have to wait 25 minutes just to order. And I could find a seat when I came in. I probably wouldn&#39;t give it a higher rating.  The food was good. Nothing to write up in a paper about. Just honest good foodI may give it another shot during the week.

Lots of options of different biscuits with toppings and pies. I have lots of food allergies, so I went the simple route of a biscuit and a piece of the milk chocolate pie. Both were delicious and well worth the wait. I had wanted scrambled eggs with mine, but they only have one type of egg (can&#39;t remember offhand, sorry)!  I&#39;d say that was the biggest downfall. You can eat inside or outside. The outdoors area is much nicer and has a ton of space...as long as you don&#39;t mind eating in benches. But it&#39;s rustic and fun and definitely worth it to try.

Their biscuits is soft and moist unlike any other biscuit I&#39;ve ever had. Almost like a cake but much more body to it.I had the hot chix biscuit sandwich- spicy full of mexican spice flare. Pickles added a nice balance with acidity sweetness, and mouthy lubrication to the biscuit and chicken.For dessert I got a slice of their rhubarb pie. Delicate flakey pie crust with a rhubarb filling that had a preserve consistency to it. If it got served to me without knowing what it was I would have said that this was the best peach cobbler I&#39;ve ever eaten.Definitely worth stopping in for a quick bite."

Sadly after coming here I know this isn&#39;t going to be one of my regular spots.The thing that killed it for me is how little value you get for what they charge.I ordered their hot chix sandwich and gladly paid nearly $10 for it because I&#39;ve paid as much for other awesome chicken sandwiches before (the roost &amp; honey butter fried chicken) and have been satisfied. I was expecting the same here, but when my sandwich came out I was seriously shocked at how small it was. The piece of chicken was the size of two chicken nuggets put together. Yeah the ingredients are high quality and it had flavor but I finished the chicken in two bites and was pretty much left with half the biscuit.I also had the grits and you would have to be crazy to think that&#39;s worth $8.The pie is great, I&#39;ll give them that, and I may come back for that even at $5 a slice but you couldn&#39;t force me to $10 on a sandwich that small again."

Their menu of pies is slightly different than the Logan Square location, but that&#39;s not a bad thing, check the website and see what kind of pie you want and go to the location that soothes your pie craving.Since I live in Uptown, I am thrilled that there is a location much closer to me so I don&#39;t have to deal with California traffic to get my pie on."

This is just a review for the pie, nothing else.I just came back from European trip and saw this opened across the street. I like desserts and decide to give a try. After paying almost 6 dollar after tax for a pie of key lime pie, my first bite makes me wanna spit it out. It&#39;s very very very sweet. But I guess that&#39;s just how American desserts are.I don&#39;t want to be mean but after having all kinds of desserts in Asia and Europe. Nowhere else makes desserts as sweet as in America and this pie is even at the top of American dessert sweetness level.Price. This is definitely overpriced. People are just overpaying for the hipster atmosphere. 5-6 dollar a piece? This is what I pay for world class pastries. In Paris, a piece from top pastry shops is about 5-6 euros, which given exchange right now, it almost the same as 5-6 dollars. If you don&#39;t know Pierre Herme and Sadaharu Aoki, google them.

Try to snag one of the little tables in the front if you can.It was buzzing at an early lunch hour. Overall, I thought it was a little pricey for what it was. The decor was charming and the staff were pleasant. I&#39;ll still go back to try the sweet and savory pie."

Happy to have them in the hood. Food is good, not great. But really all of that would be fine if they didn&#39;t service the WORST coffee I have ever had in a breakfast leaning establishment. I understand they&#39;re not a coffee shop, so I&#39;ll forgive the lack of espresso. But Chicago has some of the finest coffee roasters and this local business is servicing watered down diner coffee. I talk myself out of going back all the time because what&#39;s the point of breakfast or a slice of pie with a nice warm delicious cup of joe?"

We wish the food had been as good as the warm, friendly welcome we received from the lovely young woman at the counter. Since we don&#39;t eat meat we were happy to discover the non-meat options. We were very disappointed with the biscuits and veg gravy, both overly salted and gravy extremely spicy. I was so looking forward to a light, fluffy biscuit. It was dense, almost gummy, overly rich and fatty and very salty! We also shared a yogurt parfait which was very good with their homemade vegan granola, but it was just glopped into a bowl so I&#39;m not sure how it qualified as a parfait. My husband liked his coffee and my iced tea with lavender lemonade was delicious but I was disappointed that it was served in a plastic cup.Another thing that really bothered me was the lack of good ventilation! The whole place smelled of bacon and sausage fat. (I guess some people wouldn&#39;t have a problem with this.) I will have to return at another time to sample their pie. Hopefully it will be better than the biscuits! I may be a snob, but biscuits should be tender, just like a pie crust or why bother consuming the calories!I will say that everyone around us seemed happy to be there and pleased with their food."

That&#39;s right: ever. And I&#39;m talking anywhere around the country, including Southern restaurants famous for their biscuits. Bang Bang&#39;s biscuits are moist but not heavy or dense, buttery but not greasy, and they hit just the right balance of savory with a hint of sweet. I have no idea how they do it. But I do know that at $3 each, including delicious housemade jam, their biscuits are also the best culinary deal in town.The new shop in Lincoln Square is downright adorable, and the hipster staff is very nice, efficient and chill. The pies are also exceptional, especially the wonderfully flaky crusts, but it&#39;s the biscuits that have made me a Bang Bang devotee. Goodbye, waistline!"

The whole thing was too buttery and heavy without any balance. The avocado could have benefited from some more seasoning to brighten it up (such as lime juice). The sandwich was disappointing, especially for the price. I would definitely go back and try something else, but overall I didn&#39;t feel like Bang Bang lived up to the hype."

Well, they were working on the recipe so no kougin ammans anytime soon. Ok. Ordered a canelle for my sweet treat and asked some questions about the menu as it isn&#39;t the simplest. Cashier had no idea on any. Owner (?) right behind was able to answer. Was the cashier incompetent or just not trained properly? Either way...My guest and I were served our drinks right away. I was a bit disappointed my apple cider wasn&#39;t warm...I&#39;m sure I could have asked, but I figured that&#39;s how they meant it. I wish menu would have included that detail though.After waiting a while and seeing other guests order and get their pastries right away, I figured mine had been forgotten so I went back up to the counter to request it. Another employee I hadn&#39;t yet spoken with gave it to me (without proof of purchase so I guess I could have requested more?). No one ever checked up so glad I asked.Our meals finally came out (15-20 min later?). The bean pancakes were quite good. The quiche was very jiggly, and I was not a fan of the texture. I love pie crust as well so more would have been great especially to balance the soft texture of the eggs. It was much fancier (and expensive) than I expected.Small place with one big table. Atmosphere was decent.  Service can be worked on as expressed above. Parking was pretty easy for us on a busy road. Nowhere to put purses when eating.

Not being from Chicago I wanted to try out the fantastic sounding pastries before we headed back home.When I walked in, the pastry selection was limited because items were still coming out of the oven. I do not mind waiting for food so I got bread and butter while the kouign-amanns came out of the oven. With that being said, when I was baking for a living, we had at least the first round of all pastries ready to go before we opened our doors for the day.The bread and butter was very good. Homemade butter is a real treat. The bread was chewy and full of flavor.Where the train derailed was with the kouign-amanns. I got back to where we were staying and my husbands first comment was they looked burnt. There is supposed to be a crackly crunch of caramelized sugar so I held my breath while taking my first bite. Burnt sugar. So I peeled off the layer of burnt sugar but then I didn&#39;t get the crackly buttery sugar goodness that makes a kouign-amann a kouign-amann. And I ended up throwing mine away. Such a shame. A certain bakery in Salt Lake City still holds the title of best kouign-amann I&#39;ve ever had.The nettle quiche was rich and decadent and the quiche was the richest example of a savory custard I&#39;ve ever eaten. The canele was also very good along with the cats tongue strawberry filled sandwich cookie.Overall I&#39;m glad we tried it but this won&#39;t be making the return list when we come back to Chicago."

I walked over on a Sunday morning with a friend for some breakfast. We arrived around 9 and the restaurant was filled! I really enjoyed the environment. One long shared table with a few individual tables. I would say it&#39;s a 20 seater. Proceeded to the counter and ordered our coffee, kougin-amann, croissant, a scone, bread and butter and a quiche. There was one party in front of us and we were told the wait would not be long. We were given our coffees and pastries to enjoy while we waited.All of the pastries were absolutely delicious. Kougin-amann was so so flakey and buttery. The caramelized sugar at  the bottom added a perfect crunch as it should. The scone was my all time favorite though. It was nice and airy. You can tell the dough wasn&#39;t overworked. It had a really nutty flavor that I throughly enjoyed. The croissants were solid, flakey and baked to a golden perfection.Aside from the pastries, we ordered bread and butter and the quiche. The bread was nice and chewy and had a nice crust on its exterior. The house made salted butter was rich and decadent. All I can say about the quiche is that it tasted like a light airy custard that had been lightly steamed and set. I&#39;ve never had quiche prepared this way, but it was unique and tasty.I&#39;ve went back 4 more times now and have found myself really enjoying the changing menus and pastries they offer."

I think it would be impossible to be in a bad mood while eating here. Came in around 11 on a Sunday and the place was full. Cellar Door is made up of a couple individual tables and a very large communal one. You place your order at the counter, but they don&#39;t start making your food until you&#39;ve gotten a seat. Our wait for 2 people was probably around 15 minutes.The good news is that they have some pretty amazing baked goods so while you wait, you can have a pastry as an appetizer. Even if there isn&#39;t a wait for a table, you should have a pastry as an appetizer or dessert because if they&#39;re anything like the pear tart we had, then you&#39;re in for a treat! So flaky and flavorful, you&#39;ll forget how much butter is probably in that dough.Ordered the brown butter and sage quiche and the fig yogurt bowl to split with my husband. The quiche was incredibly light and came with a green side salad. It&#39;s a pretty good sized portion. The yogurt bowl came with figs and pecans as well as a slice of cornbread and honey butter.Staff was friendly and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Looking forward to coming back again. Took away a star because the hot tea is $5 for a cup and that just seems a little ridiculous. Everything else was priced well."

The place itself is beautiful with plenty of light and friendly staff.I had been here once before and had the quiche - which, as I said, delicious. This time I decided to try something different. I ordered pastries to share and decided I would try the &#34;Turnip&#34; from the lunch menu. My friend received her dish, and I waited a little longer for mine to come. When it did, it was the saddest and most disappointing &#34;meal&#34; I have ever seen. I realize they do it light here, but the size of my dish was ridiculous for the $10 it cost.The turnip was shaved thin, with some grilled ramps, a sauce on the bottom and supposedly a chili oil on top. But it was no more than a serving spoonful of food in total. You can see from the picture I posted how silly it looks on the giant dinner plate. I don&#39;t even think I got a whole turnip in the dish...The runner took my plate away after he set it down (and I gave the plate a look of horror), and said he had forgotten something. All I could think was: &#34;Yeah, THE FOOD.&#34; He came back and said, &#34;They forgot the chili oil.&#34; Again, I stared at this massive dinner plate with a side dish of food on it. Now with a light drizzle of chili oil. For $10.I left hungry, bewildered, and disappointed, which no one is looking for in a brunch. I will probably not be back, because there are other brunch places out there that will actually feed me. Do you know how many full sized turnips I can get for $10? Sorry, Cellar.

You know why it was awesome...because it&#39;s done right and I know that they care. I mean &#34;on fleek&#34;. My boyfriend and I shared the quiche, chocolate croissant, cherry-vanilla tart, bread and butter and a cup of coffee.  The croissant was crusty outside and soft inside...not chewy. Tart had the right amount of sweetness. Bread and butter were soft. Coffee was great. Yeah...my meal sounds simple but I got full. I like that you can see people baking in the kitchen. I like the minimalistic decor. If I want a light breakfast or lunch and don&#39;t want to risk wasting my money on bad cup of coffee nor a chewy croissant....I&#39;m coming back."

There&#39;s no sign on the store and can be easily overlooked. Th pastry menu is quite limited, but that should provide more quality food right? It&#39;s a open kitchen/bakery and everything seems to be fresh made in house. I came here at 1pm on a very cold Thursday and scored the last 2 morning bun and got one crossiant. Unfortunately the Kourig Amann were all sold out. I was told that the kourig is usually sold out by 12pm... BOO! My very first kourig Amann was from Dominique Ansel Bakery in NY and was known as the DKA. I&#39;m very excited to find a place in Chicago that serves this.Crossaint - Flaky and not all buttered up. I can eat without guilt and it was really good!Morning Bun - It&#39;s made from the leftover batter of the crossaint. It&#39;s soft and flaky on the inside with bit of cinnamon and sweetness.Overall, i will definitely return for the morning bun and hopefully can score the kourig amann!! This place reminds me of the famous Tartine bakery in San Fran. Good Job!!"

I love the casual, minimalistic feel of the place.Sticky brioche roll: Perfectly sweetened and light. I could probably inhale twenty of these in one sitting.Plum tea cake: Well executed, but I personally wasn&#39;t a fan of the flavors. I was expecting more of a sweet plum rather than the slightly vinegar-y taste of japanese plums. I liked how moist and dense the cake was, and the brown sugar coating on top brought a nice touch of sweet.Blueberry danish: Another amazing pastry--the pastry itself was buttery and flaky without being overwhelming so. I wish there was a tad more blueberry flavor in the cream cheese, but overall this was delicious.Pistachio beignet: I thought this was a little disappointing, to be honest. I tasted little, if any, pistachio in here despite it being in the name. I did like the textues of the beignet with the peach and the yogurt, however.Quiche: I can&#39;t get over how good this quiche was. There was no fluff--no spinach, no vegetables, no extra ingredients. Just the wonderfully light texture of well beaten eggs complemented by a buttery, flaky crust. I loved how the richness of the quiche itself was balanced out with the shiso salad and edible flowers. Absolutely delicious and probably the best quiche I&#39;ve ever had.Overall, the pastries were solid, but the quiche was out of this world. I&#39;d come back time and time again for that quiche."

As food was delivered to various people at the table heads would turn to get a glimpse of the dish and then to compare it to the short daily menu on the wall. There is a breakfast menu and a lunch menu, each with five items on it.  The two men sitting next to me ordered the braised radish and the fermented cabbage dishes (this was more appetizing than it sounds).  From their conversation regarding the food they seemed to be in the industry, they were very likely were chefs themselves.  They complimented the chef. They even took pictures of the food.Good luck to Cellar Door Provisions - it&#39;s a gem."

From the menus written on long sheets of brown paper that hang on the walls to the communal tables in the middle of the shop, CDP doesn&#39;t approach its restaurant the way others do. But I like that.I wouldn&#39;t hesitate for a moment to order bread and butter here. We dined for brunch and ordered the day&#39;s quiche and Staff Meal - greens, a soft-cooked egg and, of course, bread and butter. The quiche was silky, almost like a custard pie.  But the bread and butter was the standout: two generous pieces of perfectly chewy bread are topped with a heaping scoop of butter and just a sprinkle of salt. When you dunk it in the yolky eggs, it tastes even better.Seating is limited and fills quickly. If you can&#39;t land a seat, though, at least you can still grab a perfectly flaky kouign amann, croissant or morning bun to take away. Bread, butter and pastries are the bread and butter of CDP."

It delivers in being particularly light and fluffy eggs. It almost tasted as though you were biting into little individual clouds.  This eggy masterpiece is one that cannot be matched in any reasonable sense.  All of the dishes I tried were quite tasty.  Everything had a  bit of a light and healthy feel to it.  Though the dishes feel a bit minimalistic they capitalize on expert use of a limited number of ingredients in order to delivier great flavor.If you&#39;re looking for a meal that will keep you light on your feet and won&#39;t weigh you down for a busy day you have found it here.   I would also be remiss to not reccomend getting a delicous cup of local cider.  This place is truely a gem.

A part of me wished i had honey butter or an herbed butter to try with the bread, but maybe that would have ruined the pureness of itQuiche - Oh my goodness. This quiche has such a simple elegance to it. It was more on the custard side, and it was so silky with no fillings (not that it needed it). Decadent without going over the top. Nice, flaky crust. For how large the piece is, the cook was consistent all the way through. Excellent dish.Smoked trout with sweet potatoes, tagarashi, seeded danish bread, soft boiled egg, and hollandaise - this was delicious as well, the trout had a beautiful flavor that paired well with everything else. The sweet potato brought a subtle autumn flavor. Each bite was fantastic.there is limited seating, so may be hard to get a spot to sit.  i didn&#39;t love how there was one long table to seat multiple parties because i felt strange looking straight ahead of me to see another party. i felt like i was prying into their conversation, but i wasn&#39;t trying to and i just didn&#39;t know where else to look! would prefer that broken out to several smaller tables that could be combined or separated when needed.Wanted to also try the canele, but they were out of it at 11 am on a Saturday.

Though minimalist throughout, the seating is extremely comfortable, even for lengthy sittings over pastries, tea and good-hearted conversation.The bread &amp; butter pairing is a nice way to start for those not scared of a few extra carbs - well worth it. The delectable quiche with side arugula salad is typically my go-to selection, but virtually every menu item is sure to peak the interest of certified foodies. Having said that, keep in mind the menu is routinely adjusted based on ingredient inventory. In other words, the menu at 2pm will likely differ from that of 9am.Seating is mainly communal and often a tight squeeze during peak brunch hours, so it&#39;s a gamble for larger parties.All &amp; all, a nice change of pace from typical diner grease - leave those spots for epic hangover days.

They definitely do a good job creating a nice communal vibe without pretension.The food is solid, but overpriced, at least what I had was. A breakfast crepe with a few sauteed vegetables that did not come close to filling me up, it wasn&#39;t bad at all but 12$ was too much for it.I went back and forth on whether this should be a three or four star rating because the place is pleasant and the food is nice but ultimately I think it is a little overpriced.I mean, a La Croix sparkling water costs 2$.... C&#39;mon man, its 3.99$ for a twelve pack at the supermarket and I assume it is even less when you buy it in bulk.Definitely a place worth checking out but they need to either increase portion sizes slightly or reduce the prices slightly for me to be a regular customer."

The food was so artfully presented and everything we ate was super fresh and tasty.  The ingredients were allowed to speak for themselves without being overpowered. And even the delicious pastries weren&#39;t dripping in grease or butter.  To put it simply, everything tasted very clean. The decor also matches the food perfectly... Tasteful, artful, creative, and clean.CDP is also owned and run by a few people who seem to genuinely care about the community and where their food comes from.  Aside from nearly everything coming from local farms and sources, these guys make their own butter, yogurt, cheese, and of course bread/baked goods in-house.  And they make their baked goods throughout the day, so they&#39;re always coming out fresh instead of everything being baked first thing in the morning.The guy working the register (Tony) seemed like a really nice/genuine person when I placed my order and helped talk me through the options. Turns out he&#39;s one of the owners.  He came over and chatted with my wife and I for awhile after we finished eating and was super cool.  We could really tell from speaking with him how much these guys care about what they&#39;re doing and about having a positive impact on the neighborhood (and planet for that matter).  They all met while working at a local food co op and it seems like that same philosophy has carried over into this new venture.I definitely recommend checking this place out...

The combination of all these flavors made is incredibly tasty.The omelette also came with a side of toast, which was phenomenal - definitely homemade and definitely worth the 2$ for a side of it.Service was great, even though is was busy staff had the patience to take us through our several questions about the various items on the menu.Two minor downsides I&#39;ll star with are the seating area is a bit small, in fact we waited for about ten minute(after ordering our food) before we got a seat.

Not bad aside from that issue.The kouign aman was good, but the bottom was a little too burned. So much in fact that I peeled off the bottom layer in order to enjoy the rest of the pastry.The canele was great it&#39;s just as good as the rest in the city but smaller and more expensive.I spotted some of the food items.

And there were some things about our meal that were very good -- the croissants and whole wheat sourdough (??) type bread that was served with the ham and eggs were delicious, and I enjoyed my sunchoke soup. The coffee was quite good, and the overall vibe of the place is refreshing. Some things, however, definitely need to be rethought as they get their legs. Our party of 5 ordered a scone, croissant, and brioche to share at the table, and each was served on a plate, bare. No offer of butter or jam on the menu or on the table, and when I asked for butter was given a tiny scrape of butter in a jar for a significant portion of baked goods. The croissant was delicious on its own. The brioche was good, but eaten plain was just not interesting enough. The scone was very tasty but parts were undercooked to the point of tasting like dough.And the &#34;ham and eggs&#34;, which my father and husband both ordered, seemed like a joke. We were told the ham was actually going to be pork belly, which, yum, but what arrived at the table was a huge portion of bread, a lovely poached egg with accoutrement, and maybe 3, 3-inch long, shaved-thin slices of limp fat with a tiny bit of pork attached. Smaller than bacon slices and half as thin. For $12, an egg, 3 big hunks of bread, some greens, and perhaps a half oz portion of pork belly. This was a silly presentation and I strongly recommend they rethink serving a dish called ham and eggs when the &#34;ham&#34; looks like garnish on the plate. There are plenty of other places in town that source from local farms and can actually feed you (not just load you up on bread) a significant amount of protein for $12."

All of the tones are beige and light green with lots of natural touches like bamboo and twigs. I felt like it was a nice touch amidst the madness of downtown. Our party of 3 was seated immediately in the middle of lunch rush hour. Outside seats were already taken up, so if you&#39;re picky, get there early!We started by sharing the Kale and Artichoke Dip. We all looked at each when it arrived because the artichoke chunks were HUGE and they had raw kale on top, but it was superb. Between the three of us, we barely made it through half and already started to feel full. So good!I ordered the Turkey Press and I was not disappointed. I will say it was a little different than the description suggests. It&#39;s definitely more of a buttered bread that&#39;s toasted (think grilled cheese) as opposed to a panini, but still delicious! Huge slices of turkey, thick cuts of avocado and lots of garlic aioli. I didn&#39;t care for the bacon (and there wasn&#39;t much of it anyway!) because it wasn&#39;t crispy, but to each their own.My aunt ordered the Havana Club and my sister ordered the Chicken and Guac. Everyone was so happy, and as I sampled bites of everyone&#39;s I started to wonder whose I liked best! All of the sandwiches come with fries, tater tots or garlic mashed potatoes without an extra charge. Their were also options for a $1.50 upcharge, including sweet potato fries and a side salad.Of course, being in downtown, sandwiches ran around $14 a person, which wasn&#39;t terrible given location. Service was slow, but it wasn&#39;t because our waitress didn&#39;t care. I honestly think she was given way too many tables, which impacted her ability to wait on each of them in a timely manner.We enjoyed it, and will definitely try out some of the other restaurants in their chain!"

On a hot night, this one really hit the spot. I ordered the salmon BLT with sweet potato fries. The roll wasn&#39;t great as I recall, but the salmon was moist, the thick cut bacon was ciao and juicy, and the jalapeno aioli rounded out all the flavors together.Great location, great atmosphere, great food and drinks, friendly service.

The whole rosemary frond in the London Mule is a nice touch, and the Sinners and Saints is appropriately strong.Do NOT get the steak sandwich - one of the worst pieces of meat I&#39;ve ever had the displeasure of experiencing.  The brie and jam on it is tasty, but the steak was fatty, not charred, chewy and just downright awful.  Try something else - the tilapia looked very good."

Kinda flavorless and the chips were not good.For lunch, I ordered the Havana Club with fries. The sandwich was very flavorful, and the pork was very tender. The fries were good, but nothing special.

If your mouth isn&#39;t watering yet, check your pulse.Best of all, they have ample outdoor seating that we took advantage of today, which eliminated the noise problem of eating in the restaurant.

You get what you need, the servers stop by, just don&#39;t expect great service. It&#39;s just not the place for it...The Parmesan crusted talapia with spinach and garlic mashed potatoes is a delicious entree well worth the $15.

I know when SB first opened they had an amazing homemade black bean burger that I loved getting even though i like my meats. Then they took it off the menu for a long time and so when I saw it back on the menu yesterday I got all excited.  I have no idea what this current veggie abomination was, but it was basically a bland breaded brick of lord knows what, but all not good. When i left 3/4 of my burger still on the plate I think my co-workers almost had heart attacks since I always eat everything. Also, the sweet potato fries tasted like they were re-fried, so just added to the bad meal.

I had barely touched my meal and was planning to have a few drinks. Anyway, within minutes we were asked to box everything up and were given the checks. We paid but continued to finish our drinks and were then kicked out! The man who kicked us out was soo rude! The place wasn&#39;t supposed to close until 10 and we were asked to leave before 9pm.Never in my life have I been treated in such a rude fashion. I was forced to stand outside in 20 degree weather to wait for my ride because they would not allow us to wait inside at 9pm! I understand wanting to close early on a slow night, but you do not do that when you have PAYING customers who intended to have a nice night out.Needless to say we will never be back. How rude, south branch."

The waitress took our food after we were done and didn&#39;t offer it to go. We assumed it was... but it wasn&#39;t. We sat forever with an empty glass of beer before the waitress returned.Maybe if you sat at the bar it would be better, but as a sitdown it won&#39;t be good enough to bring us back"

I love the interior decoration -- it has a slightly casual, upscale, yet elegant vibe. I just don&#39;t like the green river but that&#39;s not their fault. ;-)As far as the food, it&#39;s where you can find your over-priced yet still tasty business lunch. It&#39;s nothing that&#39;s extraordinary. I really enjoyed their Bang Bang shrimp as an appetizer. It has an Asian twist to it with just enough crunch. Their hummus platter was decent. I liked the texture that more resembles peanut butter than Sabras or what you can get at a grocery store.I also ordered the Mahi Mahi salad. Although the dressing was good, the napa cabbage seemed wilted. The portions are ginormous though! Even after one hour of digging in, I still had what could pass as a complete portion in front of me. The salad is about $17 so ... be aware. The mahi mahi wasn&#39;t super fresh though, which is disappointing.Overall, it&#39;s a great place for a business lunch. If you&#39;re trying to impress a client, I think the location rather than the quality of the food itself is more important, but hey, what do I know as a yuppie?"

If your into sports this is a great place to go to watch the game. Many TVs and great atmosphere. When I lived in the burbs I also like it&#39;s close to the metra train station, so you can eat and have plenty of time to make your train.My favorite item on the menu has got to be the buffalo rolls. Must get appetizer when you go. I also enjoy the Santa FE wrap and I go back and forth between getting the fries or being my child like self and getting the tater tots as my side.

After closing out my tab, my friends and I went to grab our coats, and mine was no longer hanging on the rack. The employees told me they had seen a girl walk out with two winter coats - one tied around her waist over the one she was wearing. My keys and work badge were in the pockets of my coat.The following day, I called to see if my belongings had been returned. South Branch called me back later that day to inform me that the finance of the girl who took my coat had dropped my keys and work badge off, but not my coat, and he would *likely* drop my coat off in a few days.When I went to pick up my keys and my badge and found that my coat had not yet been returned, I asked that management contact the person who had dropped my keys and badge off, and they told me that they had not taken down any contact information for him, which is extremely disappointing. I, and a number of my colleagues, work right across the street and have loved grabbing drinks at South Branch after work. Unfortunately, after this experience, I will not be returning.

It would be very nice to sit outside during the summer. I chose the tomato basil soup and Cowboy salad. The tomato soup was a disaster. It tasted like they dumped the half cup of salt in there.

I truly tried my best to finish it but could only ate half of it. My coworker liked her fish Taco.The price was a bit high for lunch.

Anyways, when we got there, the waiter spent about ten minutes trying to find a table that would accommodate us. Fortunately, he found us one, and guess where it was?! In a private room! The room was absolutely beautiful, and it included a huuuuge round table so that we were all facing each other. We got really lucky for not having made a reservation. Anyways, I ordered the fish tacos. When served, they looked absolutely amazing and vibrant. Props to the chef for having good plating skillz. The taste, however, was pretty average. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because I&#39;m Pakistani and I NEED tons of spices/flavor for a food to taste really good to me, but their fish tacos were just lackin&#39;. I was so ecstatic when I ordered them because I love fish tacos more than I love my cat (actually, not really), but the taste was honestly a 6/10. My friend ordered lobster mac &#39;n&#39; cheese, which was around $20 for a bowl, and after one bite, she pushed it away. She didn&#39;t like the taste at all, so she resorted to eating my side of sweet potato fries. Tragic.All in all, the food was pretty average.

We were promptly greeted by our waitress who took our drink orders and we decided to get the buffalo rolls appetizer. These were awesome! They&#39;re like egg rolls..but with buffalo chicken in them, and they come with carrots, celery, homemade blue cheese, and extra buffalo sauce.For my entree I ordered the waldorf salad. It was pretty good, but the beets were a little overpowering for me. I loved the candied walnuts, cranberries, and the sliced apples with apple vinaigrette. I saw them bring someone some kind of salmon salad that looked pretty good..I&#39;ll have to try that next time. Coworker got some kind of cuban club sandwich with avocado and bacon. and picked the side of mashed potatoes. This portion of mashed potatoes was insane, like as big as my head.

South Branch was very accommodating regarding reservations and flexible with fluctuating numbers/moving tables around. Additionally, the waitress was great about splitting checks up for our group which I&#39;m sure is a pain to deal with.I had the seared tuna salad, which was good but not amazing (someone pointed out that it could use some acidity like lemon which I agree with and think this would be a great addition). Everyone else&#39;s food looked great (I&#39;m definitely trying the turkey burger next time) and folks enjoyed what they had. Food service was very quick.The one downside was that the red wine I ordered was VERY warm. I would expect this in a dive bar/pub, but South Branch is not a dive bar and has a decent wine list so I expected better. To me, warm red wine is pretty unpalatable. That being said, I would certainly go back as there was a great atmosphere on a Friday after work, plenty of space and a good menu. I know they have a great outdoor patio area so maybe I&#39;ll wait until winter is over!"

Their Sunny-side-up Burger.. a soft pretzel buns, bacon, caramelized onions, lettuce, tomato, and a oozing egg. I always eat it with the sweet potato fries... and 10+ napkins. This is by far one of my favorite lunch time splurges... and I finish it right in enough time for an afternoon nap.2. Their Calamari.... delicious and very great for a happy hour appetizer!3. Herb Crusted Salmon... served over a tomato pure&#39;... SO yummy!4. Cowboy Salad... a lighter option, but just as yummy and filling.They always have great service and drinks as well. I once ordered a drink that I didn&#39;t really enjoy, and the waitress asked me why I wasn&#39;t drinking it and when I told her it just wasn&#39;t my favorite, she comped it, and brought me an alternate beverage.... without me asking!Our company has had numerous company events and happy hours here, and I have always been extremely happy.

SO OF COURSE WE GOT THE CHEESE CURDS!!! =D  I think they are especially good here because of the batter and the unique smoked tomato coulis side filling.Although I am sure that we all would have been perfectly happy with a few plates of cheese curds, I ordered the Grilled Yellowfin Tuna Sandwich, and my teammates ordered the Turkey Burger Flight special and some Baja Fish Tacos. My sandwich was so good - everything complimented each other so well, and the portion was so big that I was even able to save half for later. The sandwich is a bit difficult to eat since the tuna is a rather thick cut so maybe opt for something else if you&#39;re trying to look cute while eating.

South Branch is located at the former location of the underrated Pazzo&#39;s. Despite the fact that it&#39;s a dead work day in downtown, the place is packed with well-dressed young professionals taking long lunch breaks because it is slow at work this holiday week (same here, except for the &#34;young&#34; part). We waited 20 minutes for a table, and even though the place was packed it never felt like we were crammed next to another group. The window seats along the river look like prime seats. The bar looked like a good place for an after work drink, so I may have to save that for another day.Instead of going for the patty meIt, I ordered the Trevi - grilled chicken sandwich with mozzarella and tomato on a fairly blah focaccia roll. I guess my choice was the healthier one, though I might do the patty melt next time. The sweet potato fries were not bad. I did have a bit of lunch envy as my boss had The Dip, a massive prime rib sandwich on Texas toast with a small bowl of au jus dip that he could not use for awhile because the sandwich was so big. He gobbled up the tater tots, and also a bowl of tortilla soup that looked good too. Service seemed rapid here, so even with the wait for a table we spent only about an hour there."

The glass rim is sprinkled with salt and spice and it comes with a few pieces of cheese, which pairs really well with the drink itself!We shared the lemon pancakes and salmon hash for a mix of sweet and savory. The lemon pancakes were GREAT! It&#39;s not what you&#39;d expect lemon pancakes to taste like. The lemon sauce is more sweet than sour and the pancakes are perfectly fluffy. It&#39;s topped with fresh blueberries to make you feel good about yourself after indulging in the pancakes. The salmon hash is also amazing!

Well, this is the spot! Delicious (more so on certain items than others..) and inviting.The service was great, we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table for five people around noon on a Saturday. That&#39;s pretty fast for a brunch place at that time. The staff were friendly and kept checking up on us if we needed any refills on any of our drinks. One of my friends received her entree fairly late after the rest of us got our food, and they comp&#39;d us some chocolate dipped strawberries. I thought that was a pleasant surprise, especially since we didn&#39;t think much of the timing of her food nor complained about it at all. Another note is that if you eat inside the restaurant, it can be pretty loud due to their high ceilings. So if you want to hear your friends talk a little clearer, I would sit at the outside patio.Now onto the food and drinks. The drinks we had were iced coffee, and Vietnamese iced coffee. The iced coffee was good, not too acidic. However, I do not recommend the Vietnamese iced coffee. It does not taste remotely near any authentic Vietnamese iced coffee! It just tastes like a cup of iced coffee with milk and a ton of granulated sugar instead of using condensed milk. And onto what I had, the Kingsbury Eggs Benedict. It was delicious!!!! I highly recommend it. The sauces on top were great, and the hot sauce that we got at our table was a great addition to it as well. The roasted baby potatoes with the Benedict were just as tasty as the main part of my meal. Four people in my group had this, and one girl got the salmon frittata (which she said she enjoyed!).I would definitely come back here and try to explore the menu a little more."

If you want to beat the rush, 9:30 am on Saturday is the perfect time; the place was mostly empty. We were even able to snag an outdoor table with a great view of that gargantuan Whole Foods across the street...Service was outstanding! I don&#39;t think my water glass even got to half empty, and I pound water at restaurants like it&#39;s my job. We started with a couple blueberry muffins because those immediately caught my eye in the display case when we walked in. AMAZING. They come out cut in half and slightly toasted. I&#39;m tempted to go back this weekend and just buy a 100 of them.Beyond muffins, I ordered the Kingsbury Eggs Benedict, which had bbq pulled chicken instead of Canadian bacon. It was good! Didn&#39;t blow me away but I left full and satisfied. My one friend tried their famous lemon pancakes which he loved. My other friend got the avocado toast special. Beautiful dish but the gluten free bread kind of killed it she said.Great place for brunch down if you&#39;re down by the Clybourn strip mall (at least that&#39;s what I call it). Would definitely go back!"

FREE parking if you find a spot.LEMON PANCAKES ($12) -- 2 big circles of fluffy pancakes.  Lemon sauce is best enjoyed when you slice the pancake pizza-style to enjoy the perfect bite.  Too much carb for my taste that half went to trash.  What a waste of $$.  Only a gluten-free pancake can charge $10+.SALMON HASH WITH POACHED EGGS ($16) -- Worthy.  Serves 2+.  Perfectly poached eggs.  Plenty of salmon.  Perfectly sliced small peppers.  Nice touch of garlic buttered perfectly grilled French bread.GRILLED HANGER STEAK POBLANO ($17) -- the classier version of Steak Fajitas by $3.  A good balance of ingredients with a monotone flavor.  Serves 2+.  Reheats well.  Good amount and quality hanger steak.  I wish the poblano pepper can add pizzazz into the dish, fine dining style.In BEVERAGES, you are funding the Bodum glass supply:VIETNAMESE COFFEE ($4.50) -- clean taste with a portion that leaves your heart palpitating.  Comparative product at $3.25 on Rush St.  *wink*MASALA CHAI TEA LATTE ($4.50) -- it&#39;s by Rishi.  Streeterville area goes for $3.75.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s same taste.ETHIOPIAN DRIP COFFEE ($4) -- taste like it&#39;s slow/V60 drip.  Clean.  Since it is dark roast (negated delicate Ethiopian Bean origin), I doubt the beans are single origin.  SKIP.SERVICE -- they can sell you the menu like its the last meal on earth.  Sunday&#39;s Host took the time to tell me that kitchen closes in 15 mins.  Since it&#39;s a rare occurrence to places that charges max price, it&#39;s tacky!  It&#39;s best to go across the street, no tips needed.  *wink*BAKERY is ordinary, overpriced with decent portion.  Go across the street!  The $4.50 MERINGUE was hard and too sweet -- sweet jam on a sweet meringue (sugar overdosed!)."

The menu was extensive and had a lot of fun and creative dishes.I ordered the Lemon Pancakes with a side of the bacon and my copilot ordered the special, avocado toast with poached eggs. Both dishes were absolutely delicious and the coffee was strong.The only reason this got three stars is because the service was largely underwhelming. The server seemed burdened by our eating there, so it was relatively unpleasant to interact with them. Don&#39;t expect to feel comfortable eating here."

Yes, the food is amazing, the coffee is strong, the foam on the cappuccino is perfect.They place is clean, sharp, very open, easy on eyes, pretty loud, but fun. Good art, fresh flowers, and they have a few tables outside. With a beautiful decor around them. Most of the time you will wait for a table...30 min even more...very normal for this place.Service- this is where it&#39;s gets tricky for me. I do love this place, but they will still only get a three stars for me, not because of the food but because of not consistent service they provide. Like today I waited for over 20 min for my cappuccino. Last time they where not exempting credit cards and after I ordered my food, I was told no cash no service. No explanation or nothing. Like--/there is a cash machine on the corner...stuff like that happens on and off here. Sometimes they are just missing the easy smile that goes a long way..."

And that&#39;s including the fact that Kingsbury Street Cafe sits next door to one of the better strip clubs in Chicago. Now granted, our city isn&#39;t exactly known for it&#39;s naked lady spots, but still, I&#39;d spend my hard earned dollars on this breakfast dish over a lapper from about anyone in the entire world. Ok...maybe not Channing Tatum.The egg whites, spinach, roasted tomatoes, and giant prawns just go together more perfectly than anything I&#39;ve ever eaten in the morning. Not to mention it&#39;s half way healthy. Sure, paired with a cup of coffee, and you&#39;re looking at about a 20 spot for a breakfast, but sometimes the finer things in life are just worth paying for.Always incredible service and you can park pretty easily in the Whole Foods loading area. Overall the only thing I don&#39;t like is when I&#39;ve tried to go too early and they weren&#39;t open. Other than that this is probably my second favorite breakfast in the city."

It&#39;s definitely not a light brunch item. Only order this if you&#39;re hungry, because it&#39;s quite large. That being said, it&#39;s delicious. I added some sriracha to it, because everything is improved with a little hot sauce.

The restaurant was two-thirds full, with the outdoor tables turning over. I was hoping we would be able to get one, but we had 3 parties in front of us who arrived about 30 seconds before we hopped in line.It wasn&#39;t a good start. We waited for what it seemed to be 10 minutes just to speak to the host. We were going to have a party of 3 or 4, and when we stated that our 4th member may not come, that seemed to cause a crisis for the male host.We eventually were seated, and things did not get better. Our menus arrived and we browsed, then waited, and waited, and waited. My brother finally went up to the host and made sure that they knew our 4th wouldn&#39;t be coming (we weren&#39;t sure but we didn&#39;t want to delay service; ended up being delayed anyways!)When our waiter arrived, we were ready to order. My friend order the Piggy Moo sandwich or whatever it&#39;s called, along with a bloody Maria. My brother ordered the Kingsbury breakfast, which came with eggs, bacon, roasted potatoes, roasted tomatoes, and their whole wheat buttered toast.  I created my own omelette with leaks, mushrooms, and peppers. I had a choice of potatoes or tomatoes, and opted for the latter. The toast (whole wheat) was also included. I added a side of sautéed spinach as well.My friend&#39;s bloody Maria was terrible and he barely took 2 sips. His sandwich was good; he was full and saved his potatoes and half of his sandwich for tomorrow. My brother enjoyed his bacon the most. He also said that the hot sauce on his scrambled eggs was good. As for me, my omelette was just okay. Not great, but nothing made me go &#39;Wow.&#39; I was given potatoes instead of my requested tomatoes, but was given the latter after mentioning it. They both were very good.My meal was 13.50. Our total was 49 and change. I went up with two 20s to get change and was told by the male host to go to the bar. Not a problem, but I was very irked by his overall demeanor, to be honest with you. I usually give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but this guy just rubbed me the wrong way. Our server was good; no complaints there. Food came out relatively quickly, too.There&#39;s nothing that is going to make me come back to this place, especially with x amount of restaurants in the area. The overall experience was not good."

We waited almost an hour (to be expected, we had no reservations and it was a Sunday). The food (breakfast sandwich, salmon hash, and chilaquiles) was all average, definitely not worth the price tag. We did have a lovely helpful waitress, and the space is bright and delightful, even on the rainy day we came.Overall okay, but won&#39;t be coming back for sit down brunch.The pastries are very good- pop in to take one to go!notjustbrunch.wordpress.…"

Our orders taken and the food was delivered promptly. Presentation was amazing and taste even better! I had the Lemon pancakes and bacon. You don&#39;t need syrup because the Lemon sauce is perfection. My son had a burger. He doesn&#39;t really chew but sorta inhales his food. I guess it was good.  My daughter had salmon and egg benedict. She was really impressed. It was so much she couldn&#39;t eat it all.I ate here about 4 times a couple years back then had an issue with the food (hair in it) and the lack of concern by my server and management caused me to avoid it for about a year. I returned because my daughter wanted to try the place.  Glad I came back.

One of my FAVORITE dishes is the lemon pancakes (with the creme anglaise &amp; lemon sauce); I was a bit hesitant the first time, however SO glad I tried them and recommend and get them each time now. We usually get a plate to share for the table, so we can all have a few bites. Surprisingly, these aren&#39;t as sweet as most specialty pancakes. It was a perfect taste of sweet! A MUST TRY at this place! I usually get the chilaquiles here, which are always delicious and I like how they use fresh jalapenos on the dish. My friend got the vegan breakfast patties and really enjoyed them; he actually couldn&#39;t tell if it was vegan or meat at first (he is not a vegetarian by the way). We also did a &#34;made your own omelette&#34; - it was a pretty big serving, and didn&#39;t end up finishing it. It was filling and good, however nothing out of the ordinary. I would recommend getting one of their other dishes that is more unique to this place.  My friend got the melon &amp; ginger fruit cooler - I tried a bit of hers and really wasn&#39;t a fan. It tasted exactly that - a lot of ginger water with a hint of melon. The coffee here is great...really strong, but a bit on the expensive side. Not a big deal though for your occasional coffee! The service here is so-so; nothing terrible or outstanding. It&#39;s always been busy every time we&#39;ve gone, so that may also be the reason. If you are planning on going during the weekend, expect to wait a bit - it will definitely be worth it though!"

If you&#39;re a lemon fan like I am, definitely recommend! Although it could do without that super sweet sauce in the middle on top of the lemon sauce drizzled on top of the pancake. The blueberries on it are also a nice touch! Also, had the chia oatmeal and it was ok... Nothing I would kill for (haha) The egg white omelette was decent. Fresh veggies in the omelette, but nothing special. Fries are huge and chicken tenders for kids was quite unique. Doesn&#39;t look like your typical chicken tenders but still crispy. Didn&#39;t have much flavor which is good for kids, but when I have to finish my kid&#39;s food, it should have a little flavor for my taste. Would go back just for lemon pancakes... The price of it...not a fan of... Can do without paying $12 for two decent sized pancakes...$7 maybe better  the host was also a sweetheart, and I felt bad because he kept picking up my son&#39;s little toy train. I didn&#39;t get to pay the bill since my friend picked it up, but I would definitely leave a nice tip for the welcoming atmosphere and helpfulness of the host."

The salmon hash, flavor filled, light, filling and generous in portion. It took about 20 minutes for the food to come, but totally worth it!

But you really can&#39;t order anything bad here. Bakery items won&#39;t disappoint either. Fresh ingredients with a modern ambience. The servers and baristas have always been friendly. Making a reservation is best for parties of 4 or more, especially on the busy weekends. Usual quiet during the weekday mornings  before business hours which can be conducive to breakfast meetings. Otherwise, when it&#39;s a full house, the noise level is high. Across from the Whole Foods so the traffic can be moderately heavy and the buzzer from the WF garage can be distracting, if you&#39;re seated in the outside patio."

I must the say the food is amazing and so tasty and delicious. I had the tomato quiche twice which they only serve on weekends and the other time I had the kingsbury breakfast. My friends love there cheese scone and even had to take one to go. I am glad this restaurant came on check please. I would come back here in a heartbeat and recommended to others.

My date got 2 breakfast entrees!!  What a woman!!! :DShe got the salmon hash which she LOVED and the lemon pancakes which she also loved.I got a delicious breakfast sandwich called piggy moo cluck sandwich. Yum as ever! Came with breakfast potatoes.In the spirit of ordering 2 things I got a chocolate chip muffin toasted with butter. It was delightful.The only hiccup I had was when I ordered an ice mocha the person who dropped it at the table (not our waiter) said &#34;here is your latte&#34; I said this is not a mocha to the waiter and he returned some time later to say. &#34;They said it IS a mocha but how did you want it to be differently and they&#39;ll make you another&#34;. I had to say &#34;well there was absolutely no chocolate in that drink so starting there I guess is what I would like.&#34;  When he returned to the table he definitely had an iced mocha so I felt a lot better.  My date had an alcoholic drink which she liked but I cannot remember the type however I do remember a lot of fruit and it was very boozy. She liked it.Service was great in fact since she ordered two entrees the server offered to warm her pancakes up since she had let them cool considerably while having the salmon hash.Despite going around 11:30am on a Sunday the wait was only about 20 minutes. It was a cool rainy day tho and patio was closed.

Kids will love the little silverware and extensive kids menu but slow service and few check-backs makes it less kid friendly. No crayons or anything to occupy the kids so they will get antsy with how long it takes to get their food. This restaurant will nickel and dime you for everything here...$1 for this, $1 for that, $5 for this, $8 for that. It all adds up. I got a salad with no drink and my kids split 1 kids meal for lunch and the total was over $30 without tip. It seems excessive for what was ordered."

I wanted so bad to love this place but I&#39;m a bit disappointed.The service was friendly. No complaints there.The food: disappointing!I had a bakon bloody and the presentation was nice but I felt it lacked some zing.My sister ordered the shrimp frittata and she said there was way too much tomato flavor, considering there was two whole plum roasted tomatoes plopped on her plate I don&#39;t doubt it. So if you&#39;re not a fan of tomato, ask them to omit when ordering that dish.I ordered the kingsbury special, 2 eggs, maple bacon, potatoes and a roasted tomato. The maple bacon was delicious, the potatoes were hard and bland. Tomato and eggs were fine, not much you can do wrong there. It came with a cheddar scone, which I also felt lacked flavor. The coffee was good.Over all, I am glad I can finally say I have been but I doubt I will be returning."

It&#39;s two poached eggs smothered in hollandaise sauce, topped over a pile of delicious pulled BBQ chicken, rested over two fresh pieces of English muffin.Anyways, with that out of the way, I now have yet another contender for favorite brunch place in Chicago.Kingsbury Street Café is a bit misleading, because it&#39;s more diner than a café.With bright lighting, large open tables, and tall stools by the side, it&#39;s as close to a modern diner as you can get.While they are a bit lacking in the sweet department, their egg based brunch items are amazing.I&#39;ve tried the Kingsbury Café Breakfast (pretty standard, but those herb potatoes are amazing), Piggy Moo Cluck sandwich (loved the smoked ham with maple glazed bacon) and Kingsbury eggs benedict (delicious on all levels).They&#39;ve also got some killer coffee, notably the Vietnamese drip coffee. Just know that their Ethiopian and Vietnamese drip coffee don&#39;t come with free refills, so if you&#39;re lacking some caffeine, stick to their house coffee.They&#39;ve also got an awesome assortment of pastries and deserts by the front, something I am definitely planning to explore in the future."

The cheddar scone was to die for, moist, just a little cheesy. I had the veggie meat patties which weren&#39;t awesome but with some ketchup, passable. I don&#39;t fault the restaurant, it&#39;s soy after all. I thought the stewed tomatoes were a weird addition to the breakfast but no harm done.The service was pretty fast and attentive.

Loved the open space. So refreshing to go to a brunch spot and actually be somewhat intimate, without the hectic chaos of traditional brunch diners.After reading other reviews, I opted to build my own omelette. I originally was taken aback by the idea, as I tend to think that restaurants should have a clear idea of their own concoctions. However, at Kingsbury they had both. My omelette had gruyere, jalapenos, leeks and turkey sausage. This just may have been one of the best omelettes I&#39;ve ever had, and I think I would say the same if I had chosen different ingredients. They just really know how to make an omelette here. Not only that, but they did not skimp on the ingredients at all. The accompanied potatoes were fine but the multigrain toast was delicious. Loved how it was in a biscotti form, as it was not only easier to eat, but looked nice as well. Also thought that the omelette option was good bang for your buck, as the portion was quite generous, and starts out at $10 for 3 ingredients and just $1 more for every additional ingredient, so mines was only $11.Sis thought her tofu miso scramble was a tad salty while cousin thought his shrimp egg white frittata was quite bland.We also shared the lemon pancakes and these were amazing. Super light and fluffy with a perfect lemony, not-too-sweet glaze.Service was pretty good. Server and staff were friendly and waters were refilled when necessary.Overall, would love to come back.

The food is OUTSTANDING!  The place has a very clean, stylish design.  There are very high ceilings, so it can be a bit noisy but you can still hear your companion without shouting. There is slightly an open kitchen and you can see the chefs working their magic.The food is just simply devine!  We had the whole wheat carrot pancakes with cream cheese and toasted pecans.  This is an outstanding riff on carrot cake. The pancakes weren&#39;t dry, as whole wheat can be, very tender and with a small dollop of syrup (which came on the side in a cute little crock) you could taste all those wonderful flavors without getting knocked over by richness or sweetness, it was balanced and VERY tasty!Next we had the egg white frittata with roasted tomato and kale with three perfectly cooked jumbo shrimp and a sprinkling of feta (you could choose goat cheese too). This too was simply amazing!  It was cooked perfectly, presented beautifully and was light and very flavorful.The coffee comes in a huge mug and is &#34;Starbucks grade&#34; (yum!) the cream comes in its own individual chilled crock, no prepackaged creamer crap here!  We each had a small freshly squeezed OJ (double yum!). Service was nice, friendly and but just a tad slow.The menu is diverse and I am going to make it my job to try it all!  I just don&#39;t think you can go wrong here!  There may be a wait but it is soooooo worth it.I love this little slightly hidden gem, but it&#39;s across from whole foods so there&#39;s your landmark to find it. Double win because I can eat here and shop there!Our tab was $46, I think that&#39;s on point for the exceptional food we had. I think the ingredients used , preparation and presentation are reflective of the price, and very &#34;worth it&#34; to me.This is a place you want on your radar, get there soon, you will be delighted you did!"

The dish has a nice creme anglaise  &amp; lemon sauce, lemon zest and blueberries, which all worked together well. My husband and I split this with a create your own egg white omelet(roasted red peppers, onions) that was nice and fluffy. The omelet came with well seasoned and roasted fingerling potatoes and some multigrain bread.  I also ordered a large orange juice, which was pricy, but I believe fresh squeezed.Overall this was a nice brunch place, a bit on the pricey side if you order beverages, but the food was fresh and tasty.The atmosphere is minimalistic and very bright/airy with the high ceilings. The waitstaff was on point and friendly. We did find free street parking on the block behind the restaurant."

We sat outside under the shade of a nearby tree next to window boxes of herbs. I ordered the mushroom quiche with side salad and an order of bacon. Everything was perfect. Hot, and rich with an abundance of mushrooms mixed with fresh and tangy with spicy arugula topped off with BACON! Seriously this bacon though you guys. It had a GLAZE. Possibly maple? Possibly liquid crack? 3 slices of heaven that the entire table was salivating over. If you go here and don&#39;t get bacon, go straight to the nearest sanitorium. Oh, you&#39;re vegan and don&#39;t eat bacon?? Excellent, more for me! My only regret was not getting a bloody mary in case there was bacon in it.tl;dr: go here and order a mimosa and bacon."

Every dish that the servers brought out looked absolutely incredible. We decided to go with the eggs Benedict with pork and carrot pancakes. Every bite got better. It was hard to leave knowing that we don&#39;t have restaurants in my hometown that even remotely resemble the flavor and unique dishes that this place serves. We also had a couple bloody Mary&#39;s, which were pretty good and the perfect addition to brunch."

We were especially eager to try it out because we had been big fans of  Work Of Art, it&#39;s parent. It&#39;s a very nice addition to the burgeoning shopping expanse of the Clybourn Corridor.The place serves breakfast and lunch all day on weekdays and brunch on weekends. It&#39;s a large, bright, airy space, comfortably casual. Service was friendly and a bit leisurely, which suited us on our recent visit. I think anyone could find something appealing on the menu, which features American café favorites with a few Vietnamese influences. In addition to a variety of coffees, teas and soft drinks, there was a small selection of beers not on the menu (I did not inquire about wines).We each had sandwich plates, and they were generous. My pork belly bánh mì was tasty, though a bit messy to eat; it was served on a toasted baguette rather than the traditional soft roll, and the ingredients were not uniformly distributed -- as a result, things kind of oozed out here &amp; there. My sweetie&#39;s BLAT with chicken was more composed, and was delicious (the chicken was exemplary in its freshness and good flavor). Each came with a nice small salad of greens and carrot shreds; my only complaint was that the vinaigrette was too vinegary). The BLAT would easily have served two diners; I think it would be a smart choice if they had a half-sandwich option paired with soup or salad.We had a nice lunch. The BLAT sandwich stood out as our favorite, and all the rest was definitely A-OK. I&#39;d surely stop by again if I were in the neighborhood at lunchtime."

What brunch place has a valet only parking lot in Lincoln Park? This is not River North or the Loop people...We had a large group and we were seated at the front table near the host stand. It was great to be out of the way except that area of the restaurant was absolutely FREEZING. Between the front door opening and closing and blowing cold air in and being seated next to the large front windows I was not warm for a moment of my time spent there.For my meal I had the steak and pepper sandwich with fries. The sandwich and fries were good but not great. The food took a quite awhile to come and I found it to be a somewhat overpriced for what we were served.Overall I think that Kingsbury is a bit overrated and I think there are a much better spots to go for brunch that are a better bang for your buck and definitely more comfortable and easily accessible.

We waited about 10 minutes in Saturday morning for a table. Upon being seated we order a couple of house bloody Mary&#39;s. They were spicy, but not over the top. You can&#39;t governing with Tito&#39;s vodka either and that&#39;s what the house is made with. We had trouble deciding what to get so we got eggs benedict and whole wheat carrot waffles to share. Both most excellent!!!! The open kitchen made it able to see all the food coming out and we admired each plate. Everything looked so amazing! I def recommend this place!!!!"

We wanted to sit outside but the 5 tables in front were full. They have a ton of tables to the side of the place but no chairs, that&#39;s a problem. We were seated inside where it was nearly empty.The waiter took close to ten minutes to acknowledge us. I saw on the menu that the least expensive drink was a canned soda at $2. Call me crazy but I wasn&#39;t about to pay $6 for lemonade!! So what if it&#39;s fresh squeezed - $6??? It costs about 20 cents to make.My diet coke came in a glass and at first I thought it was a dark iced tea as there was no carbonation. It was flat and tasted like pure sweet syrup. I called the waiter over and he explained that they didn&#39;t have any cans and that this came from a gun. I asked for an iced tea instead.When that arrived I took one sip and nearly got sick. It tasted like I was drinking perfume. And that was $3.50.I ordered the grilled bbq chicken sandwich which came on a focaccia bun with a small side salad. It was fairly dry and unappealing but not awful. My daughter had a &#34;bahn mi&#34; sandwich which she liked; her boyfriend enjoyed the veggie burger. I did ask at the end to have the tea removed from the bill. The waiter was a bit arrogant in stating that I was the only person that ever complained about it.All in all the service was sketchy, the food was just ok and it was overpriced. The city needs more basic restaurants where you don&#39;t have to float a loan to eat lunch. These places are all trying to outdo each other and this one didn&#39;t cut it. Would not go back. I&#39;ll squeeze my own lemonade."

Still waited for another 20 minutes while the tables sat there empty. Food was nothing special, especially when you add in the price you&#39;re paying.

I had the Benedict and it was so flavorful! My friends both built their own omelettes and also thought they were exceptionally good. They got mimosas and I had their regular Bloody Mary- awesome!

What I miss most of all about Chicago is the food, and this place does not disappoint! I ordered, because I was feeling sassy on a Sunday, the house Bloody Mary (they have all different kinds with tequila, whiskey etc). It was great, spicy, and fresh! You can tell its homemade tomato juice!I had the build your own omelette with egg whites packed full of veggies. I picked the roasted tomato and toast rather than the potatoes. The toast was more like a baguette/biscotti and it was incredible! I got the whole wheat....mmmm!My friend ordered the quinoa and kale which came with an egg on top...wow, it looked amazing and she loved it!They also have lemon pancakes which we didn&#39;t order but looked at longingly and envious from afar. Will definitely get those next time I am in town!The decor is minimalist and modern and just perfect!

Few but good amount of diners, a hostess with a friendly greeting right by the front doors, open space, with lots of sunlight coming through the windows. Clean and quiet, it&#39;s a great meet up place with a friend or in a middle of a work day.WONDERFUL menu. All natural burgers and I ordered one, and it was thick, and the patty was cooked perfectly medium as requested. Came with largely sliced tomatoes and lettuce, along with a pickle and fresh cut fries on the side. I heard brunch is amazing, and I would come back for that.The reason why I rated this restaurant a 4 instead of 5 was because I was asked by the hostess, who was very friendly, to order &#39;to go&#39; by the cashier. 4 people working on the staff, and one of the cooks, after a few minutes of waiting, said &#39;2 more minutes.&#39; He didn&#39;t make any eye contact, no greeting, but for not being so busy, and it being during lunch hour, I felt patience was key, but i&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t get to me sooner. I waited for 10 minutes for my food, but that&#39;s okay. I know they cook everything fresh, and they did offer me water or to order a drink, but I should&#39;ve received attention more quickly. I do believe that if I was dining here, it probably would have been a quicker notice.I think this cafe does strive to improve and do it&#39;s best. Great location next to Whole Foods.

If you plan on going, understand the parking situation is pretty dismal. Like, real bad. We had made a reservation but definitely did not need it at 11:30 on a Saturday morning. They brew their own coffee and it was fantastic, very bold. Aidan L. thought that the breakfast quinoa sounded interesting, so we ordered this to start. I liked the idea, but you can&#39;t really hide the taste of quinoa or pretend that it&#39;s as tasty as oatmeal.For brunch, I ordered the salmon hash and was incredibly pleased with my decision. The flavor of the salmon and herbs was awesome, absolutely recommend this dish. The boyfriend created his own omelet and it was gargantuan. He thought it was good, but nothing amazing. There was a lot of egg, but not a ton of fillings. The toast that came with it, however, WAS amazing. Thick bread with unbelievable raspberry preserves, this tasted more like cake than toast. The real reason for my drop down to four stars is the service. Our waiter was friendly, but was MIA for what felt like years. Tables around us were sat, ate, and left in the time we were at Kingsbury. He was just nowhere to be found for most of the meal.

There they&#39;re uniformly shredded and cooked so that they&#39;re golden brown and crispy on at least one side, maybe both sides. The ones we&#39;ve had here have been an assortment of randomly shaped and sized potato pieces with some browned bits mixed in throughout.

Hard liquor is where it&#39;s at here. Debated going for a second one, but I was pretty toasty after that first and didn&#39;t want to end up like the guy I saw on the way to the restroom holding on to the wall for dear life, so I decided on a 22oz draft Guinness to get into the St. Patty&#39;s Day mood.The food here... Just okay. I went for their Chicken Pot Pie special served with your choice of soup, salad, or potato. Overall it was alright, but I must say it was pretty generous on the chicken comparable to how generous they are on their alcohol.

Basically the same quality, though.Service was fine enough, but it does seem that basically all the servers had been here for 20 years and were &#34;over it.&#34;I don&#39;t really have a problem with this place, but I have no intention to go back for a work lunch."

Then you&#39;re in a pickle.You&#39;ll casually mention Ceres to friends as a happy hour visit to gauge their interest. If they agree, you know what kind of night is in store. Most will run or hide - bad memories or they can&#39;t face the challenge. You&#39;ll struggle to find friends willing to come here on a M-Th night. Friday it&#39;s jam packed and they&#39;ll make an excuse that it&#39;s too busy to warrant coming here... excuses.You&#39;ll develop a love hate relationship for this place. Love the amount of alcohol per serving, hate the hangover per hour the following morning. You might call in sick or work from home. But you&#39;re a champ and you&#39;ll come into work.

I&#39;d never had the occasion to venture here except for yesterday, for a happy hour/networking event. The event was hosted on the patio. My preference would have been indoor seating as the day was quite sweltering. I will note that the servers did their best to accommodate the group, keeping us well fortified with appetizers and taking drink orders. It was a cash bar although the appetizers were free, which was a great deal. I should have remembered the drink advice from my other Yelpers, as I&#39;d made the (miskate?) of ordering a vodka tonic. This was essentially absolut in a glass, on the rocks, topped off with a literal splash of soda water. Oh, well, at least it was a short glass and the one drink ended up being plenty, so I didn&#39;t  have to burn through cash. My favorite appetizers were the quesadilla, chips and guac, and chicken skewer. Calamari were not warm (by temperature) and the sliders looked good, although I didn&#39;t sample any. The atmosphere was convivial and a great option for this type of gathering."

We came in a little after 1pm on a weekday and after being seated, we waited 20 minutes for our waitress Maria. The table next to us was served right away. They were given menus and their food even before we got to see a menu. We did not even get complimentary bread while we were waiting. Our waitress was also very short when we asked for napkins and to explain what kind of vegetables their lunch special came with.The food was also not that impressive. We ordered the special of the day which was a fried filet fish with tortilla soup. It was $9.95. A cup of soda was $2.25. The soup was salty and the fish was sour, probably too much lemon. The fish was also not very fresh.I would not go back based on the poor service and mediocre food. Not sure if it was because we were dressed casually or it was because I have a disability. It might have also been because it was at an off hour but other people who were dressed casually seemed to have gotten better service. Whatever it is, Maria was not a great waitress and made our experience less than memorable."

I spent a few days in Chicago and caught up with an old friend here. Shout out to her for taking me to the place to be!It was a warm summer evening and the patio was calling our names. Friendly staff, great menu, strong drinks, a diverse crowd, fun all around... I was impressed with everything.The menu seems to really embrace the &#34;farm to table&#34; experience. Everything sounded fresh, healthy and delicious. It&#39;s been a few days and I&#39;m still thinking about the lemon butter tilapia. The combination of the freshness of the fish and the silky smooth sauce from the butter was absolutely delicious! The tilapia was cooked so well and will literally melt in your mouth.The patio gets packed especially during happy hour but service was outstanding and my waitress was very attentive taking the time to answer all of my questions.Now shamefully, I must admit that I didn&#39;t even step foot inside. I stayed out on the patio totally absorbed by the outdoor vibe and completely oblivious to that fact an &#34;inside&#34; even exists. That seems to be OK though because from past reviews, it sounds like this isn&#39;t really a dining destination but a happy hour favorite, ideal in the summer.

The weather was enjoyable and the tall buildings help to block the late-afternoon sun very well. The tables are just wrought iron but they get the job done; there are plenty of them available as well so feel free to bring a large group. Unfortunately the weather turned and we quickly moved inside. While I did not get a good chance to look around it seems like a nice spot - a good pub feel (with a decent-sized wood bar, etc.). There are also plenty of tables inside as well.Bathroom: It is clean, does not smell, and is well lit.Staff: Our waitress was just fine. She didn&#39;t go above and beyond (not that there was even an opportunity to do so) but she also was there when we needed her.Drinks/Food: We started with drinks, a wide assortment, and everything was great. The beer was cold and the whiskey/bourbon pours are INSANE. Seriously, you get an entire rocks glass FULL of liquor. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen anything like it! As for food, when we moved inside we contemplated eating but the menu is pretty sparse...Value: The drink prices are right where you&#39;d expect for a nicer place such as this and the liquor pours are ridiculous.

If you take a look at the glass next to the cranberry juice, that is all alcohol. The way they do drinks here is that for $8, they give you an entire glass of alcohol and then put your mixer on the side. Then of course, there is unlimited popcorn as well as great conversation friends. BUT WHAT? No wonder this place closes at 8PM or people would die here. I looked at the menu for food, and nothing sounds too great, but it is meant to be more of a diner-esque place so if you can ever make it here early enough, I am sure it would taste great!Make sure to get here before 4:30PM or you won&#39;t get a table and would have to wait around.

Cere&#39;s does not joke around when it comes to their pours. If you order a mixed drink, expect a cup of ice topped off full with liquor and a tiny itsy bitsy splash of mixer.You&#39;re good to go after one drink. The only complaint that I have is that they started charging for a side of your mixer and they used to just give you the can on the side. Like, I appreciate a stiff drink but sometimes you just need a side car to go with it.This is definitely the place to go for cheap, strong drinks. At $7 a pop I can walk out feeling pretty good at a decent price."

First of all, before I even talk about the ridiculousness that is their cocktail menu, I gotta give them major praise for offering FREE POPCORN!! A drunk person has to have their salty, crunchy snack &amp; in unlimited amounts no less.Ok, now it seems that everyone knows what this place is all about, which is why it gets so packed after work hours. You order a cocktail, which is basically a small glass filled to to rim with whichever poison you choose &amp; a can of soda on the side. ON THE SIDE. And this glass ain&#39;t no tiny shot glass either, it&#39;s a hefty sized glass filled so full that the only way to fit any soda in it is to basically sip off a shot&#39;s worth of booze. That gets your evening started right there. After two drinks (2 Jameson&#39;s for less than $10 each!) I&#39;m pretty much well on my way to bedtime.Apparently they close pretty early, probably to discourage blacking out on their clean tables &amp; chairs.

Service is brisk, but courteous, and the prices were fair. There&#39;s also a substantial outdoor seating area a good distance removed from the hubbub of Jackson Blvd.I&#39;d say the best dish was fish tacos; they were fresh and tasty, and the tortillas were tender. (As one diner noted, &#34;when you&#39;re not sure what to get, go for Mexican dishes, because that&#39;s who&#39;s in the kitchen&#34;). My jambalaya pasta was flavorful; the only knock I had is that the shrimp were a bit soggy.

The noise level is low so you can easily talk with a group while at lunch. If you are in a hurry go downstairs to their cafeteria/market area, still great food. Try the grilled cheese with tomatoes and bacon on Multigrain. Dont skip out on the fries they are hand cut and so good!!"

This place is always packed on Fridays when I go. Maybe it&#39;s the traders grabbing a drink at the end of the day or just the beginning of happy hour for every other Chicagoan in the area. They only stay open until 8 but with how strong the drinks are, that&#39;s plenty of time. You certainly get more than you pay for.  Usually the same bar staff which is great to get to know them. Good luck finding a waiter if you want to order food. Room full of professionals winding down after a long week and some randoms looking to talk with anyone who will listen. Scene gets a little rowdy at closing time but definitely a spot to check out every now and again."

If people at work find out, actually, they might make me go.However, I DO frequent this place for lunch. There are a couple of great things about it: the servers are really nice, the bread basket is weirdly good, you always get seated quickly--even in the middle of the lunch rush, and the price is right.The food here is pretty straight forward American. I love the french fries, which come with all of the sandwiches, and where else can you get a good tuna melt for lunch in the Loop? Nowhere that I know of. My coworker and I love to go here when we want some no nonsense comfort food at a good price. My favorites are the tuna melt, bot club, and chicken pot pie. It&#39;s the type of place that serves out the food that you imagine it would look like when you hear about it (that makes no sense--roll with it!).This is one of my favorite lunch spots--it&#39;s not the healthiest and doesn&#39;t have the most creative food (I certainly wouldn&#39;t come here on a day when I wasn&#39;t at work), but when I crave some diner food, nothing else fits the bill quite like Ceres."

I had never been but my friends strongly recommended it as their drinks were &#34;good and strong&#34;. We made it at about 345 and were seated quickly. The restaurant was PACKED and pretty busy so we weren&#39;t taken back that the waitress hadnt approached us immediately. In fact a nice waitress from a nearby section came to our table (about ten to fifteen mins in) and apologized for the high wait time then told us our waitress would be with us in two minutes. Fast forward another 15 minutes (no lie its 415/420 by now) and still no one has been to our table. We watch as our waitress (Helena) serves the tables surrounding us. We wait a few minutes more and then my friend stops her and asks if we can be served because &#34;we&#39;ve been waiting thirty minutes now just to order&#34;. Helena debates her and tells her &#34;you haven&#39;t waited thirty minutes AND it&#39;s busy&#34;. We watch her try to walk away and my friend begins to stop her and tell her the orders for the table. Helena was annoyed at this point but takes the order down anyway. About five minutes later we have our drinks (Traders Punch) , which btw were delicious! Then a few minutes later we have our appetizers. Cool? Hmm nah! Helena puts a large plate of cheese fries on the table. We all look confused and seeing as to how terrible our first interaction was, we reluctantly tell her that we didn&#39;t ask for cheese fries but for a large plate of regular fries. Strike two! Helena proceeds to tell us that that&#39;s what we ordered lol... I suggest just eating the fries because I wanted her to go away... But Helena insists she get the other ones and so she does.. Cool? Hmmmm nope! Helena comes back with a SMALL plate of regular fries... I&#39;m being punked right? Then we explain again what we asked for... We stop and say, &#34;can you just bring one more order of small REGULAR fries?&#34;.... She obliges and walks away. Ten minutes pass and we realize she&#39;s never coming back to our table. We flag down the other waitress in the section next to us and she grabs the manager/owner. He clearly flustered AND busy apologizes and comps us a plate of chips w/ salsa and guac. While we appreciated it, it didn&#39;t help any further that night. Helena came back to rush us out (we were still drinking and by this time there were open tables near us). She wanted us to close out the tab (still intended to spend more money) and then came back every few minutes to ensure we didn&#39;t walk out on the bill. We paid the bill and my friend was pissed. So pissed that she wrote on the bill, &#34; no tip, get some manners&#34; lol. Before I move on, I understand how petty this is but at the time of the incident... Helena got what she deserved.. I&#39;ve never seen such blatant disrespect from a server in my life.  Five minutes later Helena kneels down next to my friend and I and says &#34;YOU PEOPLE are the ones who need some manners, get!&#34; Things got foggy after that because everyone including myself began arguing with her. The manager was again apologetic but insincere and eventually stopped listening to the story... Helena came over and acted as if she had done nothing wrong and we left feeling sad. Sad because it&#39;s a great happy hour spot and now it&#39;s added to a list of establishments that I will never again support. Here&#39;s my tip, the customer is ALWAYS right... Even the black girls that you don&#39;t think deserve good service smh."

That last part is especially important in the dead of winter, when it&#39;s dark, windy, and cold out and coworkers are looking for somewhere to unwind near the office.Even though it&#39;s a big place, the dining room gets crowded by around 5:00, so you may want to send out a couple scouts to save a table early. The setup is very casual, similar to a college union. The steadily rising noise levels may be a side effect of the tall mix drinks. Order a [pick your designated spirit] and soda, and you&#39;ll get a very full tumbler glass of said spirit, and a can of the soda on the side. With those generous portions, you get to choose just how strong you want it. The free popcorn helps too."

But I&#39;m reviewing my experience (and mine only), and it was highly negative.Keep in mind that the restaurant markets itself as a cafe and not a steakhouse. Cafes generally appeal to all audiences and diets, and this is where the place disappointed. As a vegetarian, there were zero main courses on the menu that I could eat. I can accept that if restaurants can work around that (for instance, provide a veggie patty in lieu of meat), but they had no such options. As such, I ended up leaving simply because I wasn&#39;t able to order anything - in a cafe in Chicago, a city whose restaurants normally appeal to an extremely diverse community. Even a basic, rudimentary veggie burger would have sufficed, as I&#39;m not at all a picky eater outside of my single ethical restriction.Essentially, I had an easier time eating at Buffalo Wild Wings than I did here. That&#39;s disappointing. However, the restaurant does offer drinks, as well as items that appeal to non-vegetarians, so I can&#39;t say it&#39;s a universally poor experience."

We ordered take-out and it was quick &amp; affordable. Ordering it for the first time as take-out was probably a bit more confusing than dining in, since everything had to be sealed deconstructed and it took some research and imagination to try to correctly combine all the dishes together. The restaurant is really cute inside and it is BYOB, so we may be back to enjoy everything in-house sometime!E4 J.J. Tiger Cry - Slices of beef that you dip in this delicious spicy sauce. The beef was not that tender, but the sticky rice &amp; spicy sauce made up for this!N2 Guay Tiew Moo Thoon - Excellent noodle soup served with fall-apart delicious pork and flavorful broth. It could have done without the homemade pork ball though..R3 Khao Mun Gai Tod - Splendid fried chicken dish which is sweet and filling. It seemed somewhat similar to an orange chicken type chinese dish, but so much better and with the sweet Thai flavors instead. Probably my favorite dish!I definitely want to come back to dine in, order R3 again and then branch out and try some other dishes!"

Got a seafood rice dish (I think it was R1) and the squid was somewhat rubbery although the rest of the dish was good. I don&#39;t think I would go there again but maybe we just had bad luck.

I chose it for my birthday dinner because I&#39;d been fantasizing about their fried chicken for far too long now.Fried chicken fantasies. Yep. Not even kidding.We were warmly greeted and started perusing the menu. We weren&#39;t sure which amazing chicken we had gotten last time so started asking some general questions about the chicken and menu.The owner? She REMEMBERED US: and not as in, &#34;Oh, hey, you look familiar.&#34; She recalled where we SAT and what we ATE..from ONE visit 6 months ago! Amazing!  (I hope we were memorable in a GOOD way :)We ordered:_________________________________________________A2: Chicken WingsGet them! They&#39;re large, juicy, crispy, and just delicious! I like the sauce they come with, but it&#39;s honestly not necessary: they&#39;re great on their own!_________________________________________________A4: Pork MeatballDefinitely a favorite! I&#39;m not a huge pork eater, but these were delicious! I couldn&#39;t get enough! They&#39;ve got that snappy skin and are meaty, toasty warm goodness on the inside. They&#39;re garnished with ginger slices, chilies, and toasted peanuts._________________________________________________A5: Chicken MeatballGood, but probably my least favorite, though my guy was a fan. They come on skewers with a delicious sweet/sour sauce._________________________________________________N1: Curry Noodle with BeefGreat depth of curry flavor with slight heat. It has great texture with the noodles, sprouts, and beef. I really enjoyed this one!_________________________________________________R3: Fried Chicken over Ginger RiceAMAZINGLY crispy, flavorful, steamy chicken. The rice is spot-on with a great ginger flavor. The sweet/sour sauce that comes with it is so good. This was both of our favorite dish!_________________________________________________All of the dishes had fresh flavors and were plated so nicely: casual to go with the &#34;street fare&#34; theme, but with forethought.

We started off with the chicken fried wontons, which were a greasy piece of heaven. The chicken satay was very well prepared but there wasn&#39;t anything particularly special about it?Several friends got the fried chicken over rice, which was very good but not that special? Like, the chicken was very well fried but at its core, it is still fried chicken and rice. The basil chicken, on the other hand, was super awesome and delicious. I went for the beef curry and rice noodles, which had a great peanut buttery sauce but the meat was too fatty for me. (This is a frequent problem I have.)I would definitely go rice dish over noodle dish next time I&#39;m here.

It is a noodle dish with a spicy sour broth with chicken balls, ground chicken, peanuts and fried wontons. Delicious! All the flavors were perfect and the meat was perfectly cooked. You also get a tray of sauces to personalize your dish. I added just a little red chili pepper because the dish already has a kick to it. It was perfect and I cannot wait to go back."

My one (very slight) complaint would be that some of the beef pieces were chewy and tough.Guay Tiew Moo Thoon (braised pork noodle): delicious, hearty broth with tender pork and meatballs.

I think rice dishes are their strongest dishes.Tom Yum soup was super watered down and barely contained any actual food. But the Tom Yum Noodle Soup came with a ton of food, so if you&#39;re craving Tom Yum flavor get the noodle soup.Grilled Squid was bland and chewy. The only flavor was the dipping sauce, which was a generic sweet and spicy tasting sauce. Pass.Basil Tofu is solid and super tasty. I just wish it came with some vegetables or something else for a bit more variety in flavor verses eating heaps of tofu and rice.And according to my friends, things like Fried Chicken Ginger Rice, Basil Chicken with Rice, etc are always good.The desserts are small and underwhelming. I think their Thai iced tea makes a better dessert than anything on their menu."

I ordered the cornish hen dish and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked and the sauce was spicy, but delicious. Love the sticky rice. It&#39;s BYOB too (with no corkage fee). Husband ordered a dish he normally gets here, but they brought him something different...he asked them why the dish looked totally different and they weren&#39;t sure what he was talking about. He said it was good, but not what he wanted. Maybe they ran out or something...who knows. Very cool place - and I don&#39;t generally consider myself someone who likes Thai food but I would eat here again for sure! Cute little atmosphere, small tables, cold water, very hip but also very good and a good value for the amount of food you get."

Came here on a cold January Saturday afternoon with two girlfriends. One of my friends is a vegan, another is a huge foodie who enjoys making food with meat ingredients. All three of us walked out happy.Their ice teas are so amazing, when I was done, I wanted more!  They are darker than most so it&#39;s not overly sweet and diluted with milk. Plus the fact that it came in a mug!My order of noodle with bbq pork came with a broth on the side. Lord that broth was good! You are supposed to pour the broth into the noodle but i couldnt resist and went ahead and drank it.The noodle was pretty nice, but I amNot a huge meat eater so after a while, I got tired of my generous portion of bbq pork.Didn&#39;t have to wait for a seat when we thought seating may be an issue. Lots of foodie and people who knew what they were ordering at this restaurant so you know you&#39;re getting the real deal. Service was spectacular, for asian restaurants standards, seriously!! Very knowledgeable, kind, gracious and prompt. Presentation was great. Only thing is the price is not street food price so that goes against the experience."

I am excited to go back when they are offering their full menu. As of 10/15/2015, they are only offering 2 entrees and some apps.We had #23, Rice noodle with stewed pork soup and meat ball and #18, Chicken over ginger garlic rice. I liked the pork soup better than the chicken rice. HOWEVER, I will have to state that we did order this to go and when we got home were kind of confused on how to put together our foods. I think we messed up but hey.We also had the fried rangoons which were really great. WE also had the chicken wings which were ok. We really want to get back but are kind of disappointed that they are not offering pad thai,Is that insulting to think that all Thai food should include pad thai?"

Understandable since there was only one girl working the floor.What we ordered:Papaya salad: Highly recommended by the waitress. We watched them make it fresh with the mortar and pestle!!! It was sweet and spicy. I would like it slightly less sweet, but that&#39;s just personal taste. Still is a must try. Loved the little pieces of dried shrimp in there.Khao Mun Gai Tod (Fried chicken over ginger rice): Really good. Fried chicken had great flavor without being dry. Skin was nice and crispy. The rice is amazing. Had awesome chewy texture and ginger aroma. Came with a side of sweet dipping sauce.Guay Tiew Moo Thoon (braised pork noodles): My fav of the night! So complex and good portion. Came with probably 5 homemade pork meatballs and many chunks of delicious braised pork. Soup broth was sweet and savory. I added the vinegars they provided and a few splashes of fish sauce. Took it to another level. I love my food piping hot and all of the dishes came out piping hot and fresh. Noodle texture was on point.Thai Iced Tea: Bomb. Loved it. Legit.Overall, the service was great. Smiling waitress that was willing to give recommendations. My favorite thing about JJ is that it doesn&#39;t offer Pad Thai and crab rangoon. Loved the atmosphere, too. The cups and dinnerware are street food kinda style.Can not wait to come back and try the other dishes!"

I dunked every bite in the sweet chili sauce that came with it. At one point, I was not sure if we even ordered these wontons or not? They were gone really quick. I mean, who doesn&#39;t love fried things. *wink* Stop judging me.So, back to it. The menu is extensive and I opted for the Khao Lard Kra Praw - stir fried ground chicken with basil and thai chili served over rice. I was not disappointed by any means. It was a large portion and I anticipated getting a to-go box however, I could not stop myself from eating it all. The snow falling outside made me do it.This dish had the perfect amount of flavor and spice and was not greasy. You could also get it with a sunny side egg however, I politely declined since I am an egg whites kind of girl. Still, don&#39;t think it could have been any better.My boyfriend ordered a broth filled with wonders. He devoured it. There is evidence of the deliciousness in my photo.A huge bonus is that this place is BYOB and is great for date night or even a casual night out with friends. Definitely give it a try if you love Thai food, want to start loving Thai food and if you just want to be around good, happy people.A little gem as they say."

So, we called them and asked if we could get in early.This place sells real Thai that you can get real taste. Everything that we ordered was good so far. We got Chicken meatball and Tiger cry for appetizers. Our main dishes were Hoi Tod (mussel pancake), Kao-ka-moo (pork leg with rice), and Bah-mee with BBQ pork (egg noodle). Delicious!!! Five stars for everything. I asked the staff for a special dish, she offered me Hoi-tod which was not on the menu, and it was so AMAZING. We ordered Taro in coconut milk and Kanom-tuay (something coconut on top of thai style jello) for desserts.The staffs were so kind. Totally, feel like home. The cooker said she has gained her energy when customers give her compliments.This is my Thai restaurant in Chicago for sure."

This place is not your typical Thai restaurant. It&#39;s way more awesome.The food tastes so light and fresh. #8 sliced beef tastes like it was marinated in happiness and was cooked perfectly. I also had fun eating lots of E-Saan rice, which is just stick rice for your hands. The Miang Kham was really nice starter. The Tom Yum soup is packed with lemongrass and ginger. My main course was the Lard Gai chicken, which I asked them to make spicy. They knew just the type of ballsy spice I wanted while still being conscientious of my whiteness so it was just on the delicious threshold of my spice limit. So tasty, all of it.On top of that the service is fantastic and the place is really clean and gets a lot of light. There&#39;s a bunch of folks from Thailand working here and they&#39;re all super smily and nice. The waitress and cooking staff were friendly and attentive but not overbearing.

Here&#39;s a run-down: the fried chicken wings, homemade Thai sausage, bbq pork and egg noodles, minced chicken and rice, and then a beef dish and another sliced chicken/rice dish (can&#39;t remember the names on the latter two).You know how when you find a new restaurant and you&#39;re elated at the discovery?

I fell in love with everything Thailand and vowed I will live there one day. There are hundreds of Thai restaurants in Chicago, but JJ Thai is the first I&#39;ve found that pretty much transported me right back to Thailand! The food is amazing and is closer to what you&#39;ll find in the far-flung areas of Thailand than most other Thai places in Chicago. If you&#39;ve decided that you&#39;re not a fan of Thai food, you should seriously consider giving JJ Thai a shot. If you love Thai food, you should give JJ Thai a shot.

Limited menu tonight, totally understandable. Huge addition to the neighborhood. We had the chicken meatball appetizer to start. Very tasty, great sweet and sour sauce. Nice and spicy. Then we had the Khao Mun Gai (chicken over rice with spicy sauce).  Awesome ginger sauce. Super spicy with great flavor. Get extra sauce! Also had the Guay Tiew Moo Thoon (rice noodle in pork broth with pork meatball). This reminded me of Vietnamese pho. Pork broth with great cinnamon sort of flavor. Delicious.  Plus all the staff was super nice and very attentive. The bomb Thai iced tea and addictive banana chips sealed the deal. Can&#39;t wait to come back and try the rest of the menu."

This was not entirely accurate. On this cold, snowy day, delivery would have been money, but I guess they have not yet started this service. We finally bit the bullet and went with pick-up.Overall, it was good, but definitely not OMG mind-blowing good. We ordered the fried chicken wing appetizer to start. The wings were slightly dry and the sauce that accompanied the wings was alright. For the entree, we ordered the Khao Lard Ka Praw Gai (ground chicken basil) with fried egg. Now this dish, was pretty darn tasty and I would highly recommend it. The yolk of the egg mixed with the chicken really elevated the flavor. Plus, we asked for it spicy and the heat was spot on. The other entree we ordered was the Guay Tiew Kaeng Neua (rice noodle with beef curry). This dish was also tasty. The curry had a nice balance of spicy and sweet. The only negative is that there was very little beef (4 or 5 pieces) and the quality of the steak was poor. One piece was mostly fat and not really edible. I do also wish the menu was a little more descriptive as I am not the biggest boiled egg fan and the curry came with boiled egg. But that&#39;s just a personal preference thing.I will definitely order from here again, especially when they offer delivery. Even though they don&#39;t have dishes that we typically associate with Thai, this place is definitely worth visiting!"

Tasty, flavorful, fresh tasting, quality ingredients.  I could go on and on...  This is not your typical Thai restaurant, they don&#39;t serve pad Thai, pot stickers, etc., this has more of an authentic feel to it, like eating at someone&#39;s house.  Be sure and experiment with the lazy Susan containers of chili they bring to your table.  I chose the mildest (red) one which surprisingly added an extra kick to my already full-bodied soup.  It was so good I kept adding more, more and more !!Tip: Thai iced coffee was more than generous.... just request easy on the ice.Attentive and caring service. They really, I mean really appreciate your business!Cons:  Seating. One word, uncomfortable.  They have those baby stools you see everywhere now, with no backing.  I was fortunate to grab a (1) table with stiff-backed industrial chairs, still uncomfortable though.  What happened to cushions???Sorry I like my drinks stiff, just NOT my chair!"

We ordered off the menu and then decided to change our minds as we, noncreepily, watched our neighbors receive their bounty, and wanted what they had. I ordered the chicken and ginger rice (great portion, spices were on point, and chicken was tender and moist), grilled squid (just crispy and tender enough without being chewy, larger portion of squid i&#39;ve ever seen), and I forgot the other entree but it was good. Will be going back for sure, I&#39;ve already said that, but I really mean it.I wonder if they will have an outdoor patio for warmer weather?

Beyond that, the flavours and quality are just alright.I&#39;ve ordered carryout from this place twice. The first time, the food was nothing outstanding but not terrible either. The sticky rice was a nice accompaniment to the Khao Lard Ka Praw Gai (basil chicken). There&#39;s just something about the combination of those flavours and textures that made it extra tasty.The second time, I ordered Khao Mun Gai (braised chicken over ginger rice) - it was quite disappointing. As soon as I opened the carryout container, the smell reminded me of day old chicken that was reheated in a microwave. The chicken was a little tough and dry for being braised. It really made me wonder if the chicken was indeed reheated in a microwave. Also, I understand that the bulk of the flavour of the chicken should come from the side of sauce; despite that, the chicken itself was pretty tasteless.The distinctive menu selection doesn&#39;t compensate for the so-so flavours. Two tries is enough to give it a fair chance; I won&#39;t be back."

The only downside is that you&#39;re basically in the middle of the lobby of Soho House, which to me isn&#39;t quite the ideal location for tea given all the activity.The food was on point as well. A classic tea includes finger sandwiches, desserts, and scones, and the Allis delivered on all fronts. I&#39;m kind of a scone snob (biscuits are not scones!!), but the Allis nailed them and had real clotted cream, which is a major win in my book (unsweetened whipped cream isn&#39;t clotted cream!).The service was also good. Our server checked in a regularly and gave us tea refills when we were ready.I&#39;ll definitely be back for tea!"

I just love the deco and it&#39;s such a comfy spot. I am new in Chicago and I enjoy the Westloop.Now let&#39;s get to why I am giving this spot 3 stars. Well the waitresses were so careless and they really didn&#39;t  seem to care about the patrons. The were just chatting and never really came to refill our teapots, never really checked on us, they were catching up on their on things.The food itself was tasty but the service just put a damper on the whole experience. THE ONE THING THAT TURNED ME OFF ABOUT THE AFTERNOON TEA IS THE FACT THAT U HAVE TO PAY EXTRA MONEY TO GET MORE FOOD, AFTERNOON TEA IS SUPPOSE TO BE ENDLESS BISCUITS, SCONES, MACAROONS, SWEETS OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT THE PLACE IS OFFERING, I SHOULDN&#39;T BE PAYING EXTRA WHEN I AM ALREADY PAYING A FIXED PRICE FOR HIGH TEA. THEY NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD ON THIS ONE. I have been to a lot of high tea spots London, Europe, Africa and this was the 1st for me. So as a result I would rather go to the Drake and other places that offer afternoon tea in Chicago."

I had the chopped salad and it was good- I&#39;ve had better dressing but nevertheless still a very good salad.  If your looking for a light, not too heavy breakfast, this is a great spot."

And what a better way to enjoy this place by having tea time. Or so I thought....My friend and I came to The Allis on a Sunday afternoon for a girl&#39;s day with afternoon tea. Upon first impression, I was stunned by the interior design. The abundance of light and vintage furniture won me over. Unfortunately, I ended up spending ~5-10 minutes trying to figure out where in the world the host stand was. Even though I enjoyed wandering around the Allis, which I soon learned was basically the lobby of the SoHo House. I checked in with the hotel receptionist - whom I thought was the host - only to find out that the host was just a regular server. How are we supposed to know who the host was?Once my friend and I were both seated, it probably took ~15 minutes a waiter to actually acknowledge us and take our order. Once we were served our tea, the only time our waiter came by was to take our empty plates away. We actually had to wave them down every time we needed them. My friend actually asked to have more water for her tea, and they took the tea pot without coming back. By the time, I was done drinking my tea, she didn&#39;t even want any more tea.When I first made the reservation, I was informed that we would only be allowed 1.5 hours for tea time. We probably spent ~45 minutes enjoying our afternoon tea and over 1 hour waiting around for our servers. I&#39;m glad that they didn&#39;t ask us to leave because I would&#39;ve been furious. It&#39;s unbelievable how it seemed like there were a good amount of servers, yet none of them providing good service.If you can tolerate poor service and want to enjoy afternoon tea, this is actually a  great place to go. You can loiter around with your girlfriends as much as possible and enjoy the scenery. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever be coming back.P.S. You MUST get the almond tea! It&#39;s probably the best tea I&#39;ve ever had in my life!"

All the wait staff seemed to be men though, with one woman.You place your order and your three tiers come out- chocolate cake, passionfruit macaroons, scones with jam and butter, red velvet cupcakes were a few of the contenders. to me, it was relatively inexpensive with 25$ without prosecco and $30 with.Come for the ambience, fill up on sugar."

The dark wooden cabinetry, Violet velvet chairs, blue floral porcelain chinaware and chandelier light fixtures are my definition of class.

The basic afternoon tea consists of three trays of bit sized egg salad, cucumber+cream cheese, salmon sandwiches, banana cake, macaron, lemon tart, scone, chocolate layered cake and more!You can&#39;t go wrong with their loose leaf tea selection.

Lots of strong, creative drinks can be found here.The environment is dark and rather quiet and drinks were fantastic. Would be perfect for an intimate drink after dinner. Be sure and swing by the bathroom. You have to walk through the restaurant upstairs and it looks so fantastic.

With that he came back 3 more times (I&#39;m not kidding) to ask what tea I wanted.

First of all, we arrived at 11am and we were informed that last call for breakfast was already had. But without us even asking, the waiter said he would ask if we could order breakfast if we wanted, and thus, we were able to order off the breakfast menu! How kind :)I ordered the croissant sandwich, which was nice and flaky and delish! The bacon was particularly perfect. I also got the jasmine green tea, which was so goooood. And they give you a LOT. I couldn&#39;t even finish the whole pot.The atmosphere of the place makes you feel cozy and important. Is that weird to say? But it just does. There is tons of open lighting, which I am a sucker for. I loved dining here for breakfast.And lastly, the staff was so wonderful. Well, I kind of already mentioned this. But towards the end of our meal, the waiters gave us ideas on what to do and where to go during our visit in chitown. They gave great and genuine suggestions.

I went here with my team. We ordered a chopped salad with a poached egg, devilled eggs (never came), tomato-mozz sandwich, steak sandwich and pulledpork samdwich. The food was pretty tasty - my poached egg was a bit over cooked but thats okay.

Not super aromatic, but decent.The ambiance of this place, though, is beautiful. The chandeliers, couches, tables, and decor are all spot on. I love how the colors of the furniture complemented the decor and the walls of this place. The plates are also gorgeous.

During the day you can enjoy brunch and tea, while the evening brings the bar scene.Their cocktails are really nice. My favorite by far is the Soho Mule. If you like ginger, you will love this. Till 6:30 they sometimes have $1.50 happy hour oyster specials. The soft pretzel bites with honey mustard and warm beer cheese will make you very happy.Bonus, heads upstairs to Chicken &amp; Farm Shop for dinner."

The presentation was cute and the food was light but filling.They have a fancy afternoon tea that they suggest making a reservation for that I would love to go back and try.The reason I gave the Allis 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. The waiter took forever to come back and take the order after giving us the menus, never came to check how the food was and took an unnecessary amount of time to get us the check.

We shared African amber, Jade green and Verbena mint. I loved the African Amber with notes of mango, hibiscus and vanilla. Jade green needed more steeping time for full flavor and verbena mint was pretty good as well.The food: We had the 29$ package that came with cream puffs, chocolate cake, fruit tart, macaroons red velvet cupcakes, salmon and ham finger sandwiches, and my favorite = scone with clotted cream. I was introduced to the goodness of clotted cream at this place and it seems like I can eat a tub-full of it by itself! It was this rich, delicious cream that went perfectly with the scone.The service was good. The food was a bit overpriced, and quite forgettable (besides the clotted cream and scone!). I would go for another tea with my girls, but not sure if I&#39;ll get the package again.The ambiance is very laid back. On a side note, I was introduced to the Pizza East and Chicken Shop right upstairs.

I would recommend making a reservation. They weren&#39;t booked, but I&#39;m pretty sure the weather played a role, plus it was a Monday. For $24 each, we got a selection of tea, finger sandwiches, and sweet and savory pastries.My favorite treat on the tower was chocolate cake, which I usually think is just meh. The biscuit and jam/cream were also PHENOMENAL. Like literally an explosion of flavor in your mouth. My only complaint about the tower is that there were a few too many sweet offerings. I wish there had been more savory offerings.Service was great from everyone, and I highly recommend. Can&#39;t go wrong with SoHo House!"

I was looking for a place to study in west loop and decided to drop by. When you first walk in, you notice almost immediately that it&#39;s not your run of the mill study space (and to be quite honest, I don&#39;t think the Allis is REALLY meant to be a study area, definitely more like a bar/ restaurant/ place to catch up with friends and family). There are beautiful chandeliers hanging from the high ceilings, comfy sofas and chairs everywhere, and lots of tables to sit and read the newspaper. Being a hotel lobby (Soho house), there are people coming and going, which means good people watching! If anything, just come by to enjoy the beautiful space.Upon sitting down at a long wooden table, a waiter came up and took my friend and my coffee orders (I got the mocha and my friend, an americano). We waited about 10 minutes before being brought our drinks. The mocha was really good- I&#39;ve never had blue bottle coffee before and thought it was delicious.I came here at around 11 am and there was plenty of seating. Once it hit around 1 pm, the place definitely filled up and larger groups started coming in. I&#39;d say, come here early and enjoy the nice ambiance and great decor and leave before the afternoon rush. The servers were exceptionally nice and patient. Overall, a great experience.

I like how the lobby transforms from a cozy lounge during the day to a bar at night. I don&#39;t know if it was the rainstorm, but the lobby was kind of empty. My group snagged one of the long tables. I wanted to order food, but it was too late and the kitchen was closed. I ordered a  Soho Mule - 42 Below Vodka, Ginger, Lime, Soda served with candied ginger. It was really good, probably one of the best mules I&#39;ve had. You could really taste the quality ingredients. The ginger flavor was very strong, but I liked it. I also loved the decor - especially the chandeliers, furniture and artwork. I definitely want to go back and try their tea service."

There is no place like this in Chicago...it&#39;s beautiful with a line of gorgeous chandeliers across the whole restaurant! There&#39;s an open bar to the right when you enter and to your left are the couches/tables that you sit onOn the right and left side of The Allis are two other restaurants, one&#39;s a chicken shop place and the other is a pizza place!Anyways, this place is beautiful and so well put together and elegant and just plain cute! My cousin, two sisters, a friend, and I went on Valentine&#39;s Day, and reserved for the Afternoon tea which was great with savory and sweet finger foods!So the tea platter special was so cute and actually kept me full without giving me that bloaty feeling!There were three finger sandwiches - egg/cucumber/salmon, there were also a bunch of two-bite desserts that were all fantastic and scrumptious!I swear this place makes you feel like your British and that you are a part of the royal family just having a casual lunchThe service was great and was very glad to share more information about our platter and explain anything we needed to know! Everything came out in timely fashion. It was a bit pricey, for all of us, we paid $230 in total. With 5 tea platters and a couple more items! Hope you try it...God Bless :)"

Food is great! We really like everything we&#39;ve ordered from them but oh man they are SLOW! And confused. You have to be very patient and have no immediate plans if you go there cause it takes them about 20 mins before they even bring you coffee! And forget to bring you what you ask for...but they are very nice and polite.The egg white sandwich is good, light, and delicious. Their On Toast is pretty good! We have also tried The Allice and Bagel or Bialy (we got bagel). All are very good and fresh. We haven&#39;t tried any of their drinks but they look tasty and refreshing! The orange juice is freshly squeezed. We love their outdoor seating area and they get a whole star for letting you bring your dog!"

While I try to find any excuse to inject caffeine into my body, I think I may like the actual sandwiches and sweets at tea better than  tea itself. The Peninsula is usually my go to for afternoon tea, but I recently decided to switch it up for tea at The Allis.The Allis is located within the Soho House and the only dining area that non members can enjoy. Their Afternoon Tea may be the best deal in town at $24/person ($32 if you include a glass of prosecco). In comparison High Tea at the Peninsula is $55/person ($68 with prosecco).The sandwiches, sweets, tea and prosecco were all very tasty. My only complaint was the stomach ache I had later that evening for eating way too much. The atmosphere is a bit more casual than some other High Tea hotel experiences, but still great.Unfortunately, they aren&#39;t able to do a table for more than 15 people with the way they were set up, but did their best to accommodate my party of 18.Looking forward to trying other meals (and of course more tea time) at The Allis. Based on tea here and food in the members only restaurant at the Soho House I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t disappoint."

Definitely a nice change from the $15-$20 cocktails in LA.I highly recommend the allis soho mule. It&#39;s a very spicy (in a ginger spicy way) drink. It wasn&#39;t syrupy ginger at all.I also recommend the eastern standard. For those that have been to Spago in Beverly Hills, there&#39;s this $30 drink called peppino&#39;s revenge that I absolutely loved but couldn&#39;t afford to drink again.

It has a very old world feel that is like an immediate hug when you enter. You feel like you&#39;ve gone back in time to when men were gentlemen and women were ladies.And then my friend and I sat at the bar and were promptly ignored for 20 minutes. At the bar. Where there were like six people working behind the bar. Almost intentionally avoiding all eye contact with us.Eventually one of them accidentally looked over and we were able to order a drink. We each got a glass of champagne. The glassware was beautiful and once again gave me that happy going-back-in-time feeling.After drinking our drinks, we decided not to stay. It felt very pretentious and the wait staff couldn&#39;t have made us feel any less welcome. Unfortunately, we once again couldn&#39;t get anyone to even acknowledge our presence at the bar. All we wanted to do was pay and leave. It took us another solid 20 or more minutes of actively trying to get a bill before someone finally paid us any attention.It&#39;s definitely a unique spot. But, make a reservation and sit at a table. The bar is a wasteland of rude waitstaff."

I felt super fancy drinking tea and eating small snacks with my friends on couches and with chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. Although the experience was great, I thought their teas were not very strong. It was difficult to tell the difference between the two different teas we ordered.

A holiday pop-up market was just finishing up when we arrived, so the first half hour of our gathering was accompanied by blaring music from a DJ, followed by an hour of constant door opening right by our table as workers broke down the setup, making several of us wear jackets during the tea.The tea sets were cute, but several ladies had various cracked/chipped cups and pots. At least four of us had lukewarm tea arrive, and it was a good 45 minutes before anyone who ordered a glass of champagne got any. The desserts were ok - the chocolate cake was too sugary and rich for my taste; the cream puff was bland and soggy, and the macarons kind of stale. The lemon tart wasn&#39;t bad, or the thumb-sized slice of ham and cheese finger sandwich I had.One member of our group informed our server she had a nut allergy; our server in return asked how much of a concern cross-contamination was. Seriously? &#34;I have an epi-pen but I&#39;d rather not use it,&#34; my colleague replied. Apparently they&#39;ve never had to accommodate anyone with a nut allergy, as this then required sending staff down the street to Whole Foods, causing a longer wait for the tea snacks, only to have what arrived be several chocolate chip cookies, several frosted sugar cookies, and some sliced pineapple with raspberries. Don&#39;t trouble yourselves, really. For a fancy-schmancy place, I am not impressed with the quality, creativity, or service we had. For having paid about $30 per person, I&#39;d be happy to pay an extra 10 bucks for a better experience elsewhere next time."

I ordered the Lean Sandwich and my friend ordered the Mean Sandwich (both ten dollars). Honestly, I felt like it&#39;s just what I make for myself before I leave my apartment in the morning.

Everything is so classy, from the giant chandeliers to the tea sets made in England (yes I actually checked out the bottom of my cup haha) to the nice plush armchairs we sit in.The best part? Afternoon tea with a whole tower of goodies is only $24, which was easily $40+ at a fancy hotel like the Drake. And you essentially get the exact same thing (probably a little more actually, I was so full afterwards!).In this giant three tier tower of goodies we got a total of 7 pastries and 3 finger sandwiches, and they are all decently sized. My favorites were the cream puffs, which were incredibly soft with very aromatic but not overly sweet filling. My least favorites were the macarons which were a little too sweet and a little too sticky... and I&#39;m also just spoiled from having lived in Paris.... Then the chocolate cake was just nothing too special and wayyyy too much sugar. Of course, I&#39;m just nitpicking at this point, overall everything was awesome!"

I even heard they hold tea time, which anyone can reserve to partake in, and that includes an elaborate spread.The Allis was a great stop for day drinks. I had A Man About Town rye cocktail, and that was a smooth drink down to the last sip. My girlfriend had a regular Old Fashioned and that was just as perfectly crafted. We also shared an avocado toast, which was two slices of toast piled with chunky seasoned avocado and topped with a half boiled egg.

However, I will highly recommend that people try out the Afternoon Tea at the Soho house café - The Allis. It is truly unbeatable in terms of the food and service you get and the price you pay for it. Some other famous hotels and restaurants also do the afternoon tea services in Chicago but no one delivers this well at a price point lower than most.For just $29, you get a great selection of finger sandwiches, scone, fancy cakes, and tea of your choice. I had the chamomile citron and it was divine!The food was perfectly sized to go with tea and there is enough of it that once done, you feel satisfied. The interior is quite lovely and there was an eclectic group of people. The light chatter in the background along with the soft music went quite well with the tea service.I definitely would recommend Chicagoans to try their tea service and bring all their visiting friends and family here for the same."

The Missus and I aren&#39;t exactly what I thought this place would love to see walking in. We&#39;re in our 40s, not exactly style hounds, and aren&#39;t sceney types. But we like a nice drink now and then, and this place was welcoming, sans attitudes, and had extremely tasty libations. I had a hot toddy, and The Missus had a soho mule. Both were killer-particularly her mule, which had a very strong housemade ginger syrup. I imagine that on a weekend night this place is probably overfilled, but tonight was perfect. Great stuffed chairs and little nooks here and there to chat or just sit and read. Have to come back and grab a bite sometime. But great first experience here."

But my most recent experience was pretty awful. I&#39;d made a reservation for afternoon tea with my girlfriends. When we tried to order, our server said we need to order one full tea service for every person because &#34;that&#39;s the requirement for making reservations&#34;. I double-checked their website, as of 2/15/16, there was no information about this. Nor was there any mention of this &#34;requirement&#34; when I made the reservation or called to confirm the reservation the day before our visit. Eventually he relented after checking with the manager, but cautioned we should &#34;remember this requirement for our next visit&#34;. I find it insulting that we, the consumers, are being told off when they obviously have a lapse in their staff training. To make it worse, the dry scones we were served came without the usual array of butter/jams, and sadly it would have benefited from both. I visited the Allis when the afternoon tea service first started. Back then, though the food was nothing special, at least the service made up for it. The ~2.5x price jump is not justified by the quality of food and along the way, they lost their down-to-earth charm &amp; friendliness. Skip the tea service and just get a drink."

Our table was candle lit and the chandeliers glistened. I felt as if I was entering the realm of French Royalty, with an urban industrial twist. Three tiers of high quality pastries from cakes to crumpets to sandwiches and scones along with plentiful re-fills on your individual pot of tea (highly recommend Rooibos) all served on the cutest printed tea cups and dishes. I instantly felt like Marie Antoinette-Queen of Tea Time! By the end of snacking I was stuffed with my belly warm, full, and above all happy! Best $27 I have ever spent along with the best tea time experienced! I can not wait for another act of indulgence!"

It was an amazing experience!The atmosphere is beautiful, from the elegant chandeliers, to the floral tea tableware, and comfortable velvet couches to sit and enjoy with friends. I did some research before choosing this location, and I chose this venue due to affordability, compared to many other tea services in Chicago, but does not compromise quality at all.The tea service itself was one of my favorite experiences. The food was delicious and provided a traditional afternoon tea service experience. There are three tier stands filled with finger sandwiches and a variety of desserts. The portions look deceptively small, but are quite filling. I went with three people, and all of the food items are served on one stand. Each person has one serving of each item. I really enjoyed the small cucumber sandwich, the small salmon sandwich, the scone with the strawberry jam, and the chocolate and peanut butter dessert.There are a good variety of hot tea choices. Each person gets their own teapot serving. I chose the African Amber tea. I prefer more sweet teas, and I was so happy with my choice.It is definitely a more formal environment, wear business casual. And the tea service is only available at certain times, be sure to schedule accordingly."

Great service and plenty of parking, my girlfriend and I were greeted promptly and given a great little seat where we shared a 3 tiered tray of cakes, sandwiches, cookies and other assortments. We chose the one that included a sparkling cocktail which was delightful! Service was very prompt and we loved the tea that was included. This is so great for little get togethers and I plan on taking my Mom here as well. The pricing was not bad at around $30 a person and I was absolutely stuffed!

Seating is mainly on couches, lounges and random tables. It kinda looks like your grandma&#39;s furniture put into a swanky loft. But it works. It was busy but not so crowded you couldn&#39;t get a drink or sit down.The drinks are well made. They offer a small food menu, mainly bar bites. Since we had so many people I ordered one of everything on the menu. Granted we had all been drinking quite a bit but favorites were the guacamole,  truffle grilled cheese and short rib and cheese panini.Service is a little slow. Often drinks were &#34;forgotten&#34; by the waitress. But not a bad lounge option. I will definently be back."

I expected something small with few pieces of avocado but oh my goodness! It looked like two large avocados on my toast. Very delicious and exactly what I wanted. The inside is spectacular.

We were able to call in in the morning and get reservations for 4:30. The Allis is located inside the Soho House, and offered two pretty affordable options for afternoon tea. Afternoon Tea set was $24, while the second option was Afternoon Tea with a glass of rose prosecco at $32.The sandwiches were a bit salty for our taste. The bread was also a bit hard (perhaps stale?).  The sweets were nothing special, and the teas were just okay as well. The best of the set was the scone, lemon pound cake, and red velvet cupcake.This was also the most casual afternoon tea place I&#39;ve been to yet! We sat on sofas with the teas on coffee tables. Others around us were people in their 20s and 30s typing and working away with coffees.The decor was cute, but I&#39;d go elsewhere if looking for afternoon tea!"

The vibe here is very cool, chic, and Chicago-y (yes, I know not a word, but it works).We ordered two old fashioned&#39;s which I thought were delicious. My bf thought they were good but a bit lacking in flavor. They do offer a small plate menu of you were looking to grab a snack while drinking. I believe the total with tip was around $25, which is very much expected when drinking with the chi-town scenesters;)All in the all, the Allis is a perfect spot for a pre dinner drink if you are dining on Randolph street.

The hotel has everything from a spa, to a pizza place, a chicken shop and my absolute new favorite place to afternoon tea, the Allis. I made reservations a few weeks prior since they are starting to get busier and for some reason when I called the day of they didn&#39;t have the reservation. I thought I was going to freak out, but the manager Janel (sp?) totally took care of it and made sure we could be accommodated. Not only that since we asked for 5 girls for our table and two of the husbands tagged along with the babies they were able to get chairs for us last minute, now that is service you can rely on. We would all head over to the pizza place after having fabulous and affordable afternoon tea here. The place really is spectacular and we loved it for being located in the lobby. I must say this is no peninsula or the drake but I kind of like the more casual, boho like environment with super funky chandeliers. I also loved the fact that its kid friendly as I saw quite a few toddlers and babies around with their mommies as they sipped on their afternoon tea.Now onto the tea part, for $24 I truly think it&#39;s an affordable afternoon tea package with your own little tea pot. At first I thought the quality wouldn&#39;t be as great as some of the other high tea places in Chicago but I was gladly mistaken as everything and I mean everything was phenomenal. I kind of want to come back every weekend now. The presentation is beautiful when they bring everything out and all the pastries were delicious. Loved the salmon sandwich, loved their scone, loved the lemon tart with blueberries on top, loved the macaroon (and I normally don&#39;t like macaroons) and I even loved the chocolate cake with the delicious fluffy and whipped like chocolate mousse. I felt like those were the true standouts and I left full which doesn&#39;t always happen with an afternoon tea service. I know that at the peninsula and the drake you can ask for more scones as part of the package but I wasn&#39;t sure if they had that here since they also have an a la carte menu.So after everything, the only negative was that we were too full to join the guys at the Pizza East place besides having one bite just to try it (that place is also on point). I will be back for several reasons, LOVED the atmosphere, the management including Janel was super sweet and accommodating to us and our babies and the tea service itself was very memorable.

The bar is beautiful and you never know who you&#39;ll run into. I equally love the cute little outdoor tables where you can enjoy a light breakfast or lunch.

Classy but casual and unpretentious. We usually come here for drinks and end up getting a few items to share. Can&#39;t help but always end up wanting to munch on something here because of the table spread they have next to the bar. The old fashioned and negroni are fabulous.Not sure what the other reviewer is complaining about in terms of not plating the food well. Soho House is British-inspired and they have very classic British items on the menu like the Scotch egg, pork pie and sausage roll. You eat it just like and it&#39;s not supposed to be garnished like at a fine dining place. Even Jamie Oliver would have served it like it is served at The Allis. The Scotch egg is ahhhhmazing.Breakfast here is wonderful too. They have boiled eggs and soldiers (can&#39;t get these British classics anywhere else in Chicago)."

We were running about 15 minutes late so I called to inform them; when I arrived, I had no issues getting seated.The setup was so charming. Each person was required to get the afternoon tea package (1 pot of tea of your choice with a stacked tower of goodies. Each person got one of each food item).

My friend and I got there at 10:45am and were informed that they&#39;re doing last calls for their breakfast menu, so we ordered right away. My friend had originally asked for their eggs in a pot, but after about 4 minutes the lady came back and told us that they&#39;re out, and now she can only take order from their lunch menu. I&#39;m not sure what their time frame is, but that was 10:52.The food was good. I had the avocado toast, and it was arguably the second best I&#39;ve ever had. The avocado was fresh and ripe and very very very creamy. The poached egg on the top was OK, the yolk was cooked a little much for my taste. Regardless, the big chunks of avocado with basil was very impressive, the basil really added to the flavor and gave it a fresh taste.Excellent interior design as well, which I am a total sucker for. Perfect for a breakfast or lunch with your friend (if you can wake up early enough to make it before they start their lunch menu, that is). The lunch menu seemed good too, definitely want to try their wagyu tartare and tuna crudo, and the atmosphere seemed to be good for an afternoon tea too.I am definitely going back, I just wish the staff was a little friendlier, i got the impression that they just didn&#39;t want to be bothered and were not pleased whenever we asked for something (we weren&#39;t asking for anything impossible, I just wanted a napkin so I could spit out my gum, and separate checks for me and my friend. Plus, we only had one menu to begin with). Also, I could see how it could get a little hectic as people from the hotel kept on passing by with luggages. I really want to like this place, hopefully it will work out next time."

It has been a special big birthday and at the end I couldn&#39;t be more blessed.We planned having afternoon tea for our annual spring tea but since it&#39;s so close to my birthday, it was sorta kinda mixed up together. We were giving a new player in the tea Chicago arena a try.Soho House is a beautiful hotel and quite exclusive. It&#39;s a member only hotel and if you aren&#39;t a member, you ain&#39;t staying here. It&#39;s pretty hip and pretentious at the get go. One of my friends said she was ignored in her Honda at valet and they took care the Porsches and the Teslas first. Douchey on that.The inside was beautiful and buzzing! So many people in the lobby and it was quite overwhelming for a little bit. I had an issue with my reservation but they finally made it right by me and they kept my original time and sat us after about 10 minutes of wait for them to set up the tea set.For $24/pax, it was a pretty wonderful tea offering. We didn&#39;t know what to expect as comparing it to Peninsula&#39;s tea at a whopping $75/pax after tax and tip, $24 plus tax and tip seemed pretty damn reasonable. The tea selection was smaller but I found my earl grey and I was happy.The sandwiches were simple but they were delicious. The ham and cheese was especially nom nom though it&#39;s just ham and cheese. The desserts were pretty including lemon tart, eclairs, macarons, and a chocolate cake. The sweet bread and the scones were my least fave. They were just okay borderline meh. However, we were full and happy. We had a great time chatting away on the couch and drinking tea and eating tiny food where our pinky raised as we held them. Oh poo. Call it hoytie toytie. At least we didn&#39;t put on hats and flower dresses.It was definitely enjoyable and the price was right. The ambience was also pretty chill after the lobby died down. The service was a bit slow, and then it picked up, then it was slow again. But overall, for being as busy as they were, I forgave them.For some reasons, all my friends left me to wait for my ride to pick me up at 6 pm. I was actually a little pissed they all left me to wait by myself but turned out they were all being sneaky as they had to go to the restaurant where I found them all as they screamed surprise!! Holy shit. It was crazy.Was a great afternoon tea spot. Nice ambience, food is more than fair, and price is right. The tea madam would recommend it."

I especially enjoyed the green chili sauce.  The chicken itself wasn&#39;t too dry, which shows that they actually monitor the food as they cook it instead of throwing it on the grill for a long time and drying it out.I wasn&#39;t as impressed with the sides.  The mac and cheese seemed like your standard fare for any BBQ restaurant in the city, and the corn on the cob had too much mayo on it for my liking and was slightly soggy.  Sweet potato fries are just that...sweet potato fries.  It&#39;s hard to mess that up.In short, come for the chicken, not the sides, and you won&#39;t be disappointed."

When I saw that there&#39;s a chicken place closer than Wicker Park, I really wanted to try it. My first go around with Art of Chicken was just okay. We weren&#39;t wowed by it.This weekend, on the suggestion of my husband, my infant son and I did a stroller walk to lunch (for me) while my eldest son napped. When I stepped into their small storefront, their cute kitschy decor impressed me. For such a small place, they put a lot of thought into how it looks. When I looked over the menu, I asked the server at the window what was her favorite. She preferred &#34;Crazy Chico&#34; with its herbs and spices marinade. I stuck with my typical charbroiled chicken order of a half of chicken and a side. Since it&#39;s been super hot lately, I got a beverage too.The chicken is served on a cute metal plate with a tray and homemade salsas with pita bread. Crazy Chico chicken is amazing. It almost made me question my loyalty to Nick&#39;s Pit Stop. It was a great blend of herbs and spices to make a tasty chicken. I had sweet potato fries which were tasty too. If there&#39;s one thing I don&#39;t like about Art of Chicken, it&#39;s the pita bread. Theirs is dry and a little too salty. I like soft fluffy pita bread not overly chewy.Overall, I like this place and will return again for another stroller walk lunch with my kiddo. The staff was really nice and helpful too."

At least once a week, sometimes more &amp; our orders were usually $50.00+ each time. But as of lately, it seems there are a lot of catering orders going on &amp; we have to wait until those are completed in order to place an order. Unfortunately, our orders have cut down because of this. We try calling at 11:00am when they open thinking that we might beat the lunch crowd, but because there is a catering order, they want us to call back around Noon or 1:00pm and then it ends up being an hour and a half wait. I&#39;m sorry, but I think that&#39;s ridiculous.

I mean yea is good chicken but not outstanding. First time I was there I tried both of them and even though I did notice a little difference between them, the flavors are not as distinctive as I would like them.BTW the fist time I was there the chicken was a little underdone, almost raw. second time we asked them to cook it well done and it came out just perfect.The sides, on the other hand, are great. And for me maybe the only reason to come back to this joint. I have tried the mac n cheese, corn on the cob and sweet potato fries. Mexican style corn the way is should be on the cob with all the toppings. solid mac n cheese and great fries. When I think about this place I crave the sides more than the chicken. Would it be wrong to make a meal out of sides???Service is nice but there is one girl with a bitchy attitude disguised as nice. She tries to be nice but her bitchyness comes through.The place is small but really cool. Some tables and bars, some chicken wire and cool wall art make for a cool place.The prices are spot on.The art of chicken, 3* for chicken and service, 4 * for the sides"

These hombres do NOT mess around.There are two types of chickens, El Jefe and the crazy Chico.//el jefe - 4.25 (quarter chicken) - smokey flavor with a crispy skin. It almost has some sort of sweet tangy taste to it. I loved it, thought it was amazinnngggg//corn on the cob - 1.99 - dayummm dayummm DAYUUMMMMM. this is some REAL ASS CORN! its very similar to elotes [might be the same thing] except they don&#39;t cut the corn off, put it in a styrofoam cup and give your fatass a spoon it eat it with! The corn was sooo soft and full of flavor. I meannnn JUICES UP IN YOUR FACE.. and you better believe you be thanking it afterwards [it = referring to the corn].All in all. This place is amazing.

Easy enough order- and all the chicken was pre-made- so it shouldn&#39;t have taken 10 mins. There were 2 people ahead of me also waiting.They apologized for the wait to everyone. I understand, the place is new, and they are getting it together, But they need to step up the pace a bit- Everything is already cooked, it shouldn&#39;t take so long.As far as the chicken goes- it did not jump out at me, as being anything special, it was good, but not over the top.  For half the amount, the rotisserie chicken at Costco is better.

But not nearly as fine as the art itself. Indeed, the chicken here is roasted to perfection. I had a half order of the El Jefe and a regular sized order of the Mac &amp; Cheese. The El Jefe chicken is marinated overnight, cooked slow, and you can definitely tell from the first bite; it is a masterpiece. The spice is light but the taste is substantial. The skin comes crispy and breaks with ease as it separates easily with each bite thus allowing you to portion your skin to meat ratio as you please. The meat falls effortlessly off of the bone which, if you&#39;ve ever cooked chicken, is not simple feat. In the end, you will have a pile of bones and nothing else.These guys really put the time and care into making great chicken and if you ever crave it, then you shouldn&#39;t hesitate to come here. Along with the chicken, they also serve some pita bread, which comes out warm and soft like they had just baked it. If you&#39;d like, they will also serve you up some homemade salsa which was quite delicious. I&#39;m from California, so my expectations for salsa are very high. I had their green and their orangyish salsa. Both were spicy, which I was excited about, and packed some nice flavor. However, i&#39;m a much bigger fan of salsa that carries much more of a tomato taste. Although the salsa that I tried had more flavor coming from the peppers, it was still satisfying. The mac &amp; cheese was no gimmick either and paired well with the chicken.All in all, the service was great, the place is clean and well-kept. They got a TV to entertain you, although I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll just be staring at your plate. In the end, it&#39;s all about the chicken."

The corn with everything was a disappointment there was an overload of butter mayo and parmesan and im not picky about corn, I love elote, this corn just didn&#39;t taste good. Then my chicken meat was grey, I&#39;m not sure if it was because marinating over night so I ate it anyways. And there was not enough chicken meat on my piece for one person. I was still pretty hungry after spending $10 so I was pretty bummed. I&#39;d like to give it another chance but honestly I&#39;ll probably stick to the chicken dinner for $7 at Q-tine"

I wanted to go somewhere nearby that matched my cowboy boot attire, so we ended up at the Art of Chicken.The restaurant is tiny, and when we were there it was filled with cops (which I have learned is a good sign).I had the crazy chico chicken (breast and wing) with mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and Mexican coke (YAY for Mexican coke!).The chicken was moist and tender, but it wasn&#39;t super flavorful. The red and green sauces were good and added a little kick--which I thought was missing from the skin.  I think I would rather go to Feed for my chicken needs.  However, the sides were awesome.

There aren&#39;t many really good places in Bucktown to grab a solid, home-cooked, comfort food chicken meal. So when this guy moved to town, I was pretty excited to try it out.Essentially, they have two options of chicken, you pick one or the other, and load up on side dishes.  One is juicier than the other, so it really depends if you like moist chicken or spiced and crunchy chicken.  Both are delicious so if that&#39;s all you care about, close your eyes and point.For side dishes, I recommend the mac and cheese and/or the sweet potato fries, but they have plenty of other options to choose from.  I tried out the corn on the cob with everything on it, and I hate to say it (for fear of sounding like a 12 year old girl) but it was pretty spicy. I don&#39;t know what was on it, but my lips felt like the sun afterwards.  Just fair warning that if you like it more on the mild side, just ask for butter.The prices are very reasonable, the food is delicious, the staff is friendly, and the service is quick.  What more could you ask for?"

The Art of Chicken recently opened and it&#39;s perfect for those evenings where you want to pick up something quick, inexpensive, but still relatively healthy.TAOC sells two kinds of chicken, which is grilled: Crazy Chico and El Jefe. The descriptions sounded about the same to me, but I recall that the El Jefe is marinated in juices and spices, and the Crazy Chico is marinated in herbs and spices. The chicken is sold in quarters, halves, or whole options, and comes with homemade salsa and pita bread.Several sides are also available: mashed potatoes, spanish rice, fries (sweet or regular), steamed vegetables, corn on the cob, and my personal favorite, mac and cheese. Sides come available in both small and large size options.We placed an order for a whole chicken (Crazy Chico), and sides of spanish rice and mac and cheese. We waited about 15 minutes for our order. The chicken came hot off the grill, and looked and smelled great.I thought the chicken was really well done (in execution, not temperature) . The skin was crispy, and the flavor went deep into the chicken. It was juicy, and kind of smokey tasting. Me likey.The spanish rice was rather lacking. It didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor, but the mac and cheese more than made up for the shortfalls of the rice. It tasted strongly of a nice sharp cheddar, and the consistency was very creamy. Wished we&#39;d have ordered a large size instead of a small.Service was swift and very friendly. You may have to wait a few minutes for your food as the chicken takes some time to cook, but it&#39;s worth it.Chicken is all they sell here, but they do it right."

That was a long time ago.   I spent most of my day annoying coworkers telling them about the chicken I would dominate after work.  Finally, my wish came true as the place opened for business today.I hate comparing it to chains like El Pollo Loco or Pollo Campero, as it&#39;s much much better than those places.  Wait, I guess i just did.  But that&#39;s what I was first reminded of.  The Mexican influence is apparent throughout the small menu and they do a great job on their specialty chicken.We had the Crazy Chico along with some fries, mac and cheese, and spanish rice.  You could really taste the flavors and spices used.  Not sorry to say I went HAM on the Crazy Chico and almost finished a whole chicken by myself.   The french fries were our favorite out of the sides. Big crunchy slices of potato with subtle hints of herbs and spices, we were quite pleased with them.My only suggestion would be to maybe offer some pico de gallo with the the chicken. Their salsas are tasty, but a good pico would go really well with the chicken. Maybe they just didn&#39;t have it today, hopefully they&#39;ll add it later.Inexpensive food and friendly counter service.

The menu isn&#39;t very big, but they did have roast vegetables as an option if you wanted to make it a healthy meal unlike what we did.The corn wasn&#39;t the healthiest I&#39;ve ever tried, but it was very flavorful and had a bit of kick. The mac &amp; cheese was the creamy &amp; delish as well....and last but not least, the chicken was just about perfect! Often when I try roast chicken like this, the meat might not have nearly enough flavor compared to the skin, or it ends up overcooked/ dry, but none of those issues here. The flavor was amazing through the entire half chicken &amp; it was cooked perfect &amp; juicy.We tried the red &amp; green sauces &amp; while standalone I thought they were very good, and would love them with some chips or on a taco, I didn&#39;t think the chicken needed them.All of this + delivery + tip for ~$30 for 2, and we have at least 1 meal leftover...not too bad!I&#39;ve never dined in so I can&#39;t comment on the service, but I&#39;ve been in the area and its a casual, order-at-the-counter kinda place &amp; has a small patio.Will be eating here again in the near future!"

I highly recommend the El Jefe, it is a bit more spicy than the other, but not real spicy. It is just right! Cooked as you order it, not sitting around waiting for someone to buy it. All the sides are really good too, my husband and I always get the mashed potatoes, mac and cheese and corn, you can&#39;t go wrong with any of them. But I have to say the best side of all is the mexican rice, it is our favorite. The place is really cute and the staff is very friendly. They also give you two different sauces for your chicken, one more spicy than the other. I personally like the spicier one! It&#39;s nice to stop in, pick up some grub to take home and chow down! It is like having a home cooked meal, without the hassle of cooking and bonus, no mess in the kitchen! We always have leftovers and they are great the next day too, I love to eat the chicken cold.So, take the night off and go grab some grub, you&#39;ll love it!"

They also both have service that leaves something to be desired to varying degrees.I&#39;d compare growing up with Harold&#39;s to growing up with an abusive drunk parent, and finding Art of Chicken is like finding refuge in a foster family where my care-givers are just drunk but not abusive.Harold&#39;s historical abuse of patrons is well known. Ran out of chicken? Ok. Got my order wrong? No problem. Ran out of chicken during the time it took me to drive back to pick up whatever chicken you didn&#39;t give me. No worries. I&#39;ll just take 3 wings for that breast I paid for and didn&#39;t get and you no longer have - ok I&#39;ll take 2 - ok 1 wing, and some extra white bread? Please?I&#39;ve already ordered from Art of Chicken like 20 times. Unlike Harold&#39;s, they always answer the phone. Unlike Harold&#39;s, they have never got my order wrong. Unlike Harold&#39;s, they actually have a decent space to eat in and actual tables with a bathroom. [How Harold&#39;s in WP gets away with no public restroom - even for customers - I still don&#39;t understand.]Like Harold&#39;s they have upped the wait time. Like Harold&#39;s they have run out of chicken on me - though never after taking my order. Like Harold&#39;s they are pretty militant about getting the f- out right at closing to the extent that it&#39;s not a good idea to order for pickup within 30 minutes of closing.But beyond the better (or not as bad) service - I think this place eclipses Harold&#39;s because it&#39;s not nearly as bad for you health wise. Both versions of chicken at Art offer nice spice without the potential to stain your furniture or clothes with grease. For those of us over 30 it gets harder and harder to justify clogging your arteries especially if (or more likely when) you are treated poorly for the privilege of doing so.In short, Art of Chicken serves chicken with an attitude, but doesn&#39;t serve it outright rude. To quote the immortal Yelp development team &#39;yay I&#39;m a fan&#39;."

Super clean, bright, and festive graphics on the walls.As mentioned in the reviews, they have two flavor preps for the chicken; El Jefe and Crazy Chico. I really wanted to try both varieties in this visit, so I ordered two quarters, one in each variety. (While I realize this wasn&#39;t cost effective as you end up paying $2.25 more by ordering 2 quarters instead of 1 half). I also ordered a side of Spanish rice, and mashed potatoes.Everything was really good, and plentiful. I couldn&#39;t finish all of the sides and pita that came with the order. While there was a difference in the varieties, it was very subtle. If I had to pick one over the other, I would go with the Crazy Chico. It seemed to have a bit more brightness to it.  Though the description doesn&#39;t say so, I was really hoping that El Jefe was going to be spicy. It wasn&#39;t.  They do, however, have a couple of sauces on the side, that had nice spice.The quarters came with a leg and a thigh. I generally prefer dark meat, so this was fine, but I wonder if one could request a wing and breast.As far as the sides go, the Spanish rice was slightly above average, and the mashed potatoes were average (but did appear to be made from real potatoes). Next time, I&#39;ll order the half chicken outright, and go with a single side (like I said, they are plentiful).The best part is the price. Cheap has a negative connotation, but that&#39;s what it is. My entire order was about $13, and that&#39;s considering the fact that I purposely overpaid in the manner in which I ordered. I&#39;m always on the lookout for takeout dinner options that can come in  under $10. This is definitely one of those options."

The El Jefe is great Flavorful and juicy and a bit of spice. I admit that I like the Crazy Chico the most, which is their regular chicken that somehow manages to stand out from the everyday. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s so good, but it is. I like to get extra pita.Where I was disappointed was the sides. The corn was decent, but otherwise, I have been unimpressed. It&#39;s also veru cute on the inside, but small and not especially comfortable.I say order a chicken, get extra pita and take it home to eat with some Velweeta mac and cheese.Dat Chicken doe."

When I arrived over 20 minutes later, I was told that my order wasn&#39;t ready yet. Not only was it not ready, but they had run out of the mashed potatoes I ordered and also had run out of the corn I had ordered. After just doubling up on the other sides, I also ordered a bottled Coke to go. After 10-15 minutes of waiting in there for my order to be ready, I finally got called up. Since I was in a hurry and quite frankly starving, I ran out of there with the bag. Got home and realized they didn&#39;t include my Coke in the bag, but had definitely charged me for it.Although it was an unsatisfactory customer service experience, the food was pretty good. I got both types of chicken (El Jefe and Crazy Chico) and I&#39;d say the Crazy Chico is much better with a lot more seasoning. The sweet potato fries were also very, very good. Almost made up for not getting my mashed potatoes...almost. The mac n&#39; cheese was good too. What I really loved was there orange spicy sauce. You only need a little bit but it adds a lot of kick. Skip the spanish rice. It was very bland.Overall, great food but they need to work on their customer service and ordering process. Would love to try again without all of the issues."

What a great little spot. When we were seated we noticed that the their kitchen area was wide open and it had little notes on the window for the day. It ranged from wishing everyone a great St. Patrick&#39;s day, to the weather, to Happy Birthday shout outs to two of the guest that were celebrating with them that night. Very cute indeed.I started off with an drink called Corn, Bread &amp; Butter. It was brown butter fat-washed with  moonshine, cranberry, orange marmalade. Very unique and quite delicious. Next I ordered the Bbq Octopus with pork belly and sea island red peas. OMG That was so good! I swear I could have had three dishes of this as my meal and I would have been in heaven. For dinner I ordered the Chili Braised Short Rib with Red Beans and rice and smoked Sour Cream. Sadly I was too full to really enjoy it all and because I was staying in a hotel room, I couldn&#39;t exactly take it with me. But I did manage to eat almost half of it and it was quite tasty.

The soup was just okay. I liked the unique seasoning clump on top and think it saved the soup since the soup by itself would have been boring and bland. The broccoli grilled cheese was stuffed by so much cheese that I had to remove half of it to taste the bread and broccoli. I wouldn&#39;t order this again.3) Upon leaving, we were both super upset to see the breakfast buffet!

I just loved the place, the ambience, the service, food, drinks.. Everything was great!! We went there just for drinks to celebrate my last day at work and ordered some lychee based tea and a moscow mule. Both were good, the tea was one of the best... Moscow mule could have been a little stronger but was okay for that moment.We were enjoying our drinks and suddenly the comes with 2 plates of awesome looking triffle with come panacotta on the bottom, raspberry coolie, and chocolate brownie topped with something that tasted like chocolate butter cream.. With a gluten free chocolate cookie and a dark chocolate coated fresh strawberry on the side.. It was to die for, I am not a dessert person but this was goooooddd!!! And the best part was, it was complimentary, they had some plates extra so.. I guess now is the time when I shud mention, the lounge is reservation only, bar is not and bar is not that expensive.Overall, awesome experience, will go there again. It is good for a romantic brunch, dinner, or just drinks with friends too..."

I took the elevator to the second floor and was greeted by iridescent metallic orbs suspended from the ceiling and smartly dressed employees - particularly the Dutch guy with a pocket square and the blonde woman with a My Little Pony tail swishing down her back. My hand brushed against the wall as I walked to my table and it&#39;s slippery bumps surprised and thrilled me. The view of the city from floor to ceiling windows took a back seat to the glassed-in kitchen stage which was the perfectly appropriate centerpiece to the dining room.I was excited to go to Travelle ever since I saw it featured on the television show Check Please! I studied the menu and made a list of everything I wanted. The server helped me decide how to order my two cocktail selections: first the elaborate Corn, Bread &amp; Butter followed by the mature Santiago Reunion.The Corn, Bread &amp; Butter is probably one of the most embellished cocktails you will ever have in your life. It is served on a wooden tray filled with crushed herbs and grains. There is a smoldering cinnamon stick (or something that looks like it), a two inch cube of cornbread, a small jar of marmalade, and the drink in a copper mug (like a Moscow Mule). The mug is filled with crushed ice from which protrudes a narrow straw. It&#39;s embarrassing to admit that the clandestine drink eludes my description. It was a little sweet and everyone at my table really liked it but I wonder if all of the fanfare scattered the possibility of analysis.The Santiago Reunion is like a smokey Manhattan. I absolutely loved it and would get it again. It&#39;s unadulterated simplicity was bold in maturity. I would say that in comparison a Manhattan is bright with syrupy flavors like walking through a forest with light beams broken by the leaves and branches. The Santiago Reunion is the leathery face of a well-traveled, strong individual walking through the trees.We shared three starters: Roasted Bone Marrow, Roasted Cauliflower, and Endive Salad. We liked all three. M&#39;s favorite was the Endive Salad and her least was the Roasted Bone Marrow. My opinion is the opposite of hers. We both agreed that we were unimpressed by the Roasted Cauliflower.We asked our server if the meat was grass fed and he answered no. He explained that Chef Tim Graham prefers grain fed animals. We further asked if the corn and soy used in some of the dishes was non-GMO to which the server reported, &#34;Yes, the chef said that he uses all organic ingredients.&#34; Um... I don&#39;t know if you know this, but although non-GMO and organic might often overlap they are not synonymous. So that answer influenced M to get the BBQ Octopus and I took a walk on the wild side and got the Soy Marinated Skirt Steak.The BBQ Octopus left M in love with Travelle. In fact, she said that this might become our new anniversary restaurant. My Soy Marinated Skirt Steak didn&#39;t lead me to agree with her. I appreciated that the flavor of the meat shone through. The thinly sliced radishes, cucumbers, and mango was a bright contrast to the characteristically tough and fatty meat; however, I think I prefer a more traditional preparation.For dessert I was torn between the State Fair Cream Puff and the Pumpkin Cheesecake Pie. The server surprised us by bringing both and they were both incredible. I appreciated that both were rich with flavors but light in texture.We weren&#39;t paying but we think our bill was over $200 for the three of us. It was a delicious dinner in a chic setting. It seemed as if every detail was attended to. For example, the acoustics were perfect for comfortable table conversation balanced with background music and the muted voices of those at other tables. They accomplished this by having smartly carpeted floors and textured ceilings. I definitely appreciate a restaurant that is able to bring incoherent dreams to sharp focus."

I came for a holiday work dinner in December, and everyone had a great experience.We had a private section for about 20 people, with a preset menu. We all started off with some appetizers - two flatbreads, a mushroom one and an assorted veggie one. The mushroom flatbread was great! We then had an option to pick between the field squash soup and the endive salad. I chose the butternut squash soup, which was very flavorful and light. For my main course I picked the mushroom risotto. It was great! Very tasty, a little heavy (but that&#39;s expected with a risotto). I would definitely order it again. I finished my dinner off with the apple cobbler, which was more than enough to make my dinning experience excellent.The atmosphere, the service, and the food all deserve 5 stars. The decor of the hotel lobby, the lounge and the restaurant is very tasteful. Some nights they also have some light live music in the lounge."

The prawns were cooked perfectly, served with a flavorful broth as well as toasted ciabatta with aioli. The mocha bombe for dessert was also tasty, with a light interior and not overly sweet.Service was warm and professional, and the decor strikes a good balance between modern and inviting, making for a relaxing yet elegant dining atmosphere."

This is where the high price was justified by high quality.  We ordered the Travelle Benedictine which was an eggs Benedict with lobster and spinach ($29) and the cast iron baked eggs with mushrooms and onion ($15).Here&#39;s where the quality justifies the price. Beware I&#39;ll be using the word &#34;perfect&#34; a lot. The lobster benedict came with large shavings of truffles on top and a side of perfectly roasted potatoes. The two eggs were poached perfectly. The English muffin was toasted perfectly so it was slightly crispy and chewy. The real showstopper was the lobster.  Look at the picture!  That&#39;s a lot of lobster! The lobster was cooked to perfection, tender and juicy. The Hollandaise sauce was creamy but not overpowering and they didn&#39;t drown the dish in it. All together the lobster benedict was balanced and flavorful. Each component of the dish was perfectly cooked.The cast iron baked eggs was also very good. The mushrooms were firm, not droopy from overcooking as so many cooks tend to do, and bursting with buttery flavor.  This dish came with a side of fresh fruit. It&#39;s in the small things that  speak volumes about a chef&#39;s ethos.  Not a single bad berry in the bowl. Every single berry was firm, sweet and unbruised. The melons and pineapple were evenly sliced and perfectly ripe.  It was so remarkable that my companion and I got the distinct impression that there was a guy in the kitchen whose sole job was to study the berries individually for perfection before plating it.The service at Travelle is top-notch and whoever is the head chef for breakfast is doing an amazing job. Their attention to detail in every element of their dish puts other hotel restaurants of comparable stature like The Peninsula to shame (but that&#39;s another review).  If you want to try a fancy hotel breakfast go to the Travelle at the Langham.P.S. There&#39;s no Tigah pic because we opted not to bring the cubs to this pricey place."

I would describe it as &#34;understated, modern chic&#34;. It was beautiful and inviting. I was absolutely fascinated by the glass-walled kitchen where I could see the chefs preparing our food and having fun while doing so.The food was delectable. We tried a few different dishes and each one was yummier than the last. Our favorites were the lightly-breaded chicken and waffles, the crispy octopus, the prawns, and the rabbit sausage gnocchi. We paired our dinner with the French 75, the Monte Carlo, and La Paloma, all mixed perfectly and superbly enjoyable.The staff was warm and friendly and made the whole experience very homey. It felt light-hearted and fun to be there.I love this place, can&#39;t wait to go back."

The prices are a bit on the high side although that&#39;s often what you find when you are in the area especially when you have a hotel connected to you. Anywho it has a wonderfully cozy bar which I could see myself returning if I wanted to get away for a little drinkypoo before dinner here or elsewhere. The wine list is very good and has an interesting selection of beers and cocktails.We came for brunch. They have a very pricey buffet options or an ala cart. We ordered off the menu and were very satisfied with the creative dishes that came out. The service was wonderful, friendly and knowledgable about both the food and the wine and beers they offer.

It&#39;s perched on the second floor, but has deceptively good views due to being perched right over the river. The space is beautiful inside, the service is great and they have a very large (almost overwhelmingly so) cocktail menu, of unique and top-notch drinks. I had a Monte Carlo, on the waitress&#39;s recommendation, and it was great.To be fair, this was on a Saturday afternoon when the place was fairly empty, so I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s like at night. But it&#39;s a great place to people watch and tipple the afternoon away with friends."

Me and my bestie was looking for a last-minute breakfast destination wow in Chicago. Of course I relied on Yelp to help me find a place and this restaurant came up. So we walked a short distance from our hotel and decided to stay here even though the prices were a little bit more than what we were looking to pay. However the food was simply amazing. As well as the décor and service were top-notch.On Sundays, they had a nice buffet for breakfast that included anything from crab, sausage, bacon, eggs, smoothie and omelet stations, as well as fresh fruit. We decided to get something light - I got omelette. Again if food was simply amazing but I was taken aback by the potatoes. These potatoes were out of this world. They were season so well that my best friend and I almost got some to take on the bus home. My bestie got the French toast that was made from scratch and she really enjoyed how fluffy and light they were.Overall I really enjoyed this restaurant I would definitely come back once I&#39;m in Chicago area again.

The bar area was closed but has window views of the river which is quite nice.  I ordered a glass of champagne and the bottle was brought to the table which I appreciated because it can be annoying when the champagne isn&#39;t super chilled and there are minimal bubbles. I also ordered the Burrata with Persimmons. I would venture to say it&#39;s the best and most interesting burrata I&#39;ve ever had and I will be dreaming about it for weeks to come! The only suggestion I have for them is to be sensitive to the amount of times they ask to clear the table, especially when the plate still has about half of the food remaining. I think we were asked 3 times just for our appetizer :("

For starters, it&#39;s so chic. You come in the hotel entrance on Wabash, and you go to the elevators, and the lobby of this place screams class and elegance. When I got off the elevator on the second floor for Travelle- it was just... Decadent. It was dripping with gold. It just permeates the whole place.If the ambiance wasn&#39;t enough for you, the drinks will get you. Such original drinks, and the first couple pages are historic drinks brought back to life. They had drinks originally from the mid 1800s available. Truly this place really nails it with drinks. I am by no means a connoisseur, but the beverages and their selection was incredible. The prices reflect that ($$$$$). I had the Chicago Fizz- loved it.Now for the food. Yes, it was similar to what I had experienced before with the drinks. It was delicious. My friend who came with me was also so impressed. I had the burger and fries for dinner, and I almost passed out. It was juicy and delicious. I just was so into it, and the service was on point. I felt the drinks + dinner + ambiance really sets this place apart. Try the flatbread starters. They are excellent.Finally I would say this. The view is incredible, like so good. The thing is, it&#39;s a dressy environment, great for small groups and just a good date night. Coming on your own and having a drink is great. No matter what you won&#39;t be disappointed. The caveat of course is that with a couple of drinks plus starters and a meal, it&#39;s about $70 per person. I mean it&#39;s not too bad, considering what you are getting.At the end of the day this place- it&#39;s a treat- so indulge yourself to what is arguable one of the top ten places in Chicago and if anything else at least for the night you can dine the way you deserve."

The Travelle Eggs Benedict was the best Eggs Benedict any of our party had ever tasted. The lobster portion was not at all stingy, the truffle smell perfumed the whole table, and the sauce was incredibly balanced. Amazingly, the Norwegian Eggs Benedict was almost as good--even when compared immediately after. Both had potatoes tossed in a preserved lemon that made us pause in appreciation.The prawns were earthy and delicious. We used the toast with lemon aioli to mop up the prawn jus.The rabbit sausage flatbread was delicious, particularly if you got a sizable piece of artichoke in your bite.Special thanks to the cook for the off-menu preparation of deckle and morels.All was superlative. I will definitely recommend Travelle."

There is an extensive buffet, but we ordered off the menu.The skillet we had was good, but the highlight of the meal was the Benedict. We selected the salmon, and it was an amazing blend of ingredients. The sauce was not a standard Hollandaise as is usual on a Benedict, but rather something much more citrusy and a perfect accompaniment to the salmon and the beautifully cooked eggs. Wedge potatoes had a strong herb flavor but were unremarkable. Service was attentive.It should be noted that, although we did not have wines (since it was 10am), the wine list here is perhaps the most interesting in the city, with a very broad range of selections ranging from extravagant to affordable, and all very interesting."

ROASTED CORN RICOTTA FLATBREAD · tomatoes, scallions (opted to remove the speck since we don&#39;t eat pork).  This was AMAZING.  Hands down, one of the best flat breads I have ever eaten!2. TOMATO SALAD · buttermilk panna cotta, basil.  This was good, but it was hard to eat because the panna cotta was really runny.  I would probably skip this if I were to go back.For my entree, I chose: SOY MARINATED SKIRT STEAK · fire &amp; ice salad.  The skirt steak was so tender. Not the typical, over-cooked chewy mess that can happen to skirt steak when not prepared well.  The fire and ice salad was perfection.  The &#34;fire&#34; came from the thinly sliced jalapenos in the salad.  Honestly, I probably could have eaten an entree portion of the salad.  That&#39;s how good it was.My husband chose: SPICY HALF CHICKEN · Nichol&#39;s farm corn, honeycomb.  I didn&#39;t try his chicken, but he thought it was well seasoned and well prepared.For our sides, we asked for the:1. ROASTED CAULIFLOWER with romesco sauce - I pretty much ate the entire side by myself because ti was too good to share!2. MARBLE POTATO SALAD.  This dish had bacon in it, and we were so grateful that the chef actually prepared this from scratch for us without the bacon.  It was very thoughtful and the gesture greatly appreciated.As if that wasn&#39;t enough food, we opted to share the Pumpkin Cheesecake.  YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!We never felt like we waited to long for our food, our servers seemed to know just when to check-in and always made us feel like making our experience at Travelle exceptional, was a priority. What makes Travelle a class act is that they did not charge us for our &#34;cocktails&#34; or our dessert.Way to bring us back Travelle!"

When my brother suggested starting 2015 on the right foot with Travelle&#39;s New Year&#39;s Day brunch special, I was salivating upon perusing their selection of eggs benedict.The decor and ambiance permeated sheer elegance. Our waitress was attentive to fine details and made the experience pleasant. The waitress substituted my brunch beverage for a latte, which was a great touch to my meal.I tried the florentine eggs benedict along with the nutella buttermilk pancakes. The eggs came with a side of sweet potatoes, that were perfectly seasoned and crisp. I am generally not a fan of sweet potatoes but I inhaled these. While the buttermilk pancakes were light, they were not anything exceptional. I do realize they had a dollop of nutella, which is always a good choice in life.I&#39;ve had my fair share of eggs benedict and no place comes close to the flavors captured by Travelle. This strength thrives on the high-quality and freshness of their ingredients. I am salivating as I type this, looking forward to re-visiting soon."

My only real complaints with our Travelle experience were 1) more difficulty finding street parking for the location, and 2) the seat I had wasn&#39;t all that comfortable with the curvature at back of seat cushion (I&#39;m sure the design was more for looks).  It turns out you can get 4 hours of validated parking for $14 if you eat here, and that&#39;s not too bad for the area if you want to kill that amount of time (I paid $10 for metered parking).  Anyway, wife had the baby octopus/pork belly appetizer, mushroom ragu, and banana pot de creme dessert.  We shared dishes and I had the baby octopus/pork belly, chili braised short rib, and chocolate cake.  The highlight for me was that baby octopus - it was a benchmark to remember - being a large, nicely grilled piece and yet so surprisingly tender and delicate.  The pork belly was nice also, but not quite as succulent as a best ever serving.  The short rib was tasty and also extremely tender, and this dish had a nice bit of Tex Mex flavor to it with the red beans.  The mushroom ragu had a large variety and quantity of tasty mushroom slices and was smothered with a creamy and subtle coconut like sauce.  The desserts were decadent, and you could feel the calories entering in, and staying put.  The chocolate cake was good, and I personally liked it a bit better than the banana pot de creme, but it wasn&#39;t not top notch moist.  They have an open view kitchen area and except for the fact that the bar area was separated from the dining area, I didn&#39;t find anything particularly odd about the dining space that some earlier reviews alluded to.  The space is loud though.  Overall, a great visit and experience for us here."

The pork and mussels were a big hit at our table.  They are served in broth that is to die for and pretty good when used to soak your bread too!  The service was impeccable from the bar to the dining room.  The décor is lovely.  The entire evening was a masterpiece.  Cheers to the chef and staff at Travelle!

Paul, our waiter, continued to deliver stellar service. The menu has recently changed with some nice highlights, our favorite of which was the lamb spareribs. The peri-peri chicken and the curry-wurst were a close second and third. They removed the risotto and replaced it with a pasta that was not the best. A minor pet peeve of mine is when menus don&#39;t include all the ingredients listed, for example the pasta was filled with green peppers. We had the mashed peas as a side, which were good, not fantastic. Other highlights included the chicken wings and Boursin flatbread with zucchini and radish.Of all the deserts, the creme puff was the biggest hit with the chocolate cake (essentially German chocolate cake) was the runner up."

Bartender didn&#39;t know what two menu items were and seemed unable to find out. Good wine selection. Beet salad was presented nicely and competently crafted.

The service is impeccable. From the friendly person at reception to the great waiters and busboys, you will be catered to and well taken care of. The room is well laid out and seating is comfortable. Plus they space out diners pretty well, so there was no crowding with neighboring tables during an early dinner.What I liked about the food was how each course brought me to a new destination. White gazpacho took me to Andalusia. Scallops with friend green tomatoes brought me to the antebellum South. Gnocchi with cremini mushrooms (impressively served out of a Parmesan cheese wheel) had me traveling to Tuscany. And the panna cotta with sour cherries landed me squarely in Rome. Or maybe it was the martini that made me dizzy. I liked the Parker House dinner rolls too. Dinner was win-win.I must say the room has one drawback, unless automobiles are your thing: the view of the Marina Towers garage is up close and personal. At one point, the curtains closed and that improved things; later they opened again for some reason. I recommend keeping them closed at all times!! Meanwhile Travelle&#39;s top flight service gets 5 stars, food is 4.5, and the room (including the view) is 4.0. In my book it all adds up to 5.0 for this lovely fine dining destination."

The staff and service were excellent.  The 4-course is only tasting portions, of which we did not know that from the menu or the server and were rather disappointed in the portion of what I thought was to be our entrée.  SO you get a small salad, two appetizers and a dessert.  For 45 dollars this is not a value.  Taste - excellent.It started with a complimentary glass of dry proseco, then a &#39;Waldorf&#39; salad of greens, granny smith apple, grapes, candied walnuts and got cheese.  Tiny but delish.  Followed by a succulent quail in a spicy/hot pilli pilli sauce.  Then pork loin with black-eyed peas.  Very tender and tasty sauce on the peas.  Dessert was a chocolate tart with fresh raspberries.  THe crust was rather hard to fork through -- actually hd to saw through it, but tasted good.You do not get to choose from different options, the 4-course is a set menu.  Probably different for each Wed.We also opted for a 20 dollar wine pairing with each course, but those pours are only about 2 ounces - meager.  Their wines by the glass are very pricey, btw.Overall: great service, excellent taste, beautiful hotel/dining, not a good value. small portions on the 4-course special Wed menu."

The second drink I tried was the TRINIDAD JAMES Rum, Bourbon, Passion Fruit, Almond, Clove.  I have to say this was a wonderful drink to end dinner with.  Perfect blend of tart, sweet and strong.After a delightful dinner we made our way over to the lounge.  They had a local artist performing on her electric violin and it was so much fun.  She was so talented but unfortunately it was her last performance at Travelle.  They are no longer doing live entertainment and that is ashame because the crowd continued to gather and applaud her amazing talent."

The dining room was empty around 6:00 p.m. on a weeknight, so we decided to sit at the bar where it was mostly packed for happy hour with groups of people probably staying at the hotel.The bar was busy so we had a bit of a wait until we got the menu&#39;s for food and drinks. My husband and I loved the falafels but the presentation was outstanding. All though we loved the falafels, I feel like it was plain and it didn&#39;t have a kick. I might be picky here but unless you&#39;re a falafel fan, come here for drinks and something more authentic and different off the menu. He also got himself a well made cocktail and we also ordered a chicken wings. Wings were perfectly flavored with Mediterranean flavors.

We sat at the &#34;chef&#39;s table&#34; which was basically positioned next to the see-through, glass-enclosed kitchen. We dined here on a Friday night to celebrate my parent&#39;s anniversary and they certainly made it feel like a special occasion with the chef, Tim Graham, even coming out to chat with us and pose with our table.Surprisingly though, the place was half empty even when left around 7:30 or so (our reservation was at 5:45pm). Note that it can feel a little cold by the windows if you&#39;re dining here on a cold day but since this is a historical landmark building, they truly can&#39;t do much about the windows.Anyway, the food itself was just OK. The highlights were probably the sea-cuterie (smoked seafood dishes instead of assorted meats), flaming chicken wings (they fire these babies up at your table), and the bone marrow.We also ordered the New York strip steak, lamb loin, chestnut soup and fried mussels but none of these were that great especially considering the prices we were paying.My parents were seated on the side of the table that had a direct view of the kitchen so they were quite entertained all night even noting how one of the sous chefs had time to dance and text on his phone since it wasn&#39;t busy.Other highlights include the espresso cheesecake, which you can order as part of room service too if you&#39;re staying here, and the extensive and very good wine selection!For wine, we ordered a half bottle of the 2002 Shloss Lieser Riesling from Germany and 2011 Kosta Browne Pinot Noir from Sonoma Coast. Both of these wines were outstanding and paired nicely with our dishes.Service was 3.5 stars - I wanted to give a higher rating but they mixed up my NY strip steak order with my brother&#39;s order so mine came out medium well instead of medium. They did offer to bring us new steaks but we politely declined, so they should have taken at least one of them off the bill. The desserts my parents ordered were free and they even gave an extra cupcake with a candle so that was a nice touch.Ambience gets 4 stars and food just gets 3 stars, so these average to 3 stars overall (rounding down). Wines get a solid 5 stars though!I&#39;d come back to the bar/lounge area, which certainly appeared to be a lot busier, to sample some more of their delicious wines and enjoy the view but the food is just meh. Hope it improves over time as it certainly has some promise!"

Then why just two stars?Easy. The food, while fantastic, was nothing adventurous and worth about half the  price I paid. The restaurant attempts to justify this price by a fancy building and a whopping amount of pretension. Look, don&#39;t BS us. You serve drumstick chicken? You can&#39;t be pretentious. Good talk.Let&#39;s hit on a few highlights: The gelatinous olive oil was silly. The foccacia bread service was utterly ridiculous - foccacia, along with sun-dried tomatoes, was the darling foodie staple of 1992. The excellent tartare was served with some hilarious spoon with a funny-tip and lightly burnt toast. Can&#39;t I just use my fork? I&#39;m not a neanderthal, in fact I have a doctorate, so stop trying to make me feel dumb.Seriously, if this place dropped the pretension and the prices, it would be one heck of a restaurant. You can tell the front of house is run like a Rochefoucauld swiss watch (that&#39;s a &#34;Trading Place&#34; ref...) and the service was really great. The piri-piri chicken was wonderful, as was the tartare. The frame for awesomeness is truly here. Until then, it&#39;s a place for some Arlington Heights hotshot who just leased his first BMW and is looking to impress his wife. The next week, she&#39;ll go to book club at Houlihan&#39;s and tell all her friends...The biggest offense: the crowd was just gross. V-neck tees? Check. Children running around? Check. It goes on and on. To sum up: Great food and service, lotta pretentious bullcrap, and mouth-breathing customers. This dinner was worth $60 on a really good night.Pass."

Its back beans that come shaped like squared off logs and I must say it was pretty good. My entree was a USDA prime burger and it was delicious, cooked just right. The service was very good and its one and airy and bright. Price for three with two drinks was $123.00 so its on the high side but not out of line for downtown Chicago, especially in such a locale. the Langham Hotel."

I ordered the walleye sandwich (which was the dish that drove me to pick the place), but I received an under-cooked piece of fish and a bland, mushy sandwich. Fish sandwiches aren&#39;t particularly complicated to begin with, but I&#39;ve honestly had better from take-out joints."

Characterized by an expansiveness and openness, the service strikes the right balance of proper and friendly. We arranged for a mini-group brunch on New Years day. The Benedict special for New Years day was exquisite - best Spicy Merguez Sausage benedict I&#39;ve ever had. Drinks were great as well.

The flavors didn&#39;t work for me, but since that&#39;s not how the drink was intended, I&#39;m willing to assume that it would&#39;ve been awesome with bourbon.Anyway, the potato and leek flatbread was delicious.  There was mustard on the flatbread, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had that particular combination of flavors.  Definitely get it!!!  The piri-piri chicken was very good too, super tender and lots of flavor.  It was actually a little too salty for my tastes, but I&#39;d rather have more flavor than less.I wasn&#39;t in love with the desserts: we had the nutella baklava and pistacho honey cake but I&#39;m not generally a fan of baklava or pistachios, so that&#39;s not surprising.  I was a huge fan of the appetizer and entree though and am still planning to come here for brunch."

Normally, because we&#39;re just having one round of drinks, we sit at the bar when we do this thing, but there were no seats available. I feel bad about taking a whole table just to run up a $30 tab -- it&#39;s like having to put on pants just to retrieve your mail-- but waitress was totally fine with it. She was very knowledgeable about the drink menu and attentive to dietary needs: one of our friends is diabetic and couldn&#39;t have anything with simple syrup in it, so she made sure to double check if the drink she wanted had any. It was cool that she was happily willing to take extra steps like that. Or maybe she just thought we were nice enough people and decided not to poison us. Either way, she&#39;s aces in my book.The big selling point for me was the atmosphere. I could best describe it as a modernized 60s art deco theme without all the asbestos. I&#39;ve always thought that was a great look so, naturally, I loved it in there. If you&#39;re a fan of Mad Men then this might be an interesting place for you and your coworkers to stop by during cocktail hour so you can discuss how to build explosives out of canola oil and bow tie pasta just like Don Draper (I&#39;ve never actually seen the show).Whenever you drink at nice hotel bars, you need to expect to shell out a bit of cash. The question is when you order a martini, are you getting a good quality gin, or are they giving you some well junk that was made in one of the hotel bathtubs? I felt the drinks were made in excess of our expectations (to be honest, I ordered a Balvenie on the rocks, so even Ray Charles couldn&#39;t hose that one up, but the others in our party were beyond satisfied with theirs) so while you&#39;ll pay premium prices for a drink, it&#39;s not the watered down budget junk you&#39;d get at Applebee&#39;s.Generally our &#34;Let&#39;s get cocktails at fancy hotel bars&#34; night is comprised of places we try once and probably never return. It&#39;s like going to Delaware; they&#39;re fine places to go . . . once, but there&#39;s nothing spectacular about them that would make us want to go back. However, given the experience we had here, I can see future trips to Travelle a couple more times."

I was not disappointed. It was extremely juicy but had a nice crispy finish. The Mahon cheese (reminds me of Austin Mahone!) and the pickled onions brought some different bright flavors to the combo. There were also dried tomatoes, lettuce, and a secret sauce of some sort. I think it was a pepper aioli. The french fries were well seasoned and on the crispy side, just how I like them. Although it was pricier than my normal lunch, it was such a nice treat on this beautiful day to enjoy a great hamburger. Now it&#39;s time for my food coma!"

From the moment I pulled up to The Langham Hotel in my cab, I knew this place would be luxurious. The doorman came to open my cab door, offer a hand (which I accepted), and politely asked me if I knew where I was going within the hotel. He pushed the rotating door for me, where I was greeted by a hostess.Every individual in that damn hotel was genuinely welcoming and beyond attentive.Anyway, the service at breakfast was (obviously) fantastic. My rich coffee was constantly refilled - a detail many servers forget. The aesthetics of this place was perfect for me: decadent, with lots of neutral tones and a modern feel.I ordered the vegetarian Eggs Benedict option, which included some amazing potatoes covered in arugula, and a side of smoked bacon. The presentation was beautiful, and the generous serving of bacon (like five pieces!) was some of the best bacon I&#39;ve ever had, ever. The Benedict plate was pretty large for my taste, which was fine. Ideally I would have finished the entire thing because it was phenomenal. Yes, this place is a bit pricey, but if you feel like splurging on some breakfast and being pampered, it&#39;s certainly worth it.Oh, and I checked in on Foursquare, which was sent to my Twitter, and promptly received a follow on Twitter and tweet from the hotel, wishing me a pleasant breakfast. Wow! All around great hospitality. I&#39;ll be recommending the hotel to friends and family, simply based on my great experience at Travelle."

I must admit, I am not the world&#39;s largest Italian beef fan. Give me a gyro any day. But every so often I get this compulsion to try it again and see if I&#39;ve discovered the beauty of it yet. So I went down to try Joe Boston&#39;s, a mint green building just a couple blocks from Humboldt Park. It&#39;s an old-timey dive with great counter service.Let&#39;s talk about this sandwich. First, it&#39;s massive and stuffed to the gills with finely shredded beef. The beef was tender and cooked very well. The hot peppers added a really good spicy flavor. The bread was fresh and honestly soft enough to be consumed without extra juice. My problem is with the dip. I&#39;m a big believe in dipped beef sandwiches. At best, they add another layer of beefy flavor, almost like gravy. Sadly, the dip here was mostly oily for some reason. It certainly softened the bread (which didn&#39;t particularly need it), but I think I might have done better without it. It didn&#39;t add flavor, just moisture!If Italian beef or dives are your thing, it&#39;s definitely worth a visit. Otherwise, I probably won&#39;t unless I develop a craving for a massive spicy sandwich."

Tender beef, thinly sliced, amazing au jus, melty cheese, and delicious spicy gardinera (spelling?). I left totally satisfied and super happy that small businesses are still thriving, kicking so much ass, while keeping its roots firmly in the ground."

BIG MISTAKE!!!Up and  Down and Up and Down and Up and Down.....broken axle anyone?  Their parking lot is really an experience unto itself, surprised no one has ever mentioned that in any of their reviews?  Wish I had brought my camera with me, I would&#39;ve filmed it, in an odd way it&#39;s kind of hilarious.Tip: Bring a lifejacket, because if it rains you and your whole family could easily be swallowed up if you&#39;re not careful. So remember to count ALL the kids before exiting the parking lot!As far as their food goes, it&#39;s not really worth it, it was a complete waste of time and money.  The Italian beef sandwich I had on Saturday lacked any kind of beefy flavor to it even with the addition of sweet peppers.  I could hardly see them, let alone taste them, in hindsight though I should&#39;ve brought a magnifying glass just to convince myself they were actually there in the first place!  In other words: chintzy!I think the problem here is they cook the beef all day long, then it becomes dried out and tasteless.  It never really gets busy here, but I noticed it does seem to attract a lot of unsavory characters, probably because they&#39;re located in a desolate neighborhood, off the beaten track.  I wouldn&#39;t exactly call it a family destination... so if you go there you&#39;ll know what I mean!Ambiance: Zero starsMaybe Joe should go back to Boston because this isn&#39;t a real (Chicago) Italian beef, as we know it.  It&#39;s Boston&#39;s version!  So for now I&#39;ll just stick to the old tried and true, Johnnies Beef in Elmwood Park or Portillo&#39;s where they know how to make Italian beef that&#39;s tasty, well seasoned and each order comes complete with a generous amount of green peppers and where the lines are always out the door and where they&#39;ve never lost a customer yet to the abyss!!!"

Just the way I like it...Normally I am a fan of trendy and cool spots that serve fancy cocktails and lively cuisines. However when it comes to beef sandwiches give me the hole in the wall that serves up fat, juicy beef sandwiches all day long. This place embodies Chicago, a real old school joint. It was established to serve the many blue collar workers that worked in the area many decades ago. Those places have mostly left but Boston&#39;s still stands proud catering to a new gentrified crowd.After a rather dissapointing experience with Bari&#39;s beef a few weeks ago it was nice to get back to familiar tastes. The beef just melts in your mouth along with nice peaks of oregano. Good bread that held everything together, i was rather pleased with my beef. This is what a chicago beef should be like. Unfortunately it does NOT unseat Mr. Beef on Harlem as the best beef I&#39;ve ever had. While the flavors were very good a few subtle shortfalls spelled its doom for top spot. There were some nice peaks of oregano but it didn&#39;t explode in my mouth like Mr. Beef.  Also the beefs here are kind of small and not as much beef jammed inside, it seemed like i just took 3 bites and it was gone. Oh BTW, what&#39;s up with those fries (controlled portion)? Are they not the most boring fries ever?  Mr. Beef&#39;s fries are better and more plentiful.Overall a very good beef and the type of place a beef joint should be in. They would make my top 5 beefs list. Just NOT #1."

He packed up my order himself and gave me tips on preparing the beef and using the sternos. I got a pound and a half of beef, gravy, bread pre-cut into party size portions, sweet &amp; hot peppers, sternos, a rack and tray with lid all for $30!

I was initially going to go to Al&#39;s due to several approvals of it from Adam Richman (of Man v. Food fame), but I took to Yelp to see what was said about it. After reading that Al&#39;s was overpriced, undersized, overrated, and underwhelming (among other things), I decided I&#39;d be better off going where the locals seem to go -- Joe Boston&#39;s.For the love of God, thank you. For $7.50, I got a dipped Combo (as recommended) with sweet and hot peppers, fries, and a Sierra Mist, because they were out of Mountain Dew. Damn!Within just a few minutes, I got my food and dug in... it didn&#39;t last long. I ate my sandwich so fast, it was almost gone before my friend got his. It took me until I was a couple bites from finishing when I realized that I didn&#39;t get the hot peppers -- only the sweet. I was slightly miffed, but the beef was so good, I hardly gave a care at all. I will say that the spicy peppers on my Italian beef would have taken me to a high I haven&#39;t been to before in my life with food... and I&#39;m scared of heights. Maybe it&#39;s a good thing they forgot the spicy ones. The fries were hothothot out of the fryer. They had absolutely no salt on them, but I didn&#39;t really miss it... there was plenty of salt in my Combo.Joe Boston&#39;s is the definition of a dive. I&#39;ve learned from many restaurant visits that the dives can often have some of the best food, and Joe Boston&#39;s is no exception to that. The only thing I&#39;m not fond of with Joe Boston&#39;s is its location. Being an out-of-towner, I had no idea what station would be the closest. Looking at a map, it seemed to be the Green Line stop, California. If that&#39;s the closest, that&#39;s awful. I had to walk 1.25 miles through a rundown neighborhood to get to this place! As it turned out by the time I got there, it would have made a hell of a lot more sense to have just driven there and parked in the street. Ah, well... live and learn.Joe Boston&#39;s, I&#39;ll be coming for you the next time I&#39;m in the city -- one of the highlights of my trip, for sure."

You receive your sandwich, sit down and promptly enter a sanctified cathedral of deliciousness. And shortly thereafter, you begin to weep bitterly as you realize that the holy moment has ended.

Joe Boston&#39;s beef is perfectly good, but not as good as Johnny&#39;s to my taste buds. It has to do with the seasoning of the beef. Johnny&#39;s beef is more flavorful. Of course, if I&#39;m in the neighborhood, I&#39;d stop and have a Joe Boston beef without hesitation. Again, the flavor is a matter of personal preference.Service: They don&#39;t have the concept of queueing here, which should be fundamental. People just crowd around the counter and it&#39;s impossible to understand who is next.Atmosphere: It&#39;s a beef stand.

Everyone proclaimed it their new favorite beef. But, what really blew my crew away were the sausages. They had that perfectly crisp/charred outside, and were gone before I had a chance to get seconds.Great fries as well.

Definitely one of the highest quality beefs out there in the world. I like to get mine with hot peppers and dipped so you&#39;ll need to plan on wearing clothes that you can get beef juice on if there&#39;s any drippage (plus your hands will smell like italian beef unless you scrub off a couple layers of skin). There&#39;s so much deliciousness in this sandwich it is difficult to convey. They have a beef, fries and drink combo for $7. This place is (at least the times I&#39;ve been) pretty relaxed and quiet. The fries here leave something to be desired so I would only get them again if I were super hungry or wanted to split them with someone else.

They cook their own meats and trust me I seen this myself since I used to work for them when i was a teenager. other places order their beef precooked and all they have to do is heat it up, not this place, it&#39;s basically made from scratch. The owner is a very straight forward guy, you will rarely see him but most likely it will be in the mornings, and this restaurant is a very friendly place to eat at.now if you are going to be around the north side of Chicago and have a craving for beef&#39;s this is the place to go to. I suggest getting the Combo which is ( beef/ sausage) all in one bread, and make sure they slap on the hot giardiniera  because the sweet peppers will not bring out the full experience of this great crafted sandwich and have it slightly dipped in their gravy,, trust me you will not be disappointed."

Especially with its 4 star rating. My fiancé and I aren&#39;t picky eaters and had our fair share of poor service, which surprises me to have to write such a bad review. We eat at Mexican restaurants, almost weekly (chains &amp; mom and pop restaurants). We were interested in trying this place out.Usually, when asked if this was your first time, detailed explanation about the menu and recommended flavors are offered. The menu explains the flavorings but it sounds complicated. But not this time. The waitor let my fiancé and I sit there puzzled about what to order for over 10 min. He walked past us asking his other tables how they are doing. And one table to the left of me, he blankly asked, can I take this out of your way and give you the check? Whoaa, didn&#39;t even offer dessert yet and he has his customers 1 foot out of the door. The restaurant was almost completely empty, with 1 table left on the other side of the restaurant. So it wasn&#39;t like it was so busy to a point where you need to close tables out to re-open for the next customers.I had chosen 2 entrees incase the waitor would say something I didn&#39;t like on my initial dish. But no, he just took our order without explanation. When we received our entrees, my Mahi Mahi was half drenched in this unappetizing colored spicy sauce. The Mahi Mahi was bland without the sauce. So when I eventually looked past the color and the thoughts that it reminded me of, it was just ok. Nothing fancy like the menu explained, nothing to keep me wanting more.My fiancé&#39;s churrasco wasn&#39;t appetizing either. The sauce was sweet and tangy, flavors he didn&#39;t like. Overall, the flavors of everything, from the salsa for the chips to the sauces that were paired to our entrees were not appealing.This overview of flavors could have been more helpful if the they were explained in details. I also had the Mago-rita Mango and it was disgusting.I usually give restaurants like these a 2nd chance before I even think about writing a review, but I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about how our expensive dinner was a disaster. Never returning and I DO NOT recommend this place."

Our waitress was apologetic though. The food was good--complimentary chips and 3 kinds of salsa were delicious. Chipotle salsa was on point. The taco variety was nice. We got carne asada and al pastor; both were tasty. The arroz rojo was nice and fluffy. They also have little guacamole carts that roll around and make fresh guac for the table--very cool! The tacos aren&#39;t expensive but some menu items run kind of steep. Overall, good up-scale(ish) Mexican food."

The interior design is pretty amazing compared to the older locations and the vibe is amazing. We were seated right away, but it took a good 5 minutes or so until our waitress greeted us and brought us some water. We ordered chicken fajitas that come in the lava rock (not the traditional ones) and a side of the Hispanic corn. The fajitas were decent, but the corn was not good at all. The waitress saw that we didn&#39;t touch the corn and didn&#39;t pack it up to take home, so I&#39;m surprised she didn&#39;t ask us how it was. It would have been nice to get something else instead of a dish that had more cream than the corn itself. Overall, our experience was decent. I will come here occasionally, but will stick to the Arlington Heights location when possible!"

I got the cacahaute mole, and the sauce was really good, but the pork medallions I got it with were dry and tough. They also initially brought me the wrong sides.

Hot and fresh; and alone make it worth coming back. They serve three salsas with them which are also pretty good.  The margarita (up) is pretty solid too.Unfortunately the food was a kind of a let down.  The moles seemed to be a focus, so I went with the more traditional, with peppers and chocolate as the base. Served over top of the half chicken.  The chicken itself didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor which probably would&#39;ve been fine IF the mole stepped up to it.  But it didn&#39;t have any of the deep, rich flavor that you should get from a good mole. Disappointing.The tacos were a-ok. We tried the steak and pastor.I know the restaurant is new, but I&#39;m wondering if maybe their focus is on a few too many things starting off.  The menu is huge and I&#39;m wondering if everything could benefit from scaling back a bit.I was hoping for an upscale Mexican place that I would want to go to without having a theatre ticket in hand.

This is a Mexican Cantina but with a Latin American twist. I had the tortilla chips with 3 of the house made salsas. The first one was Roasted Tomato and Jalapeño which was mild. The second was Fresh made with jalapeño, tomatillo and jalapeño which was medium and the third was Arbon Chile made with sesame seeds which was spicy. I liked the Roasted Tomato and Jalapeño and Arbon Chile. Then I had their Horchata which was not too sweet and it was great. It was their soft opening so they were in testing mode but the Staff still did a great job. The grand opening is on 7/18."

We went not too long after their opening (yes, it&#39;s taken me a few weeks to post this review), so I&#39;m hoping they will smooth out the kinks as they go. We started with a drink at the bar, while we waited for the rest of our friends to arrive. The bartender was friendly, efficient and provided great service...and even though I&#39;m not much of a tequila aficionado, I was impressed with their tequila menu. So...4 stars for the bar experience. Once our friends arrived, we moved to a table for dinner. I liked the chips with the 3 different sauces that they serve, and they came in handy, because service/food arrival was sloooooooooow. Also, the food was kind of hit or miss. Some of the dishes were great....some not so great....and some of them came out very cold, including the classic fajita entrees, which you would expect to be sizzling hot. So....2.5 stars for the dining room/dinner experience. The ambience is great...they really did a good job with the build-out of the space...and the staff was mostly friendly. So, overall, 3 stars, with the possibility to increase based on the success of future visits. I am looking forward to returning and trying again!!!"

The portion sizes were large. The chips and salsa kept flowing... I personally loved their green salsa the most. Overall a very good experience. And it didn&#39;t feel too expensive either. We had recently been to another restaurant in Chicago in River North and had paid about 120 per couple, and here we paid close to 80 per couple for similar orders. Add to that the convenience of free parking for three first 90 minutes and this place feels unbeatable. Highly recommended!"

Decor is very nice and I could see maybe hanging out there for Happy Hour (although we didn&#39;t have nay drinks), but that&#39;s about it.  Entree prices are rather high and since it was our first time, we decided to try a few of the tacos and one of the entrees to get a taste of what they had to offer.  There were 3 of us.  We had the Pastor, Carne Asada, Chorizo &amp; Camaron tacos, the roasted asparagus with chimichurri sauce and the Ropa Vieja (slow braised beef brisket).  Pastor and Chorizo were the best of the tacos, but not great.  Camaron was okay, but the Carne Asada was tasteless ... I don&#39;t even think there was salt and pepper on it.   Meat to tortilla ratio was excellent, but not good.  We would rather make the trip to Pilsen or Chilango on Taylor for tacos.  The braised beef brisket was okay, but for $17 we expected a lot more that just okay.  It was mushy and tasted like bland beef stew.  The roasted asparagus was the actually a dish we really enjoyed though!  The service irritating and strange on many levels.  I don&#39;t understand why the the staff feel the need to clear one person&#39;s plate while others are still eating.  Eventually, it ended up that my husband sat there still eating all by himself while the rest of the table was cleared.  On top of that, the waitress then brought the dessert menus over to me and my mom.  My husband was still eating when the waiter came by and asked if we&#39;d like dessert (never even acknowledging my husband)!  We we said &#34;no&#34;, he immediately turned around and returned with the check.  My husband was still eating!  Then when my husband was actually done, a gentleman came by (we assumed he was a manager because he had seated us) and scooped up my husband&#39;s plate without asking if he was done and came back to clear away the chips and salsa.  Again, he never said a word.  Didn&#39;t ask if we were done, how our meal was, if he could get us anything else .... nothing!  At that point it became clear why the wait staff didn&#39;t know how to do there jobs .... management doesn&#39;t know how to do the job.  Quality of food did not match price points and weird service means we won&#39;t be back."

Ordered a sandstorm plate, which had chicken + beef schwarma and 2 falafel.Pros: All of their entrees held up. Meat was tender and flavorful. Falafel was crispy and not at all bland. Could probably scarf down 10 of those on my own.Cons: The Zam Zam salad was a bit of a let down, and they were a bit skimpy with the hummus. The rice itself was alright(not phenomenal, not terrible, a little dry). For the price($11), expected a bit more in the plate.Verdict: 3.5 stars. Good food, though for the price of the sandstorm I expected a little more(esp on the hummus). That said, would be willing to try again and see if maybe it was just an off day, as the schwarma and falafel(especially the falafel) were quite delicious."

It was the best thing on the plate.Cucumber/tomato salad was crunchy and fresh. Rice was perfect. Steak and chicken both had their positives, but I liked the chicken better.I think my only complaint was that the hummus was a little oily - oil accumulated on top.

I later learned that the delay was the fault of Grubhub rather than Zam Zam, but the owner was very apologetic and offered to comp my next order.

There&#39;s also a sauce poured over all of it - that&#39;s new. I always ordered extra pita because there was more than enough to NEED extra pita.

The food is great and as a vegan I love that the staff is very knowledgeable about veganism and plant-based eating so I never have to worry about my food having animal products in it. I also appreciate that they&#39;re proud of having vegan options and are looking into adding more vegan options in the future.Every vegan or vegetarian definitely needs to get a falafel wrap from this place. Seriously sooo good, so filling, and reasonably priced at under $5.The guys who own it are some of the nicest guys in all of Chicago and they treat their staff well, which is important to me. If supporting small businesses with ethical business practices is important to you, Zam Zam should be on the top of your list of restaurants to frequent.Good vibes at Zam Zam all the time.

I live in Albany park which has a lot of great Middle Eastern options. In fact, I rarely try any spots outside Albany Park cause they usually let me down. I had a craving today and was too far to go home, so I decided to try Zam Zam and I&#39;m glad I did.I had the &#34;Sandstorm Wrap&#34; so I could try a bit of everything (Falafel, Beef, Chicken). It&#39;s essentially a burrito with all three staples, red cabbage, pickles and yogurt sauce. The guy at the register asked if I wanted it spicy which is always a bonus for me. So they threw in some hot sauce.From the one sandwich I had, I can tell they don&#39;t mess around. All three main ingredients were on point. If you&#39;re in the area and want a decent meal, stop at Zam Zam. I will be recommending it to my falafel loving friends!"

I really loved this place when they opened, I still like them, but we don&#39;t order from them multiple times in a week anymore.  Give it a try, hopefully they are on their game that day and cross your fingers that they will deliver when you call... Oh, one nice touch is the sign on the wall that offers free samples for the &#34;unheard of price of...FREE.&#34;  I hope they get back to their 5-star glory days!"

I had been looking forward to eating at this new restaurant since I first noticed their &#34;Coming Soon&#34; sign. Wrigleyville, specifically on Clark St., lacks a good variety of restaurants to choose from. Clark St. is all bar food, and not too far is Taco Bell, McD&#39;s, and Al&#39;s Beef. The one exception is the amazing Big G&#39;s Pizza. Some of the bars have great menu items but they don&#39;t specialize in any one particular kind of food or they are over priced. This is why Zam Zam caught my eye.I walked in just as the Cubs v. Cardinals game was about to start and I was greeted by this very nice young lady. The kitchen is exposed and the entire restaurant looked very clean and very new. The prices for everything on the menu were fair and reasonable for a casual middle eastern restaurant. I ordered the chicken shawarma and the baba ghanoush. I asked the lady when they opened and she replied that it was today! (Sunday, May 4th). I congratulated her and the cook behind the counter.For $11 I got a great serving of the best baba ghanoush I&#39;ve had in Chicago with a nice warm toasty pita bread, a very nice size chicken shawarma sandwich, and a can of coke. The baba ghanoush can easily be shared with another person but I was really hungry so I was able to easily take down the whole meal. The sandwich was packed with fresh ingredients. I noticed some ingredients that I was not used to seeing in a shawarma sandwich like pickles and red cabbage but it made for a really tasty experience and everything had a nice crunch which for me made a big difference. I still had some baba ghanoush that I was able to stuff into my sandwich, and I can&#39;t emphasize how delicious the whole meal really was. The chicken was also very tasty and had a delicious flavor profile. I will definitely be going back to say the least. I hope the people of Wrigleyville welcome this family owned restaurant with open arms.P.S.To the owners:Please make sure you start delivery a.s.a.p. This neighborhood thrives on it and you will see your business grow tremendously!!! List your business on Grubhub&#39;s website because it will really help with getting the word out. You deserve to be noticed. The food will speak for itself!"

They suggested getting everything in the wrap so I obliged. BF got the beef schwarma plate that comes with 2 sides. He got hummus and the Jerusalem salad. I was underwhelmed by the Jerusalem salad, but the beef shwarma was pretty tasty. Everything else was underwhelming. It also took a really long time (15+ min) for our food to come out and there were only 3 other people in the restaurant."

He actually prepared the falafel himself, handed it to me, reached over the counter and shook my hand to thank me for coming before I left.

The falafel comes at a good price, and the shawarma is well seasoned and quite yummy. The food always feels fresh, the pitas are warm, and I always get filled up. They have &#39;the sandstorm&#39; on the menu, and I recommend trying it at least once. Especially as a late-night food, I can imagine it&#39;s amazing.

I ordered a dirty chai that was very smooth and tasty the first few sips but then I realized it was a little too sweet for me. For the record, I have a sensitive sweet tooth, so that&#39;s really up to the individual to decide! I stayed to get some work done and was having a pleasant experience, wondering why the Yelp reviews fluctuated so heavily. There was only one person in there other than me and it stayed that way for the hour or so that I hung around (it was early afternoon), though I did notice one of the employees step outside to look down the street and greet people - not sure if this was friendly &#34;getting some air&#34; habit or he was looking for customers. Not the first time I&#39;ve seen this happen &#39;cause I passed by the cafe earlier this week, too! Hurting for customers? That&#39;s too bad...I liked the music though: it ranged from throwbacks to classics, Etta James to Red Hot Chili Peppers. Free wifi code for the individual and power strips everywhere!The reason I give it 4 not 5 stars has nothing to do with the cafe or food itself or the staff per say, but...After a little bit of being there, I could hear the staff arguing in the kitchen! Not sure what it was about, probably scheduling or something, but I could very clearly feel condescending tones, defensive tones and disagreement involving power differentials. A liiiiiittle off-putting for the atmosphere, enough that I lost concentration on my studies and decided to chug my drink and go. Maybe that wouldn&#39;t have been the case if there were more customers while I was there, and through idle chatter I wouldn&#39;t have heard the kitchen arguments, but that wasn&#39;t the case for my first visit.All this to say that it&#39;s a great place to plug in for wifi, catch some Pokemon (wild Haunter this afternoon), study, read, draw or whatever with some coffee and a warm sandwich if you can swing by Clark Street! I&#39;m gonna give it another chance, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s different with other employees and customers around, but I did come at a weird time in the day and probably an off time for the employees."

Reviews led me here to Aje Cafe.That morning was a cold one, the smells and sounds of coffee creation welcomed me into the warmed space. Sounds of coffees dripping, steam expelling and heating machinery whirring. The interior is exposed brick filled with art and kitchen deco stuffs. (Can&#39;t stress the importance of filling empty walls with stuff. So that sound isn&#39;t bouncing around, it gives an ease to making short calls. Walls busied with stuff that customers may like to buy, stuff that can spark the mind to purchase different cafe goods or stuff that helps a seated customer spark in inspiration to the next sentence of text they&#39;re needing for that morning email.) The cafe offers plenty of seating and suggests refrain from using larger tables unless having a big group.A few were sippin&#39; drinks whilst punching away on keyboards. Expecting a possible rush inside, I scanned the menu ahead of time which is available online. I entered with an idea of what to chomp. Chipotle chicken scrambler sandwich composed of tomato and red onion scrambled into egg w/ chipotle chicken and picante cheese.. it was damn good. Served piping hot, wrapped in a thin sheet wrap of aluminum. I almost couldn&#39;t hold it, but did because I wanted to enjoy it without wait. Paired this with a cafe au lait, which I butchered in pronunciation...  I think I paid just under ten dollars with tax.I&#39;d definitely do the sandwich again, coffee was good but I should probably try something craft in the future."

Other Yelpers have helped me find the best places and avoid the mediocre, and it&#39;s time to pay it forward and advise others about my experience this morning.I moved to Chicago two days ago, excited for all of the hustle and bustle near my apartment. This morning I decided to stop at Aje for food before headed to an appointment down the street. I asked for my order to go as I needed to be there in 15 minutes. While I was waiting for my food I received an email saying the meeting was delayed thirty minutes, in which case I decided to sit and enjoy my food before heading over. As I sat an had a bite or two (barely started) the lady at the counter came over and said &#34;I thought you weren&#39;t staying&#34; and asked if I wanted a plate. When I replied that I had changed my mind, she rolled her eyes again in which case I asked if it was okay that I stayed (something that shouldn&#39;t have to be done, seeing as I just gave them my service and the establishment was 80% empty). She didn&#39;t respond and JUST WALKED AWAY. I went to the counter and asked her, again, if it was okay that I stayed, in which she and the other worker replied that they are &#34;frustrated about how much they spend on takeout containers&#34; which I had received my food in.They made me feel extremely uncomfortable and unwelcome. Remember, I&#39;m new to Chicago- know nobody and anything- and this is my first experience with their service or any in that area. I decided that I would leave mostly for feeling awkward and not because they clearly wanted me to.Perhaps you wouldn&#39;t be stressed over the price of your to-go containers if you treated costumers better and kept them as patrons."

I&#39;ve never looked at the &#34;born on date&#34; on a bottle of soda, and I&#39;m sure most shop owners don&#39;t, but knowing that Aje&#39;s owners are paying attention to these minor details makes me feel good about the products they serve."

Joseph and Anna are fantastic, and make the freshest, tastiest soups and sandwiches (breakfast and lunch) in the city. The atmosphere is perfect to get some work done as well - the wifi connection is flawless (honestly is a deal breaker for me and I&#39;m sure most who work from their laptops all day). It is a true gem in the Lakeview area - be sure to stop in! On top of all of that, it is the definition of wonderful small business - the support for these operations is as important as anything!"

Been looking forward to checking out Cafe in the city since my Europe trip couple months back.Atmosphere was how it should be for small Cafe shop, trendy but with vintage style, free wifi, and good tea/coffee options.I ordered the Pesto Turkey panini (switch to Salsalito Turkey) with Sriracha mayo along with home made pasta on the side.  Combination of flavor and crispness of panini made it a perfect meal. Adding the Peanut-butter and chocolate chip cookie also helped.  hahaIf you are driving i don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have an issue find a street parking."

They do personal requests (I asked for extra spinach) which I really appreciated. I feel like it&#39;s hard to find a solid veggie wrap/sandwich that actually tastes good in Chicago and this place nailed it. I didn&#39;t really talk to the girl who took my order but she was nice and polite. I will most definitely be  back.

I was looking for a new place to get a bite to eat and also stay for a few hours to get some work done.I tried out the prosciutto cheddar panino on their menu, which came with a choice of sides - can&#39;t remember what the others were, but I got the fruit salad. The sandwich was AWESOME. Hot, melty, and all the ingredients were fresh. Also a great combination of textures and flavors. Get this. It&#39;s really good. The fruit salad was also great - plums and pears in a fruit salad?! Say goodbye to your boring, run-of-the-mill strawberry-and-apple fruit salads.I got an iced chai latte later on too - wasn&#39;t a huge fan of this. It tasted okay, but I&#39;ve had better at other cafés.The elusive fifth star is because service is pretty standoffish - nobody was rude, but nobody was particularly pleasant either. The two people behind the counter did not seem to want to be there in the slightest. I generally don&#39;t care too much about service (i.e. I don&#39;t need a lot of waiting on), but a smile/general human pleasantries go a long way.Wifi worked well and the atmosphere was nice and quiet for getting some work done.

Each sandwich does come with a very yummy side. I&#39;ve tried both the fruit salad and the homemade pasta. Despite the extremely delicious sandwiches and quaint atmosphere, the staff is pretty rude and standoffish. For this reason, I decided to give this cafe four stars.

I&#39;ve passed this place many times walking by on Clark and I went in last week for breakfast. It was empty, although it was about 9:30 on a Friday morning.I ordered the San Diego breakfast sandwich and a cup of tea which was served in a large yellow mug that would have made the Mad Hatter and March Hare proud. My sandwich was ok- I wouldn&#39;t order it again. The tea was fine.I ate there and sat at the small couch by the windows. They do have wifi but I&#39;m not sure how long I would hang out here because I didn&#39;t think there were too many comfortable chairs. I ordered a sandwich to go to have later for lunch. I liked this sandwich a lot, which is good because I chose the make-your-own option. These sandwiches come with a side as well which I think is pretty good value. I chose the pasta salad which was quite good.One petty thing that irked me is the sign taped to the register that said something like: remember to bring cash next time. I get it. It&#39;s a small business and they don&#39;t want to pay fees to the Visa, etc if they don&#39;t have to... but that&#39;s what many people choose to do these days. I think it would come across less condescending if it said something like: as a small local business, cash payments are greatly appreciated. Or something like that.I would go back again to choose my own sandwich. Other than that... probably not."

Two years after my first review with a few visits in-between and Aje Cafe is still 5 stars. I&#39;ve come to know these owners &amp; there&#39;s no way they treated anyone with the level of disrespect they&#39;re being accused of without being provoked. Every time I walk in here I&#39;m usually looking like a mess, hungover and they still enthusiastically greet me and provide perfect service. See my last post: you act like a punk, you&#39;re going to be treated like a punk. Good for them for not taking bull.Also, tried out the bacon cheddar bfast sandwich and of course it was amazing-- just the right amount of ingredients and all of the highest quality. It&#39;s also not swimming in butter/grease so you don&#39;t feel THAT guilty about the bacon. Joseph (owner) is killing it on the grill. I never had to wait more than 5 mins for anything, and who cares anyway when you&#39;re getting quality food? I&#39;m actually blown away that only Joseph and his wife run this place.

She had 4 large bags with her, which I had left with her so I could run a quick errand up the block, so she asked if she could stay and hang out for another 5 minutes while he closed up while her boyfriend came back to help her with her bags.The man working said, quote, &#34;I&#39;m F***ING TIRED of this S***, get out right now,&#34; quite aggressively, then said something about &#34;working a hundred hours a week.&#34; When I returned to the cafe, she was sitting on the doorstep of the shop next door, on the verge of tears.My girlfriend is a kind, quiet, introverted girl who likes to read and spend her time in libraries (she had been reading Nabokov in Aje Cafe) - think Belle from Beauty in the Beast, if she had to be a Disney princess - so I know she would not have asked for 5 minutes rudely or aggressively. And worse, the man inside was still behind the counter cleaning when I arrived, so she would not have prevented him from leaving the cafe by staying.I&#39;ve been to Aje Cafe many times, and the staff has always generally unpleasant and unhappy, but the food was always alright, so whatever, no big deal. But this was unacceptable.There&#39;s a Peet&#39;s Coffee &amp; Tea literally a block north on Clark Street, and everyone there is always VERY friendly and the atmosphere is just as cozy (and always cleaner) than at Aje Cafe. If you go just a few blocks further north to Belmont, then you&#39;ll find Kickstand Espresso Bar, which serves superior coffee and has a much friendlier vibe. Go to either of these places.There is no reason to support Aje Cafe and its ungrateful, unfriendly staff. Go elsewhere."

I ordered a prosciutto caprese panini and the classic smoothie. Both were good; the ingredients seemed fresh, and the food seemed reasonably priced.The customer service needs improvement. When I walked in, no one greeted me. I looked at the menu, decided what I wanted, and walked up to the cashier. After about a minute of silence, I smiled and she asked me &#34;what do you want?&#34; in an unfriendly tone. Later, when I asked for a cup for water, she rudely replied &#34;give me one second.&#34; On one hand, I noticed they were busy and only had two workers: a middle aged man working in back, preparing most of the food and a middle aged woman at the cashier. I&#39;ve worked at restaurants too, so I can understand having a bad day, but this is no excuse for poor customer service. They should still take the time to greet their customers. For example, if you&#39;re too busy to take a customer&#39;s order right away, all that&#39;s needed is a smile, eye contact, and a quick &#34;Hi! We&#39;ll be right with you&#34; or  &#34;we&#39;re really busy right now, but we&#39;ll be with you in __ minutes.&#34; I understand no one is perfect, but that&#39;s the customer service model that any business should strive for.Note, today was my first experience at Aje.I might give the place a second chance and come back for the food, but it wouldn&#39;t be my first choice after this first impression."

Maybe I just hit it at a bad time, at a around 4:15 or 4:30 on a Saturday. The man and the woman at the counter were not particularly friendly at all. And by 5 pm, they were already pulling in the sidewalk signs. (I even asked if they closed at five rather than six; since they seemed like they were closing up shop). They certainly weren&#39;t too excited about the remaining customers; they seemed to just want to get the hell out of there. At Starbucks, I expect people to think it&#39;s a j-o-b, but not at a locally-owned coffee shop.One thing that&#39;s starting to perturb me more and more is places that have minimums for credit cards. Sure it cuts into your margin, the most it could be is 20 cents on a $4.00 drink. I get it. That&#39;s a lot of margin lost. But it&#39;s 2014, people. Cash is going by the way of the dinosaurs. Charge $4.25 instead and keep your expenses to yourself. Or accept payment by phone. Otherwise, put a sign on the bathroom saying how many sales per square foot you&#39;re losing, charge extra for the refrigeration for any juice or iced drink, put a price tag on each piece of furniture in the place... All of these are business costs. Shouldn&#39;t I get a discount on the ATM fee if I pay cash? Then there&#39;s the sign that says you can only get a wi-fi password if you buy a medium or larger drink. I get it, and I usually tip well in coffee shops. I know that the owners aren&#39;t Wall Street bankers. But it really cheapens the experience. Question: Did you do the math before you opened this place to make sure your were in the right business?I will say that the mocha was delicious. I liked the mix of comfy chairs and a couch, as well as traditional tables. Good music at a reasonable volume.I&#39;ll always support local coffee shops. But I expect them to be more-friendly than a Starbucks, and I&#39;m always surprised when they&#39;re not."

I was driving through the area when I realized I was starving, and a cafe with wi-fi seemed like the perfect choice. This place can be hard to find because it&#39;s tiny (and pretty hidden amongst the surrounding businesses) but I scored a meter right out front and made my way inside! I knew right away it had everything I needed: outlets, comfortable chairs, a quiet atmosphere, and a nice-sized menu.The thing about this place (at least during the day) is that it&#39;s not just quiet... it&#39;s VERY quiet. It&#39;s got a hardcore work atmosphere going, and while that suited me just fine, I can see how it might be too quiet for those trying to have a conversation. I bet at night or more towards lunchtime it gets a little more lively. No complaints here, just a heads up. I gladly sat there working to soft Christmas music while drinking a white hot chocolate!Ohh, yes. My white hot chocolate. WHC. Love of my life. Whatever you want to call it. It was made so perfectly with a gorgeous little design on top, and it tasted like every fantastic vanilla ice cream I&#39;ve ever had steamed into one cup. I also ordered the grilled chicken wrap, which had a ton of fresh vegetables that were cut up right before my eyes. It was a healthy meal that left me feeling great and relaxed.The best part about this place is the owner and his employees. These people are just flat out nice. They brought everything out to me, asked how everything was, and someone even asked me if I wanted a glass of water. So refreshing to see people going above and beyond and enjoying what they&#39;re doing!I grabbed a blueberry muffin to go and I can&#39;t wait to have it later. Stop by this place to work on your laptop, grab lunch or dinner, or to experience a life-changing white hot chocolate. You won&#39;t be mad you did!"

For a busy neighborhood filled with young people, we were expecting a hectic atmosphere., especially on one of the first warm days during a Cubs game and Blackhawks game We were presently surprised when we came there to find a comfortable, peaceful, and welcoming environment. The sandwiches and coffee are really good. You get a good sized portion for a reasonable price. The food was very fresh. The service is very good too. I am planning on coming back soon. I recommend everyone give this place a visit."

The tea comes in a cute cup and a tea holder cup ( I think it&#39;s a super cute presentation). It&#39;s a good quiet work from home spot.

In. The. Hell???  AND, I got the wrong sandwich.  The food was still good for what it was, but 45 MINUTES for breakfast sandwiches???  That is ridiculous.  And the cashier/server just is not pleasant.  Not one smile, just not pleasant.  I know you&#39;re busy, and that&#39;s hard work, but busy = money, so act like your glad you have customers instead of acting put out.  This one bad experience won&#39;t keep us away, but another one will.  Get it together."

Based on first impression though, I don&#39;t understand why their rating is so high. The customer service my boyfriend and I received was a little below average. I would have given this place three stars for the drinks were at least decent, and that&#39;s just it... The place was A-OK. It certainly wasn&#39;t &#34;top notch&#34; as implied by their current 4.5-star rating. Perhaps it was an off-day?I ordered an oolong tea (Rishi brand). I had a hard time deciding which teas I wanted, and luckily there were no customers behind us so I took my time in deciding. My boyfriend, on the other hand, ordered coffee. We sat down and proceeded to do some work on our laptops. My tea came within 5 minutes, but my boyfriend&#39;s coffee never came. Around the 10 minute mark, my boyfriend was annoyed and he went up to inquire about his coffee. When he came back to the table, he informed me that the cashier gave him attitude. Strange. His coffee came to us 5 minutes later.Aje is a nice, quiet place to do work. The coffee shop despite offering free wifi wasn&#39;t bustling with customers. In fact, it was quite empty on a late weekend afternoon, which I found a bit strange on Clark Street, one of the most happening streets in Lakeview Chicago.... but I suppose it wasn&#39;t so strange given our customer service experience. I mean, really, who wants to wait 15 minutes for coffee? Imagine if they&#39;re this slow with drinks, how much slower would they be with the sandwiches? I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to know, but it&#39;s nice knowing that a quiet, relatively empty coffee shop is across the street whenever I want to work."

I ended up ordering a panini with prosciutto, basil. red onion, and pesto. It was delicious and served with a small side of homemade pasta salad. Definitely a good lunch; the portions weren&#39;t overwhelming and the prices were reasonable.

A bunch of people were on their laptops (we later found out they were part of a novel writing group). They were all spread out, and took up way more space than they should have.We walked in at the same time as another person, who ended up leaving due to the lack of space. One of the employees at Aje was very rude to the customer, when she made a remark about there not being enough space for her group, he told her &#34;whatever.&#34; I was a little shocked! I felt like they should have forced the group of people to consolidate and not take up the whole cafe. Most of them weren&#39;t even eating/drinking anything when we came in (but I guess they could have been earlier). We were lucky to snag the last table.The menu looks great, lots of options, reasonable prices. I ordered a pesto panini, and my Grandma ordered the Caribbean salad. I was very turned off by the fact that the guy (the same one who spouted &#34;whatever&#34;) did not use gloves when preparing our food. The food tasted great though, all of the ingredients were fresh and yummy. I liked the fruit salad that came with my sandwich. The salad was large, and my Grandma liked it.Afterwards we split a delicious cookie!

This is exactly the kind of place to stop in on a lazy afternoon or a blistery evening and get a quick soup/salad/sandwich of comfort, come home, pour some wine, sit on the couch, and pass out watching HGTV. Not that I have any experience doing any of the above.Keep an eye out for Aje. It&#39;s on a very busy stretch of Clark that&#39;s beset with boutiques, bookstores, realtors, lions, tigers, and bears. There&#39;s a lot going on and it&#39;s easy to overlook the cafe. While there are no dancing chickens or neon signs to lure you in, the food will definitely bring you back. While I wanted to go with the strawberry turkey sandwich (just for the novelty of eating a strawberry sandwich), I opted for the California Turkey. Served on your choice of bread (multigrain) and side (fruit salad; I had to have some strawberries), this bad boy comes with turkey, creamy avocado, tomato, cucumber, cheddar cheese, and light ranch dressing. I&#39;ve had a lot of sandwiches in my day but this may have been one of my favorites. The flavor profiles weren&#39;t ground-breaking, but the portion allocation and flavor combinations really worked for me.My sandwich was made by the owner who engaged me in conversation, asked how I&#39;d heard of his cafe, what I liked eating, and what i should order. He was very proud of what he had going on and extremely interested in gaining a new customer. Sadly, one doesn&#39;t have owner interactions like that all too often. It was a nice experience. While I waited on him to fresh-make my sandwich, I had time to look over the menu. From pastries to smoothies to paninis, Aje hits all the cafe buttons. Add to the strong menu, a comfortable space perfect for working on your laptop, having a meal with a friend or drinking a coffee and reading a book, and you have the makings of a perfect light meal destination in any season (which may be a given day in Chicago).P.S. He talked me into getting a cookie. It was big. It was chocolatey. It added to my truffle shuffle choreography. I regret nothing."

The other friend who made a purchase went to use the bathroom. Finally, the last friend went towards the bathroom and the owner or manager told him it wasn&#39;t a &#34;f*cking public bathroom&#34;, he then continued his rant, eventually turning his attention towards me. Further escalating the situation, he called me a piece of sh*t just for using a toilet without a purchase, swearing and yelling at me and my party (in front of customers, no less). At this point I had not yet uttered a word. I Interrupted his unrelenting tirade with &#34;hey f*ck you, we&#39;re leaving!&#34;, as I walked the last few feet out the door. He charged after me, out the door, onto the sidewalk and got in my face and asked if &#34;I wanted to start something&#34;. Since I wasn&#39;t going to hit him, and his efforts to provoke me to do so were fruitless, he eventually went back in. I&#39;m shocked at how little it took for someone to abandon all professionalism and threaten people in his store, not to mention the shock of anyone invading my personal space like that, ready to hit me. As guests we were not unruly or rude. What was that display of aggression for?  Unreal."

FORTY SEVEN U.S. DOLLARS. The burger was decent but most definitely not a $20 burger. Second, I rode my bike here to meet friends and realized when I arrived that I had forgotten my bike lock. I went in and politely asked if it was ok to bring my bike inside and stash it somewhere out of the way while we ate. The restaurant was about 1/3 full and there were at least 10 places where it would have been out of everyone&#39;s way. But they said no. It&#39;s ok to bring in gigantic baby strollers, but a bike? No way!So I will not be going back and I recommend you skip this place. You&#39;re not missing anything."

Thankfully it still tasted well in combination with the other meats but could have been easily a 5 star burger if it wasn&#39;t over cooked. The fries were well cooked to my liking nice and crispy. The chorizo Mac and cheese were something else -wow! It was good but it was  filling. Could have gotten that by itself. But hey we&#39;re from out of town and needed to try.They have roughly 32 beers on tap which is awesome and tv screens all around for game days. We brought kids with us and hey enjoyed it as well.

Despite them being overwhelmed by Lolla jerks like me, we had great and attentive service.I had been to Burger Bar on the north side and am happy to report the quality is just as good here. I built my own burger, keeping it fairly simple with lettuce, tomato and cheddar, and it was fantastic. The sweet potato tots were a little soggier than I had hoped, but still: they were sweet potato tater tots, so how can you complain too much?The beer list is excellent as well.

This needs to sit at the front of the review because this is the reason you should come and what you should talk about afterwards. The rest of the experience is also very good, but the burgers are everything.My wife doesn&#39;t eat beef and burger places sometimes disappoint her, even though a turkey burger can be great. She got an amazing chicken burger with nice truffle fries. I got a special. It was a half pound Angus burger with an 8 oz steak as a burger topping. It was delicious and cooked exactly how I wanted.The location in the Loop lends itself to leaving the doors open and letting in a nice breeze. The place was lively at 8pm on a Friday without being packed. The waitstaff was very helpful and noticeably charming.I was not very happy with the beer selection. It was more interesting to the darker and hoppier side, but if you like lagers and pilsners, the choices were big brands like Blue Moon. I had a new and interesting cider and the beers I found were good. I just wish there was more selection for people who don&#39;t want super bitter beer. My wife got a bourbon vanilla milkshake that was very nice, though.I also had the fried pickles. They were good, though not a strong pickle taste. It was really about the breading and the sauce.That epic burger, the good fries, really good staff and the nice location made for a very good experience."

I ordered a 5 Rabbits draft and my partner ordered a Revolution.  Both beers arrived at our table at slightly below room temperature. On such a warm day, a nice cold beer would have hit the spot but we were served lukewarm beer which was not good. I ordered the grass fed burger with cheddar and bacon. It was barely okay. It&#39;s obvious they &#34;flame grill&#34; on a natural gas grill because you can really taste the gas. It&#39;s basically a slightly better Whopper. Fries were decent though. But the warm beer and subpar burger pretty much made up our minds that we won&#39;t be coming back. I&#39;d rather walk a further up Michigan to Shake Shack.

You can choose between salad, fries, sweet potato fries, or chips for a side. I actually highly recommend the salad if you&#39;re trying to eat clean - *hint* choose the red wine vinaigrette.Although the BYO burger was good, I recommend you going for their specialty burgers instead. The buffalo bill burger was WOW. The tomato chutney, goat cheese, and arugula packed a nice and original punch to the gamey bison patty.The atmosphere is great, it&#39;s very trendy with HDTVs all over.

First, I got to the restaurant around 10pm. My friends and I were starving and although the restaurant wasn&#39;t very busy, the hostess told us there was a 20 minute wait. So we waited while table after table opened up. We asked the hostess if we could just be seated at a table we didn&#39;t mind waiting, since the windows near the door were open and it was cool out. We were told that they were understaffed so she isn&#39;t able to seat those tables.Rule #1, don&#39;t tell the guest you are understaffed. Then about 2 seconds after that a table walked right in and was seated, obviously they knew the hostess. Rule #2, if you are going to serve your friends as VIPs at least be slick about it.So we were seated and our server was very nice and took our drink orders, bringing them out quickly. We put in an order for fried pickles and the chorizo chips. The housemade chips themselves were delicious. My friends found the chorizo on top weird. I liked the flavors, but it was rather difficult to eat and the oil from the chorizo became a pool for the chips, causing them to be rather soggy.We then ordered our burgers. I had the one with pulled pork and Andouille. It was good, but it definitely didn&#39;t knock my socks off like I had been told it would. I will say though that their fries were pretty spectacular.Another strange sidenote was that right after we placed our order for dinner, our server informed us that the kitchen would be closing in 10 minutes (it was 10:30 on a Saturday night) and did we want to order anything else. Since we came in with the mindset of getting boozy milkshakes, we assumed those came from the bar, not the kitchen. Long story short, we were wrong....now we know."

The person who brought our food out walked off before I could ask for silverware. Hard to eat a side salad without a fork.So how was the burger? Cold. Yup. So I boxed it up and took it home to microwave. Just a bad experience all together. They were pretty busy so I&#39;ll give them that.In terms of taste-it was ok. The gyro burger was different but who wants a cold burger on a dry bun? My husband liked his blue cheese burger but it was also cold.

Madison asked us how we were doing, what we were craving, and gave us the best, most honest and accurate suggestions of the menu. The food came quickly and tasted amazing. I&#39;m going to keep taking her suggestions on burgers, wings and drinks because there&#39;s always something I haven&#39;t tried that tastes better than the last. Madison was extremely knowledgeable about beer, down to the hops and ingredients, and had the menu memorized to the point where she didn&#39;t have to write it down. (We ordered a LOT of food, too!)The best part I noticed is that our bartender served everyone else with the same zest and authenticity as us. She was incredibly patient and helpful to new customers and tourists around us. I can&#39;t imagine the difficult sports and entertainment crowds they have to deal with, sometimes unexpectedly, but have no doubt she treats everyone with the same respect and care!I&#39;ve been a few times before, but just couldn&#39;t let her hard work and dedication go unappreciated! This woman is very good at her job and happens to be one of the main reasons I plan to keep coming back."

They have a wide variety of beer selections that were reasonably priced.I had the backyard classic with bacon, lettuce, red onion, and tomatoes. The bacon was just one thick piece and it was candied, I think, but I wasn&#39;t a fan and you couldn&#39;t have the bacon in every bite of burger. I ended up taking the bacon off the burger, and I&#39;m usually not one to reject bacon. The truffle fries were really delicious but the urban sauce (some mixture of ketchup and mayo) was meh.My boyfriend had the firehouse with sweet potato fries. He reports that it was pretty good and seemed to really like the chipotle sauce. I snagged a sweet potato fry with lime crema and it was delicious.The service was decent, but they didn&#39;t refill water the whole time we were there, which wasn&#39;t great.All in all, pretty good burgers and it&#39;s going to be pretty hard to live above this burger place and not consume my body weight in burgers."

Conveniently located just about a block from the Roosevelt Red, Green, and Orange line station, it&#39;s a great central happy hour location. If you&#39;re driving, you&#39;ll have to park at least a block away, but it&#39;s kinda worth it.The space is a lot bigger than it appears from the outside and is not too small for a group. The staff is super friendly, the place is clean, with typical bar decor.The menu is reasonably priced and accessible. They have a pretty good beer list, they have beer flights, and a full bar. I was very excited to try the burgers. They have beef, veggie, and turkey burgers which made me happy. They have some pre-designed burgers that are listed as beef but you can substitute with turkey or veggie burger patties. You can also build your own burger and they have some pretty good options. I chose a turkey burger with bacon, and was really happy to find that the burger was well seasoned and delicious and my bacon was crispy. I didn&#39;t have the French fries, so next time I go that will definitely be my side of choice."

I got the shrimp burger, which was a bit of a ballsy move (I mean... shrimp burger?)... it was interesting, it tasted good, weird texture but I ate the whole thing!

You can smell the burgers cooking on their grill when you walk by outside. Their big garage doors open onto Michigan Ave where a nice breeze comes through. We had their fried pickles - which were awesome with the Urban Sauce. The housemade crispy pork belly chips were outstanding. We weren&#39;t overly adventurous with our burger - but Backyard Burger was so juicy and tasty like a burger from a backyard cookout where the guy on the grill knows what he&#39;s doing. And the slab of candied bacon on top was sooooooo good. Our server was really attentive and helpful with answering menu questions. Can&#39;t wait to go back.

It wasn&#39;t very crowded (im sure due to the weather that day). Service was fairly quick, however not the best. By this i mean our server was polite and somewhat attentive, my thing was i like to be asked if we had ever been there and get some suggestions. Maybe this wasn&#39;t the case because it&#39;s a burger &#34;bar&#34;. All in all my experience was good and the food tasted great!FOOD: We started off with appetizers (bratwurst corn dogs) tasted great along with dipping sauce. My boyfriend ordered their burger of the month. I took a bite and it was very yummy and spicy. I ordered a grass fed burger with provolone cheese and lettuce, tomatoes &amp; red onion. I like to keep things simple. Along with their sweet potatoes fries. Very good and filling. I stuck with water because i don&#39;t drink. However my boyfriend ordered one of their beer&#39;s (don&#39;t remember which one) but he had no complaints.DECOR/ATMOSPHERE - Nice decor and atmosphere. Feels like a bar low key &amp; chill. Seemed clean from what i saw.$$$ - It&#39;s about average pricing for a good steak burger.STAFF/SERVICE - i pretty much explained this above. I dislike judging from a first experience from one person because everyone is different. People have off day&#39;s, people have different attitudes and personality&#39;s etc. I don&#39;t judge harshly so i overlook this type of things most of the time unless it is a really bad experience. That is why i still rated this 5 stars. I like to look at the overall picture of my experience and if positive outweighs the negatives then I&#39;m sold."

I found this place on yelp and when I asked my friend if it was good (I have been looking for a great burger). She said her husband really enjoyed it and that was good enough for me so we decided to eat here. I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. It oozes the dive bar vibe which makes you know what you eat is going to be great. The day we went was great out so the windows were open and there was a cool breeze coming in. We asked to sit by the window and they had no problem accepting our request. Overall great atmosphere and service.The first thing we ordered was beer. While I don&#39;t know the extent of their draft menu, I saw some things on their beer list I haven&#39;t seen other places. Now keep in mind I like sweet beers so I always enjoy a beer that has fruit accents. They had a full list of summer beers with different flavors. They had pear, watermelon, blueberry, peach sour... the list goes on. I have Summer Shandy often so I decided to try one of the more unique flavors. Watermelon made the cut and it was yummy, but my friend ordered a raspberry beer and that was by far my favorite.The burgers were amazing. I got the hey shortay which had short rib on top of a very delicious burger. The flavor was great. In fact, I finished my entire burger (dont&#39; judge) and those portions are huge. One friend got the Wild Bill. She was a little nervous about trying bison for the first time, but it came recommended by our waiter. She was very happy with her decision saying it was really great. My other friend got the high hog which is pulled pork on top of a burger. While she only ate half, she kept saying how yummy it was. She took the rest home to share with her dad.Next time I plan on trying the truffle fries and one of their boozy milkshakes. I wanted to try a milkshake this time, but I was so full I decided against it. I had a great time here and plan on brining my boyfriend here."

The bar had solid ambiance - tons of TVs  broadcasting college football, lots of fans, big bar area, and a great burger list. It is a longer walk to Soldier than you might think - about 20 minutes depending on your pace / luck with lights.Beer list was pretty solid - lots local (Chicago &amp; Midwest) beers on draft and in bottles. My server let me try a few beers to help me decide, which is always a plus. Prices were a bit high, but the place is on Michigan Ave and walking distance to Soldier, so they can get away with it.We ordered the Hot &amp; Smokey with truffle fries and the Santa Fe Salad. The Hot &amp; Smokey was served exactly as I ordered it and was a massive undertaking. The main flavors ended up being the BBQ glaze and the cucumber-onion slaw. The slaw was piled on thick, burying the Tillamook cheddar (and its flavor, sadly). The burger overall wasn&#39;t hot as the name suggests, which was a little disappointing. The flavors were more underwhelming than I expected, especially with the lack of heat and lack of cheddar goodness. The truffle fries were seasoned perfectly - salty goodness that was definitely worth the extra $1. Unfortunately, a lot of my fries were overdone. And  I didn&#39;t order it, but $2 extra for sweet potato tots? Come on. It&#39;s cheaper to add chicken to a salad ($1).The salad was large, served with 2 small bowls of the chili-lime vinaigrette on the side. The dressing was flavorful, albeit a bit spicy (even for my dad who loves spice), beware! It was your basic &#34;Mexican style&#34; restaurant salad - a good option if you&#39;re not wanting to tackle one of their gigantic burgers.The manager popped by our table to check in on our dining experience and seemed genuinely concerned about making sure that everyone&#39;s table was being taken care of properly. Very customer-oriented and friendly!If I was in this area, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to try this spot again, but it didn&#39;t  take over my top burger spots in Chicago list."

Well I still bat an eye....but hope the taste/quality is at least worth it. I wish it was a few dollars cheaper, but overall I got close to my moneys worth. I went with the lamb burger (house made lamb sausage, manchego cheese, mint chimmichuri (yum!), spinach, tomato-onion salsa. I thought the chimmichuri and tomato-onion salsa definitely provided a unique taste and the lamb sausage was tender and juicy. For a $1.00 I upgraded my side of fries to truffle fries and they were pretty good, although I wouldn&#39;t have mind if they were a little less crunchy. My friend and her boyfriend ate a big meal the previous night (so don&#39;t judge), but they just went with the cobb salad and sweet potato tater tots which they enjoyed.

At first I was unsure of the size of their burgers (that&#39;s never stopped me before) and whether it was smart to go for a Elk Burger (it was my first time trying elk!)It ends up that the Elk was cooked to perfection, as recommended by the server due to the dryness of elk if overcooked. It was also the perfect size and all the condiments were in perfect harmony! Also, the sweet potato fries were not overwhelming-ly heavy and the perfect portion of them were served. My friends and I also ended up splitting a oreo milkshake, which thankfully they split 3-ways and was the perfect end to the meal.

The burger was very yummy and a good size, I couldn&#39;t finish it all. But, what made the meal exceptional was the fried pickles! I am a big fan of fried pickles and have tried them from various places, these are by far the best fried pickles I have ever had. They were so yummy, and didn&#39;t have the unhealthy taste that other fried pickles sometimes have. They were clean and yummy and a perfect appetizer. Overall the service was great , the restaurant was nice looking, and the food was very very good. Hubby and I will have to stop here again sometime"

So that contributed to the problem, plus it was below 0 outside.  Anyway let&#39;s get to why were are here.Beer list was great.  I will enjoy it more when the garage doors are open.So we had wings and fried pickles to begin and the wings far out shined the pickles.  I think the fried pickles are pre fried or maybe that was just last night with the event coming on because we forgot to order or the bartender didn&#39;t hear me either way the wings come out, I ask about the pickles and they show up 2 or 3 mins later luke warm.  Now wings are smoking hot, I mean smoking, I am sure the place being a little on the cold side helped with seeing the smoke, and the pickles you could eat as soon as they came out.Burger, burgers, and more burgers.  Lots of options here and I like options.  But went with make my own of Grass Fed burger, friend onion strings, bacon and cheese, ended up being just under $20.  Burger was good,, not that best but good. Cooked perfect and everything came out as ordered.  Came with fresh cut fries.My buddy got a basic cheeseburger and ordered truffle fries, that he said they were outstanding.I think between the combination of the cold inside and outside, put a damper on the experience, but i will be back as their mug club option ($40) is an awesome idea.  So I can see a 4 or maybe 5 star in the future.keep it up Burger Bar and open one of these in the 60640 zip code, we could use a burger craft beer place."

Anyone driving, parking will be a nightmare.Beer - there is a pretty wide selection of craft beers on tap and bottles. Certainly 5 stars for varietyTVs- plenty of TVs make for a great venue to watch some games and drink some beers.Food - now here is where I give 3 stars. In the day and age of gourmet burgers and not to mention 5 guys down the street, I certainly was underwhelmed by the $12 burger. Yes, you have some serious toppings on the stack burgers but the actual burger was meh. We asked to get ours medium rare and the server insisted that we go with medium since their medium has a pink center. Yup, medium got too dry!!All things said I would come back for beer and apps but will walk a block and get my burger at 5 Guys!"

Stopped by for an early lunch and was not disappointed. We tried 4 different burgers and split them all since there were so many that sounded good. My personal favorites... the hot &amp; Smokey,second favorite was the Fire House, followed by the not so stout stacker. Everything was good the sweet potato tots, sweet potato fries, truffle fries as well as the regular fries. Would suggest you not miss the blue cheese bacon chips. These were soooooo good! Arrive was great and they even gave us suggestions for good places to go in the area. Don&#39;t miss this place it was delicious!!!"

I was pleasantly surprised, they have phone charger plugs right under the bar, so while you have a good time, your phone is charging. Steve made our group feel like we were family, nothing better than a service like that, he also gave us some complementary chicken wings to try and let me tell you, you will forget about BWW or Hooters or whatever other chicken wing place, so crunchy on the outside, but so juicy at the same time, the sauces are bomb! I had the get-in-my-belly burger, medium rare, it basically just melted in my mouth, just heaven on a bun, no other way to put it.

We talked in just after 5:00 or so and was seated immediately. The staff were pleasant and efficient.I wasn&#39;t feeling particularly adventurous so I decided to build my own burger. I stuck to the basics and just went the burger, lettuce and tomato route. I ordered the half pound angus burger and it turned out to be more than enough food. I actually had a hard time finishing it. The burger was decent. It wasn&#39;t the best burger I&#39;ve ever eaten but it was good enough for me to be a return customer. I liked the fries too.The burger was only $10 which is more than decent for the area. My only complaint is that the restaurant was a little loud. We had to practically yell to ear each other over the other patrons and loud music. But I guess that&#39;s to be expected in a bar on a Saturday night."

All of our burgers were fantastic I got the tri tip stacker. So good. You can customize your own burger as well. Ask for their &#34;special sauce&#34; to dip your fries in. Milkshakes are also good and they have unique flavors to try.  We were gonna try the bacon bourbon cheesecake shake but we were too full by the end to even think about more stuff to fit in our stomachs.

(IF it ever warms, up that is... ;-)My only take away star is for their veggie burger. Yea, yea, yea.. I know this is a &#39;burger bar&#39; but nowadays there are plenty of vegetarians out there and restaurants should be able to serve a tasty veg burger.. I&#39;ve been to many establishments in the city that make a mean one.. however, the Burger Bar is not one of them.. I cut into it and it had a white/pal shade??!  WTH is it made of?? Perhaps rice.. maybe garbonzo beans, I guess.. I&#39;m not quite sure..  ? The taste was awful though.  I hope they can find another supplier for the veggie burgers because it was simply, horrible tasting. With that being said, the sweet potato fries that came with it, were excellent.Seems like a cool spot.. will definitely be back.. and will become a regular if they can fix my animal friendly burger. :  )"

I fell in love with the Lincoln Park location many years ago over their fantastic chicken wings. Now my love affair continues with the new South Loop location.The South Loop area is exploding with many new restaurants and this location stands out like a gem with a delicious proven menu.  It&#39;s perfect for a few drinks with some fantastic food.I highly recommend  the fried pickles with the urban sauce. I love how crispy the breading is along with the yummy pickle inside. The pickles are even made in house which makes this dish even better. They cut them length wise and not like round circles. This makes them easy to hold and dunk in the urban sauce.I am also in love with the bacon lollipops. Yes you head me right! This is like the best candy ever. One bite and you&#39;ll fighting the table for the next one.  It is asian spiced pork belly that is wrapped in bacon topped with a cider glaze. The dish just works &amp; is a great start to any evening here.Do you like Mac N Cheese? Don&#39;t be embarrassed because it&#39;s not for just kids. The versions here will blow you away. They have a 3 cheese Mac, peppered bacon Mac, chorizo Mac &amp; pulled pork Mac. I&#39;ve had them all but the chorizo is my favorite and I&#39;m not a chorizo fan either. The spicy ground chorizo mixes perfectly with the special 3 cheese sauce and delivers a real winner.  I literally can not stop eating it.Do you love wings? Then this is the place to order them. I love how these wings are grilled. Anyone can batter a wing and throw it into the deep fryer.  This place has some crazy good sauces to toss the wings in too. Tuesday are a great day to try the wings because they are on special at both locations. I&#39;m totally into the BBQ wings because it is the first wing I ever had here many years ago. It&#39;s hard for me to forget my original chicken wing love. If you&#39;re into spicy then go for the dry rub wings with habanero bbq or el diablo wings with habanero salsa.  Honestly you can&#39;t go wrong with any of the wing choices. They also have sassy wings with a spicy chili-ginger glaze &amp; a sriracha aioli or smokey wings with a sweet smoky basil BBQ. I can&#39;t get enough of them here.This place also had a great beer selection. You will find many craft brews available. One week I had a local brew made out of beets and when I came back the next week they had a different brew from the same brewery. I liked that cause it forced me to try a new beer. I like to say, &#34;There&#39;s a lot of Craft Brews but not enough hours in a day to drink them all.&#34; The Burger Bar is going to help me get closer to that goal. They also have a mug club you can join which gives you your own mug and a 20oz pour for the price of a 16oz beer. I feel like I am in Europe where you only drank at your pub and went nowhere else. The mug club creates a sense of ownership. The bar even had a built in pint rinser which is something every European bar has. You clean the glass prior to pouring the beer to make sure there are no impurities in the glass to ruin the taste of the beer. This place is serious when it comes to your beer. They also have a keg cemetery for dead kegs. It is located outside the bathroom. Make sure you stop by to pay your respects for our fallen kegs.This place has so much great food I almost forget why I started this review and that&#39;s because of the unique burgers. This place has been serving up burgers long before the Chicago Burger explosion. In fact, I believe Chef John might have created this fascination with burgers in Chicago. He truly knows good food.I&#39;m going to mention a few of my favorite burgers like the &#34;Hey Shorty&#34; with braised short ribs, caramelized onions &amp; roasted garlic aioli. It is so yummy. The &#34;Hot &amp; Smokey&#34; which is a bbq beef burger, smoked pulled pork, grilled hot link, tillamook cheddar, smoked habañero-BBQ glaze &amp; cucumber-onion slaw. You&#39;re going to need two hands &amp; a big mouth to eat this one. If you don&#39;t believe me then check my photo out. If you&#39;re looking for a spicy burger then go with the &#34;El Diablo Firehouse&#34; which is a chipotle spiced burger, charred jalapeño-scallion-chorizo relish, pepper jack &amp; guajillo aioli.They also have exotic meat like the &#34;Wild Bill&#34; with grass-fed, lean bison, arugula, goat cheese &amp; tomato chutney on a pretzel roll. I love buffalo burgers because of the leanness of the meat &amp; this one didn&#39;t let me down.  I can&#39;t wait to try the elk burger &amp; the lamb burger. I&#39;m getting hungry thinking about them.  I also loved the chicken burger. It&#39;s seasonings were really good. Everyone does turkey burgers but you never see chicken burgers. I am really glad I tried it.So if you find yourself hungry in the South Loop, then stop in here for a meal you will not soon forget. The management &amp; staff are amazing with great customer service. I love the bartenders too because they really know beer. I can&#39;t wait to go back to eat &amp; drink again!"

Everyone raved about the wings, so we had to try them, the sassy wings were the perfect amount of spicy and sweet, best wings I&#39;ve had! I&#39;d got back just for the wings! I ordered the wild bill, it was good if you&#39;re into goat cheese, arugula, and tomato chutney; it was a VERY messy burger to eat! My husband did &#34;build your own burger&#34; very delicious but it gets pricy, each extra toppings are  $1.50 each. Sweet potatoes fries were okay, salty and fried. Lots of beer choices too. Atmosphere, was definitely a bar atmosphere, loud and crowded (if you go during w popular time)."

I tried a bite and will admit that it&#39;s good and cooked nicely but the flavor profile doesn&#39;t even begin to compare to the complexity of the raviolini di pera! 4/5Service:friendly, waters refilled, no complaintsOverall:my friend who&#39;s Italian was very defensive when I said it reminded me of a nicer olive garden. he forbid me from mentioning olive garden inside Tuscany lolllll but he&#39;s right. Tuscany is way better than Olive Garden and definitely more authentic. the waiters and cooks appear to be Italian and I believe a good number of the restaurant&#39;s clientele are Italian as well. I&#39;m assuming they would know where to go to get good Italian food! :)"

I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve never received  so quick and on point service than I did today.They start us off with their garlic, Parmesan cheese and olive oil dip. And we ordered bruschetta to start. It came very fast and then ordered our main entree. I ordered the Pollo Montecarlo and my wife ordered an my wife ordered the fettuccine alla primavera. Her dish was alright, but the Pollo Montecarlo was very tasty. It had a Chardonnay reduction based sauce with the spinach as the base at the bottom. And then the chicken and prosciutto topped with fontinella cheese. All the ingredients complimented each other very well.One thing that always bothers me is that I never leave enough room for dessert. Perhaps it&#39;s the bread in the beginning or chips and salsa at Mexican restaurants but I never seem to be able to taste the desserts. Anyways...I will definitely be returning to Tuscany on Taylor."

This restaurant is a nice Italian restaurant in the middle of Little Italy and definitely one of my favorites. It is a good place for a date night, as it is a quieter, more intimate atmosphere.This time, I went with my boyfriend for an early dinner, which consisted of red wine and a few different appetizers. We got the Grilled Calamari appetizer and the Prosciutto &amp; Mozzarella appetizer. Both were really tasty, but I thought the grilled calamari (which was a special) had too many chick peas in it. However, the prosciutto and mozzarella was delicious. It was so simple, but the meat was perfect and the buffalo mozzarella was the perfect texture.I can definitely see myself coming back again for dinner!"

They need to update that.&#34; After checking if we could receive said dishes from the kitchen, he came back and essentially said they could, but would throw some sausage in the sauce, which we all know, throwing greasy sausage in a tomato sauce for five minutes really imparts flavor into it.We went with two different options instead and they were awful. The veal tortellini had zero sauce in it and was incredibly bland. The same goes with the overdone parpadelle with the flavorless bolognese. Honestly, we&#39;ve cooked a better Sunday sauce at home and I expected more from Little Italy.If the restaurant had updated their menu online, we wouldn&#39;t have even gone. The pasta combinations were so bizarre that it was clear that they were essentially just throwing ingredients on a plate (Seriously, who serves shrimp scampi with marinara sauce?).Italian food isn&#39;t the cheapest of options and I feel sick that I actually spent money here. The whole experience was basically false advertising and I hope the homeless man we gave our doggie bags to enjoyed his meal...because we certainly didn&#39;t."

At least the girl working the cash register was friendly and she seemed apologetic for the harsher woman.

They&#39;ve always been very accommodating.Anyone who bothers to read anything I write knows that I was raised with a grandmother that taught me that garlic is a bulb from the onion family.  She taught me that it should be used sparingly - as in, heat the olive oil in an iron pan and rub the raw garlic across the oil - then toss out the garlic.  She also said that tomato paste was an American invention (Ref: Chef Boyardee) and that if you wanted your sauce thick, you cook it all day. You don&#39;t add paste as a thickener. Restaurants that add paste are cheating their customers. You also notice that most of those customers end up eating Zantac and Tums as dessert due to the fact that the sauce was undercooked and has about a thousand times more acid than non-paste sauces that are cooked properly.I note these things as a public service and to their credit, Tuscany understands fresh ingredients.  That said, If you&#39;ve read other reviews here and the writer raves about the toasted garlic, smashed and served in olive oil, I would suggest that they have (to say the least) an uneducated palate. If you want to eat raw or toasted garlic before your meal, you might as well lick a brine block as you&#39;ll actually taste nothing that&#39;s served after the fact.Does Tuscany serve garlic as an appetizer? Yes!  If you don&#39;t like it then don&#39;t eat it... easy.  Do they pay attention to detail and help the customer enjoy the experience? Most of the time - yes.The problem is that on our last two visits we&#39;ve been served portions that are extraordinarily small.We start with the brick oven pizza. It&#39;s always good and there&#39;s no need to special order anything about it.  Obviously we need modify the pasta (sans garlic) and do so.The last time we ordered the Penne E Capesante ($22) and this time the Ravioli Della Casa ($18). On both occasions the pasta was cooked perfectly and the flavor was great. The serving size was amazing small. In the case of the ravioli, four squares for $18. Why?  When they place the food in front of you, you stare at it as if it were a joke.  Four pieces of pasta on this big, white plate!Then I realized - it&#39;s the menu!  There&#39;s been a shift in the way they&#39;re doing business. Somehow, someone has decided that Northern Italian cuisine has to be &#34;small plates&#34; and multiple courses. This is why you only get a few bites in each course and why, not coincidentally, the overall bill is higher than usual.This is not the way it used to be at Tuscany nor is it the way true Italians serve in Northern Italy.  I know because I have family who own a restaurant in Florence. I&#39;ve eaten there and you&#39;re lucky to walk out with any measure of an &#34;American&#34; calorie count.  As the comedian John Pinette said, &#34;they kept bringing us food to try.  After we&#39;d eaten several dishes they said &#34;okay - now you order!&#34;  That&#39;s an accurate account of the generous nature of food as a presentation of life.  Italian food is not tapas and never has been.For many years we&#39;ve enjoyed Tuscany. Now it&#39;s degraded due to economic revisions. &#34;Oh, they won&#39;t notice!&#34;  Believe me, we noticed.  Now off our list of excellent food at a good value."

The restaurant is on the eastern end of Little Italy and is a traditional upscale Italian bistro with classic red sauce dishes. On our hot Chicago night, the windows were closed, but I could imagine them open on some enchanted evening. We had reservations and were seated promptly by the attentive, but reserved staff.As a word of caution, the portions are very large here. We started with a grilled octopus salad which was my first time eating that particular sea creature. I could tell it was prepared well, but I just did not enjoy it. My second course of gnocchi was truly amazing. The handmade gnocchi with ragu was enormous, but I devoured it with gusto and would love it over and over. Unfortunately, this made my main course of veal parmigiana a labor of love. The veal chop was massive, taking up the entire dinner plate and of course was served with a bowl of gemelli pasta. Dessert was enticing, but the presence of well stuffed doggie bags on our table signaled that we were spent.Overall, this is a great place to take friends or your date. It is a classic Italian restaurant nice enough to impress, but still enjoy on a random Tuesday. I wish we had a nice place like this back home in Sacramento, but I will still dream of that gnocchi at night until I return."

The warm atmosphere of the restaurant and our waiter with a heavy Italian accent made us feel like we&#39;d been transported to Italy.Unfortunately we were not starved due to several pre dinner cocktails and noshing on their delicious bread with olive oil and garlic so we skipped appetizers and went straight for ordering pasta dishes. My boyfriend went with the pasta special of the evening, a linguini with seafood in a spicy marinara. He was pleased with the dish and I loved what I sampled.I went with the Agnoloti Burro e Salvia. I&#39;d had a similar dish at Tuscany&#39;s sister restaurant, 437 Rush and absolutely loved it.

It&#39;s a moderately priced fine dining Italian restaurant.The roasted garlic, parmesan, and olive oil for dipping the bread that they gave us was good, but I wish their bread selection was better.We got the tagliolini alla carbonara and the linguine vongole.The carbonara was very good, but the first bite was very salty from the pancetta. I could tell the pasta was handmade and fresh, which I loved! My only critique would&#39;ve been to have less pancetta. I was gulping my water throughout the meal because it was so salty. Even my boyfriend that can eat anything and everything said it was salty for his taste.The linguine vongole was very good and it came with a generous amount of clams. Very flavorful, but a little salty to my taste as well.Verdict: I gave it three stars because of the overly salty taste of the pastas and the bread being stale/hard, but I would definitely give this place another try. Maybe the second time around will be better and I can change it from three to four stars!"

Promptly greeted by the host and seated. We were provided with the menu promptly, however the waiter left us alone for about 10 mins and took a while to return even after indicating we needed help with ordering. The food arrived about 10 mins after ordering... Me and my friend felt the lentils were undercooked though the roast garlic with bread (as simple as it is) tasted delicious. The seafood was alright... Just as expected.Overall,Decor - 4/5 (formal decor with ambient calm lighting), seating can be cramped to some extent with consequent noise from other tables (heard the entire Chinatown walk convo from the next table)Service - 3/5 promptly seated. However, it ticked me off that the waiter took over 10 mins to take orders.Price - 2/5 - 50usd for 1 appetizer and 1 entree (with 20%tips) - I would expect better portions and better food prep with presentation.Food - 2.5/5 - certain dishes met the mark of being memorable while other failed miserably (undercooked lentil being the first of the few).Overall - 2.5/5 - would drop by if I need to impress a date with a fancy looking pricey place and menu, with average food."

Supermarket sweep that bitch and just load up the cart. Check out, go home, cook dinner and ask anyone to be borderline rude to you with an endearing Italian accent and BAM - you have Tuscany.If you must go, come for the cannoli, stay for the overpriced mediocre Italian food. Overpriced is an understatement. Calamari appetizer is $13+ for a decent portion.I went with my fiancée and I got the Paglia Fieno (pasta with prosciutto and mushrooms in a cream sauce) and he got the Chicken Montecarlo (chicken with prosciutto over a bed of spinach). The pasta was cooked well but the prosciutto looked more like deli ham and the mushrooms added decent texture. It was fine, but not worth the $17. His dish was a disappointment. I ate it and couldn&#39;t figure out what it tasted like, mostly because it tasted like nothing. I can save you time and money ($20) and just give you air to eat. I&#39;d say prosciutto one more time but not paid by the word, folks.I&#39;ve consistently been disappointed with Phil Stefani restaurants (437 Rush). Better local Italian spots in Little Italy.

I was trying to decide between Tuscany, Sofie, and Rosebud when we ended up here.I was a fan of the roasted garlic, the truffle fries (THESE WERE AMAZING) and the service, but unfortunately was not a fan of the main entrees.My SO got veal and I got a chicken dish with quinoa that I wasn&#39;t satisfied with... maybe the garlic messed with my palette, but I did not like the seasonings (I admit that my SO said it was amazingly well-cooked chicken). I asked for a different entree and exchanged it for pasta primavera. I loved their house noodles, but I hated the sauce and the dish overall.  I expected some variety in vegetables, but the dish only contained zuccini and bell peppers.I am so sad that I was disappointed by the food at the restaurant, especially on a day that I wanted to just relax and eat good food.

We had to go into the city if for no other reason than to eat lunch at his favorite Italian restaurant and get their roasted garlic.After spending the day doing the tourist thing in the city; going to the top of the John Hancock building, walking Michigan Ave, shopping in the Water Towers, and checking out Navy Pear, we ventured west to Tuscany. I am so glad we did.It was such a nice quiet romantic break from the hustle and bustle that is Chicago. There was no doubt we were in the middle of Little Italy of Chicago either. I am pretty sure the guys sitting a few tables away were Wise Guys. I wasn&#39;t about to mess with them. I loved it though. it was lunch the way lunch was meant to be eaten; beautifully plated, waiters in suits, wine by the bottle and the warm smell of garlic in the air. We had two plates of their roasted garlic appetizer. I can&#39;t say anything more about it other than you have to get it, ask for the Italian Peanut Butter. You will die happy!Side note, I think there was a private room in the back that would be perfect for a larger group or get together.We had a great time, left stuffed and happy!"

Tuscany really sets themselves apart with their bread situation. I am sure other reviews have mentioned, but getting a plate of roasted garlic and peppers in oil certainly upped the ante for us.More than anything, we found the staff the perfect compliment to our meal, primarily the woman tending bar. Kimberly (the bartender) was beyond amazing. To be honest, I was initially irritated with her because she declined to pour me the glass of wine I requested. What?!? However, she won me over quickly, letting me try a taste of the wine I ordered and realize for myself that what I requested was not at all what I wanted. She then poured me a glass that was fantastic, so good that I wanted a second. She was extremely attentive but not overbearing.We will definitely be back!"

The food is good overall, but I was there the other night and I&#39;m pretty sure the spinach that came as a side with my dish was frozen and right out of the box. It most definitely was not fresh spinach. It&#39;s a has nice ambiance, but in my opinion a little overpriced for the quality of the food."

Two friends of mine from Chicago Lyric Opera were working as singing waiters at the original Stefani&#39;s restaurant on Fullerton. I used to show up to sing with them, and I quickly became hooked on the amazing Italian cuisine that this place served up. When they closed several years later, I was heartbroken. I feared I would never taste these dishes again.A couple of years ago, a family member moved to the Taylor Street area, causing me to drop in to Tuscany. O my God, there they were!! The same Stefani family recipes that I had despaired of ever tasting again!When you are first seated, you are presented with a rosted bulb of garlic which the waiter mixes tableside with oil and a bit of salt, to be eaten with a basket of warm breads. For me, that garlic spread and a martini would be enough!One thing you should know is that the menu contains many delightful dishes, but you needn&#39;t confine yourself. You will not see many classic Italian staples on the menu. That is because the kitchen will prepare any classic dish if you simply ask.My favorite appetizer is large, tender, alabaster-white grilled calamari, served over arugula salad. It&#39;s been off the menu for months now, but I ask and they make it.Last night, I tried a special appetizer of prosciutto, a white creamy cheese, and fig jam, served with pizzettas (little warm, airy popovers). Amazing!The two entrees I had dreamed abut since Stefani&#39;s closed were veal marsala and linguini with white clam sauce. They were both exactly as I remembered them! The veal scaloppini was tender and flavorful, topped in a savory marsala sauce with dozens of little button mushrooms. It comes with a side of rotini in a tasty red sauce. The linguine features tender clams in the shell. I think what I like most about this dish is that is rather dry - not at all oily or saucy. Flavors are robust.My wife is partial to the veal chop, which is pounded thin to a size that overlaps the plate, and covered with gorgonzola.The restaurant is conveniently located about 3 blocks west of the Taylor Street exit on the Ryan. The valet is only $6, and they park the car in a small lot right beside the restaurant, so you never have to wonder what became of your car.This is a popular spot for sports fans, so it can be crowded in the early evening before games at the United Center or the UIC. The room is open and attractive, but it can be very noisy when there is a crowd. Bartenders and waitstaff are colorful characters, but very professional and efficient.A tip: Some Costco stores in the Chicago area sell gift cards to all Phil Stefani restaurants. $100 in gift cards for $80. I pick these up when I&#39;m anticipating a trip there.Another tip: Tuscany has another location in Oakbrook. I&#39;ve been there twice and I don&#39;t hate it, but it&#39;s not the same. Go to Taylor Street."

After some research and some narrowing down. We went to Tuscany and the next night to Coco Pazzo- both Northern Italian. The overall consensus was that while Coco Pazzo seemed to be better quality food, Tuscany tasted like an Italian mother made it... Coco Pazzo had more delicate flavor, but no heart. I can dig both and there&#39;s a time and place for each type of food..Great service, great food, good relaxing atmosphere - never rushed. Will go back!"

Wife had a hair in her salad. Always upset about that. Entrees were pretty late getting out as well.  When they came we weren&#39;t impressed.  My wife and mother in law both ordered pasta with scallops which were about $25/plate no sides or salads.  Each entree came with only three tiny scallops surrounded by a heaping portion of pasta.  My $20 &#34;boneless&#34; chicken dish had plenty of bones and gristle in it. This place is the definition of a rip off.  They look at you with $$ in their eyes.  Reminded me of tourist traps in Italy. Won&#39;t be going back anytime soon.

Well,  when you first walk in the dining room area is very fancy,and the host is ready to greet and bring us to the table that we reserved for our party that was very nice. The service is at least 4 stars because they are friendly and accommodating to their guest through out the dinner. HOWEVER, things weren&#39;t all that great with their food.I had to unfornuately give it only three stars, because the food was not that great. We had spaghetti with penne noodles or what Chicago people like to call it mostaccioi noodles, very skimmy calamri appetizer, the salad dressing on their house salad was tastless like as if nothing was on the salad besides the lettuce on the plate.They served us plenty of wine and beer, but all their beer was bottled not on tap, for a fancy place with a bar, you&#39;d think they would have beer on tap, but no it wasn&#39;t.

I thrive for this low-key eatery located right in the heart of downtown Chicago.I came here for breakfast with a friend who had just flown into Chicago, and we decided downtown would be the best meeting point. Fearful it&#39;d be an expensive shop, we were surprised to see Thrive360 be a place that was not only affordable, but tasty as well. The look inside felt very chic and comfortable.When you walk in, you order from a computer screen that lets you select and modify your order. I went for the Denver Scramble which contains scrambled eggs, brocolli, cheddar, scallions, and a homemade salsa roja. With your order, I also tacked on spinach, edamame, and other veggies all for free! Some items will cost more, but the healthy greens are included.What I ended up with was a delicious and healthy breakfast scramble that prepped me up for the last workday of the week. All the ingredients blended well together, and I was full even off my small bowl. Vegans would definitely go nuts for this place too.My food came out to less than $6 for the bowl, which was a steal!If you are in the area, I highly recommend stopping by and enjoying some organic, healthy cuisine yourself."

However, I randomly decided to stop by Thrive360 when I was wandering around the Loop for a place to get lunch since the decor looked clean and nice.I loved how many options there were--it took me quite a while to decide what I want, and I finally went with a relatively safe choice: falafels with a sweet potato salad and wild rice + quinoa. The portions aren&#39;t very big, especially for the price, but the food was tasty, fresh, and well seasoned, not to mention the fact that it came out relatively quickly.Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!"

It&#39;s important to know that the food they serve you keeps you going all day and also gets rid of all the nastiness on the inside of our bodies. I hope this place does well. I&#39;m not a big fan of healthy eating with kale and turkey bacon but I know so many people value this type of eating in the downtown area. You have so many fast food joints around the area that Thrive360 Eatery should stand out because it&#39;s fast food with a lot of prep work done for the option to be healthier option for people. You can feel better working knowing your body is fed properly and it does make a difference in the work day. So please give this place a try.The service was great, it was fun and interesting to get to know the Chef behind all of this amazing food. The food is colorful and that means it is designed by a Chef who knows that colors is how we should eat. Bright greens and leaner meats. Great opportunity to try this place we are so glad we did."

Unlike Protein Bar, Thrive360 also serves dishes that may have more (good) fat or carb based. Their juice bar is still exactly the same as protein bar but their food isnt. This is still a healthy alternative food spot than other casual dining spots. Expect high quality ingredients which in turn does translate to dishes being pricer, but personally i could tell the difference.

I really wanted to like this place but my breakfast was so disappointing that I found myself wishing I had just gone to Corner Bakery.First of all, the restaurant is GORGEOUS. I mean, super slick. I loved that the entire menu is customizable and that you can place your order at the little kiosks.After much indecision, I went with the almost-naked oatmeal. At the kiosk I asked for no honey and an addition of peanut butter and strawberries for an extra charge.My order came quickly and the lady behind the counter was very nice. The food itself was...bleh. The oatmeal was cold. Not warm or tepid or even lukewarm--it was stone cold. Granted, I know cold oatmeal is a thing but I think that most people ordering oatmeal expect it to be hot or at least warm.And if the oatmeal is going to be cold, the menu should at least give me a heads up. Also, the strawberries I added were totally frozen. This is a bummer because, again, the menu didn&#39;t indicate that they would be frozen. If I&#39;m getting upcharged for three strawberries they should probably be fresh.I really enjoy Protein Bar but this was really a miss for me."

Ordered THE VEGAN FALAFEL &amp; TAHINI bowl, which tasted pretty good but was not filling. For the same amount of money or less I could have bought a more filling lunch at a different Mediterranean place in the Loop. My friend ordered Jenny&#39;s Noodle bowl with chicken and said it didn&#39;t taste good at all, it had a weird sour taste and was even less filling than my falafel bowl. He was hungry an hour after eating lunch... and he paid $11 for it (including tax).The bottom line is I would pay a higher than average price for lunch if it tastes very good and is satisfying, but I wouldn&#39;t go back to a place that left my feeling hungry."

Great place to go sit down and chat with a colleague or get some work done as they have plenty of seating.Also, recently I have noticed the Protein Bar on Adams and Franklin has been consistently making runny smoothies that are more juice-like than smoothie based.

It&#39;s healthy and it&#39;s a spin off of protein bar. I don&#39;t necessarily understand the difference in the 2. Maybe it&#39;s got a slightly more middle eastern vibe to it, which is very in right now. The place is open and airy and you can see most food being assembled as it is an open kitchen. The staff was very attentive and we even heard from the cook who helped create the menu. We started with kombucha, which I am not a fan of but my friend said it was very good. Then we tried the falafel, which was one of my favorites. The sweet potato salad is unique in a good way. The miso noodles were meant to be served as cold, but I didn&#39;t think the combination was very good. The bone soup was also done very well. I could enjoy that on a cold day. My favorite part was the Kale Caesar Salad. The croutons were made of cheese and had a great flavor. You received the health benefits of kale. They added tomatoes which was a nice touch and the dressing was made with greek yogurt. Overall, it was great. From there it went down hill. The Superfood Harvest Salad has mint which was really awful to bite into. The Southwest salad/bowl think was a hot salad and very displeasing to the palate. The espresso malt was kind of chalky, and the rest of the desserts were all from another location. If I went back, it would be for the caesar salad, but that&#39;s pretty much all."

While the food was good, it wasn&#39;t great, and the ordering system and set up of the dining room was weird.Like many other quick service restaurants, we ordered at the register. Only instead of grabbing a number and picking our own seat, we were told where to sit by the hostess (not even escorted, just told). Kinda weird.While ordering I told the cashier I liked spicy food and asked what kind of sauce I should get as I had never been there before. She told me medium, and that they had all the sauces available in the dining room so I could always get hot or any other flavor if I wanted. I went with her recommendation, and my boyfriend just went straight for the hot sauce. He joked that she probably didn&#39;t believe I could handle heat &#39;cause I&#39;m a white girl, lol.As far as the sauces that were openly available in the dining room, other diners had taken all of them to their tables to eat with. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s what you are supposed to do? Or if everyone is just selfish, cause what ended up happening is that there were no additional sauces available for us to try as the cashier had suggested. Lame.Overall, just kinda so-so.

We had chicken thighs with a mango lime marinade it was delicious and juicy. The chicken was packed with major flavor the rice and the mushed peas were flavorful spicy and amazing. It is not super spicy just right for me. You can pick the level of spiciness you would like for your food to be. Peri Peri is known to be a spicy type of food in general so just expect it to have some spice level bc it&#39;s how it&#39;s suppose to be.

I came here two nights in a row for dinner. It was THAT good, I couldn&#39;t help myself!!This new location is beautiful inside and even has a great outdoor seating area. You order your food up front, and they&#39;ll bring it out to your table.   The customer service has been wonderful both nights so far. They had a manager walking the floor continually checking in to make sure our meal was okay. He even asked to refill our sodas from the self-serve station! Also the sauces.....the sauces!!! So many to choose from, all good for their own reason. The wild herb is probably my favorite other than traditional hot.In the two nights my boyfriend and I have been there we&#39;ve tried almost all of the sides and still can&#39;t decide our favorite. Maybe the peas because they&#39;re different, or let&#39;s be honest maybe the mashed potatoes because, well, they&#39;re mashed frickin&#39; potatoes and I&#39;m what some would call a &#39;carbo queen.&#39;"

You&#39;re assigned a table but have to order at the counter. The food is served to your table (minus the napkins and silverware). Everything else (silverware, drinks, sauces) you have to get yourself. What&#39;s the point of leaving a tip?- The service at the counter is blah- Prices are steep- Small portions"

I definitely ordered a chicken sandwich. She brought me a wrap then proceeded to tell me SHE rung me up and she KNEW that I ordered a wrap. Then walked away. Wouldn&#39;t I know what I ordered? This girl clearly had a chip on her shoulder and took it out on us. Will not return to this location. So unimpressed.Food was 4 stars- even though it wasn&#39;t at all what I ordered, the chicken was very flavorful. Also loved the rice. Will probably visit a different location. Will definitely not go back there if they think it&#39;s acceptable to permit their staff to behave like that."

The food was out fast given the ridiculous line that went out the door. The food itself was as amazing as ever! The chicken is always so moist (I know..I hate that word too), flavorful, tender, and never has that frozen flavor. The chicken is grilled to perfection - one of my pet peeves is when the skin on a grilled chicken is still chewy and fatty - with Nando&#39;s, that&#39;s a non issue, the skin is always crisp perfection. We always get it insanely spicy, but I love that they have options from mild to burn your retinas off.The sides are great - I love the rice and potatoes.If I could command all chicken joints to be Nando&#39;s I would!"

The sauce was absolutely excellent since the lime gave the tender chicken a great zesty zing! Also I loved the fact that they had complementary sliced lemons for me to put in my water.AMBIENCE: Lovely indoor seating with modern hanging lights. Great South African vibe and beautiful bathroom. Similar dining to that of Panera Bread or Noodles and Company (allows for a causal yet nice dine-in experience!)SERVICE: The staff working there is extremely nice and they greeted us with warm smiles. Very helpful! Wish they could have had us stay near the restaurant entrance before being seated though because you have to order by the kitchen.Would come again!!"

My wings were cooked to perfection and I dipped them in basically every sauce Nando&#39;s has to offer. Not to mention their Portuguese rice is a gift from the Gods.This is a great place to have a snack/beer prior to catching a movie. The ambiance and set up allows for easy conversing and not having to scream over one another to pass a napkin.Overall, I&#39;m happy to have sacrificed my ideal movie time to eat a snack here.

High protein and slightly low fat food. So for all my bodybuilders and weightlifters this place is macro friendly. This location just opened up and it has an amazing decor. Better than the rest of the nando&#39;s in the loop area. But their chicken isn&#39;t prepared better. Most of my wings were small and burnt. Anytime I go to nando&#39;s I always order the 12 wings with a side and I usually get good size wings( nando&#39;s standard) and probably about 2 or 3 crispy ones. But this time all the wings were burnt and smaller then normal. So as far as decor and view goes, this place is the best. For how they prepare the food, by far the worst I&#39;ve had. Hopefully it gets better the longer they stay open."

Must have been an issue with the half chicken because she asked if I could sub for dark meat instead. Being as hAngry as I was, I just said yes. I finally got my order 40 minutes after ordering it and when I get home, I noticed my half chicken was substituted for ONE chicken thigh. Please explain that to me.

Never anyone there to greet, have to wait on someone to eventually saunter up to you.  Loooong wait for food both take out and eat in even when the place is pretty empty. Wait was so long (over 20 minutes) once for just one piece of chicken I almost left without my food, but finally found a manager who eventually helped.

The garlic bread was good and the Fries was ok.The burger was ok not so great.The Roasted veggie wrap was horribly cold. They must have added huge amount of yogurt or something directly from the refrigerator i guess. I ate only the sides and wasted both the burger and wrap.Also i could not understand the serving model. We need to order and pay for what we want while entering the restaurant. Sounded like Chipotle. But in the receipt they are expecting us to add a &#34;TIP&#34;.

I have been working in the southwest corner of River North for ten months now. Why I waited this long to try this place, I don&#39;t have a reasonable explanation.I went in and ordered an oil spill which, is the BP, or combination of brisket and pulled pork. Unfortuantely, they were out of sliced brisket, so I went with chopped instead. I got slaw for my side and I got a free cornbread since I was a first time customer.They give you whatever sauces you select on the side and they ahve six to choose from. I didn&#39;t care for the Chicago style with the Old Style beer in it. The KC one had a tang and worked well on the brisket. Next time, I think I&#39;d try the Memphis on it though. But the winner, was the pulled pork topped with the South Carolina mustard sauce. I&#39;ve had a few mustard based sauces that were just overwhelmingly strong. This sauce was well-balanced between sweet, smoky, spicy, and bitter and it was an ideal complement to the pork. The slaw was a fine side. It had a blend of vinegar, a touch of mayo (thank God, not too much) and some red apple, which made it different than any other slaw. I think I&#39;d try their beans next time though.And I have to give some love to their beverages. They have an excellent homestyle lemonade on fountain with free refills. Also, their sweet tea is freshly brewed and marvelous. Combining these two together makes an ideal Arnold Palmer.As far as Chicago BBQ is concerned, I&#39;d probably have to give the edge still to Smoque just because they have such good ribs and their peach cobbler dessert. But for a limited menu, this place is dynamite and I hope they continue to expland and come to the suburbs."

The Mac n Cheese is SO good! Super crispy, but it is oily. I like that they ask you if you want the beef brisket to be the fatty slices or the thin slices! I would definitely come back here again. Service is quick, even during busy hours.The sitting area is busy during lunch time, but you can still grab a seat if it&#39;s just you and a friend. There were a lot of little flies or fleas (?) or something which really detracted from my eating experience because I was shooing them away while trying to enjoy my beef brisket."

It comes with a generous portion of eggs, potatoes, and brisket, and topped with the KC sauce, it was absolutely delicious. The brisket was very well seasoned, and the KC sauce had a very interesting tang in addition to the heat.

The nice thing about the brisket is that it&#39;s sliced to order so it retains all the moisture and juices. The pulled pork and chicken were equally tasty. They have a multitude of sauces to choose from and a limited sides menu.I tried the North Carolina which is a vinegar-based sauce and Kansas City which is thicker and spicier. The baked beans are prepared with what looked like to be pork. The cornbread was moist and flavorful and had bits of corn throughout. Overall a decent lunch spot for quick BBQ and a nice change-up to the Loop lunch rotation."

Instead of going to your typical deli, try out some quick but quality bbq! Chipotle style ordering, so even long lines go by fast. I got the brisket salad with all the toppings, including corn bread, with the Chicago style sauce. This was a great combo. The brisket was delicious and tender, and the sauce was tasty. The cornbread  crumbs were especially yummy and sweet too. Even the salad was a very filling meal, so you get your bang for your buck at this place! A nice change from your average work lunch."

We even had Blackwood Fridays at the office where a bunch of my colleagues heads over here before it gets too crowded for lunch. They do get really packed but the prep line is so efficient everytime, you&#39;ll be out with your order in about 10-15mins.If I feel eating healthy I go for the salad otherwise I&#39;ll take a pile of meat, 1/2lb with side of pickles, brisket platter baby! Top it with Chicago (simmered with old style lager) + Kansas style sauce for that sweet n&#39; spicy blend. The brisket salad taste equally amazing with all the veggie garnish please. Beans, corn, carrots, onions, pickles then a choice from fatty, lean, or in between chunk of meat. My go to sauce for the salad is the vinegar based North Carolina style. They do have other meat choices like the pulled chicken and pulled pork which I would think is good but not as great as the brisket . 15Hours in the smoker wraps that flavor to the beef and makes that extra tender meat. Don&#39;t skip a side order of the crunchy crust and gooey inside mac n&#39; cheese that comes in little cupcake sized foil cups.And whoever thought of bbq for breakfast for a little over 5 bucks is a genius! I&#39;m a fan of eggs+taters+brisket with Alabama white sauce. They recently added the buttermilk biscuit and eggs sandwhich with your choice of either pulled pork or brisket smothered with cheddar on top. The breakfast of champs! They do serve the la colombe coffee too for 99cents. I&#39;m a fan so hope you guys branch out to the burbs soon."

There was no line at all with a few people seated on the small seating area. The staffs are very friendly and the food came out quickly.I ordered the pulled pork platter with the famous apple coleslaw on the side while my friend ordered the beans and mac and cheese on the side.The pulled pork was really nice and tender. We both chose the chicago style sauce. The sauce can be overwhelming so if you can, try asking them to put it on the side or something. Next time I&#39;de want to try the memphis rub, heard a few people ordering that while I was waiting for my food.Overall, a good portion for 8.9 dollars and a quick meal."

We got there a little after noon so prime lunch rush. There was a long line, but it moved quickly. We both ordered the salad with beef brisket. They give you the option of a fatty cut, lean cut, or in between. I went with the in between and choose all the toppings to go on the salad plus the apple dressing. We took the lunches to go as there wasn&#39;t much seating available there. Price for my salad was 10 bucks and some change. When we started eating the salads in our office, my coworker noticed that I didn&#39;t receive any cornbread croutons!! Guess the person who made my salad forgot that when I asked for all the toppings. Overall, the salad was really good and didn&#39;t even need the dressing since there was so much going on in the bowl already.I&#39;d go back again but would be sure to keep a watchful eye so that those cornbread croutons aren&#39;t forgotten..."

Choose between a sandwich or platter, choose your meat, choose your sauce, choose your sides. I got the brisket platter - half lean and half fatty (I appreciated that they asked what cut I&#39;d like) - slathered in Chicago-style sauce with mac &amp; cheese and cornbread.The brisket was soft and juicy but slightly chewy. The Chicago-style sauce was pretty good - definitely better than I expected: sweet yet tangy in a good way. The pickles were alright. The mac &amp; cheese left something to be desired. But the cornbread was soooooo good. I haven&#39;t had cornbread that good in awhile. It had a sweetness to it that wasn&#39;t overpowering, and it was perfectly moist with the right density.More like a 3.5 simply because of the cornbread and lack of other delicious bbq options in the area. I like that they don&#39;t drown the meat in sauce so you can actually taste it. The facility was clean and catered to the surrounding offices."

This place is like the Chipotle of BBQ and they are slammed by lunch time. The large staff behind the counter runs like a finely oiled machine. They are ready to have your selected food packed for you but be prepared to eat elsewhere because it is small inside. I ended up having a nice BBQ picnic near the Chicago river.The staff was fantastic. I couldn&#39;t decide between the the pulled pork or the brisket and they suggested I get both meats. They will split a single portion of meat among two different meats which is great if you are eating here for the first time. I had no idea they would do this because it is not on the menu board. So I was really glad that I asked the guy behind the counter my question.The hard part was to decide which sauces to get. I decided to go with a Kansas City Style BBQ sauce on my pulled pork and an Old Style Based BBQ sauce on my brisket that was called Chicago Style. I looked over at the PitMaster to see if he approved with my sauce selections and he gave me a big head nod. That really made me feel very confident in my sauce choices. I must admit both sauces were really good. They have 6-8 different sauces to choose from. I wish I could have tried them all. Maybe on my next visit.The PitMaster whispered something to one of the staff members and the next thing I knew the staff all did a giant yell saying, &#34;First Timer!&#34; I thought that was really cool and less embarrassing then a version of Happy Birthday at Applebee&#39;s. It was a great way to acknowledge a newbie and make them feel special.Ordering here Is similar to a cafeteria counter where you walk along the glass making your selections. Next up for me to choose from was my sides. I wanted all of them and finally settled on the Baked Beans and the Mac N Cheese. The guy behind the counter also threw in a free corn bread. He told me that because it was my first time he was giving me a gift. This is definitely better then a birthday song at Applebee&#39;s plus the food is way better here.All three sides were good but if I had to pick one then I would go with the baked beans. These things rocked. I am going to say they are the best baked beans I&#39;ve had in a long long time. In fact, when I come back here next time I may get two servings of them. I wish they had a larger double order. Yes they were that yummy.I also loved the meats but the pulled pork was my favorite. I would surely come back for that. All of the meat is available in a platter form, sandwich or salad. So depending on your mood you can choose accordingly. They even had pulled chicken but I did not try that.So if you&#39;re craving some BBQ in the city then this is your place. The staff will have you in and out in a flash. The food is really tasty. I can hardly wait until I am in the area and I can come back in for some BBQ. I also promise you that it smells really good. There is nothing like some meaty smoke smell in the air.  Stop in for a smell and leave with some meat."

One of the partners, Jon, reached out to me about my previous visit almost immediately after I posted my review. Through talking with Jon, it&#39;s evident that they really listen to their customers and take feedback very seriously.  Jon met me when I showed up for my usual yardbird salad, sought additional feedback on how they can improve and apologized that I received service below my expectations.I also went back separately a 2nd time to see how Blackwood fared on my own... And I have to say they passed with flying colors. Everyone was super friendly and helpful and the whole ordering process couldn&#39;t have been better - the way it should be.  They also labeled the toppings on the glass per my suggestion (see previous review)!

I skipped salad day downtown and I&#39;m so glad I did. I ordered my pulled pork platter online to beat any lunch crowd that might await me. No need at 11:15 though, there was only one person in the ordering line. For about $12, I walked out with a tube of pulled pork, baked beans, Cole slaw, a corn bread muffin, and a tasting of pickles. I say tube only because it were wrapped in foil like a Supreme tamale.The piggy was juicy and nicely seasoned. I got a little smoke from some pieces of outside, but it wasn&#39;t that much. Too bad though because the rub was fantastic. I wasn&#39;t anticipating likely the KC sauce as much as I did but I wound up finishing one of the little cups. It had the chile powder flavor I know from Arthur Bryant&#39;s, but it wasn&#39;t as overwhelming. With its nice heat, it paired beautifully with their slightly sweet pickles.Did I mention the beans? I liked how the sauce wasn&#39;t too thick and there were other visible vegetables. Sorry veg-heads, there&#39;s pulled pork in there so it&#39;s not for you.

During lunch, you first pick between a sandwich, plate or salad and then you pick your meat, sauce, and toppings. It&#39;s a similar setup during breakfast where the base is eggs + potatoes and then you choose your meat and sauces.I&#39;ve had both the brisket and the pulled chicken and both are quite tasty. The brisket is perfectly moist and juicy and fatty - but not too fatty. And when I&#39;m feeling super healthy, I opt for the chicken instead. Let&#39;s be real though - I get the brisket 90% of the time!The sauces are all made in house and are named after the city that inspired it. I think that the South Carolina (tangy mustard) goes well mixed with the Kansas City (spicy red). Just make sure to keep your eye on the person squeezing on the sauces because sometimes they can get a bit heavy handed for my taste.Lunch time prices are a good value for the quality and portion sizes (~$10). But the real bargain is at breakfast time when you can get a plate full of fresh eggs, potatoes, and bbq meat for about ~$4, which is less than I would pay for a microwaved Starbucks breakfast sandwich !!"

This used to be one of my favorite lunch spots but now there&#39;s no option to order ahead of time and pay when you pick up your order. If you pay with your credit card online, it doesn&#39;t go towards your Spring rewards, and the lines are too long in person. Are you deliberately trying to turn people off your loyalty programs??

Not to mention, we thought the portions were quite small for the price.Being that it was our first time here and we didn&#39;t think they were busy...maybe 3 other people in line, we felt rushed by the &#34;line of employees&#34; and not welcomed to ask questions about items.If you have the time to go get BBQ someone else in the city, I&#39;d highly recommend it.  If not, I&#39;d choose another cuisine for lunch.  Chipotle is right around the corner.  :)Having spent 5 years in Texas, I may be over critical on BBQ, but I feel I would still not give high ratings for this place.  I likely won&#39;t return, as there are better BBQ joints in the area and throughout the city."

It was a gorgeous, sunny Chicago spring day and what better way to enjoy it than to get some BBQ, right?!? I went to the location on Lake Street in the Loop. When you walk in you&#39;ll notice that  Blackwoods is very sleek, clean and modern. If you didn&#39;t know the store was there you&#39;d miss it as you walk by the concrete and glass office building it is in. You can&#39;t smell any BBQ while walking by making me wonder where they cook their meat. This runs counter to the way many think of BBQ. If you go down south BBQ places tend to be a little more rustic, etc. and you can often judge a BBQ joint by the aroma emanating from within. My favorite place is Bogart&#39;s in St. Louis. Getting hungry just thinking about it.I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with the &#34;Memphis sauce&#34; and a side of mac &amp; cheese. The guy building my sandwich reached below the counter somewhere and produced a handful of pulled pork. Where did it come from?!? I have no clue. I&#39;d like to see a BBQ place breaking down a pork shoulder behind the counter after it had cooked for hours upon hours but you don&#39;t see that here. There&#39;s just a mystery drawer with meat in it. All together, my lunch came to $9 which is pretty reasonable in the Loop for a non-sandwich place over the lunch hour.As for the food itself, it was quite good. The pork was tender, the sauce was sweet, and the brioche bun was great too! The only negative thing for me was how big the sandwich was (it&#39;s a little much for lunch) and the fact that the meat was luke warm at best. As for the mac &amp; cheese, that was the best part of the whole meal! The cheesy crust on top was delicious and I could have eaten it all day!Overall, I&#39;d give Blackwoods 4 stars. It&#39;s good food and it&#39;s adds some variety to the Loop lunch scene. Will I go back? Yup!"

Brisket, pulled pork or chicken on a bun, a platter, or salad.  I did brisket on a platter and was not disappointed.  Wow, real deal, black and salty on the outside, tender inside, probably one of the best briskets I&#39;ve had.  My wife had pulled pork on a bun,.. the bun itself was nothing special but that pork!  You get an extra side if you tell them it is your first time.What I liked also was the choice of sauces,.. being Canadian, i feel as if my knowledge of BBQ nuances is limited so was happy to be able to compare St. Louis style with Carolina etc.  The mac and cheese side was just normal as was the cornbread.If this place was here, I&#39;d find myself there frequently.  As it is, I&#39;ll just have to curse Memphis Blues and pay for substandard."

The brisket is a little overdone and not as tasty as I&#39;d like. It&#39;s a bit on the dry side although the fat on it is very tasty and you can taste the brine which is excellent. The Chicago sauce and the Kansas city sauce were...  Interesting.  the Chicago sauce has too much beer taste to it and the Kansas sauce had too much of a spicy bite. The Mac and cheese is gone and was awesome. Corn muffin awesome. Pickles crisp and tangy like home made garlic and onion pickles.  Would I order again? Maybe just to give it a chance to redeem the dry meat.

Probably not...you&#39;re in Chicago not memphis. However, it is still amazingly delicious. The Brisket with in-between fat and lean is delightful. The pulled pork is alright. While the brisket is decent in a platter, it actually tastes best in the salad to cut through some of the heaviness. I personally prefer the Chicago and Kansas City sauces as they provide some sweetness with an underlayer of heat.As far as sides go, my coworker adores the cornbread. I think it is alright. My preference is their mac n cheese. Ooey and gooey inside, topped with a crunchy, buttery crust that adds some texture, it is a divine indulgence. Great lunch spot."

However, as some other reviewers have mentioned, the customer service leaves something to be desired.I&#39;ve felt very rushed on a couple of occasions. I&#39;ve felt like the people behind the counter don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m saying/asking and don&#39;t make an effort to or try to remedy the situation but instead continue to rush you.I was going through the line today ordering 2 platters. I got slaw on both and then they asked if I wanted cornbread. I said yes, one cornbread for mine. Employee says &#34;are you sure you don&#39;t want one for the other? It&#39;s included&#34;. This leads me to think they changed their pricing so I say yes. Get to the cashier and he has charged me for the cornbread. I explain that the other employee told me it was included. He asks if I&#39;ve been there before instead of asking which employee said that.  At this point, he should be trying to clarify what was said, and make sure HIS OWN EMPLOYEE knows their pricing. Neither he, nor the manager next to him offered to take back the cornbread and void that charge.I hope they improve upon their customer service so I&#39;m more inclined to return."

My boyfriend and I were visiting from DC and decided to get BBQ - mostly I just decided because I absolutely love BBQ. The thing is, I get pulled pork and mac and cheese at every BBQ joint I go to so I can have a standard to compare against (and maybe also because I really, really like both of those things). Let me tell you that Blackwood BBQ is at the top of the list! I got the pulled pork with South Carolina sauce and the mac and cheese and was so incredibly satisfied. Sometimes the mac and cheese is just pasta with some cheese thrown in, but this was not. The cheese and macaroni were so deliciously intertwined and inseparable that it was amazing. The pork was tender with just the right amount of some of the best mustard sauce I&#39;ve ever had. The eating area was small but clean and well kept, and the staff seemed quite nice.Blackwood BBQ: my hat is off to you. Now if only you would open a joint in DC, my life would be complete :)"

The mac and cheese side was spot-on. perfectly cheesy with a nice cheesy crust on top that reminded me of creme brulee.A table card notes that Blackwood gets all of their seasonings from the Spice House.

Be aware, there is a line for lunch as it seems like many people who work around here picks this or chipotle. The style of service is very similar to chipotle where you walk up to the line and order your entree. Then as you go down the line, you get to pick and choose what kind of side items to add to your platter/sandwich/salad.I ordered the brisket with half lean and half fatty cuts, drenched with the Chicago style BBQ sauce and North Carolina BBQ sauce on the side. I really recommend getting the Chicago sauce if you are visiting the city because it goes really well with the brisket. The North Carolina was a good sauce as well, but would be better on pulled pork since it is a bit sweet. Also, I&#39;ve got the baked beans and Mac and cheese as my sides. Baked beans wasn&#39;t too special but it had chunks of meat in it! The Mac and cheese had a crust layer on top, and was creamy and cheesy throughout. Wouldn&#39;t go too crazy over the sides, but would recommend baked beans over Mac and cheese if I had a choice. Overall, had a great experience and recommend!"

The brisket sandwich looked amazing so I think we will try that next time we come back. We also ordered the mac &amp; cheese (not my favorite of all time, but still very good) and baked beans which were delicious with bits of pork in them. I&#39;ll try the cole slaw and corn bread next time around! We also had the home made lemonade which was a bit on the sour side but a good pairing with the BBQ.Overall, a great dining experience - we will be back!"

You get your choice of meat: pulled chicken, pulled pork, or brisket in a sandwich, platter, or salad. Genius idea for sure!What I tried:MAC AND CHEESE!!!: WOW WOW WOW. I don&#39;t even like mac and cheese that much but this was amazing. I could have eaten a whole big bowl of this stuff. Just try it.Brisket: I&#39;d suggest getting the fatty version because it&#39;s more juicy but regardless this is pretty good, flavorful, and tender. And you get a really good portion of meatCornbread: also pretty good. I&#39;d definitely choose the Mac and Cheese over this though but it is still good!Cole Slaw: a little more vinegary than I&#39;m used to, but still solid. I mean you need some veggies after all this meat.South Carolina BBQ: This was my favorite bbq sauce. It&#39;s definitely very different from the usual BBQ sauce, this thing is good! Definitely worth a try. Sort of reminded me of honey mustard.Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots in the area and definitely a must try!"

Genius, why didn&#39;t I think of this first?Let&#39;s start off with the great... that mac &amp; cheese. Holy crap. It really is delicious, these Yelpers aren&#39;t lying. Super crispy crust on top, perfect warm gooey cheesiness inside. Moving on to the good... the coleslaw. I love me some creamy coleslaw, and this is only $0.99 so I figured why not give it a go. It was decent, but kind of bland... needed more celery seed or something perhaps? And now for the OK... and this is the unfortunate part b/c their name is, after all, Blackwood BBQ. The BBQ. I had the pulled chicken. It was just OK. There wasn&#39;t really any smoked flavor to speak of... all the flavor comes from the sauce that they put on (I had Memphis style because Duh) and the sauce wasn&#39;t even that flavorful. It was decent, I&#39;d eat it again, yes, but I&#39;m just not like WHOA BLACKWOOD HOLY WOW IT&#39;S THE BEST EVER like some people.There was a line outside the door, we arrived at roughly 12:30, so that was to be expected... butthe line moved super fast, so don&#39;t fret on that. Staff was really friendly &amp; funny, too.Basically we were comparing Blackwood to Husky Hog with every bite, and right now, Husky Hog is still the reigning champion of legit BBQ in Chicago. I&#39;ll give Blackwood another shot for sure, I love the concept &amp; I mean, it&#39;s BBQ. Even when it&#39;s not mind-blowingly great, it&#39;s still freakin&#39; BBQ."

If you plan on bringing a group, plan on sitting somewhere else because there&#39;s very little seating inside.I ordered the pulled chicken with the Kansas City sauce, which has a little more than a kick.  It&#39;s pretty spicy, but has a good vinegary bite.  I also tried the baked beans which are really good, but non-pork eaters beware because I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s some pork in there.  The corn muffins were actually my favorite part of the meal; they&#39;re sweet and have little kernels of corn mixed in.  Definitely worth a try."

Some people get put off by the Chipotle-style setup, but some of the best BBQ I&#39;ve ever had came from a gas station, so I never judge a BBQ place on its looks. I ordered the brisket with Memphis-style sauce and got sides of corn bread and mac and cheese.The brisket was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had, and I&#39;m pretty picky when it comes to my brisket. The mac and cheese comes in an individual ramekin-style container, and was also top-notch. The corn bread was pretty good, but not as good as the other two. The sauce was OK, but the meat was good enough that it didn&#39;t need any. I also wish I had gotten another slice of brisket, but given the price, I think it was fair.The line was out the door when we went, but moved quickly, so don&#39;t be put off by that.

Despite the line being out the door, it actually went really quickly. The idea is similar to Chipotle - you pick your style (sandwich, salad, platter), meat (brisket, chicken, pork), sauce, and sides and watch them make it as you go down the line where you pay at the end. They had enough tables for a few dozen people, but I wouldn&#39;t take more than 1 or 2 people with you when you go.The Chicago sauce was an unexpected favorite - it was a little spicy and very flavorful. The North Carolina sauce was pretty bland. The brisket was flavorful all on its own and had a great texture. The mac and cheese was pretty good and definitely fresh out of the oven - good crust and rich cheesiness, although I would have liked a little more spice. The baked beans were TERRIBLE - a total letdown at the end of the meal - and tasted like runny old italian wedding soup. One caveat for the brisket - they do not trim it very well, so if you are like me and don&#39;t want a mouthful of fat, you&#39;ll have to do that yourself when you get it.We would come back, especially with the sandwich coming in at $8 with cornbread for $1 or mac and cheese for $1.50."

He convinced 5 of us to join him on a lunch outing here. He warned us that it wasn&#39;t a huge space so we decided to try to make it there by 11:45 to beat the lunch rush. We made it over and it wasn&#39;t packed but quite a few seats were taken so we figured the 6 of us would probably not be eating all together. Seating is communal so you will see gaps here and there.Once you walk in you can smell the yummy goodness of smoked meats. They have different versions of BBQ:Memphis BBQ (usually good)Kansas City BBQ (my favorite)South &amp; North Carolina BBQ (have to be in the mood for it)Chicago BBQ (Never heard of it)I tried the KC BBQ pulled pork sandwich and I enjoyed it with cole slaw slapped on top. Sauce was very tangy with a small kick to it.  One of my buddies got the brisket platter and it looked very good. He let me try a piece and it was very tender and packed with flavor.

I should have gone to McDonalds.

By the time we left though the crowd definitely picked up.I ordered an appetizer for my entrée. I went with the stuffed mushrooms and they were delicious! I only wish the portion size was bigger, but hey it is an appetizer. I was eyeing my associate meal though. Next time I will definitely try the Parm Burger.

I like a messy juicy beef.  This sandwich again was huge and served on that crusty bread.  The peppers were fire roasted with a little char and were the perfect accompaniment.  Both sandwiches were served with large home style fries that were so crispy, non-greasy and dusted with Parmesan cheese.  So good.  This restaurant elevates the standard sandwich and fries to a new level.  We were so full from the portion sizes that we took our cannoli and tiramisu cupcakes to go.  I highly recommend Ameritalia.  It was a great find and the mama couldn&#39;t have been nicer.  We loved it!"

We walked up to the front counter and a nice woman came out from the back. The cook/chef also came walking from out back. It just was not a very &#34;welcoming&#34; experience. The food was good; not great. I opted for the grilled cheese and &#34;jojo&#34; potatoes. The bread for the grilled cheese was a bit too thick but it had a decent taste. The jojo potatoes looked good but didn&#39;t have much taste and were too mealy. My partner choose the meatball sandwich. It had tons of toppings that hid the taste and made it hard to eat. He didn&#39;t like the fries at all.Perhaps it was what we ordered.

They seem homemade- not the good kind homemade.  Like the super amateur, we made cookies out of a box homemade.  You have to go here for their warm comfort meals.Not thrilled with their carry out food.  We ordered carry out twice and the food was underwhelming both times.  Pasta was overcooked and barely had any sauce on it. Flavor was lacking.  At least the food was still very hot when we brought it back home.

The presentation of the food and the shop are humble. The food is excellent and plentiful. It&#39;s not I could taste the melted cheddar in every bite of my Cavatelli and Cheese, and the pepperoni center of the breadsticks was delightful.

I love the Parm Burger here, it might be one of my favorite burgers in Chicago!My dock for it being only 4 stars is that, of all the times I&#39;ve been here, there is always only 2 people working: the Chef and the very nice lady in the front (both of whom I believe are both owners of the place). That wouldn&#39;t be an issue at all, if not for the fact that the wait can get long if there are more than 2 or parties trying to order. Having only one cashier and one cook, things can get backlogged and orders can end of taking a while.I&#39;ve only had a few other items on there menu outside of the Parm Burger: the meatball &amp; pepperoni side, orange chicken nuggets appetizer, and the Ameritalian. the Parm Burger was by far the best, and I&#39;d almost be willing to give 5 stars just for that.

The sandwich came out a few minutes later and was pretty good. The chicken breast was nice and moist, the bun was toasty and came with some lettuce and tomato. The real star here was the sauce. And lots of it, without this slightly peppery aioli, its a just a simple sandwich. What came along with it were some decent potato wedges with some crispy polenta scattered on top. Really, the polenta adds nothing to the dish, except for the fact that it dries your mouth out faster than a bowl of weed.For 10 bucks I&#39;d rather go get some chipotle and save a couple of bucks. But if you decide on coming here, its a decent enough place to spend your money."

Obviously. It was 10 at night and we were both craving Italian. This place was super close, had fab reviews, and delivered. Winning. Everything smelled and looked amazing when it arrived, but unfortunately even our ridiculous appetites couldn&#39;t fool us into thinking this was anything even close to a good meal. We ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and the bolognese with 2 extra bread sticks. The noodles were super rubbery and all stuck together like hard, mushy glue. Obviously we either got the noodles from the bottom of the pot or they were actually made of paste. The sauce had zero flavor and the breadsticks were reminiscent of something soft and squishy that had been dunked in a bowl of sawdust. Trust me, after eating here, you&#39;ll actually be craving Prego. Save your doll hairs for literally any where else."

They were both amazing.So we&#39;ve been meaning to go back for food. So then we went by on a gloomy afternoons for lunch. I got the chicken Parmesan and he got the spaghetti and meatballs. For a appetizer we got stuffed peppers because we were starving. The food was excelled and fresh. You can tell it was freshly made because of the food temperature it was piping hot. Now don&#39;t get me wrong this is not a fine dining up scale restaurant but the food quality is there. I recommend this place to anyone who likes Italian foods. The family that owns the place are very nice and the son is the chef. The pasta is fresh made pasta not that boxed stuff. The tomato sauce is not too salty and doesn&#39;t give you heart burn. The bread is freshly made as well. This place should be very popular also they have BYOB. I think they would attract more people if they served wine and cocktails however this place was amazing and I will be a returning customer :)

There thick cut potato wedges that comes with sandwiches / burgers are fresh and crispy as well.I have also tried the Chicken PLT Sandwich and Ameritalia salad (w/chicken) -- I would describe them fresh, juicy and tasty.Its a delightful cute little restaurant with a very pleasant team of people eager to accommodate your requests."

BOMMIN!! It was seasoned well and had a bunch of flavor. The last dish we ordered was the delux calzone.  The crust was super tasty and went perfectly with the side sauce.The woman even came up and asked how our food was-  that to me was the winner. Great customer service and awesome food.This is the perfect spot to get a bite to eat before a night on the town.  I will definitely come back here the next time I&#39;m in Chicago."

I was a little worried since I don&#39;t eat pork, but I had no problem choosing menu items. I came in with 4 kids. The cavatelli and cheese (without prosciutto) was perfect for the kids. It&#39;s like a mac-n-cheese. Kids also got the orange chicken nuggets, but they didn&#39;t like the sauce. And my older daughter made her own calzone with chicken because there wasn&#39;t one with chicken. My husband and I have big appetites and shared (well he ate most) the parmburger, Italian beef stromboli, and an ameritalia salad. Everything was great. It was a little pricey, but it&#39;s important to support local businesses, plus it&#39;s walking distance, which is great."

It was difficult to decide what to try, because everything sounded so good. Between the bf and I, we managed to try two types of Stromboli and two starters (the polenta fries and the stuffed mushrooms). The mushrooms were solid and the polenta fries were amazing. It is admittedly kind of hard to go wrong with polenta, since it is delicious, but these were a nice twist. They had a perfectly crispy exterior with a wonderfully creamy interior. Of the two Stromboli, (Italian beef, Sausage) the Italian beef was the clear favorite. The sausage was good, but not quite the star that the beef was. Also, I personally think the Stromboli would have been plenty large enough to share (and they already come nicely divided into two pieces), but we did not take that route, which unfortunately left us with absolutely no room to try any of their desserts.In short, I would definitely recommend this place, and would say you can&#39;t miss the Italian beef or polenta fries."

They have a great variety of things, all of which have been spectacular. Ranging from the Parm buger to the different Strombolis to the Cavatelli and Cheese, everything has been good. My go-to for an entree is normally the Deluxe Stromboli. Another must have are the polenta fries with a great honey-like dipping sauce. The portions are quite generous and normally I have enough left over to eat for left-overs the following day.The food is always out quickly, and the staff is welcoming.

The bun was nice &amp; crusty though. It&#39;s counter service so you order/pay food and server will bring your food out.

Ameritalia filled all that.ITALY MEET AMERICAAs the name suggests, several items blend the land of the Burger with Italian classics. My ParmBurger contained two Meat patties crusted in a crispy Parmesan shell and topped with a roasted Tomato and Basil leaves. All those toppings held together by the mild, yet flavorful Bun just blew me away especially when the cut of the Basil shot through. The Meatball and Pepperoni Calzone was more typical--it contained a lot of the wrapper but it wasn&#39;t overwhelming especially because you could add more flavor with the additional dipping sauce.The Cupcakes were very tempting. Each had a thick frosting with a Sour Cream texture while the Cake stayed moist. The Tiramisu was topped with Nuts and had great Coffee tones. The Cannoli Cupcake was also great.EXCELLENT PLACE AND SERVICEThe interior is very casual and seems well to attract the 20-40 year olds in the area. Local art covers the walls and flower vases add a nice touch to the tables. Has a Coffeehouse feel.

They were great, and the truffle honey oil adds a great flavor and nicely complements the fries. The stromboli was a bit of a disappointment - the bread was so hard it bordered on stale and was completely flavorless. The meat didn&#39;t have a lot of flavor either. Honestly, the only thing that made it worth eating was the super flavorful tomato sauce (although there wasn&#39;t enough of it) that they provide for dipping.The much-reviewed cupcake tasted like yellow cake mix to me, and not even freshly made yellow cake from a mix.

It was lightly (perfectly) breaded and was some of the most moist, flavorful, and tender chicken I have ever had. Absolutely delicious. They have a chicken item on the appetizer menu that apparently is the same style chicken with a different sauce...I will likely get that next time as well.  My meal was quite large and my leftovers will be lunch tomorrow. Highly recommended!"

I tried the Italian Beef Sandwich, which I realized was prepared from scratch and took around 5 minutes. The bread was hot and fresh, the beef was very tender and juicy, and the grilled banana peppers were otherworldly. Potatoes were also amazing and were fresh. I must also say the portions run rather large. And all this came at a nominal price of $10.I didn&#39;t have time to try their strombolis, which take a little longer than the sandwich, since they are prepared and baked fresh. Therefore I am certainly going back!How did I manage to miss this place all this time?!"

Wow!  Words cannot describe the amount of joy we BOTH felt once it hit our taste buds.  I also cannot rave enough about their Korean chicken wings.  It was perfectly seasoned with the right amount of spice and great portions.The service was good and it&#39;s in a great location with tons of free parking on the street.  The restaurant is also right off the 606 so it&#39;s very convieniet for any bikers, roller bladers, and fast walkers.I definitely reccomend this restaurant because there is a variety of food to choose from and you can explore many different Thai dishes that will rock your world."

The other day when ordering a veggie burrito, I saw this nice little nacho side with the daily special... and I asked if I could get the little nacho thing on the side. Without charging me extra, the guys gave me chips and a small tub of cheese and even jalepenos. Great gesture. Small things like that can make a difference.The veggie burrito itself is good. The second time I went, I asked for them to go easy on the grilled veggies, and it seems they didn&#39;t do that. Maybe their register system is very simple and doesn&#39;t allow for customized orders? IDK... But overall it&#39;s still good.Next time I want to try something else... like maybe the nachos?

For a whopping $8, I got a giant to-go thing filled to the brim with: lettuce, corn, pico, some amazing black beans, a generous helping of fajita veggies (my fav!), sour cream, cheese and of course, steak.

I was left wanting more, but to be fair, I feel the same after eating a Chipotle burrito (I have a big appetite).It soon was packed around noon and noticed that some customers were waiting quite awhile for their orders, so not sure how efficient their service is.Coworkers got the tacos and it was actually 3 tacos instead of 2, as stated on the menu. The red and green salsas on the tables were somewhat disappointing. Both were lackluster and needed more flavor and spice.Not a bad place to go but not amazing either."

There is a nice bright big screen TV on Sportscenter to distract you from the wait. All the tables were occupied when I arrived, but luckily seats opened up as I was getting my food.The special included rice and an avocado salad to accompany the Chicken Enchiladas which ended up being a decent amount of food for $7. The Enchiladas turned out a bit dry, but still had the necessary seasoning. I could&#39;ve probably mitigated it with some sour cream, but I&#39;m not a big fan of smothering my food with that stuff. Their house hot sauce packed a good kick, but the enchiladas was a bit disappointing. However, the avocado/salad that the included was pretty fresh and good (although basic), and the rice was acceptable (with a little help from the hot sauce).Overall, I would say the flavors are OK, but the textures are a bit off (which could be due to inexperience with dealing with heavy traffic lunch hours). This place is still very new, so maybe I&#39;ll give it another try in the future."

First of all.....CHEESE SAUCE??????   I&#39;m sorry, but if you&#39;re calling yourself a Mexican grill, you should NEVER, ever use cheese sauce!!  Cheese sauce is reserved for crappy festival nachos, or movie theater nachos.  But NOT at a Mexican food joint.  Everything else on the plate was great, but the cheese sauce ruined everything about the food and my experience there.While I will never go back there again for nachos, I try not to throw the baby out with the bathwater on any food establishment.  I always try to come back to try something different next time.  Perhaps there is something else that I will like there?I am not sure where to get good steak nachos (maybe La Cocina?) in the vicinity of my workplace.  If anyone can name a good place, I&#39;d be grateful!"

They have a very simplistic menu with the basics of taco&#39;s, burritos, taco salad and a burrito bowl type of thing.I got a steak burrito and it was delicious! Had steak, rice, cheese, tomatoes, and the basics. It was a pretty good size burrito and would have probably been able to split it and I would have been satisfied. That didn&#39;t happen though. I ate the whole thing. Something I liked was that they cut the burrito in half for you which makes it much easier to eat.The prices weren&#39;t bad but some things are a little high, like the chips and guac for $4.50.

First of all, our group of 4 only waited a short while to get a couple of tables together and we were getting help from the owner and another worker there. It was very sweet that they noticed and tried to do something for us. Despite the menu being simple there was plenty I wanted to try. I ended up going with the spicy fish that came on a bed of rice, salad, and guacamole. The fish was flavorful and spicy, the rice was very tasty, and the guacamole was solid. Also, it looks like they have refillable horchata - unheard of! I thought I might have had to order an appetizer or something to get full, but I was more than stuffed. They also give you a sample size of chips, and I really enjoyed the red sauce at the table. I totally want to come back and try the bowl, the chicken enchilada special, the burrito, and the tacos.

I stopped in today with two coworkers for lunch.The restaurant is very clean and the staff is very efficient. The menu is sparse with three burrito options, a few taco options and soups/salads.My coworkers ordered burritos and I ordered a tortilla soup. Since it was subzero outside, we decided to dine in. Perhaps because of the bitter cold the interior wasn&#39;t much warmer than the exterior. The food took about 7 to 10 minutes to come out. The burritos were about medium size in the soup was a decent cup.Upsettingly, it&#39;s hard to beat chipotle. Asada doesn&#39;t come close. The price points are equal to if not greater than chipotle and the quality and quantity aren&#39;t there. My coworkers burritos were underwhelming. My soup was ok, but I&#39;ve had much better tortilla soups.I very much wanted this establishment to be Bueno, but I&#39;ve learned my lesson and will stick with the tried-and-true for my americanized Mexican food.I&#39;d suggest skipping asada."

Due to the mob scene that the local Chipotle is, we needed a place like this.I have been there 4 times, and every time, the service was very fast, very courteous, and the food was of great and consistent quality.  Nothing negative to say whatsoever.Understand, this is not a fancy Loop joint. It is a burrito joint, and it absolutely excels at that.  Reasonable price, really good food.  For you idiots giving it a low star because your order got messed up once, or it is not comparable to Frontera Grill, please just sit down and shut up.  Thanks."

Came to Chicago for a 4 day rendezvous and visited this place twice. Hands down best filipino breakfast i&#39;ve had in my life. This place is easily missable, it&#39;s on the corner of a district that isn&#39;t so glamorous. Diamond in the rough comes to mind. Parking is just where ever you can find a spot in the neighborhood or street.Walked in, you can go left or right, plenty of seating and great for groups. The Today show highlighted the skirt steak breakfast and that&#39;s exactly what I ordered. To start, they give everyone a generous bowl of lugao which is a rice porridge, but mix in ginger, lemon and garlic to spruce up the flavor. So I ordered half skirt steak filipino breakfast. I kid you not the plate it came on was literally a serving tray (like 14&#34; diameter maybe) laden with the juiciest skirt steak, made medium rare as I ordered, a small side of steak sauce, garlic fried rice, two eggs on top of rice (anyway you like, but sunny side up seems to be the filipino way), a side of a tomato/cilantro/garlic salsa (tasted like ceviche but without the seafood) along with a serving of champorado (chocolate tapioca pudding, not sweet at all). All this for $12. Holy mackerel, this is a deal of a lifetime.Got to meet the owner, the actual Uncle Mike who was sweet to pull up a chair and hang/chat with us for like half an hour. He is there everyday, very involved in the running of this very successful establishment. he cooks and makes sure that you had the best experience ever. For a caucasian guy (he married a filipino lady), he can cook a mean filipino dish, and even picked up some of the filipino customs as well. He came back with more lugao for us to take home.Will always come back here whenever I&#39;m in Chicago. This has the overall five star experience for food and excellent customer service."

But I ended up going for the longanisa breakfast then stole some of my girlfriend&#39;s tocino off her plate. Completely fair trade. For those of you that can&#39;t decide they do offer side orders or you can go for a combo between some of the options as well. Get the best of whatever you like!Their platters are served with a bowl of lugao (rice porridge topped with fried garlic, scallions &amp; ginger), garlic fried rice, two eggs your choice (over easy FTW!), side of tomatoes with parsley (almost like a pico de gallo salsa but without any peppers), and chocolate rice/tapioca pudding.

Everyone in the restaurant looked happy, and those finishing up looked satisfied -- you know the look! ;)The moment our food was brought out I saw a sparkle in my boyfriend&#39;s eyes and his jaw immediately dropped at the sight of this HUGE PLATE that he was so ready to dig into. Everything came out perfect, the food smelled great, cooked perfectly, and tasted like all the raving words described to us before coming in!I am very thankful that I was there to see how happy my boyfriend got while eating his first Filipino Breakfast! Thank you!

I&#39;ve consistently gotten their tocino breakfast combo which is grilled cured pork shoulder with eggs, garlic fried rice, and a bowl of lugao (aka congee aka porridge). It does the trick everytime. I leave with a full belly and extremely satisfied. Their house coffee is, surprisingly, good! Like really, really good for a diner. I usually get 3 refills. Why not when it&#39;s free? Sometimes, maybe when they had the chance to eat breakfast before working, will give out free dessert! I got chocolate rice pudding once. It doesn&#39;t sound appetizing, but low and behold, i gulped it in a minute. My bf has gotten the bangus breakfast, which is the boneless marinated milkfish, and the longanisa breakfast - sweet chorizo sausages. Every breakfast combo comes with eggs, garlic rice, and a bowl of porridge which has a hint of lemon. Plates are HUGE so i always have leftovers. The grilled pork and sausages are only $9.95, milkfish was $14.95.Warning: I havent been to other filipino breakfast joints so maybe that&#39;s why i think so highly of Uncle Mike&#39;s, but i&#39;m really content with this place cuz it hits the spot, everytime."

I was very pleased.The service was equally good.  The wait staff represented many different cultures, not just Filipinos.  But they were all very knowledgeable about Filipino food.  And one of my favorite things about the whole experience was that when we were getting ready to leave, they offered us some more arroz caldo to go for free!  Far be it from us to ever turn down anything that was free.  We were expecting to get one more order.  But after waiting for it for a while and wondering why it was taking so long, they came out with four huge containers of it!  Wow!  We definitely got our money&#39;s worth!  Plus, I believe they were so eager to give it to us for free because they are very proud of the fact that their soup is made fresh, and so, like coffee, if it sits too long, they throw it away.  So if they can give it away instead of throwing it away, that&#39;s better.  So, kudos to them for both freshness and taking care of their customers.Overall, I love this place, and I will go back every time I am in the area!  Well done, Uncle Mike!"

I have been only been here twice but this place is easily my favorite breakfast place in Ukrainian Village. It has a very homey feel. The servers are all extremely nice.I&#39;ve never had Filipino breakfast before, but all my Filipino friends say that the breakfast is amazing, and I have to agree with that.Your meal starts with lugau, which is a Filipino chicken rice soup. The first time I went, they also had cabbage soup to offer. I ordered the marinated skirt steak - what they are well-known for. It was so juicy and was perfect with my over easy eggs.The second time I went, I ordered the sweet chorizo (I forget the actual name of it) and it came in 4 links. It probably isn&#39;t the best thing for my health, but it was the best thing for my taste buds. It had just the right amount of fat to be delicious.I have also tried the milkfish. It&#39;s a very interesting breakfast food choice, seeing that it is a whole deep fried fish. It was surprisingly good. A little dry, but I think the point is to pour the lemon garlic sauce that comes with it over it.They gave complimentary chocolate rice pudding. I was stuffed beyond belief at this point, but I ate it anyway. It was the best.I&#39;ll be back to try everything else on the menu!"

Nacho came back with some complimentary bread, beans, and rice porridge...which could have been a perfect small meal itself...we then ordered the combo breakfasts of longanesa (sausage) and Tocino (wine pork), and my buddy got longanesa and Bangus (fried fish) and it comes with garlic fried rice, 2 eggs anyways, and a chocolate rice.  The food came out and he asked if we wanted any more free porridge which was great, coffee refills timely, and I tell you, the meal was so yummy, and Uncle Mike came and talked to us!!!

The 4-star-rated FIlipino breakfast seemed to perfectly fit the bill. Yelp, you did me dirty this time.Arriving before 8, we were told to sit anywhere we liked, as only one other table was in use at that point. Our server immediately brought water and a bowl of lugow, a chicken and rice soup with some lemon slices, that was pretty watery and bland for our taste. Adding salt helped highlight the lemon and green onion flavors as garnish, but overall I felt it was under seasoned and would have preferred a bolder taste. For my main meal, I chose the Tocino (pork shoulder) and my fiance got the longanisa (chorizo). Both meals come with garlic rice, eggs, some salsa, and a small cup of chocolate tapioca pudding. We continued to be underwhelmed by the food; the garlic rice was good, but I thought it could have used even a bit more garlic. The pink-hued pork shoulder slices had a little more fat in the meat-to-inedible-fat ratio than I prefer, and reminded me of less flavorful Chinese BBQ spareribs in taste. My fiance felt similarly about the pink-hued sausages on his plate. The chocolate tapioca pudding, at the risk of repeating myself again, had a hint of cocoa taste, but ended up more closely tasting like watered-down instant hot chocolate at a large group event, and I just didn&#39;t enjoy the gummy tapioca with only a mild hint of sweetness; I have a thing about chewy food textures, and this set it off. They didn&#39;t overcook my over-easy eggs is the best thing I can say about what we ate.Despite the large portion sizes, from start to finish we felt like the taste of the food had been muted to about half of what it should have been; if Guy Fieri needed directions to Flavortown, I would point him far in the opposite direction. The service itself was quick, but we spent $30 for one of the most mediocre meals we&#39;ve ever eaten. We wouldn&#39;t eat here again."

The server did inform me that the price had gone up a few dollars from that which was listed on the menu. No problem.  I requested  my hash-browns &amp; toast well done and the steak medium rare. When order arrived , she  noticed that the hash browns were not well done , &amp; offered to have them further cooked. The steak was rare , so she took it back for further cooking as well.By the time my plate came back for the third time the eggs &amp; potatoes were cold!  The skirt steak , lukewarm.   While skirt steak tends to be a cut of beef that requires some chewing, my order had not been properly handled in the kitchen. A quick sear on the flat top and proper butchering would have helped . Even though I tried slicing on a slight angle across the grain, it was extremely difficult to chew. While my 1/2 order was more than ample in portion size , the texture made it very unpleasant . The marinade was perhaps a little too vinegary for my liking , and lacked salt.Overall, the staff here are extremely friendly and very helpful. The coffee , delicious. Was it an off day at Uncle Mike&#39;s today? Not sure . Maybe I&#39;ll come back and try the fried milkfish &amp; eggs. Maybe not."

I got pretty stoked for an authentic Filipino-American breakfast and so were my friends. The total count was ~ 9 people.The servers was kind and attentive, and the service was quick considering the large group we came with. The food itself was pretty good and definitely authentic but whether it was the large group or what, my bangus/tocino combo was lukewarm, something I wasn&#39;t too happy about. The taste was pretty on point though and the portions are truly Filipino.When it comes to large parties, they&#39;re usually seated in the back part of the restaurant which wasn&#39;t an issue until the waitresses were scraping off plates into a garbage can right next to our table! I understand the space-crunch but there was still a kitchen we were seated against and I was put off by bus-boy duties being handled barely a few feet away from our table. I know it&#39;s a casual atmosphere there but that was a little too close for comfort.Bonus: Maybe it was due to timing, but we got some extra arroz caldo to go since I think they were about to close soon."

Having never been to a Filipino Restaurant I knew this would probably be a DIFFERENT dining experience, and I was not mistaken. Before I get to my review of my breakfast entree, we were served a Lemon Chicken Rice Soup with Ginger. Soup before breakfast at 10:30am was different! The soup was very tasty, but I still felt the need to add a dash of pepper. I ordered the Tocino Breakfast which consisted of Anise Wine-Cured Pork Shoulder and eggs over a fried garlic rice. The deep red colored pork was shocking but AMAZINGLY tender and flavorfully SWEET. That was different - but good different. Then there were my over-medium eggs over the garlic fried rice. The garlic was a light garlic - not overpowering - as was the fried texture and taste. My somewhat goopy egg yolks were just as I prefer. Then there was the little cup of brown stuff which I thought was like refried beans. Boy was I wrong! I&#39;m not sure what it is called, but it was a cold, chocolate flavored, sticky rice pudding thingy. (Of course I didn&#39;t realize it was a cold item until after I blew on a forkful and put it in my mouth! lol) It was quite tasty! I ordered coffee, and again I didn&#39;t ask what kind they served, but it seemed darker - even with several creamers - and richer, yet not at all bitter. The portions were quite generous as well - I&#39;m not a small guy, and I ended up bringing half my pork and rice home as leftovers for tomorrow! My dining companions ordered the Tocino and Skirt Steak Combination With Eggs, and while they enjoyed their well prepared skirt steaks, they really enjoyed the Ticino even more. Service was good, attentive, solid. The price was great too - $9.50 for my meal, including free pre-meal soup, and leftovers! The decor is interesting, there is a sunshade hanging just inside the door, so if you are over 6&#39; tall be careful as you enter! Also there are a couple of stuffed monkey dolls hanging around the window shades and other chotchkies, sprinkled around the dining area. It&#39;s not the largest place so seating may be limited, but we did not have to wait at 10:30 on a Thursday. So if you are looking for a different take on diner food, try Uncle Mike&#39;s Place for a Filipino-American experience!"

Seating was no problem as it was adequate and a spacious restaurant! Yet, having been familiar with Filipino food, we came here hoping to indulge ourselves in the full-filipino breakfast experience; however, this is a distorted notion in one too many ways! First of all, from the moment you enter and get seated I swear from the waitress/waiter taking your order to the cook do not expect to see any hint of Filipino. The Lugaw(porridge-which is essentially congee)with chicken bits they serve would be tastier with some patis(fish sauce) and calamansi(Chinese orange). I absolutely enjoyed my Tocino and skirt steak combo[the best part wasn&#39;t the skirt steak, it was the pico de gallo and cilantro garnish on my plate and side of champorado(soft sweet rice in chocolate)]. My sister thought her Longanisa and skirt steak should have been cooked abit[I agree on the Longanisa(sweet chorizo) but I think they might have mixed up my medium with her well done]. Generally service was good as the waiter was able to find us some banana catsup and get us some patis for our lugaw, and they apologized and brought us a new batch of not spicy spam for my niece! Price was reasonable for portion! Ultimately this is an Asian-Mexican American fusion joint!"

The lugao soup was delicious.

The skirt steak was done precisely as I ordered it, tasted great with the marinade and I would highly recommend it. However bringing it down was the scrambled eggs on top of the dish. The eggs were not at all fluffy and, instead, were flat and dried out. The Chopped steak was overcooked and had a strange consistency.The biggest disappointment though was the bill. I was charged 10% more than the menu price for the skirt steak breakfast. The staff pointed out that the higher price was on the last line of a chalkboard that was behind my field of vision. I told them that it wasn&#39;t right to charge more than what was on the menu. I ordered from the menu. The argument continued, with the restaurant staff refusing to recognize it if the price is different than what it is for an item on the menu that a customer orders, then the customer needs to be advised that the time he places the order. He eventually they adjusted the bill, but it was very unpleasant."

We came for breakfast and felt like we ate a 9 course dinner. When you sit down they give you porridge with lemon. Why can&#39;t all Filipino places do this?? Then we all ordered our silog breakfast. We tried the pork chop and skirt steak. Both were good but the skirt steak was definitely the winner. The plate comes with garlic rice, your meat, egg, chopped tomatoes, and oatmeal. We even got champorado! How could this ever be considered breakfast! Uncle Mike outdoes himself here. He introduced himself and was kind and welcoming towards us. Why can&#39;t the Bay Area have a place like this???"

I got the Tocino (marinated pork shoulder) and Bangus (fish) combo platter. It came with lugao (congee or porridge), 2 sunny side up eggs, garlic fried rice and some chocolate oatmeal dessert. Unbelievable! With the generous portion size, it was all for I think $12. Definitely recommend and will definitely come back. Prepare to eat some heavy breakfast/brunch!Friend had the spam &amp; steak combo with the longanisa?(a sweet sausage) on the side. I had the chance to try all of them but still decided that the bangus and tocino were my favorite!What made my platter 10x better is when I mixed my sunny side up eggs with the garlic rice and added sriracha.

It was such a pleasant surprise to discover that not only was it everything we needed but also a unique experience. Food was delicious. When I came in, I made the mistake of declining the soup, which gets brought out to all patrons as soon as they sit down. Luckily, I corrected my mistake as soon as I saw the look on my husband&#39;s face after he had a sip of his soup. That little bowl of soup (just like Congee) was so great - I couldn&#39;t put down the spoon.I ordered milkfish and he got pork shoulder. Portions are huge and everything was delicious. Not only did it hit the spot, we felt like we traveled to the Philippines for an hour and hung out at a local joint. We will be back."

I am a filipino, so I will be bias with the review haha. First off, you get to sit wherever you want. Wait time during peak hours is not bad. Food selection is awesome! You get american breakfast and filipino breakfast. Awesome bangus (milkfish), longganisa (filipino chorizo), tocino (cured pork), skirt steak, and pork chop! Served first with lugao (filipino congee)! Serving size is huge for a typical brunch place so make sure you have enough room for food. Taste is amazing and very authentic! You get to have champorado at the end of the meal as well. Employees are amazingly friendly! As always, it&#39;s always better when you&#39;re on a date lol since it&#39;s not good to eat by yourself, sometimes."

And great service. Ordered a comsilog with Bangus and tocino which was more than enough for two especially since you are offered a complimentary serving of lugao (rice porridge) and ginataan (tapioca) for dessert. They even sent us with some free take home as the last customers.We arrived 10 minutes before closing but ended up staying over an hour conversing with uncle mike himself who pulled out a chair and talked to us of the history of how he started his Filipino restaurant with his wife. He brought us over a small plate of pancit and although we were full we could not resist. Uncle mike was also kind enough to offer tips on places to go and areas to visit. All around a great place.

Went here to try a Filipino style meal, and to support a family-owned local restaurant.The good:- Our waitress was very attentive, she was the best part of the whole experience honestly.-  Received complimentary lugao and a pulled pork dish at the start of our meal which was a nice gesture.- Grits were pretty good.The bad:- French toast was completely cold, bacon was awful and cold, bread was cold- One of the guys serving us had a runny bloody nose he kept wiping. Kind of gross when that&#39;s the guy bringing you your silverware (with no hand cleaning in between). I understand this isn&#39;t his fault, but why is management making him work while sick?- Same server also dropped a fork with food on it on my girlfriend&#39;s lap, getting food on her shirt. Once again, I don&#39;t blame him, looked like he was sick/worn out and should not have been working.- And to top it all off, the manager (John?) didn&#39;t seem to care at all about these issues when brought to his attention, just muttered a quiet apology as he took my money.I wanted to like this place and have a good homestyle Filipino meal, but there&#39;s just so many better options in Chicago for a delicious (warm) breakfast."

Behind the register you&#39;ll notice multiple flavors of SPAM in a can, sitting patiently waiting for consumption.The portions of food are HUGE and the quality is high for the price. My friend loved his omelette and my other friend loved her breakfast sandwich, though she was seriously weirded out by the pickles.As for my dish? I think I ordered wrong, and I&#39;ll try again. I absolutely LOVED my gigantic portion of garlic rice. It was silky, oily, super garlicky and just delicious. The two over easy eggs soaked beautifully in and honestly that would have been a perfect meal on it&#39;s own.The Longanisa and Bangus I ordered with it? I&#39;ll pass next time. The sausages were weird and kind of sweet and tangy. Not satisfying at all. And the Bangus... aka milkfish? It was gross. The menu described the fish as &#34;boneless marinated milkfish.&#34; The word &#34;marinated&#34; implied something moist, but no it was crazy dry... bordering on leathery and just tasted way way too fishy in the worst way possible.The rice sat with us all for hours.

The chefs here definitely know how to cook. Service was great as well. Our waitress, was very nice and attentive. Everyone was just bustin their asses on this busy day. One thing I want to get out here though is that I think Mike is not as nice as everyone thinks. When we came in before, wasn&#39;t that busy if I remember correctly, Mike was just throwing things everywhere in the kitchen and cursing out loud. Everyone out front could hear but didn&#39;t mind because we were all enjoying our food. I witnessed the same thing today except for the barrage of kitchen materials flying around. Mike you are an a-hole if you talk to your staff that way. Maybe that&#39;s why your restaurant seems understaffed. I&#39;m giving Uncle Mike&#39;s 4 stars for excellent food and great service.

We ended up with the longanisa combo breakfast with a side of potato pancakes. WOW.First, the pancakes: totally crunchy on the outside, lovely and soft on the inside. Killer with sour cream and apple sauce. Huge plate! Enough for 4 people, at least.The combo: incredible skirt steak with a side of steak sauce, and two fried eggs with rice. We also got champorado (not really worth the calories, though, the chocolate tasted like powder) and lugao (lovely rice/ginger/chicken porridge soup, although a little on the diluted side). We also got some sausage with the combo, and honestly, it was hard to stop eating! The portions are big and satisfying, and the food really is tasty.All in all, the food combo was killer, but we really came there for the atmosphere. Our server (the guy with the tattoos and lovely smile!) was SO nice, attentive, and made us feel right at home. The place is busy, with big families coming in looking for lots of seats. We loved the &#34;diner&#34; feel: free refills on coffee, people bustling around with big trays of food, satisfied little kids and their parents talking happily. A good option if you&#39;re looking for a low-key place to enjoy stellar Filipino (and American!) food.Uncle Mike&#39;s is a new favorite."

Portions are very sizeable and excellent for the price. But I have only had the combos, thus I have no opinion on the rest of the fairly large menu (sandwiches, omelettes, etc) because I&#39;m always too busy stuffing my face with the meats, egg, rice, and lugao.The complementary lugao (rice porridge) bowls vary in quality, some days they seem a little more watery than others, but overall are excellent. The fried garlic bits, green onions, occasional chicken pieces, and rice in a chicken broth garnished with a lemon is really the best way to start any meal on a weekend morning.The garlic rice is also very good. Light and when topped with a couple over-easy (or however you prefer) eggs, is perfect with the various meats.The pork shoulder is excellent. Sweet and savory with a bit of crispy fat. So good. The skirt steak is also quite good, well marinated and flavored. Both the half and full sizes are satisfying/filling and come with A1 sauce. The sausages are also delicious as sausages should be; definitely of the sweet Asian variety though. Don&#39;t be expecting the heavy salty punch of European encased meat mash. The combos also come with a small dish of diced tomato and onions that go nicely with everything else on the big plates.The milkfish is a little more disappointing. I&#39;ve only had it once and it was fairly dry and the flavor non-descript.Service is pretty good. Once, near the end of our meal, we got extra cabbage-borscht-like soup on the house for no discernable reason. I don&#39;t think they knew that I am a big fan of soup...but maybe they somehow did. Sometimes the kitchen seems to get pretty busy and the food takes a little longer to come out but I would never call the service here slow.We are usually seated within 15 minutes, even on a busy late Saturday morning. Parking is easy, or the 65 bus drops you off right in front of the restaurant. Place is easy to find. Bar seating and bigger tables in the back are available. Atmosphere is bustling and feels very much like a comfortable hole-in-the-wall I would find in Asia or Los Angeles.4 stars for great food and even better value."

Comfort food-esque frealz.  All for $10? Nothing makes for a better Sunday than this.They serve up a soup beforehand (arroz caldo, no?) which I devoured.  I love that stuff.  We were also treated to some longanisa sliders (aka pieces of longanisa on a pretzel bun).If you&#39;re not feelin&#39; the Filipino breakfast options, they also have your typical American breakfast stuffs (eggs, bacon, omelets, pancakes) and lunch stuffs (burgers, steak sandwiches, soups).  Very diverse menu and very reasonable prices!   You can also order things a la carte (like, an egg and a piece of spam. I saw this happen.) if you feel like trying some items, but aren&#39;t sure how you&#39;ll feel about it.  Yum!"

I usually order tocino or longanisa. This time I opted to order a half of skirt steak. I asked if it was similar to tapa and was informed &#34;it has a sweet taste.&#34;  I gave it a try. I am disappointed because I&#39;ve had tapa before from other places and this is not tapa at all. The way this skirt steak was marinated and cook has a Hispanic flair in it. It is not Filipino.The lugaw is amazing. It comes with any breakfast order, I believe. If you dine in, you get champorado as a desert. It comes with the main dish. I guess if  it&#39;s take out, this is not included because both of my orders for take out did not have it. I was looking forward to it. In the end, it&#39;s a place in the city to get Filipino food. I will just stick to tocino or longanisa next time."

I&#39;d never had Filipino cuisine before, and they have both that and standard American fare. This is definitely the place to eat outside of your comfort zone if you&#39;re new to Filipino food!The lugao (soup with chicken, rice and garlic) is made fresh daily and it&#39;s delicious! Tastes like Greek avgolemono soup, but with yummy fried garlic bits on top! Comes with all eat-in meals.Be warned about the Longanisa &amp; Tocino breakfast--it&#39;s HUGE! Anise Wine-Cured Sweet Chorizo (not spicy) &amp; Pork Shoulder (similar to Chinese spareribs) with eggs, garlic fried rice and salsa-like mixture with fish sauce and vinegar, and a cocoa sticky rice pudding. (The pudding wasn&#39;t standard accompaniment, just a bonus amuse (inter)bouche, and not super sweet.) It was all terrific!For the less adventuresome, the Monte Cristo sandwich was great--griddled to perfection and delightfully melty.The thick-cut slab bacon was tasty and not crazily salty, as bacon goes. (I mean, it&#39;s bacon, so it&#39;s salty, but the thickness makes it meaty and tasty!) and perfectly cooked--crispy, but not burned.Service was terrific--we never had to ask for coffee or water refills, and at the end of the meal they came around with another amuse (post)bouche of a hot oatmeal/cinnamon/banana/apple dessert!A great time was had by all with what was, for us, quite a culinary adventure!"

I try and avoid the longganisa because you only get 3 links and I feel like that&#39;s not enough compared to some of the other choices, though it is delicious. I&#39;ve also gotten the skirt steak and tocino.  Both are good and you get a lot more bang for your buck.A few times I&#39;ve had bad service here, there&#39;s like extra people not in uniform that help out but sometimes just hang out, not really sure what they&#39;re doing. A few times I ended up just sitting there for a n extra 10-15 minutes just waiting for a waiter to come back. Though this last time, they were pretty good with the water refills.

After she took our order and waiting about 20 minutes, she came back to tell me that the food was on its way. We waited another 20 minutes before receiving a simple Benedict and croissant sandwich. WTF! That wasn&#39;t the worst part. The worst in watching our waitress approach everyone else to see how they were doing and left us in the wind. When the food arrived, she came by and saw that we were clearly annoyed. She said sorry and said she would come by with more coffee. No coffee anywhere.When we finally asked for the check, she stopped by and was like &#34;so is there you want to discuss about the service?&#34; I told her what she did (or better yet, what she didn&#39;t do) and walked out.Oh yeah, and the food was meh.

To her credit, she went and found out, but shouldn&#39;t a server know the menu?  She didn&#39;t stop by very often and we had to track her down for water refills.  In addition, the coffee was seriously gross.  I had to send it back.  I am not a coffee snob by any means!  I&#39;ll happily chug fast food and gas station coffee, so if I had to send it back for its foul taste rest assured it was exceptionally bad.I have high hopes that this new Son of a Butcher will get over the bumps in the road and settle into a nice, neighborhood brunch spot.  It just makes me sad to lose the exceptional restaurant it used to be.  If only they had changed the name..."

Same with coffee refills.My main dish came out and had the wrong side. Instead of just bringing the correct side, they took the entire meal away and brought it back five minutes later with the correct side.

I&#39;ve been a vegetarian for 13 years. NOT. OK.The waitress gave me a confused apology, took my plate away again, and after another 10 minutes, I received another entree (but again, with the wrong side - shocker).I felt nauseous and just wanted to get out of there, so we asked for our check, which was $45. Apparently she had given us the wrong check, and instead of clearing it with us that it wasn&#39;t actually $45, she proceeded to run the card for our $72 tab, and just brought it back without a word on the $30 difference. She also conveniently left out the itemized bill out so we had to ask for that.On that note, I&#39;ve worked in the service industry for yearrrs and don&#39;t expect anything free, all those other thing could just be attributed to shitty service, but feeding a vegetarian meat is probably worthy of a free entree, drink or 10% off the tab. ANYTHING more than an &#34;oopsies&#34; apology.Also, this wasn&#39;t our problem, but the girls at the table next to us found a RUSTY NAIL in their mimosa carafe after they finished the jug. The waitress claimed was foil from the top of the champagne bottle. It was heavy enough to be clanking around - definitely not foil...Also, another shocker, she gave us back the wrong card. which we didn&#39;t realize until later, so we had to go back to this dumpster fire.From the few bites I had, the food was decent..."

It tasted okay, it was pretty, but nothing really stood out.  Not as flavorful as I had hoped, like all the flavor melded together.  Bummer.The rosemary orange biscuits, with housemade chorizo gravy, and pickled golden raisins.  To be honest, the raisins were the best part.  Other than the biscuit being cut out from a pig shaped cookie cutter that was cute, again, the flavors missed the mark.  The chorizo was slightly tastier than the lamb sausage in the other dish.  The biscuits were too orangey and not flaky or buttery, maybe a tidbit over baked.  Blah.  Overall, uneventful.  &#34;(GONG)&#34;***GONG - a reference from the Gong Show, when someone would get gonged because it&#39;s so bad, it no longer deserves attention"

Fast forward a couple of weeks later and my fiancé happened to post a link on my FB wall of their Butcher Platter that they were promoting on their FB. It looked delicious and so the next evening we went to dine there with some friends on a Sunday night.Here&#39;s some bulletin points:-Terrible communication between employees-Lack of ingredients for their special cocktails-Uneducated about their own menus-Half chicken was undercooked. Yes, still raw...-OUT OF HALF of the butcher platter that they were promoting on their own Facebook.I&#39;ll give our scatter brained server the benefit of the doubt in hopes it was her first day.But why would you promote dishes if you can&#39;t have enough supply and demand?? And who was the lead cook sending out undercooked chicken?? You&#39;ve barely been open and are already inadequate in food preparation.The best part about this place were the Ron Swanson Tots. Period.I&#39;ll never return, and the next time I think about it I&#39;ll just remind myself that Masa Azul has great cocktails and is right around the corner."

There was so much that we got to experience at this new BBQ joint in Logan! First our server appeared to be frazzled during every interaction at our table. It took around ten minutes for two drafts beers to arrive (during A slow Sunday evening), at which point the server had forgotten who had ordered what. Our friend attempted to order the whiskey strawberry lemonade, but apparently that was a &#34;mistake&#34; on the menu. His alternative cocktail was delivered fifteen minutes later (and no, the occupancy of the restaurant had not in fact increased). The rest of our party showed up to order more cocktails, that took another fifteen minutes to arrive. By this time we were all ready to order! Now, we get to discover that &#34;we are out of the ribs and wings, and oh you wanted creamed corn - we are out of that too!&#34;  This was followed by more more confusion over who ordered what drink and food. Needless to say we were MORE than ready to wash away our disappointment across the street, with a cocktail from Masa Azul, who offered everything on their menu that they said they would, with finesse! Son of a Butcher has some serious room for improvement if they intend to compete with the other hip restaurants of Logan Square.P.S. The reason i included an additional star: the Ron Swanson tots were legitimate."

We live right down the street and saw this place driving a few times and had always wanted to try it. It&#39;s a small little spot, they had a DJ playing in there front, the music was good for brunch, mellower and hip hop style at a good volume so you have no problem talking to the people youre with. The décor is really cute, about 7-8 booths against the wall and a bar you can sit at, like I said it&#39;s relatively small. We sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender Stephen for a bit, turns out we walked in on the first day of their official brunch! What luck!Now on to the food, sooooo goooood!!! I got the Brunch and Turf, which is steak, 3 bacon wrapped shrimp smothered in BBQ sauce, potatoes, eggs and toast. It was so delicious! That is the only way I ever want my shrimp made again. My roomie got the Loan Star Benedict, also very very good! I highly recommend this place and we will definitely be returning for brunch and to check out their dinner/cocktails."

Well, that was my experience at Son of a Butcher. I saw all the hype on Facebook. Read the reviews on Yelp, and it looked amazing. So I was convinced. Then, I saw there were two pages on Yelp for this spot. One had 4 stars and the other had 3 stars. Which had me confused and it didn&#39;t make sense. But, I&#39;m adventurous, like to try new spots all the time, so I decided to go with my fiancé, her cousin and my mother.At first glance, the place is nicely set up. The bar overtakes the area when you walk in, which is good, because it is a tavern. We were seated promptly but I noticed that they were not too busy for a Saturday night at 7:00 pm. Anyways, it took a little while for us to get menus or service, approximately 15 mins before our waitress come by and asked us if we wanted anything off the menu. But, she was pleasant and it seemed like she was overwhelmed. So we proceeded to order. My mom had a Michelada and so did I. My fiancé had the &#34;son of a  margarita&#34; and her cousin had a regular beer. They were out of a lot of beers and the beer she ordered said was available, then we were informed it wasn&#39;t and we were still charged for ordering it.The Micheladas were less than average. Tasted like a little bit of Bloody Mary mix was thrown in with some ice and beer. Nothing to write home about. The &#34;son of a margarita&#34; was pleasant and had the hints of lime as the drink stated. Good drink. Although I&#39;ve had better margaritas (i.e. Del Toro).We ordered some appetizers and had the Poblano Mac and Cheese and the Piggy Pops. The Piggy pops came in and they were pretty good. Only gripe was that they were a little cold. But otherwise the taste was great. Just wish they would have put more salsa on the platter. Seemed like they drizzled it on but there wasn&#39;t enough to go around. The Mac and cheese had decent taste to it but nothing great. The cheese sauce was watered down and it tasted more like pasta than anything else. I wish they would have roasted the peppers or done something more with them because the flavor was very mild. Anyways, more cheese is needed on a Mac and Cheese plate please.We then ordered our entrees and my mom had the &#34;Straight out of DF&#34;. Her skirt steak was lackluster. I&#39;ve had better skirt steak at your run of the mill Mexican restaurants. The skirt steak was chopped up and mixed in with the onions and peppers. The plate comes with tortillas and they were super soggy and seemed like they were heated in a microwave oven then thrown on the plate. For the sides she had guacamole and frijoles charros. The guacamole was good, nothing special. The frijoles charros had good taste but seemed like they had tomato sauce added to them. We&#39;re Mexican and we never add tomato sauce to out frijoles charros. Everyone else ordered burgers and I had the Pombazo-Style burger. I was so excited about having this burger. It looked amazing in the pics and the description of it made it seem like a stellar burger. From the price, (i.e. $15) one would assume you would get a great dish. But it was very disappointing. The bun was dipped in the guajillo sauce, which is cool, but after the first bite, I wasn&#39;t impressed with the taste, and my hands were now drenched in sauce. Something I didn&#39;t think about before I ordered. The beef was below average although it was cooked to my liking. I like my burgers medium. It had little flavor and seasoning to it. The burger came with a bunch of lettuce, although no where in the description does it say that the burger comes with lettuce. The carnitas were ok. Nothing great. I also had a hard time finding the grilled onions. I probably found two strings between all the lettuce. Overall I&#39;d give it a 2/5 stars. Very disappointed. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever go back to this place."

We ordered 6 wings, which were good, but only received 5.The menu says that the carne asada entre with 2 side dishes is meant for two people so we ordered it. While the entre was good it was only about 2-3 tacos worth of meat with all of the additions. They must have literally used about 3-4 ounces of actual meat. The two sides were small enough for only one person per side. This was almost $20 for this fucking nonsense.WTF? The only thing we enjoyed here was the music. I do not recommend this place."

It really wasn&#39;t so tasty and the best part was missing - the bacon. Also, I guess I&#39;m just not a shoe string fry kinda gal. They are good for what they were if you like those.

We got seated immediately and ordered our drinks and food. Sadly, they were out of the &#34;piggie by the pound&#34; so I got the spaghetti while my friends got their chicken sandwich and regular burger. We also shared the bone marrow between four people. The drinks came out quickly while the food, on the other hand, came out really slowly. I loved the moscow mule but you can never go wrong with a moscow mule.The bone marrow came out and there were three marrows. The portion is a lot and don&#39;t be afraid to ask for more bread. The bread was good but it was salted and it got too salty for me.My spaghetti was also really salty..I kept having to drink water to dilute my taste buds. I got to try the chicken sandwich and that was meh. The chicken sandwich at Popeyes is probably better than this. And the fries were mediocre.Another thing was they offered ketchup in spoonful size. We kept having to ask for more ketchup and that was a bit annoying.Service was amazing and I love the ambiance and decor but the food, not that great. And it was a bit on the pricey end.."

I had simpler tastes and my idea of a nice dinner was going to Baker&#39;s Square. So brunch was one of those terms like aioli or molecular gastronomy that didn&#39;t really resonate with me at all. After Son of a Butcher&#39;s Cochon Brunch, I&#39;m kinda glad I&#39;m in the know.Sam and I decided to come in on a Saturday morning around noon. It was raining a bit outside so the outdoor seating along Richmond St. were empty. I can imagine it would be a pretty sweet spot to grab some food on a warm night though. On the inside the decor kinda reminded me of steampunk a little bit. I could be way off here but there were a lot of brass and wood finishings. Plus there were these chairs that almost looked like they had gears on the legs. You could tell some thought went into the style of this place. Plus, the murals they have going on outside are pretty neat too. I figure this shot has been taken a hundred times before but this greets you as you walk up.Being the cochon (pig) brunch, I kinda had to go with the Piggie by the pound. Sam went with the Beef Navel Eggs Benedict, classic brunch food. Sam said that her eggs Benedict were good, I tried a bit and the yolks and hollandaise running into the muffin made it a really rich bite. The star though was the Piggie by the pound. You get a serious pile of pulled pork with some corn tortillas and I decided to add-on some almond chimichurri for good measure. The pork was super tender but there was still some pieces with a bit of a crunch to them and then there were some fatty bits mixed in too. Wow is pretty much all I have to say. If you come here for brunch and you don&#39;t try this, you&#39;re doing it wrong. I will say that it can probably feed 2 people and it was only $11 when I went. That&#39;s an awesome deal. Since I was eating at a tavern I also snagged a Goose Island Green Line.There were just a few nits to pick though. Sam came in wanting to try the biscuits and gravy and the spuddies on the side but they weren&#39;t ready yet. That was kind of unfortunate since it was already an hour after they opened. Aside from that, I&#39;d say Son of a Butcher was a solid 3.5 out of 5 for me. With Fat Rice across the street and Longman &amp; Eagle a few blocks away, Son of a Butcher has some high profile neighbors, but I think it holds it&#39;s own. Sam and I would definitely recommend this place to someone on the hunt for a meal in Logan Square."

I made reservations on Open Table earlier that same day and was able to easily get a reservation. When I first arrived, our table wasn&#39;t ready, but one of the hosts made sure to keep us updated on how much longer it would be until we were seated. Probably waited around 15 minutes, but I made myself at home at the bar while I waited. Their drink menu includes plenty of beers, Around 5 or 6 cocktails, and a few wines. I had two cocktails that were whiskey based (I forget the names of them unfortunately), but they were well worth the $10 and potent.To eat I had the braised beef meat pie dish. This dish included 3 pastries stuffed with tender seasoned braised beef and a gouda cheese sauce on top. This dish was very flavorful and is ideal if you aren&#39;t too hungry. My boyfriend got the lamb meatloaf with a sweet potato puree. The meatloaf is a better fit if you are wanting a full meal. I tasted the lamb meatloaf, and it paired perfectly with the sweet potato puree.The service we received from the staff was mostly positive, but our waitress seemed to be kind of in a hurry to get us out of there. We had a 9pm reservation, and the place doesn&#39;t close until 3am, so it was a little weird.  Maybe she was tired or was almost done with her shift.  Since I had good experiences with the host, bartender, and other support staff, I wouldn&#39;t let my experience with her detour me from coming again though."

The pumpkin was a great choice..I highly recommend if you like a little heat in your meal.If in the area, I will go again... Nice all in all..."

I was here this past weekend, and I must say I was a little disappointed with the service. Upon arrival, we were seated right away, which is always nice considering this place has been getting really popular. We sat down at this booth/table which was super close to other people but oh well, it was fine. We waited about 10 minutes for our server to come and greet us, which again I understand, they get busy I&#39;m not their only customer; however, I&#39;m pretty sure one of the managers (girl with long hair to the side and a hat) saw us sitting down for a good while, I&#39;m talking about she made eye contact with us and she didn&#39;t approach us and couldn&#39;t crack a smile. We were then approached by our server, a really nice guy, and he made it all better but it still sucked to have waited almost an hour for a decent service.Good cocktails and food, definitely sitting at the bar next time."

Our excitement was quickly diminished by the lack of service and communication. Not only did we wait 20+ minutes for our drinks we ended up walking out when it hit the 1 hour mark for our food to arrive. While watching other tables walk out we still had a glimpse of hope that our food would arrive. When it did not arrive, we asked our server to cancel our food order and we would settle up our drink bill -- 10 minutes later without a drink bill we begrudgingly left a $20. As we walked to the door, other tables applauded our bravery for doing what they wish they would have done too.  I would leave zero stars but that&#39;s not an option.Expectations are the building blocks for disappointment.Get it together SOB. So much wasted potential."

Disappointment was not an option.We were immediately welcomed by very friendly waitstaff and I instantly fell in love with the decor. Think Restoration Hardware meets Something. Basically, just a cool, open space.As with all dining experiences, libations come first. The wine/cocktail/beer selection was extensive so there are definitely plenty options. Without thought, I gravitated towards the Smokin&#39; Rose: a fruity, blackberry smoky mezcal-y concoction that was pure liquid sunshine.After quite the dilemma as there were so many delicious options, we opted for the hummus. Probably the best I have ever had. It was so fresh that you could taste the cumin and coriander and perhaps a slight hint of orange zest. It was accompanied by warm, perfectly charred pita bread and every bite was delectable. The pickled onions were also a good addition to this dish and it was a beautiful presentation. I wish this moment lasted longer.Now for the meat option. I mean, Son of a Butcher has pretty high standards to live up to with a name like that. But no problem. They did it.Get the Lamb Merguez hot dog. It comes with grilled apples, sage and a spicy mustard. Amazing flavors and ingredients that married each other and I was there to witness it. After each bite, something was happening to my heart. It was becoming full, right with my tummy. That is always a good sign.Finally, the chef Frank, is amazing. He introduced himself to us and personally made it his mission to ensure that we were having a great experience. A modest man with an impressive résumé. He knows what he is doing and is passionate about it and is definitely taking food to another level. A great individual who cares about food, the restaurant and its patrons. What more could you want? And the best part, it shows.And when we left that night, it made me wish that I was the Daughter of a Butcher. Enough Said?"

I have to say I think this was an EXCELLENT idea to get the residents of Avondale &amp; Logan Square involved and excited about the opening of their restaurant. Really smart marketing on their part, so kudos! Plus the whole event went very smooth and was seamless from what I could see as a customer.I made a reservation through OpenTable and it appears they will continue taking reservations. They have a limited amount of tables so if you plan on going to eat, I would highly recommend making a reservation. Other than the few booths (which are super chic &amp; comfy), it&#39;s standing room only at the bar. Interesting approach to not have stools or seating at the bar. Overall though, I loved the decor and atmosphere of SOB (is this okay to write in a review!? I feel dirty!!!)Service was excellent throughout our stay with multiple people checking in on us and making sure our glasses were filled and our bellies were full.I was quite happy with their draft list. Though not huge they had nearly 100% local breweries on tap - Solemn Oath, Off Color, Lagunitas, 5 Rabbit, Half Acre, Revolution, Pipeworks and Marz. I highly appreciate supporting our local breweries and loved that that&#39;s the approach they are taking. Not only that, but they don&#39;t have the standards from these breweries on tap. Sure we all know Anti Hero, 5 Lizard and Scurry are great...but awesome to be able to try some NEW brews. Beer prices aren&#39;t atrocious either ranging from $5-7 for the tap beers. On top of the draught beers, they have bottles of some of the standards plus some unique things like sours! You&#39;re after my heart, SOB. And don&#39;t worry hipsters, they have PBR, Old Style and Old Milwaukee.Short version of my beer gushing, I&#39;m down with their liqs selection.Hey Sarah! That&#39;s all fine and good about drinks...but this place is called Son of a BUTCHER!!! What about the food?!?!Yea, yea, over eager beavers...I&#39;m getting there!The bites I was able to preview last night:Coriander Crusted Goat Cheese Fritter, Apple Compote $8 - These little guys pack a punch and I don&#39;t recommend eating them on their own, the goat cheese will overwhelm you. Doused in the apple compote though, it makes for a fun and tasty bite.Rice Cracklings, Salsa Verde, Pickled Vegetables $6 - Not an overly exciting dish but if you need something clean and non-threatening to munch on while sipping suds, this starter may be calling your name. My friend loved all the pickled veggies that came with the dish.Lamb Merguez Hot Dog, Grilled Apples, Sage, Spicy Mustard $13 - Loved the lamb sausage! The chunk of apple was huge so they may need to cut them up a bit more in the future but the flavors went together very well in this dish and I could see myself ordering this on the regular.Chistorra and Fried Oyster Po&#39;boy, Cucumber, Yuzu $13 - I had never had chistorra before and love trying new food items. That little sausage was probably my favorite meat of the entire evening!Hog Wellington, Oyster Mushroom Duxelle, Smoked Lemon Hollandaise $18 - I can see the potential in this and I definitely want to give this another try in the full dish form. The meat in this wellington seemed a bit dried out but I&#39;d like to attribute that to the tiny portion.One thing I really am enjoying about the Son of a Butcher menu is the great balance of flavors. They use strong ingredients but offset them with something more calming paired in the dish. I also was seeing some flavor combinations I haven&#39;t before.Official opening is June 18th! Their Cochon brunch menu looks awesome &amp; will be served Saturdays &amp; Sundays from 11am-3pm. I can&#39;t wait to try the brunch and some other menu items. Being just a couple of blocks away from home for me, I&#39;m hoping to make this a regular hit up spot.Welcome to the &#39;hood, Son of a Butcher! Bonus points for the company email (info@thatsobt.com) and the gratis shaved ice outside! That was some amazing lime ice!"

However, that&#39;s not how the cookie crumbled this time around.Our waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu and very friendly. She had great suggestions and was checking in on us in good intervals.However, my issue comes with the food: both financially and where portions are concerned. The fritters are delicious, but for $8 I was expecting enough food for two people. My fiancé and I both ordered specials, which I really wish we would have known the price of before ordering. Each special came out to close to $35 dollars. Now, I&#39;ve been to places with $35 dollar specials. I get it. Sometimes you gotta pay for something a little extra. But these specials were pretty standard, sloppily organized plates. They tasted fine. And I guess overall I&#39;m not crazy disappointed with them, but I&#39;m super salty that they didn&#39;t list prices for these items (like almost every other restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to).Our bill came out to well over $100 for two people. To put that in perspective, Parachute (a Michelin star rated establishment-less than a mile away) was the exact same price for world class food."

But if a place like this can&#39;t make it, then the whole neighborhood deserves to drown in PBR.From the moment we got there, it was a great impression. Really fun and thoughtful decor with intimate little booths. This venue would be great for private events too.The drinks were big hits. I got the Smoking Rose, which puts mezcal front and center with just enough blackberry to balance the flavor without being too sweet. My partner got the Butcher&#39;s Mule, which opts for rye instead of vodka and has a strong minty punch to it. Also delicious.Foodwise, she got the Lamb Merguez meatloaf, which from the bite I had, was delicious and complex. I opted for the Ramen, which seems like a little bit of an oddball on this carnivorous menu, but then again, going for the oddball item is not a bad strategy: if the chef thinks it&#39;s worth breaking &#39;theme&#39; for, it must be good. That rationale paid off, because this bowl of ramen, with a rich, meaty broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and the added goodies of hunk of pork belly and a soft boiled egg, goes toe to toe with any dedicated ramen house in the city. Yeah, I said it.We also got to chat with Dave, the manager, at some length about the Cubs, the neighborhood, and New York (where he grew up and we recently moved back from). Talking to him sealed this place for me. It&#39;s not all that hard to get a good meal in Chicago. But as the food scene here continues to grow, you want to support the places where hardworking people create a great experience in an authentic and earnest way. This is one of those places. Now go give them your business."

The experience for brunch yesterday was a bit awkward and something strange was happening behind the scenes. On our arrival, we were able to get a great spot outside for 10 people immediately (which could be taken as a &#34;sign&#34; by some). We had some jam that was on our table from the previous customers that we had requested multiple times to be wiped off because the bees were coming for it... it was under the table so the person that was sent out to clean it up didn&#39;t see any &#34;spills&#34;. The servers we had were great and they were doing the very best that they could given that apparently there was something happening inside the restaurant that was causing them to close down an hour and a half early during Sunday Brunch. They ran out of champagne for our mimosas after we ordered one carafe. Some of the other items weren&#39;t available as well... I forget what they were off the top of my head. The food was just &#34;ok&#34; - I had the Texas Benedict. There wasn&#39;t much flavor to it at all so I had to add my own. Everyone at the table had the same opinion, the food was just OK at best. It wasn&#39;t bad but it wasn&#39;t great. Anyway - it seems that something needs to be sorted out because this place has really good potential."

It&#39;s a nice addition to the neighborhood.It&#39;s a self proclaimed &#34;old man bar&#34; with gastropub-pub style food. Pretty good beer list, but no cocktail menu (differentiates this place from the rest of the hood and fits with the old man bar thing). They bring out a small plate of sliced meat as you sit down, which is a very nice touch.The food was good here. I&#39;m interested to see how the menu evolves over time. I sampled the lamb tartare, which was different than I expected with a nice curry flavor and creamy texture. The bone marrow was good, as you would expect, but nothing unique. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the goat cheese fritters, not that they were bad but just not notable enough for me to order them again. The Hog Wellington was delicious, but it was served on a tiny plate which was very strange. I had a bite of the &#34;no beef&#34; mushroom Italian beef knock-off and thought that was really good, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of the thin fried potatoes. I could see the sandwich menu being a go-to for me here. Typically I wouldn&#39;t be so specific in my review notes, but this place is new enough that maybe they can make slight adjustments and become a great spot.The service was super friendly, as I expected from a new place trying to win over their first customers.

It did not have ham in it. Instead it was turkey meat. Instead of butter, our toast was served with a side of mayo. When we finally received the check the server charged for 2 cups of coffee. My husband ordered coffee but was not told at any point there was a charge for refills. It was a disappointing experience to stay the least. It&#39;s too bad because the dinner menu looked great.

My wife and I had dinner there shortly after it opened. The lamb tartare was fantastic, and so was the beef neck that I ordered. My wife is still talking about the mussel and meatball dish she had! Delicious!This past weekend we were looking for a place to eat on our way to the farmers market and popped in here. Service was good and friendly. She had the farm fresh eggs and I had the lamb sausage. Both excellent. We even had a chance to chat with Frank, the chef. Highly recommended."

The bone marrow app was barely enough for 4 people to even get a taste of. No one at my table wanted to finish their entree, which included the ramen and meatloaf. My steak &amp; frites was fine, but certainly not worth charging $26 for. Seemed understaffed as well, plus we had to wait half an hour despite making reservations."

Also excellent were the beef tongue and lamb merguez sandwiches, and vegetarian wise, the goat cheese fritters and rice cracklings, which were pretty much the most accurate representation of chicharron in vegetarian form I&#39;ve ever seen, served with an earthy salsa verde speckled with an authentic escabeche. The food was exceptional.Service was kind of what you&#39;d expect. Hipster whatever, who cares. Vibe was good, eclectic art and wallpaper, could use a cosmetic cover on the heating ducts. Good place to eat, check it out and ignore the inept reviews...and Mike Sula, he can be a dick with his reviews. A smart dick, but still a dick. ;)"

The food is great and the cocktails were wonderful BUT ... The service was rotten - absolutely terrible.  We visited 4 days after the grand opening.  Ten minutes after we placed our order we were informed they were out of ribs - at 4:30pm?  Why wouldn&#39;t the wait staff know this ahead of time.  Service was slow ... our appetizer didn&#39;t show up until after our dinner.  There wer 4 of us - two entrees came out ... Then mine.  I ordered tater tots but my sandwich was served with fries.  Instead of leaving my meal they removed it ... Nothing like a Luke warm pork sandwich to replace the fries.  My meal returned ... Then the appetizer (thank goodness) because my friend didn&#39;t have his entree yet.  Finally ... the final sandwich showed.  Our wait staff was apologetic but not attentive - came to the table only once to check our drinks and water.  No ownership of our issues and yes - we payed full price for crappy service.  Sorry Whisk.  You really didn&#39;t care or want our business.  We won&#39;t be back.

Service was excellent and the food even better. The vibe and decor immediately appealed to me. Good tunes in the background.Food:  Complimentary ham with a giardiniera right when we were seated. Very delicious and caused an intense craving to try out their brunch on my next visit. Summer squash to start, the beef tongue gyro, and the lamb shank. The only criticism I would give was the summer squash was a little salty. But we still ate all of it. We planned on sharing the two main dishes. We ate about half of the beef tongue gyro and barely made a dent in lamb shank. All the dishes were incredibly flavorful with unique spins on what you might traditionally expect.Although I insisted my friend take the leftovers home, I was pleasantly surprised to see that I &#39;forgot&#39; (K - if you stumble across this review it really was an accident) to give them to her and I got to relive this delicious meal the next day.Disclaimer: Although the chef and manager may have brought us some free shots it is very minimally impacting my 5 star rating.I will definitely be back. Maybe to writing reviews. Definitely to SOB tavern."

My friend and I were seated right away, choosing to forego the patio in favor of air conditioning. The service was impeccable: warm and prompt. We split an order of pain perdu (French toast) and piggie by the pound. Apparently, they roast a pig here each weekend and serve a pound of whatever they can take from it for brunch until they run out.I used to be a vegetarian, so I was not looking forward to the piggie end of things, but it was delectable, salty, and served with surprising and tangy sauces and corn tortillas. The French toast with mascarpone was as delicious as any brunch I&#39;ve had at Lula. This place, however, had space to spare. It&#39;s brand new, half empty, delicious, and so spacious that I witnessed a family comfortably navigate multiple strollers without causing any discomfort to the single people around them.In short, I look forward to leaving hourlong waits for amazing food in Logan Square in the past and coming here more often!"

The bone marrow barely fit on one peice of bread.  I got the po boy which and i had 2 bites of and couldn&#39;t eat anymore it was that awful.  My boyfriend who eats anything even if it doesn&#39;t taste that great had the torta and he refused to eat it after a couple bites.   Then it took forever for our server to come back with our check even though she went to both tables next to us.Super disappointed with this place.

It was pretty bad, actually...well...except for one tiny thing.We ordered the Roasted Bone Marrow. I mean, it&#39;s fat, and fat is delicious. That&#39;s what earns it the extra star. It&#39;s a bit overpriced to scrape out some fat, but it earned it the extra star. Take a slab of bread and soak it into that fatty goodness and although you&#39;re still left wanting, it is a wonderful heart attack. I wouldn&#39;t return for it as I can get the same tasty fatty flavor from my rib eye steak at home for cheaper.The beef tongue gyro was a dry ol&#39; thing with not a ton of flavor, except the mayonnaise that it was swimming in or yogurt that tasted like mayo? Not sure...but noooot good at all.The Pork cheek, well, that was just a salt lick. If you like licking salt, you&#39;ll love it, and it was as if they tried to hide the salt lick in the spicy and the cheese, but it just wasn&#39;t working. I was really excited for this one and had high hopes that just failed sadly.The best part of both of those plates were the fries. I have never sat in a restaurant and ate all the fries off the plate, but I did because I couldn&#39;t eat the rest. We left everything, so I sat there very disappointed and dipped my thin cut curly deliciousness into the one tiny spoon scoop of ketchup that they provided me with and then left... still hungry and wanting a good meal.Unfortunately, we won&#39;t be back."

I had hoped this was a just trust the menu place where they do only a handful of menu items really well.  Ended up with great drinks and little disappointed in the food.4 of us went and started off with 2 salads, goat cheese balls, and the hummus.  All were fairly tasty but small portions that were difficult to split. Goat cheese balls were ok but little too goat cheese overload.  They needed something else to cut the richness.  The hummus was very good but didn&#39;t give you near enough bread (4-5 small triangles) so we needed to ask for more.For main I had the lamb which was good but little on fatty side.  Others had the burger and it was also a little on smaller side and slightly over cooked, tasty though.Ok spot, but needs a more expansive menu or at least expand the larger plates. This great bar/pub with strong drinks and beers needs to have better food."

Luckily they were able to accommodate our original six that turned into eight. Our hungry bunch devoured everything up and down the menu! We tried the crispy fritters, puff pastry, a pork schmear special, bone marrow, ceasar salad (enough for four to split as a starter), steak frites, chicken sandwich and two excellent specials of scallops (that came on some salted black bean goodness) and the juiciest stack of pork chops. While it is short menu, don&#39;t let that fool you into thinking it&#39;s not diverse. Each dish really has a lot to offer with many unique twists. I also quite enjoyed two of their rye with walnut bitters cocktails and they have a great selection of beers that do compliment the menu.

So many places lately have been so disappointing, but this one definitely impressed us with their food!My guy and I generally go for sports bars, relaxed kind of places with a mix of burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc. We were being treated to this meal and wanted something a little bit more upscale but not totally over the top or expensive. This was a perfect balance of all that. Most of the dishes were in the high teens and $20 range, and they had a good range of salad, sandwich and entree too.We came here on a Saturday around 530. It was almost totally empty inside, but 75% full on the outdoor patio area. We had made a reservation through yelp to be safe. We were given water right away and were on our merry way.We decided to go for a cocktail for starters ($12-13). I had the &#34;in between flights&#34; which was a blend of bourbon, honey and grapefruit. It was really well balanced and refreshing. My guy had the &#34;calder&#34;, which is their version of a manhattan? or old fashioned... I always get those confused... anywho, it was a large and lovely drink too.For entrees, I went for the watermelon farro salad and added steak ($10). The portion on this wasn&#39;t massive, but definitely satisfying! It&#39;s NOT a lettuce salad topped with farro. It was strictly farro, watermelon, basil, feta and steak with a dressing. The flavors were really unique and kept my tongue on alert! It was really different but excellent! The steak was so tender and good on it too! My guy had The Director entree- roasted chicken, grilled zucchini and polenta. Holy cow was his good too! I sampled some chicken and the polenta and both were totally knocked out of the park. He was able to finish it all but was full by the end of it.This restaurant is so convenient to many blue line stops too. We loved coming here and would gladly return!"

Wine was a heavy pour, good selection.Food: Steak Tartare - wonderful flavor, but odd that it was served with potato crisps. Also ordered the poutine which was fatty and delicious.The manager came to our table to ask if we needed anything, and service was very friendly and reliable. While not the creme de la creme it definitely is a good fit for a happy hour, dinner or lunch."

We were immediately seated outside and brought water. The food was great! I had the grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad, both delicious. My boyfriend had the burgers and fries, also very good especially since they make their own pickles.The beer selection was pretty vast and had a lot of local beers which I really liked! It was a quick lunch for us so we were in and out within 30 minutes, however I do think our waitress could&#39;ve paid a little bit more attention to us, but since we are younger I know that we don&#39;t always get the best attention.Overall good place, I would recommend for lunch!"

Thankfully it was perfect- light on the absinthe with lemon peel. They have several interesting selections for drinks on their fall menu, including one a butterscotch pumpkin rum combination and a twist on an old fashioned with maple syrup, walnut bitters, and chocolate ganache dipped bacon.I was still recovering from a late lunch, so I ate several starters. The whipped ricotta with honey and balsamic glaze was unbelievable. I also picked at a house salad. It was unexpected with frisée, Peruvian potatoes, and green beans. I enjoyed the combination.The atmosphere is relaxed with a subtle industrial theme. The servers were laid back and knowledgable, particularly the bartenders."

We were a large party of 13 and we had a reservation of course. When we arrived they tried to put us at a 10 top and then 3 others would have to sit in a lounge area. We asked if we could all be together (which you would assume would happen). They did accommodate but I feel like that should have been done beforehand.We ordered some apps for the table, the fried pickles were very good as well as the sauce that comes with it. The hummus was also pretty tasty, the pita chips were a bit hard, but ok. But overall pretty solid options.I ordered the burger, I asked for medium, but they have to cook it medium well because it&#39;s two 4 ounce patties. Whomp. This just truck me as the kinda place with a real burger. To be perfectly honest, I didn&#39;t like it at all, it had a weird flavor to it. Not enough to send back, because I generally hate doing that. I wouldn&#39;t order that in my opinion.Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their various salads, salmon, etc. Maybe I should have gone with something else, but i was very underwhelmed.Service was very good and she did a great job handling the large party but it took a really long time to get our tab and half our party left to go back to the hotel. Overall, A-OK and maybe if I were in town again I&#39;d swing by and try something besides the burger."

Then later that week a friend of mine wanted to go someplace in the area and suggested this place. I didn&#39;t realize it was the same place until I arrived there. If you read the reviews, they were on point about a couple of issues. The place is loud and noisy but no more then other places...I think the walls and ceilings lack enough insolation. The food is pretty good, especially the polenta and amish chicken and salmon and succotash. However, the salad we got beforehand was bad. They served us the hearts of the romaine as a salad!?!? The beer menu is also limited and I was surprised because they had a huge bar at the center of the restaurant. Overall good experience with those exceptions. Probably won&#39;t be coming back...other options in the area."

No less than two busy bartenders were on the spot as soon as I sat down at the bar. The first asked me about my drink while pouring beers and making cocktails for others. He delivered a great martini while a second bartender asked about food. They seem not to have fixed locations but help whoever needs help. What a great idea.Dinner was salmon with polenta and hit the spot. Then a manager comes over and asks if he can clear the plates and bring my check which he does. Now I&#39;m wondering is this good service or are they rushing me out to make way for another tab? My verdict--it&#39;s good service. The people here seem nice and they are efficient. Most people are hurrying somewhere after work. So if you&#39;re 30-something and good-looking, come here after work to see and be seen; and if you&#39;re like me, NOT 30-something, you can still come here and have a nice time."

The Marq was a lot more crowded since my previous weekend evening visit but we were lucky get a table right away. Same great service as last time even with the crowd.Food: we ordered Mac &#39;n Cheese and the Marq Burger with a fried egg. The Mac &#39;n Cheese was very tasty..nice and cheesy topped with panko bread crumbs for a little texture. The burger was was very good with the pickled onions and pickles adding a nice acidity to the flavor. The egg was good..but be warned..it can get messy! We ended up using a fork and knife on the burger to avoid getting yolk all over our hands and mouths!Service: Superb service again even with a pretty full house. Our server (Kat?) was great, checking up on our table, making sure we had everything we needed. The management also came by a couple times to make sure our meal was to our liking.Atmosphere: Great place, in the day time it changed to a bustling lunch spot for business people grabbing lunch. Although bustling and crowded, it still felt comfortable.Value: Good value for the lunch menu in the area. Burger came in at $14 plus $1 for the egg, Mac &#39;n Cheese full order was $13. Might seem a bit high for some people but the execution and quality of ingredients (plus the service) warrant the price.Overall: Second visit on this trip and enjoyed it again!"

Nevertheless, the service was friendly and fast. I was dying to get the recommended Salmon BLT, but unfortunately they were out of it (it was around 1 pm). So I ordered The Intern (sirloin on wheat bread with roasted peppers and mushrooms, caramelized onions, and chimichurri with fries) and pea soup instead. The Intern was very tasty and filling, but the fries were too salty for my taste. The pea soup was meh, it was good to warm me up on a cold day but not good enough for me to reorder. Since I was on vacation, I also ordered a drink - From Rio to Goa - boy was it strong! It wasn&#39;t bad, just a lot stronger than I anticipated. My server, Migee, was super awesome and adjusted my total even though I returned the drink.The Marq has a modern comfortable look to it and I absolutely loved the credit card holders (pictured).I would definitely come back to try it out for a happy hour whenever I&#39;m in Chicago again!"

Once you walk up they do have seating outside but I chose to sit inside cause it was hot outside.I said at a table and was greeted by a wonderful, sweet woman named Shannon. I ordered lagunitas and the Executive to start off. The manager came over and talked to me about different kinds of IPAs beer they carry and he recommended one for me so I figured I would give it a try. Muncipal IPA. (Very similar to Lagunitas but a less bitter)The Executive sirloin steak was cooked to a perfect medium and had this very distinct chimichurri sauce. Wonderful. I tried different soups after this the Chef&#39;s Soup and the Green Pea Soup. The Chef&#39;s Soup I can&#39;t remember the name was boiled in pork and bones and had all different kinds of vegetables.Overall 5 out of 5 stars. Excellent food and service."

I had the executive which was an 8oz steak loaded with roasted Brussels sprouts, potatoes and onions. It was insanely good.

The place has a classy ambiance inside and the guests matched: it seemed like a lot of people were having business dinners or meetings after work. The bar was pretty full with guests in suits.I ordered The Executive which was chicken, palenta and stir-fried veggies. I really liked my meal, especially the palenta, but I&#39;m not sure it was worth $19 because the portion size wasn&#39;t as big as other restaurants in the area.My sister and Grandma got burgers and both enjoyed them a lot. My dad got the ribs and said they were &#34;OK&#34;.

It was served with large rustic crackers.Main dishes were the Chicken and the Salmon. The Salmon was fantastic the chicken was very good but could have been just a bit moister. The chicken was served with some grilled veggies and polenta which was out of this world. We had a bottle of The Jack Cabernet  and raspberry covered bread pudding ( they offer a single dessert each day). Our waitress and the manager were both fantastic and took the time to talk with us even though it was a busy Friday night.Overall an excellent evening at a very fair price."

My meal was equally good.  We&#39;d definitely return.A small quibble-- if you want wi-fi, you could be disappointed.

The bartender has a bit of an attitude so I only ordered a beer. The price on the menu for the beer I ordered, Belgian wheat, allagash white is priced at $7 on the menu, the bartender took my $10 and only brought back $2. Kept  $1 for himself. Maybe that&#39;s normal practice in Chicago but I think it&#39;s more like theft.The crooked bartender&#39;s name is Andrew.I received a message from the owner of the Marq. He explained that the bartender did not steal my $1, he said that my change would have been $0.26 after tax but they have a policy to round all change up to the nearest dollar. Still seems like thievery but they must have different laws in Chicago.  It is also policy not to give a receipt if someone orders only 1 drink at the bar, which means people unfamiliar with their policies would never know where their change went or about the tax.The owner did inform me that going forward they will be providing receipts and round up to the nearest quarter ($0.25).  However, not giving the full amount of change due still seems a lot like theft to me, but I&#39;m not a lawyer.  I wonder how that put that in their books, misc. revenue? Or do the bartenders pocket the little change."

The front of the restaurant was reserved for some industry type event, but there is a ton of seating in the back area and at the bar. We chose to sit at the bar and were able to drink and eat till we almost popped. We sampled a couple beers at the kind suggestion of the bartender and decided two that we were happy with. We had the heirloom tomato brushetta and burratta appetizer and then shared the blueberry salad and chicken entree. Each dish was so flavorful and tasty that the hubs and I started to consider ourselves foodies. But then we laughed, finished our beers, and went on our way.

My manager ordered a salad with fruit it in, and just looking at her plate, the fruit seemed kind of sparse.  My coworker had the ribs which were fall off the bone and spicy/tangy but not really smokey.  I tried his side of brussel sprouts and they were a little too over seasoned with salt.  Over all a nicer solid lunch that didn&#39;t break the bank."

You get just the right amount to share with another person; not too much, not too little. The Marq burger (added fried egg) was fantastic. Be prepared to ask for an extra napkin, however. Very messy! I think the fried egg added to the mess factor. The fries were delicious as well. Service was great and it had a great, relaxed atmosphere and nice bar.

My young server was personable and went out of his way to make sure I was happy. I always appreciate that.The food we had was good. My friend did take-out on the burger.  I had the three-cheese grilled cheese which likewise, hit the spot though I don&#39;t care for it on foccacia. (The bread was slightly soggy.) Cool thing was that I&#39;d taken half the sandwich home and nuked it the next day and surprisingly, it was much firmer and better.The ambience is light-toned-modern. It&#39;s nice and that&#39;s such a lame word as is the word &#34;lame.&#34; But that&#39;s the take-away. It felt somehow &#34;cafeteria-ish&#34; to me. Maybe if there were votives or a small flower on the table. It didn&#39;t help that it was fairly empty on a freezing night; maybe what it was lacking was just a few more patrons as it&#39;s a decent sized space. The bar/tv area was the nucleus and the couple of groups of people who were dining were seated over there, but I felt like a window seat. It&#39;ll be great for watching passers-by when the temp isn&#39;t 20 degrees.All in all, I agree - great place for a drink, to warm-up and to have a bite and conveniently located across the street from Federal Plaza so I can finally remember to mail the birthday card I toted around all day.Enter off Adams or you can access via Dearborn and catch a glimpse of the lobby of the Marquette building."

Just delicious. Then we split an order of the Mac n cheese with the pork belly. It was super rich, but nonetheless a scrumptious entree. And for dessert, the chefs special, bananas foster.

It was in desperate need of salt &amp; pepper. The menu said 6 min egg I got 1/2 egg REALLY. Cooked perfect but would have liked the other half. Purple potatoes had no flavor what so ever.

We had 1.5 hours to kill before our next class, so decided to check this place out! Looking at the amazing reviews they have on here, we were excited to try the food. The interior was very posh and exquisite. We were seating almost as soon as we walked in. Our waiter was very helpful with any questions we had regarding the menu. I am disappointed to say that most of us did not like we ordered. I ordered the shishito peppers &amp; soup of the day (it was carrot curry). The peppers did not have any flavor to it what&#39;s so ever. As a person who&#39;s a fan of spicy food, I was expecting the peppers to be a lot better than what they were. The chipotle mayo sauce they gave didn&#39;t really help the taste. A couple of my friends ordered the fried pickles - they were also mediocre. The pickles were sweet instead of sour. A few others ordered Mac and cheese and that seemed to be the only dish everyone like.

It was good; only big disappointment was they served it with greasy wonton like crisps, should be served with sliced baguette.The mains were very good; we had sweet/spicy ribs and chicken. Both were served with delicious polenta and average tasting grilled &#39;summer vegetables&#39; (yellow/green squash and onion). I don&#39;t eat a lot and often have appetizers for dinner but the portions were definitely smallish; don&#39;t count on left overs.Oddly, only one dessert choice/night; tonight was an over-dry berry bread pudding which was flavorless.Decent drink selection, comfortable seating (both high and low table choices). Minimalist decor, bar in the middle, 3 tv&#39;s by the bar. The place is a mix of contemporary/sports bar/nice restaurant. Spotless, modern bathroom. Would visit again if in the area."

We got there early on MLK day, so there was no rush. All 3 of us ordered burgers. They arrived in less than 5 minutes. That tells me they were either using a Turbo-chef or microwave. The burgers were completely tasteless. Thank goodness for all the salt on the fries!The restaurant is attractive and our server was nice, but the food was definitely not worth a walk in the cold."

It was the kind of soup that I romanticize about when I read war novels about WWI.....anyway, for the main course we had the Cubano sandwich. It was well made and the dijon mustard directly on the bread makes for a smooth bite. Its a classic, and they didnt have to change much to get it perfect."

I don&#39;t want bone marrow, probably ever.This latest visit, I noticed the bone marrow was gone (thank goodness) but so were the cheese curds (which I liked). Basically, the menu keeps changing and it&#39;s annoying, and some items I&#39;ve had were not so good. Food is inconsistent, so I usually just stick to the burger.Positives:- We always sit at the bar and the bartender there is super friendly - love her.- Love the bar area - nice decor.- Service is quick.- Good beer/wine choices, although it can get pricey.- Convenient location if in the loopIt can be a good alternative to all the old school restaurant/bars in the area, with a slightly elevated menu and beer/wine selection, I just wish the food would be consistent and the quality matched the nice interior."

You don&#39;t realize how big the space is because the bar is kind of hidden by a wall in the middle of the restaurant. The service was really fast, too. I&#39;m not all too sure about their menu, but they had a special menu for the St. Patrick&#39;s Day Parade that was on Michigan Ave (The Marq is just a few minutes walk from Michigan). I ordered The Marq Burger.The burger was really good. But the bun was a little stale. The fries were definitely good as well. I&#39;d recommend eating the burger with the fork and knife because it can get really messy. It was very juicy, and I ordered mine medium rare.

Meeting a friend there for lunch, we were seated next to the window with a great view of Calder&#39;s Flamingo. The place - aside from  being well decorated- is meticulously clean and staffed by really friendly people - everyone greeted me when I walked in.When the waitress came up and I asked her about the best burger bit, she winkingly debated that the sign said &#34;...on the block&#34; ok, I&#39;ll give that to her. She wanted to undersell it. Said burger finally came. It was delicious. Not a thick beef block like pubs often give, but two medium thickness patties, which I think makes a juicier, more flavorful burger. It was delicious. Maybe not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but it was memorable enough to get me to Yelp it.Overall, very pleased with this notable addition to the loop. Can&#39;t wait to go back for happy hour!"

We wanted to support a local establishment in the hood but this one should either go find a new one or find a new chef.  We were excited so we ordered every one of their tacos, including the po boy special taco.The best of the rest was the catfish taco but The black eyed peas overpowered your fish and left my mouth mushy and wondering where&#39;s the fish. The pork belly so dry we thought maybe it was the pulled chicken...until we had the chicken and it tasted like a mouthful of sawdust. No salt on anything either...and what&#39;s with the cole slaw? A splash of vinegar on cabbage alongside a few slivers of carrot without salt does not equal coleslaw. It&#39;s just undressed  like the $6 pico de gallo which was so dry. And just tomatoes without the tangy lime, spicy jalepeno or refreshing cilantro one comes to expect from a proper chip dip.And the beers? WTF. where do you get off selling a 12oz pour of Revokution or hopewell for $6. If I were to go there directly I&#39;d get the same beer in a 16oz pint glass for the same price or less. Sad but true. And left thirsty.Great concept (package store) with southern style taco bar but very poorly executed. THANK GOD we came in for &#34;neighborhood appreciation night&#34; where it was buy 1 get 1 free taco.

We were out on a (very) rare Saturday night that was not only of a reasonable temperature, but where the crowds were light which really offered a chance to appreciate this joint. We sat at the bar and had a few rounds of drinks from their really robust and impressive beer menu, but watching the bartender I definitely was tempted to order one of their really REALLY good looking cocktails. Maybe next time!We weren&#39;t initially going to eat there, but ended up getting hungry enough to order a few tacos each and that was where you really see the blending of soul food and mexican food take it next level. I got the Mudcat taco which was breaded and fried catfish, black eyed peas, fresh slaw and sour cream as well as the roasted pork shoulder taco and WOW were they awesome. Totally different than anything I&#39;ve ever had AND the actual tortillas held up really well. My date got a taco that was a take on a po&#39; boy and he really dug that and we both shared a pork belly mac n cheese. They had some vegetarian/vegan tacos on the menu that he&#39;d had and said were really good, but I wanted to stick with my protein for the night of drinking ahead.The bar itself wasn&#39;t huge but there was plenty of seating and while they had an outdoor seating area, I liked being able to just sit at the bar and look out the open front of the joint.

There is not a lot of seating in there to begin with. I feel like they could make room for tables inside.We got 3 tacos and the nachos. The pork shoulder taco was really good but the fried chicken and the catfish taco were bland, not much going on. Just tasted like fried white meat. They needed some spice, some acid just something to make them stand out. A verde salsa would have been amazing. One of them did have a smoke jalapeño mayo but it was flavorless. They did provide a hot sauce and it was ok but just not the flavor I was looking for, it worked better with the nachos. The tacos seems very small, two bites maybe three. And for $4+ per taco it seems a tad over priced. The nachos with the brisket was great and a highly recommended order. It&#39;s hard to screw up nachos though.The service was great. The bartender was friendly and the host even came over to us and apologized again for not having a table for us and said that he had some reservations cancel.I really wanted this place to just shove it&#39;s hand down my pants, have a little go and get me excited, but it just didn&#39;t.

This place has both and more.They do some pretty amazing things with their smoked brisket (i.e. nachos were awesome and so was the brisket taco).I have a weakness for fried chicken, and the southern fried chicken taco filled my needs absolutely perfectly.While I look forward to trying more of the menu in future visits, let&#39;s talk about the drinx.Craft cocktails are $10 and the wine list -- it&#39;s at wholesale cost. While looking at the prices by the bottle, I kept searching for an asterisk to see if there&#39;s a $25-$50 charge in addition to the bottle price to open it. But no.We had a 2009 Rioja Gran Reserva for $26. The Binny&#39;s price was $20. In most restaurants, that&#39;d be a $45-$60 bottle.This restaurant is cozy and the staff is fun and knowledgeable.I&#39;ll definitely be coming back soon, and I would encourage you to try this place -- I think you&#39;ll be very glad that you did."

I absolutely love the old timey decor,a few outdoor sidewalk seats, beer boot special of the day for $4, the hostess was very friendly and pleasant, and turnaround time for food coming out once orders were in was speedy. Plus, we were able to be seated immediately at 7:30pm on a Saturday night.

Tables were too small for all the food &amp; drinks that come out and it&#39;s not as if tables are squished together. They need to get some bigger tables in there. We were seated under the air conditioning and there was so much condensation, it was constantly dripping on my friend and I.We started by ordering chips and guac for the table for $7. I actually really enjoyed the guacamole because I often find the cilantro taste overwhelming in it. The guacamole at The General didn&#39;t have the overpowering cilantro though so I loved it. We liked it so much we used all our chips and asked for more. Three dollars for more chips. Plus they only filled our bucket about 70% for the additional chips. C&#39;mon The General...no need to nickle and dime customers!The General had 12 beers on tap and they were out of 3....that we know of! It could have been more but we didn&#39;t make our way through the whole menu. With such a limited draft menu, you need to have backups ready for your next draught drink...or at least erase it from the board. Our server also seemed unapologetic about this...but also kind of got the vibe she didn&#39;t care for us much.The General only has 5 tacos on it&#39;s list for $4-4.50 each and then a bunch of sides, including a good sized mac &amp; cheese for $5. And for in $5 mac &amp; cheese, you get a choice of a few things they will add in. One of those things was pork belly so I jumped on that! The pork belly was way overcooked to the point of having no flavor that remotely reminded me of delicious pork belly. One of my friends asked what the black stuff was in the mac &amp; cheese, yepppp, that was the pork belly. Plus it seemed more watery than cheesy and just generally something was missing in the flavor.We all agreed the tacos were not worth the $4-$4.50. They were small with not much to them and with so many taco places around, they just don&#39;t cut it. My fried chicken taco had a small slab of protein with a tiny bit of sauce on it....that&#39;s it. I also noticed every single taco had some element of spice to it. This was fine with me but it may be good to add an option to appeal to the masses...really though....I hate to say it but The General needs a total menu revamp. No one loved any of the tacos nor did we love any of the sides. The space is so great and I can tell a ton of time went into the decor. It&#39;s truly fabulous! I don&#39;t want to see it go to waste 6 months down the road. When you have such a small menu and drinks are highlighted, you need to have in stock what you have on the board. Also, service started out great but then became more disinterested, glasses left empty at times,  then our server was nowhere to be found for quite some time when we needed the bill. Finally, the prices are just a bit too much. They needed to be lowered a bit. For 4 of us we spent $120 with tax &amp; tip, thus me personally spent $30 for 1 taco, 1 mac &amp; cheese side, 1/4 of our chips &amp; guac + 2 beers. Ouch.I&#39;m rooting for you, The General! Pull one out for the home team!"

They should consider unisex washrooms.For now, enjoy the space with a few people. Great tacos, tasty sides and try the pie! If you aren&#39;t sure about a cocktail, ask for a recommendation.

Eventually someone apparently on the staff came over to us and said they were surprised to see us. Maybe I missed the sign-in sheet on my way in? They also seemed surprised that we wanted menus. Yes, I thought. I am after all in a restaurant.. We take in the ambiance for a bit. At this point the interaction with the aloof host-person is in stark contrast against the contrived saloon-style flair of the interior. The tacos were nothing special, and truthfully, at $4, seemed overpriced. Picture a small piece of fried chicken thigh on a silver dollar pancake with some coleslaw on it. Finally, what seemed to be in-between glances at his phone, the waiter hands me the check with a sincere glance which bordered on desperation.Forgive me for calling a spade a spade, and sorry for being hard on a local business in a neighborhood I call home, but I can&#39;t see through the pre-packaged novelty."

We really liked the outside seating, the service was good. However, my glass had lipstick on it...so that wasn&#39;t a great first impression...The meat is pasture-raised (free roaming) so if that&#39;s important to you, this is a great place to get some happy meat.I tried the fried catfish taco, it was just okay, nothing special. My fiance had the pork shoulder taco, he loved it!!! We also got the Soul Nachos with meat on the side, as my fiance eats meat and I don&#39;t, so it was great that they could accommodate that. The nachos were pretty good but they definitely could use (a lot) more of the toppings."

All the taco&#39;s are $3-4 and that&#39;s a perfect price, 2 pretty much filled me up (although I think I could eat 10). Shot-and-a-beer can chicken stuck out as a favorite. The vibe here is cool too.

We came for a late brunch or early lunch on Sunday and our waitress Lauren I think was honestly one of the best waitresses I have had in a long time. We had the breakfast with chicken and I had all four of the tacos which were fantastic. My favorite was the brisket and the beer can chicken. Also I had probably the best Bloody Mary ever.

Shot-and-A-Beer Can Chicken.  Delish!!  It&#39;s a MUST try!  Juicy &amp; so full of flavor, we ordered a 2nd one.  Yum!  2nd best was the Pork Shoulder taco.  Unfortunately, the Smoked Bourbon Brisket &amp; Southern Fried Chicken tacos were both really dry and without much flavor.  Both sounded fabulous on the menu.  While we were pretty disappointed in those two, we loved the Shot-and-A-Beer Can Chicken!The mac n&#39; cheese was another winner.  It&#39;s offered with bonus additions of beef, chicken, pork belly, onion &amp; jalapeno... we opted to try it straight up and it was straight up delicious!  Also, we thought it was the best bang for your buck, dollar for dollar.  The corn bread was good, but pretty standard.  I&#39;d love to see it stand out with a little more jalapeno flavor or kick.Drinks:  We tried the Black Jack, Mexican War &amp; the Abolitionist.  The Mexican War was tasty.  The Black Jack grew on me throughout the meal.  I think the flavors needed time to open up together.  My first sip was a little too syrup heavy, but the flavors blended nicely over time.I mentioned our food arrived before our drinks and we had a good gap between our first and second taco round.  In an effort to smooth out some opening hiccups, our waiter brought us each a bourbon sample at the end of the night.  We really appreciated his awareness and The General&#39;s customer service.  Awareness will go such a long way!!Our bill was over $70 before tip.  A little on the pricey side for the dining portions, but it probably won&#39;t keep us away.All said, we will absolutely be back for another try and are looking forward to a little bit better quality as The General ages!!"

Good music. Fun decor. Cozy! What more could you ask for?  Well... a little more heat, I guess.  Those brick walls are drafty.  But other than that, no complaints here.Drinks - The cocktails different, thoughtful and tasty (also around $10 each which is reasonable, I think). The beer list was impressive.  Not very long but some options there you certainly don&#39;t see everywhere else, which I appreciate.Food - I ordered something that was new on the menu and I have to say, it was great! It was the Commissary stew - sooooo good!  Everyone else really enjoyed what they got and my group of 9 ran the gamut on what we ordered.One note about the menu - They added a shared plates section to the menu but none of the items seemed really shareable.  I think they should just be entrees, personally and leave the sharing out of it.  My stew was so good, I wouldn&#39;t want to share with anybody anyway.Good Luck The General!!!

Besides the tacos, i recommend the mac n&#39; cheese and the cornbread!

For some reason, bar/laundromat hybrids are not a thing yet, so this is the closest I can get. I live right around the corner so dumping my laundry in the wash and popping into the General for a drink with my man is my new favorite thing.The General has an amazing craft beer list that has something for everyone. IPA&#39;s, APA&#39;s, ciders, stouts, you name it and it&#39;ll be there. If it&#39;s not on draft, it&#39;s probably at least on their equally awesome can/bottle list. Plus, they have a daily $4 boot special that isn&#39;t some crap no one wants to drink, it&#39;s always a great pick and I&#39;ve gotten to try tons of new awesome beers via the Boot.Their cocktails are also on point. I&#39;m obsessed with the Simmerson which has the perfect amount of pineapple without being overly sweet, and the Abolitionist (I think) which is grapefruit and hibiscus. Usually grapefruit is a palate hog and takes over a drink, but not the case here, fellas. It&#39;s perfectly balanced to catch that citrus bite and floral accents. A+!I haven&#39;t had all of the tacos yet, but I&#39;ve been pleased with all the ones I have had. I looove the pork shoulder taco with its mustard bbq sauce, and the shot and a beercan chicken taco is a close second. My boyfriend is in love with the fried chicken taco. I had the catfish one and wasn&#39;t nuts about it--mushy black eyed peas and a soft fish like catfish don&#39;t go too well together, but even though it&#39;s not the best, it&#39;s still good. Oh, and their guacamole and pico are so tasty, I usually can&#39;t stop. And if you go by for their late night menu, their beef brisket quesadilla is amazing and should be on their regular menu. YUM. The portions are smaller, but it&#39;s farm-to-table, so for the price and flavor it&#39;s worth it.I hope this place stays around the neighborhood for a long time!"

Starting with the not so great one. Showed up a little after 7 on a rainy Friday, they had the front windows open making the place wet and muggy.  We had to ask for them to close them to create more seating so we could grab a drink.  Once we finally sat down we chatted with the bar tender to try and decide what to order.  He suggested a gin cocktail for me which I can&#39;t for the life of me remember what it was called, but it sounded good enough the way he originally described.  Upon bringing it to me though he informed me it had peppers in it (not a fan but I choked it down anyway).  My bf got a double Templeton rye whiskey and asked for it neat, easy enough.  When we tabbed out though we found that our bill was $30 for the two drinks because they charged an extra for his neat (without ice).  We were upset because it should be the same amount of alcohol with or without ice. Be careful when ordering drinks in the evening.Our first experience however was fabulous.  We went for brunch on a Saturday and the bartender was super friendly. At the time we were new to the city and he gave us all kinds of advice on yummy places to eat and drink.  We had a couple beers that were decently priced and their daily $4 boot special is a total steal.  We each ordered food and left nothing on our plates and even hung around a little later because we were having such a great time!To make this long winded post short, don&#39;t order a drink neat unless you&#39;re cool with paying crazy up-charges and GO FOR BRUNCH because its the bomb."

We enjoyed the food and the ambiance so much that we decided to make this a stop on a bachelor party bar tour through Chicago and the good folks at the General could not have been more accommodating. We arrived in fits and starts after our first stop in Wrigley. The waitress was gracious enough to split all of our checks in spite of our exuberance.The food was as solid as ever. My favorite menu item is the shrimp and grits chimichangas. The cornbread is also delicious with enough moisture and spice to make it a not miss item. The drink menu is very interesting with some craft cocktails and local brews you can&#39;t find elsewhere.The General also has a jazz night on Wednesdays and a soul night on Saturdays and a bluegrass brunch on Sunday. Highly recommend The General!

I must say, at first glance I thought it was going to be one of those cheesy &#34;hip&#34; places that doesn&#39;t end up feeling genuine at all. However, this was the opposite of true. The food is delicious and the tacos are really creative. I even think the coleslaw deserves a mention (not overdressed). I love the beer boot specials, they are always a really good quality beer for just $4. And the shot/beer/taco combo for $8 is genius.The place always feels warm and welcoming on the inside, and seems to be working with the community and doing neat stuff. I was there when a DJ from Bloodshot records was there and he picked some perfect tunes for the vibe of the place. Also, last but certainly not least, the servers were what put my review at 5 stars.

Placebo is an interesting word. The food was akin to a feckless sugar pill when you know others in your trial are down the street eating the real deal meals via Rick Bayless or Habanero or Patron.Everyone there was very nice. The people were cool and friendly and all that jazz. The boys doing the cooking in the kitchen did the best they could with the menu and ingredients. I&#39;m sorry to say but the blame resides with the architect of the menu itself. When you eat with Bayless or Habanero or Patron, you know that people who really care about food crafted each ingredient and sourced it from fresh places. It takes years to accomplish those kinds of menus. The General isn&#39;t at that level, I regret to say. However, it&#39;s early. There is a lot of time to change. The menu requires a complete overhaul. The swift ordeal of human tongues will not suffer from want of other choices during that overhaul.If my taco is going to be $4 or $4.50, it either needs to huge or very delicious. These tacos were neither.One friend went home after the meal and ate a half rotten banana to fill him up, but that could also be because he listens to a lot of Gwen Stefani.I&#39;m sorry to be mean. It&#39;s hard to give honest feedback in person. The good news is that it&#39;s early and the owner/chef has time to innovate but it will require dedication and willingness to change. Two stars for kind people and potential."

I was one of 3 people when I arrived for a 12pm reservation. Was concerned at first, but a few more people showed up while we were there. The space is definitely appealing with a unique area to purchase beer to take home and electric menus above the bar. I would definitely want to check this out when there are more people there. Great local beer list! Server did a great job sharing the concept with me and various events they have through the week that intrigued me to want to come check it out later in the evening. Not a huge menu, but definitely a variety of items to choose from. I had the Farmers Hash with smoked brisket served with eggs, veggies and fresh tortillas. I look forward to coming back and hope that the neighborhood gives it some love!"

We started with the charcuterie and cheese plate, which had venison and andouille sausage and a couple okay cheeses. The sausages were kinda warm, which is odd for charcuterie in my experience; it was like they were meant to be served hot but were left sitting so by the time they got to us they were just above room temp in the middle. The tacos also came out rather cold, their flavor was okay but nothing spectacular. The mac and cheese with pork belly was decent, as was the corn bread. The decor in this place is strange and a bit confused, they are going for rustic chic but then have massive flat screen TVs to display their drink menus (which have fonts to make it look like it&#39;s written in chalk). The decor and service won&#39;t stop me from going back but the food sure will."

They offer an extensive beer list, seasonal specialties and crave worthy tacos and small plates. They are also known for their pies which we will be sure to leave room for the next time we go. The guac is served generously with a large pail of chips and enough for a group to share. Two tacos should be enough for one person if you plan to order an appetizer or dessert. We had phenomenal service from Emily. She was a very personable, attentive server. We can&#39;t wait to go back another Saturday as long as this special lasts.

Our server was very nice and without any prompting told us the specials, described the menu and even admitted that while made in-house, the corn tortillas were hand-sized, and yeah, your tacos were gonna be tiny.I ordered the &#34;Abolitionist&#34; which came with an edible orchid. I&#39;m admittedly kind of a pansy when it comes to strong drinks and I usually just stick to beer. I couldn&#39;t finish it, and we all traded sips of our respective cocktails. STRONG, and not mixed well. I guess not every bar can be cut from the trendy mixologist cloth.The guacamole was great and came with a bucket of tortilla chips. The Fried Chicken taco was pretty good even though it was bite-sized. I especially liked the mac and cheese, which was rich, filling and tasty. You can add meat for free. The slaw, however, was a useless dish-garnish. It didn&#39;t taste like much, and we kinda just shoved it aside. Collared Greens are also A+ - next time I&#39;ll just have mac and cheese and collared greens for a healthy, balanced meal.I hate being a pain, but I forgot I didn&#39;t really have cash on me, and my friends never do. The server even split our checks between the three of us! Isn&#39;t that nice.Nice spot, pleasant ambiance, decent dinner, although I probably won&#39;t be buying my groceries at the overpriced general store."

We inquired if the kitchen was open and they said they had a late night menu so we stopped in assuming we could get a few tacos and a beer or two and be on our way.  We were given food menus and were pretty excited to try some of the tacos.  When the bartender came by again we got a couple beers and asked for some tacos (which were on the menu we were handed).  But here is the catch:  TACOS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AFTER 10 PM.  Perplexed we asked what was on the menu and we were told, quesadillas (with brisket or pork), mac and cheese, and chips and guac.I understand that its not always economical to keep a kitchen open late at a restaurant/bar.  But if you&#39;re a upscale taco restaurant and you opt to keep the kitchen open, you have to dance with the girl who brought you and serve tacos.  After all, tacos are the quintessential late night food.  To make quesadillas you already have most of the necessary ingredients out, why not fully commit to the theme?  Also wouldn&#39;t it be easier to make a few tacos then whip up a batch of mac n cheese? (this lead us to believe the mac would be reheated)Overall the ambiance of the place is great.  The beer selection is very good and the $4 &#39;boot&#39; special is unique and a decent value. We did get the guac and it was uninspired (seemed to be missing something) and the quesadillas were, well quesadillas."

And I guess with my rating, I might be too. I think the rating was more for the vibe and feel than the food. But the food is very good! Let me explain.We sat in the back which was a cute outdoor area. We were the only ones there for the majority of dinner. When we left, it started to fill, which was nice. Our server was very friendly and very passionate about the menu. She went over everything in detail, almost too much (will get to that). My wife and I started with one of the specials. It was pork belly on cornbread basically, with some coleslaw. We did it as an appetizer, and this might have been the best thing of the night. The cornbread was yummy, and the combo with the pork belly flavor was delcioso.My wife got the pork belly taco and totally loved it. I probably should have gotten that. I got the catfish and fried chicken one. I see some people here raving about the fried chicken one. Not sure if I would. It was good, and I loved the chicken part of it. I could eat that all day. But it was pretty plain IMO. Just the piece of chicken and sauce. And at the end of the day, fried chicken on a taco is a bit off, no? I dunno. The catfish wasn&#39;t all that great. Thought it would have more flavor. Thought the extra stuff in the taco did more to the flavor of the catfish than the catfish itself. Not a great sign. My wife ordered the mac and cheese with pork belly. This was very good, very rich. I liked it so much and was still hungry after the two tacos that I ordered my own mac and cheese. And then I got stuffed. So if you are still hungry after two tacos, maybe get another taco instead of downing a whole thing of mac and cheese. But I would eat it again! Ha.Now here&#39;s the thing: our server was super friendly. But when we ask to get some recs or if we haven&#39;t been to the restaurant, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to explain literally every single thing on the menu, including all the different cocktails. And that&#39;s what happened. Took a while. And I do appreciate the passion. But it was overboard and long. The kicker? When we said we didn&#39;t want drinks, she brought out the draft list because she forgot and &#34;just in case.&#34; That was unnecessary. We also hadn&#39;t even finished dinner and she started telling us all about dessert. It sounded great, but we hadn&#39;t finished our meals! Eh, not a fan of that.I enjoyed the vibe and the decor and it&#39;s in a great part of Logan Square, my hood. I know I will be back. I will try some other stuff on the menu when I do. And I will buy a drink next time too. And dessert. :)"

We made a reservation on OpenTable, which was easy and convenient, for 7:30 on a Saturday. The cocktails were pretty good and probably the best part of The General. We started with the chips and guac and it was pretty ok. Nothing special but decent. The chips were light and crunchy, which was nice. When the tacos came out we were excited but biting into them was quite a disappointment. No flavor, soggy texture (catfish), not worth the calories in my book. Since I didn&#39;t want to waste my cals on the tacos, I asked for more chips for the guac (large portion of guac, which was nice) and they sadly never came. The group also had orders of mac n&#39; cheese and jalapeno corn bread. The mac n&#39; cheese tasted similar to water noodles, extremely lacking in flavor. The cornbread was meh, maybe the best food item I ate though. It could have definitely used something else.On the plus side, the ambiance of the place was nice and welcoming, the servers were nice and relatively attentive (besides the chips).I&#39;m sad that it was so blah for me as I was really looking forward to loving it."

I have lived in Logan Square for many years and so I have been waiting to try this place. The general store doesn&#39;t work at all. It is not obvious that any of the wine or supposed produce is for sale. If you see an empty carton of eggs and want to buy some you have to ask staff and they will run downstairs to get it for you which is not convenient. Does anyone remember Service Merchandise?? Exactly, obsolete!Also, the farm to table taqueria is somewhat unique but farm to table is now Everywhere. We arrived and the restaurant was only a quarter filled so plenty of space and definitely a fun space for drinks. However, you can sit anywhere but the tables were not assigned to the waitstaff so it took like 5 minutes or so for them to determine who would serve our table. I have waited on tables in larger venues and you need to be assigned a section or you will have tables everywhere and Running all night which provides poor service! The waitress was very nice and understood the menu but it took the two bartenders and bar back/bartender at least 10 minutes or more to poor one specialty drink and one glass of wine. Not sure I want to find out how long it will take three people to  serve drinks on a busy night.Of course, we ordered the guac and chips and it too well over 15 minutes to receive. In fact people that arrived after we did were served more complicated plates sooner than our guacamole and chips. Come on! I can&#39;t imagine they would be soooo inefficient with guac and chips.Tacos were okay although the order was mixed up and it was the same at the table next to ours. I ordered fried chicken which if it&#39;s a taco I should be able to eat it as such. Otherwise call it an overcooked chicken tender with a gravy that doesn&#39;t add any flavor on top of a tortilla which is merely a garnish. The pork shoulder taco was very tasty but was the only one of the bunch. The brisket taco ordered by my friend was not as flavorful as described. Lastly, please don&#39;t say this is a taqueria if you don&#39;t serve even a small side of beans!! Seriously?! I am Latina and a mixed green salad or Mac and cheese are great but definitely not taqueria worthy. And throwing Jalapeños in everything doesn&#39;t change itchy fact."

It is a nicely put together quaint dark wood interior that really does well to continue the &#34;general store&#34; theme. The food is just okay though and the prices are too high. For 4.25$ you get one taco that is somewhere between small and medium sized with a side of cabbage. Between me and my friends I tried all the tacos they offered and most were decent but the meat was all very wet, every bite sent a splattering of water all over my plate, overall not a good value. The guacamole we had was pretty good, but be careful, about 1/4 of the guacamole was left but all of our chips were gone, if we wanted to finish it we would have had to pay 3$ extra for more chips.... Most of the beers are probably .50 cents to a dollar more expensive than they should be but they do have a rotating $4 beer in a boot glass that was a very good deal. All in all it is a decent place, cool theme but the tacos are simply not good enough to have me in as a regular customer."

When I saw it was opening I was hoping it would help me get over losing the former tenants, Provenance. Sadly, the General came up short.The space is really well done and evokes a sort of Disneyland version of an old timey general store. The cocktails we tried were pretty good, and they have a nice craft beer list. The waitress and staff all seem super nice. Unfortunately it&#39;s all downhill from there.The food ranged from OK to mediocre. The chips were thin and crispy but, the guac was a little bland. The salad was nice and fresh, but also a little bland. The chimichanga with shrimp and grits was good, but tiny and cost $8 for one piece cut in half. The tacos were all meh. The catfish taco was salty. The fried chicken taco was bland and dry. The vegan taco tasted like something I&#39;ve made at home when I was hungover. My bother in law tried the pork and brisket and liked the former. Nothing was offensive or bad, but all of us agreed it wasn&#39;t worth having again.What&#39;s really egregious is the pricing. The tacos were $4-5 each and small. The three of us paid about $100 with tip for a drink per person, a few shared apps, and two tacos each. That&#39;s ridiculous, especially in Logan Square were there are dozens of great mom and pop places that make way better Mexican food.  I get that that organic and &#34;farm-to-table&#34; ingredients are not cheap, but again, there are so many of those places in Logan Square as well.

Not a brisket taco with half a piece of brisket on it. I also don&#39;t want a cute plate of mac and cheese. This is bbq/mexican/soul food none of those food styles are cute! For the price ($18 for 2 tacos and a mac and cheese) this food leaves much to be desired. I plan to try this place again in the near future. Hopefully they will take heed to many of the awesome reviews below me and their helpful advice. If not, I will just go back for the cute atmosphere.... and waiter ;)"

Similar to Spanish tapas, The General&#39;s menu is meant to be sampled with sides causally amongst friends over a drinks.FoodThe Vegan Taco - is the hidden gem of the taco offerings.  It is flavorful and hearty without feeling like you have missed out on something.Shrimp and Grits Chimichanga with the Black Bean dipping sauce is delicious and the polenta like texture of the grits adds smoothness to offset the crunch.  The dipping sauce adds a little sweetness from the black beans.  Great little appetizer to start.DrinksThe beer list is manageable with the bar staff being attentive to questions.  The cocktails like the Abolitionist are strong but balanced, plus eating the edible flower is a fun twist.  The drink special is a boot of the day, which adds a little something extra to the traditional drink special.DecorThe decor is a throw back to the retro prohibition days and the tin ceiling and re-purposed tables add to the overall theme.  The TVs in each area are needed as Chicago is a sports crazed.OverallA nice addition to the taco scene in Logan Square with solid choices.  This is not the place for tex-mex or traditional Mexican foods.  Instead, the southern twist is new welcome addition to the scene."

Room looks nice. I did not have any food but what I saw people eating look very good. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice but the cocktails where not good!! We tried 6 of them between 3 of us and all of them were way to sweet and the main spirit was no where to be found in any of them. For $10 for each of them I would expect better. We all left because our stomach hurt from all the sugar in the cocktails. We might go back and try the food but cocktail program has allot of work needed to make them appealing. Beers look like any other Logan Square bar...

Come on, do they make the chips fresh for each order? Most likely not since ours tasted a bit stale. I had the bourbon beef taco and fried chicken taco. Absolutely no flavor in either expect for the spice gravy on chicken. A chicken tender with gravy in a tortilla is not a good combo. I eventually separated the two. On its own, the tortilla was good. Chicken was dry and I even choked on it. My friend had the pork shoulder taco. That was tasty. I&#39;d recommend that one. The only reason I would return here would be if I were stop in for a drink."

It seems like there are a lot of new places in this neighborhood that put an emphasis on looking cool with retro items that aren&#39;t really functional or in some cases comfortable, while others can&#39;t seem to contain a sense of moral superiority about their menus (I was once told I couldn&#39;t have decaf at Bang Bang Pie Shop because the owner didn&#39;t believe in selling inferior products--it only went downhill from there.) In most cases comfort seems to be afterthought. This place is such a refreshing change--especially the design of it--even little things, like that the way the front patio seats face the street so customers are integrated with it rather than being fenced off. Same with the inside. The tables are just far enough that you have privacy and the music is good but not oppressively loud. Maybe it&#39;s the Southern hospitality thing. Who knows. I&#39;m just really glad they are here."

The patio with picnic tables was very inviting and there was a nice diverse crowd when we arrived. The staff was very friendly and helpful as my friend and I weren&#39;t sure on how things worked there. We ordered in line and then sat ourselves with a table number.We got chips and guacamole, shrimp tacos, ribeye tacos, and the chicken tacos. Some people are bothered by not being able to order the tacos as a single item as they come in two, but if you are going with others, then it should be no problem in swapping and sharing, so this wasn&#39;t a big deal for me, as I essentially got to try 3 different tacos.The guacamole was fresh and tasty. The slices of radish seasoned in tajin were a nice touch. I enjoyed all the tacos, but the shrimp one was best for me as the fried kale really elevated the taco. My friend also enjoyed her horchata, as it wasn&#39;t overly sweet.Overall, we only waited about 10 minutes for our food to arrive and our server was very nice. We snagged a bottle of hot sauce from a nearby table and this was tasty. Tacos weren&#39;t too small or too big and prices were maybe a touch steep, but not too bad, especially as the food was good. This is a great casual place for friends to catch up or for families or just somewhere to grab a bite. If you want authentic tacos, then go down the street, but I welcome something new and different in the neighborhood, and now I don&#39;t have to go all the way to WP!"

So, when they finally opened me and my mom visited A.T. to see what they had to offer. We ordered the garlic shrimp taco and sweet &amp; spicy chicken taco. While we waited we got some of their famous drinks. As one commenter stated, the drinks have way too much ice which seems to water them down and becomes a waste of money. The owners wife came over and I had a chance to chat with her about Antique Taco. She was very nice! However, I have to be honest about my review. I have come here and tried other things off the menu as well. Here is a list and my ratings:Garlic Shrimp Taco: Was the best thing on the menu until they changed the recipe! The first time I went I loved it, just went recently and it was ...Yuck! Especially if you&#39;re expecting to taste it the original way that you had it and you bite into something else. I was starving one day and had a taste for it and was thoroughly disappointed. Why in the hell did they change the recipe?..I will never know.Sweet &amp; Spicy Chicken Taco: Greasy for some reason..not the best but not the worst either.Creamed Elote: Horrible! I&#39;ve had authentic Elote from a street vendor which was delicioso this was a no, no! I didn&#39;t even finish it.Horchata: Eh ok.Guacamole &amp; Chips: Good. If you messed up on this simple dish then you would need to go out of business.Fish Taco: It&#39;s ok but Definitely missing something like other people have stated. What? I don&#39;t know yet.Some other things that disspoints about this place is everytime I have a taco it&#39;s cold. After waiting so long your food is not fresh and hot. As much money as you spend in that place cold food should be the least of your worries. Lastly their system seems to be unorganized or something. I can not understand why people have to wait so long for their meal. Someone doesn&#39;t know what they are doing or they don&#39;t have enough manpower in place to produce the food faster.All in all, hopefully Antique Taco will take some of their Yelpers advice because it&#39;s nice to see a new spot off of 35th instead of all the way on 31st. We need more places over this way to frequent."

I sipped on the shake will I waited. Let&#39;s start with the shake. What a genius idea to take two very delicious items and bring them together! Wow! It was rich and very tasty!I waited for about 10min for the order. The fish tacos were crispy and flavorful. The ribeye tacos were tender and full of flavor. The chili cheese curds were everything!

I&#39;ve been waiting for a few days to try it since its grand opening. The line out the door has deterred me from doing it any sooner, but it has also got me very curious.So, on a Sunday night after a late lunch, my husband and I decided to go at 9pm. Lo and behold, no line at all. The service was friendly, but our food came super slow, it took about 35 minutes.We ordered:$7 Crispy fish - very good$8 Grilled ribeye - very good$7 Carnitas- good$7 Guac and chips - average$7 Rum horchata - yummy but small$5 Pils draft beer - okayThe tacos come in twos, and we didn&#39;t know. At first, I was sticker shocked when I saw the menu, and I thought to myself, never again. However, when I found out there were two of each, the price was a little more acceptable, but how the heck were we going to finish 6 tacos?!?! We ended up taking two home.In all honesty, the tacos were pretty good, but for like $4 each, I&#39;m not sure they will make it here in Bridgeport. The taco competition here is fierce, and with Pilsen down a few blocks serving $1.50~$2 authentic tacos, I don&#39;t know. Knowing that the owner is originally from Bridgeport, I hope he knows what he&#39;s up against."

We ordered two super crunch tacos (he didn&#39;t like it. I liked the octopus. The meat inside was okay. Reminded me of my own taco nights. Weird surf and turf that doesn&#39;t work together.), fish tacos (wasn&#39;t a fan of the red onions but he liked the contrast of acidity), pork carnitas tacos (loaded with meat, best flavor, even better when you use the sour cream that comes with the cheese curds), and cheese curds (great sized portion for $8, never been a fan of chili but I actually liked this one).Service was meh. The guy who brought our cheese curds gave us one bowl and fork and left with the extra bowl and fork that he had in his hands. So two people equals one bowl? Then we got our first order of tacos and the girl was going to take away our number stand without asking if we had more food coming (we did). I understand they haven&#39;t been open for a while and these are little kinks so I&#39;m willing to look over them.Since I live in the area, I would probably come back for the pork tacos or maybe the ribeye since I liked it when I was at the other location. Such a better &#34;late night&#34; spot. Plus I could see that the tortillas were being made by hand! Love that."

Considering it first open the line was long and the wait to get our food even longer.. stood in like maybe just 20 min and the wait for our food was nearly 50 mins.I&#39;d say give it about 3 weeks if you want to try it but don&#39;t have a lot of time or patience. It&#39;ll probably doe down. The food is decently priced for what you get. I mainly enjoyed the enchiladas and the shrimp tacos.

The slaw was expected, but it tasted like someone had accidentally dropped a cup of liquid smoke into it when the recipe called for a drop. It prevented anything else from being tasted so I had to scrape it off to be able to eat these tacos. The smell was so strong that I was having liquid smoke burps up to 12 hrs later. This was nothing like the taco I had from the antique taco street vendor a few years ago.Fish taco issue was excusable. What came in the pork jowl taco was not. After taking a bite I noticed a weird texture in my mouth. I swallowed, set the taco down, inspected it for a second, and found a 1&#34; by 2&#34; piece of pork jowl WITH ABOUT 40 OF THE PIG&#39;S SPIKEY BLACK CHIN HAIRS (~8mm/ea) STILL GROWING OUT OF THE PIECE OF JOWL. I almost vommed. Did they forget to shave/skin the pig before they butchered it?I told the waitstaff and she took the taco off the bill, thank sweet baby Jesus, but I was so grossed out that I don&#39;t think I can go there again. I would have expected the entire bill be comped for this grievous offense. The server gal said the manager was coming out but she never did, so we left."

Coming back tomorrow.(I did ask for the house hot sauce that was on other tables, and it wasn&#39;t delivered to us at all during our meal, but I don&#39;t want that to detract from my review or experience- it&#39;s more about giving feedback to a great establishment to help make it even better! So well done!)"

We stood in line for about 45 minutes and then waited for our food on the patio for about 45 minutes. Luckily, the weather and music were good. I had the coconut margarita while we waited, which was alright. My bf and I shared the garlic shrimp, crispy fish, grilled ribeye and pork carnitas tacos (in the order of most to least favorite). Yes, we both had 4 tacos each. We ordered waaay too much food. I should have known better since I&#39;ve been to the original spot a few times. I&#39;d recommend 3 tacos per person or 2 tacos and a shared appetizer. Unfortunately, they were already sold out of the super crunchy taco, so I&#39;ll have to come back for that. I like the atmosphere and the food here, so hopefully the lines and wait are not as bad next time."

We went to their &#34; Shake, Rattle and Roll&#34; free event to celebrate their arrival here in the Bridgeport area. They gave everybody a treat of ice-cream or a horchata milk shake and free smiley booth photos! We had a blast. Of course, we had to also order some tacos! Why not we were in there. I ordered their rib eye tacos for $8 you get two sizable tacos full of juicy rib eye beef topped with some micro-greens i think arugula and some onions and fresco. It was really good tacos I loved their freebies as well the Horchata milk shake is what dreams are made of! It had the delicious rice cinnamon sweetness with the thickness of a milk shake the combination is dreamy. Let me say I can&#39;t wait to walk down here to try some of their margarita&#39;s next time it looks like a great place to get a quick fun date night and it&#39;s just down the street from house, it&#39;s another bonus.We dined in their outdoor patio. It was a rainy day but it was warm out so we just stuck with outdoor dining.  It has a fabulous dining hipster vibe type of atmosphere. Totally welcoming to children of all ages and the staff is so sweet and kind. We hope this place works out brings a lot of people into the Bridgeport area and see what Bridgeport has to offer!"

They are incredibly unaccomodating, and wouldn&#39;t allow two people in my group to order their meals the way they wanted them.They also only allow you to order pairs of tacos, which is just needlessly stupid. Let me order two separate tacos, don&#39;t force me to order two of the same. I would have loved to have ordered three different tacos and tried them all, and perhaps if I had been allowed to order what I wanted I wouldn&#39;t have been so disappointed.I ended up getting the fish tacos and they were bad, definitely the worst I&#39;ve had. The cabbage slaw had a pleasant smokiness but the fish itself was bland and slightly undercooked and the entire package was just underwhelming and disappointing. I was shocked that it was so bad.I ate with a group of four guys and only one of us was satisfied with their meal. I will never go back  -there are tons of great restaurants in the Bridgeport/McKinley area and this isn&#39;t one of them. It&#39;s all style and no substance."

Antique Taco goes for quality over quantity for your price, which is what you should expect. Their menu is sparse, but still has variety. Every item is small but loaded with ingredients. Lastly, everything is delicious, but overpriced. With every good thing you find, there is something not as good. Like many people say, it&#39;s definitely not an every day kind of thing, and if it was cheaper I&#39;d go there more, but it is definitely a once in a whole kind of place."

I wished it was just octopus without the beef.I love the fun drink selections here all served in fun mason jars. This location has a big outdoor seating area good for a big group. My only reservation is that the food takes a very long time to prepare. We waited over an hour on s not so busy day. It&#39;s fine on a nice day with a group of friends to hang with but might not be an ideal place to eat if you&#39;re pressed for time.

The pork carnitas was ok nothing spectacular. The grilled rib eye I felt was under seasoned and overcooked. The sweet and spicy chicken was up next and did not disappoint.  This taco was full of vibrant flavors that meshed very well.  Next up was the potato and poblano. I felt this was by far the best taco of the four. The elote was a very interesting spin of what I&#39;ve had on the street. Very rich and tasty.  I will be back when the fervor calms. The poor staff was definitely overwhelmed with the volume. I&#39;m sure this contributed to a subpar experience.

Both dishes were flavorful and portion sizes were fairly generous. Each taco had 3-4 shrimp and I had a hard time closing the tortilla. Drinks were ordered at a separate counter/outside window.  The lavender paloma was refreshing and the lavender flavor wasn&#39;t overpowering.

Yes, they bring your food to your table, but, that seemed mostly because there&#39;s nowhere to stand and wait for it.On a $100 bill - which doesn&#39;t take too long to achieve, given $3.50 tacos and $8 drinks - you&#39;re tipping $15 for the privilege of standing in line to order your food...also, there were no bike racks, which, really? in bridgeport, serving hipster tacos and you can&#39;t spring for a few bike racks?"

If you are looking for your typical mexican taco served with bland rice and beans than do not come here. However if you are looking for something that is elevated and a menu that will provide your palate with new and exciting flavors than this is the place for you. The food here combines some traditional aspects of mexican cuisine with tastes from around the world. I was pretty hungry so I ordered 3 sets of tacos which more than enough. The tortillas are made fresh in house and the ingredients taste like they were just pulled from the farmers market. My favorite taco was the pork carnitas but the fish and ribeye were close seconds. I washed everything down with a rosemary margarita which was probably the best margarita I have had in my life. All in all the whole experience was great and I would defintely recommend going here for a night out.

We added this to our list and even though it was a little out of the way from the areas we spent most of our time, it was worth the trip!We headed here on a weekday for an early lunch and at the time we got there we were lucky not to wait very long. The place is pretty small so I could see it getting crowded a little later. The people working at the counter were friendly and explained several of the menu items to us. I decided to order two bacos (pork and steak) and the chorizo egg rolls. My husband ordered one of the rice bowls that included pork, shrimp and Chinese sausage. They had plenty of bottles of Sriracha lying around to increase the spice levels for those who wanted it.My personal favorite was the pork carnitas baco, and I personally loved them being served on a bun. The flavor was different but in a good way. I liked the pineapple with the pork. As people have noted, they are small, but two plus two of the egg rolls was enough for lunch for me. I also liked the egg rolls, but as my husband said they almost had too much meat and not enough of the other stuff (sweet potatoes and other veggies). I did love the avocado aioli that came on the side (I wanted to dip everything in it!). My husband enjoyed his rice bowl and it was a pretty large size for lunch.Saucy Porka is worth a trip for lunch, especially if you are in the mood to try something unique and different!"

The miso braised pork bao was too salty and had a barbeque-esque flavor. The asian style paella was pretty good. It had pork, sausage, and chinese sausage. I thought the chinese sausage added a nice flavor to the dish. Not something I would have thought to add but it worked great in this dish! The chorizo egg rolls were decent but it wasn&#39;t as flavorful as it sounded. The best dish in my opinion was the curry sweet potato fries. But honestly, it&#39;d be pretty difficult to screw those up!Service was great though! We had a party of 6, and the place is pretty tiny. Right away, they tried to find a table that would fit us and our server was super attentive and informative."

If baffles me that I still don&#39;t have a review for Saucy Porka.What have I tried? Curry sweet potato fries, chorizo egg roll, saucy pork sandwich, Ho Chi Minh sandwich, and short rib bao. I am not a big fan of the baos, but I almost always repeat the sweet potato fries, chorizo egg roll, and saucy pork sandwich.The sweet potato fries&#39; crispiness is done in perfection. Every time I take a bite, I wonder to myself, &#34;How did they get it to this texture without burning it?!&#34; The spice and curry aioli sauce is also exceptional. The egg roll is packed with queso fresco cheese, sweet potato, red cabbage, onions, and chorizo. To its side is the avocado aioli for dipping. In no way to degrade this egg roll, it fondly reminds me of the chop suey egg rolls that I use to have in my childhood years. The execution and wrap is similar but the ingredients are the major difference. This chorizo egg roll and its queso fresco cheese has me hooked. Last but not least, the namesake saucy pork sandwich has tasty, tender pork carnitas topped with kimchi. Ever since having it, I haven&#39;t touched the other sandwiches at Saucy Porka again."

Not very good value. They&#39;re pretty pricy for such small baos. I mean they try and stuff as much stuff in there, but it&#39;s so small that it fits as much as a taco.Took the subway there, so I didn&#39;t have to deal with parking. The seating area is small, but can handle groups; it&#39;s more of like a fast food place so you don&#39;t feel the need to stay very long.Ordered:Pork Carnitas topped with pineapple salsa and served on a steamed bao bun $2.75(nothing special than a carnita taco in Dallas.)Thai Chicken Curry topped with pickled Asian slaw served on a steamed bao bun $2.75(very dry and not strong curry flavor)Miso Braised Beef Short Rib topped with pineapple salsa served on a steamed bao bun  $3.50(My favorite one)My husband and I tried this with some fries from the Frite shop 2 stores down."

Two hours later, I was at Saucy Porka.Walking in, the restaurant is very small but has the ability to seat a lot of people at the inside tables. After studying the menu, I had a tough time choosing between the baos and the ramen. Thankfully, the ramen came in a half size so I could get both! (Honestly, I was probably going to get both of them even if it came in a regular size...but thankfully didn&#39;t have to) anyways, I ordered the Thai chicken curry, the miso braised short rib and the sofrito marinated shrimp, and of course, the 1/2 order of ramen.The Thai chicken curry bao is life changing. It was like biting in to a cloud and then that cloud explodes with flavors of curry and happiness all bouncing around your tongue. On a side note, I wish I could take a nap on one of those baos. They are so soft and addicting. Anyways back to the bao tacos. Next to try was the miso braised short rib. The sauce drizzled on the beef was thick and very sweet. While I liked this, I didn&#39;t love it nearly as much as the chicken curry. Finally the sofrito marinated shrimp. To me this had absolutely no flavor. I couldn&#39;t put my finger on what they were going for here, but either way I had one bite and was done. Not worth finishing it.Finally the ramen. It was both light and perfectly satisfying. Chucks of jalapeño may terrify you but the seeds create a delicate balance to the salty flavors and really balance the entire soup. The short rib melts in your mouth with each bite and makes you want to cry each time you have to swallow and end the amazing experience.Overall I would give the chicken curry a 10 (it honestly deserves a standing ovation from everyone inside the restaurant at the time with me), miso braised short rib a 6 and the shrimp a 3. The Ramen gets a solid 8.5 with a high snap of approval.Next time I would be interested in trying more of the baos or even a rice bowl. All looked great as I passed by others and stared down their food.:)"

The baos were small and I would need at least three to be full. I orderd two baos and the large sweet potato fries and the total came close to $12.The pork carnitas was bomb but the thai chicken tasted off to my taste buds. Fries were decent, meh, I&#39;ve had better. But the thing that stood out was the sauce that it came with. That made things much more flavorful.One thing I didn&#39;t like about this store was one of the name of the sandwiches, dubbed &#34;Ho Chi Minh&#34;. I don&#39;t want to make things political but it irks me since Ho Chi Minh was the leader of the communist party in North Vietnam and I don&#39;t support the store naming one of the sandwiches after him.Service was fast and friendly. If you get a sandwich or just two baos, they bring it out on this food basket and it makes things look very empty. It&#39;s probably not a big deal but if you&#39;re one of those social media people, just a heads up, it won&#39;t be Instagram worthy.."

If you are in the area and just really craving Latin and Asian flavors then definitely stop by here. They have a great selection of Bao tacos (Bacos), banh mi sandwiches, noodles, and Latin and Asian influenced appetizers and well as desserts and beverages. The prices are a bit high, but it is in the downtown business area. This concept of fusion can be tried elsewhere in Chicago for cheaper though.I ordered the Arroz Con Edamame, Curry Sweet Potato Fries, and the Thai Curry Chicken Baco. Everything was really delicious! For $9 the Arroz con Edamame was a bit pricey for the size, but they do give a fair amount of the braised pork. The flavoring in the rice and meat was very good. The Fries were perfectly seasoned as well and the aioli that accompanied it was so delicious! I couldn&#39;t help but use all of it. The Baco was just okay. Maybe I was just incredibly hungry and basically inhaled it so I could not really taste much of the curry flavor, but the bun was soft and the chicken itself was tender.Nonetheless, the experience was nice and the food is worth a try!"

I got the miso braised short rib rice bowl, which had an extremely generous serving of short ribs and rice. The miso flavors were subtle--more subtle than that of Spotted Monkey-- but all the more delicious because of that, and the ribs were extremely tender. My one (very slight) issue would be the cook of the rice--I didn&#39;t taste the coconut flavors as stated on the menu, and the rice was a little overcooked to the point of being a large white blob.Despite this, I loved the meal and would definitely be back again, especially to try the adzuki beignets.  Being sister restaurants, Saucy Porka and Spotted Monkey have rather similar menus, and overall I&#39;d prefer the rice bowls at Saucy Porka and the bacos at Spotted Monkey."

I&#39;ve never had a fail from yelp ratings, it was rated 4 1/2 stars!!!!First off, the price point for the amount and quality of food was not fitting. I wouldn&#39;t even say that the food was average, from taste to warmth and texture all was below average.We had the shrimp bao, braised short ribs bao, Asian style paella, sweet potato fries, and Vietnamese coffee.The short rib bao had pineapple but they were neither sweet nor sour which added no benefit to the taste. Checking the pineapple taste before adding them to these baos might be beneficial. The shrimp slaw was bland, probably need to recheck seasoning before serving these again.If you&#39;ve had Vietnamese coffee before, don&#39;t try theirs. This was nothing compared to Vietnamese coffee, better off getting soda or water.Overall, expensive for below average food with good customer service."

I would say, this entree was &#34;miso-inspired&#34; at best. My friends and I managed to beat a truly insane lunch rush line, but I wouldn&#39;t say the quality of the miso bowl was worth it. Granted, my portion was far larger than my friends who ordered the other &#34; baco&#34; items or appetizers. Did I mention the bowl was $11? This is not for those trying to scrimp on a budget.On top of all of this disappointment, patrons kept eyeing one of the seats at our table. One of my friends was 2-3 minutes late, and we were trying to keep the seat until she arrived. Even while she was ordering, people kept trying to move the seat.

Very nice flavor profile on each. Between the two, I liked the short rib one more. Mostly because I&#39;m more of a beef than chicken person.I also tried the Curry Sweet Potato Fries topped with queso fresco cheese served with curry aioli ($3 half/$5 full).

The tacos were not good to me at all, i dont know why everyone here is praising the mango slices that tops these because it did not compliment it at all! Moreover, it added a sour taste to the tacos and killed the savory goodness of it altogether. The sandwich was decent, not the best ive ever had (and ive had a lot of banh mi&#39;s in my life lol) I would get it again but not if I wasnt craving it. The meat was kind of dry, I thought the whole thing could have used some more sauce. But the saucy porka sandwich was the only thing I could finish.I&#39;ve tried plenty of korean/asian infused mexican restaurants in the past. And saucy porka did not meet my expectations.

The presentation was great - made it look even more delicious. The paella dish was amazing. Definitely tasted the fusion flavors. I loved every bite! The rice was nice and crunchy and the pork sausage made it taste so much better! They also have sriracha sauce if you want to add some kick to your food. As for the buns, I was a fan of the shrimp (with a green sauce) and the beef one. The pork one was way too dry - we had to drench it with sriracha. The curry chicken tasted weird. The curry wasn&#39;t like any other curry that I&#39;ve ever tasted - it was weird.Although not a sit in restaurant, their employees would still come around and ask if we&#39;re enjoying our food.

I tried the saucy porka sandwich and also ordered the chicken curry baos. I was with two other people and they tried some baos and other sandwiches too. We also all shared the chorizo egg rolls.The flavors of the food were great and the portions definitely fill you up! I didn&#39;t really like the cassava chips that came with the sandwich, though. The sweet potato fries were also a bit undercooked which was kinda disappointing. But the sandwiches, baos, and the egg rolls were fantastic!The restaurant itself is a bit small, but clean. Service was great. I appreciated them allowing my mother to sample some kimchi, as she had never really eaten it before and was afraid of the spice. Glad she tried it too, as it was too much spice for her. If I was ever in the area again I would totally stop by this little spot again."

I had the Asian paella and a can of coconut juice ( the juice was my idea and one of my favorites ).. It is almost like any paella I have tried so far.. Yellow and dry.. Which I did not really like.. The only vegetables was a little bit of edamame and green onion.. It had more meats I could not really identify and it was also a little over cooked with I think terayaki sauce.. So the dish was flavorful, but dry and overcooked.. So I was not impressed.. The can was 2 or more dollars, where you can get it for 1 dollar at other places.. The dish was 10 dollars, but it should have been cheaper.. They brought out the dish almost too quick, so nothing was really fresh.. To me, it was a little less than OK..To be fair, I did not try the other dishes and I probably should have read more reviews before trying the 4.5 star place.."

We stopped by during lunch and the line was out the door (always a good sign)!This is an adorable little lunch spot with limited seating inside, but this is better for a quick grab and go. You order at the front but if you do decide to dine-in; waiters will bring your food to your table (very friendly and quick). Each table is stocked with a whole bottle of sriracha, that&#39;s a definite plus automatically gets two stars for that! Latin and Asian fusion is an interesting concept but one that I definitely appreciate since it&#39;s a combination of two of my favorite cuisines. We got the Asian Style Paella and I just couldn&#39;t stop shoveling spoonful of rice into my mouth (I wish the spoons were bigger). They used Mexican style yellow rice cooked with a mixture of meat and veggies and the rice itself was lightly seasoned so not loaded with MSG as is the nature of most Asian dishes. The rice by itself was good but dump sriracha all over that thing and it&#39;s like fireworks in your mouth. Where this place does lose a star is the dryness in the Pork Carnitas Bao Tacos (they call it the Bacos - love it!) where the meat was a little too dry. The sauce wasn&#39;t properly soaked so if you were to just eat the meat it would catch in your throat. The shrimp was delicious and the short ribs were excellent though! Not too big fan of the curry flavor though. Tasted a tad bit watered down, can&#39;t taste the kick of the classic herbs in curry.But it&#39;s still a great lunch spot and it might&#39;ve been just minor bloop in my order but I would still recommend this place to anyone visiting the city."

You have: asian with latin themes, and latin items with asian themes. As someone who enjoys all food, this fusion gets bonus points for being so unique!I had eggrolls filled with chorizo, a paella filled with what would normally be in a pho, and curried sweet potato fries which I would have certainly preferred to be a little spicier.People will mention in tips constantly &#34;avoid the main lunch hour rush&#34;. They are not kidding at all. This place is moving and very busy, and very, very not a place to go at noon.Meanwhile, the food is pretty awesome and there are far more vegetarian options than I could have hoped for - even if that isn&#39;t the route I went.

My favorite part was picked onions that came with it: sweet and tangy without any of the normal spicy punch you get from eating raw onion. Instead you&#39;ll be crying tears of joy from this delicious combinations of flavors in your mouth.The Spicy Porka was also delicious with kimchi and juicy pork. It&#39;s not very spicy at all so make sure to add lots of siracha if you like it hot! The kimchi was also very done, all leafy tender parts and none of the super thick base of the cabbage that it hard to eat.Last thing to note, the staff here is super friendly and nice!

All in all, it was an A-OK experience but has nothing on Momofuku&#39;s (NY) pork buns or Mistral Kitchen&#39;s (WA) pork buns. The short rib was the only baco flavorful enough for its bun. I liked the shrimp but the sofrito marinade needed a little something extra. For me, the curry chicken and carnitas were on the bland side. I think maybe if you invest in one of the $0.50 sauces, you might have a better experience. Service was quick and my husband and I were in and out in about ten-fifteen minutes on a Friday afternoon. Definitely a nice to try if you&#39;ve never had a pork bun taco but I agree with Sherry Y - a little overhyped."

I also had to try the Banana Nutella Beignets ($3). It comes with two pretty decent size beignets. The taste isn&#39;t like normal beignets, but it still tastes good. Only down fall was one of my beignet nuggets didn&#39;t have banana&#39;s in it. I will be coming back to try more options. Glad I found out about this place.

I got the bacos, they were super tiny and the whole meal was about 12 bucks. So since this place is rated in yelp with one $ sign, I though I would get a lot for the price.. But sadly, its pretty expensive if you account for portion size. I was still staving after my meal.. Not worth the trip."

A coworker and myself ordered several bao taco&#39;s and an appetizer and it came out faster than I expected. With 10 other people having already ordered food before us, I say we waited at maximum five minutes.Atmosphere/Service - The dynamic team that runs this restaurant should be taken out for a round of drinks, because the service is phenomenal. At most lunch places I assume it&#39;s going to be you&#39;re in, you&#39;re out and you barely interact with anyone after the time you pay. I had staff members ask me how it was, offer to get me water and bring me hot sauce without asking. For a casual lunch experience I thought it was really well done.Flavor -  Last and certainly not least is the flavor that packs a huge punch.  I ordered the miso braised short rib and the tai chicken curry baco&#39;s. Let me say that each had a distinct, unique taste that held no comparison to the other, but they worked harmoniously together. The miso braised beef short rib taco&#39;s are truly incredible - rich, just enough sauce and I didn&#39;t feel like I was left wanting more because the serving sizes were perfect.In conclusion, give Saucy Porka a go for your lunch time cravings and try as much on that menu as you possibly can."

The space is small, understandably, so we took our food across the street and ate outside.I had a chorizo eggroll, which was good, but I wanted it to be better. The chorizo lacked the spice it needs to make this a really fun, exciting food.I also had a couple of bao tacos. The pork carnitas were out of this world. The pineapple salsa was a nice, cooling touch on the slightly spice meet. The bao in place of a traditional tortilla makes for a soft, chewy shell. I also had the soy ginger tofu taco. Flavorful with a bit of kick.My only true disappointment was that I ordered the mojitio lemonade and was given plain lemonade instead. Not the end of the world, but because we&#39;d left and gone elsewhere to eat, there was no opportunity to correct it.Definitely worth coming here for lunch, though plan wisely because seating is so limited."

When ordering I told the cashier I did not want bean sprouts on mine, which totally derailed my order.  She said all the vegetables were cooked together so if I didn&#39;t want bean sprouts, it would be a longer wait.  I asked what the other vegetables were (3x times!!) and she couldn&#39;t answer. It was a very awkward ordering experience so I just subbed the mystery veggies out for kimchi - when all i wanted was no bean sprouts!The guy bringing out the order was super great and friendly and made up from the cashier&#39;s ineptitude.Will definitely come back for the baos and banh mi!"

The bao tacos, or bacos as they are called, have a fluffy outer bun and a delicious filling, such as curry chicken or pork carnitas. The sweet potato fries, which are normally pretty awesome, are taken to another level thanks to the curry aioli.The banh mi offerings are no slouch either. I&#39;m not sure I would call carnitas served with kimchi a banh mi in the traditional sense, but it&#39;s still a nice and unique combination of flavors.Service was superfast, and the gentleman behind the counter was quick to offer advice on what to eat.

I quickly learned that not only was maneuvering around the large commuter crowds overwhelming, the lines for lunch around this area is total chaos. Long lines and hungry people...Bad combo.During lunch one day, I decided to find a place along a road that seemed less taken. At first I thought it was an alley, but to my surprise it was actually a street! Tucked in the corner away from the hustle and bustle is a barely noticeable sign of a joint called Saucy Porka. Unsure of what I was getting myself into,  I entered the place, and was immediately welcomed by the cashiers along with the fairly large group of people. Some of whom looked like regulars, who eagerly pushed through to the front, while others like me, stood in the back, trying to take in the large menu as we try to look around to see what everyone else was ordering.Oh boy this menu! Listed on a chalkboard was a list of item I would have never fathom existed. On this one of a kind menu, all my eyes were drawn to BACOS. What in the world are bacos?! Just my luck, instead of tortillas, it is substituted with baos, which is like a steam bun. The line moved fairly quick, and next thing I knew I was next in line.With eyes bigger than my stomach, I wanted to say one of each please, but I knew I wouldn&#39;t be able to finished, so I settled for 3 tacos - Thai Chicken Curry, Miso Braised Beef Short Rib, and Soy Ginger Tofu, and a half order of their Curry Sweet Potato Fries.To my surprise, the order came out fairly quick. Of the 3 bacos, my favorite was the short rib. So much flavor! That pineapple salsa! People, you need to get on that! As for the fries, probably one of the best fries I have ever had. The curry aioli sauce got to me. They were crispy on the outside which seems like is hard to get that texture with sweet potato fries without burning it.Anyways, for a small little asian girl like me 3 bacos and a half order of fries was plenty! Stuffed and satisfied, this $15 lunch was a bit steep, but the experience was worth while."

The pork one was also good, but nothing special. The thai curry was pretty disappointing and came with more cole slaw than meat. The bacos are very small in size and range from $2.75- $3.50, so it&#39;s kind of pricey for what it is. Still, I love the fusion of flavors and the food is pretty good."

Staff was friendly. Place was getting busy around 11:45am Thursday. I got a large ramen to go and waited about five minutes for it. It was still pretty warm when I got back to the office. This was soooo satisfying. The plentiful beef short ribs were super hearty and gave off a nice flavor to the broth. This noodle soup definitely had deeper flavors than other lunch spots in the loop. I think I even tasted/saw some allspice? It will be hard not to order this again but I can only imagine other items being just as tasty. I just love reading their menu here. Everything sounds like a great blend of Asian and Latin flavors.

I was not very hungry when I came (already had lunch) but decided to have a second lunch since the items seemed small anyways.I started with the Chorizo Egg Roll. This was good and unique. I liked the avocado aioli, but I wouldn&#39;t say this is as mind blowing as other reviews make it out to be.Then, I ordered the Miso Braised Beef Short Rib baco. This was really good! The short rib was very soft and just falls apart in your mouth like it should. The marinade is yummy too and I really liked the pineapple salsa to complement it.I wasn&#39;t hesitant about getting dessert but I really wanted to try the Azuki Beignet. This was definitely a miss for me. The beignets weren&#39;t soft and fluffy as I had imagined - but I guess I am spoiled after visiting Cafe du Monde in New Orleans.

They had made the Hot and New list here on Yelp so my buddy/coworker who is an Elite suggested we go try it out. It was a bit of a hike from our office at Ogilvie but it was totally worth it.It easily made it way into our lunch rotation. If we had some time we would come. I would recommend you get the bao tacos/bacos. They are a delicious fusion of Asian and Latin cuisine. They use the bao&#39;s you typically find served in Chinese restaurants with duck as the taco shell/tortilla and fill it with your choice of traditional Asian tastes or Latin tastes, or a fusion of them. These are small so order 3 to 5 of them depending on how hungry you are. If you are hungry and haven&#39;t been before. Get one of each find your favorite.While the bacos are great, the ramen leaves a lot to be desired. Definitely pass on that, you can get much better ramen elsewhere. The noodles as well as the soup base just weren&#39;t what they should have been (comparing to traditional ramen)."

Luckily, we snagged a table and therefore got to sit while we ate. Speaking of the tables, they have Sriracha at each one - YES!Bathroom: unknownStaff: The cashier was friendly and helpful with questions and the food was prepared, and delivered right to our table, relatively quickly.Food: We each had an assortment of the Bacos, I went with one of each (there are 5 total). I would have to say that the Tofu one was quite good and the pork one was by far my favorite. The only downside to these delicious little things is that same fact: they are pretty small. Literally two-to-three bites and they are GONE. I ate all five and exclaimed, &#34;Well, I&#39;m ready for 10 more...&#34; Also, they have free cups for water.Value: Given that each Baco is ~$3 each, and they are not large, I could go broke trying to stuff myself here...The Bacos were very, very tasty but the price is just too prohibitive of a usual lunch spot. This will be for special occasions only but I will be back for sure."

The location is tucked away a bit. Look for the pig on the sign. We ordered the short rib ramen, short rib rice bowl, 2 bao tacos and sweet potato fries. The best thing there were the fries. Amazing crunch and dipping sauce. Least favorite was the ramen bowl. It had too much of the star Anise flavor in it. the broth just wasnt that great. I opted for the shrimp taco and that was meh. Flavors needed to be more bold than what i tasted. I sampled the short rib rice bowl and that also i feel lacked some flavors. Id go again for the fries and possibly try something else.

This gem has mastered the art of keeping asian fusion affordable and delicious. I can&#39;t stand places that have such high markups on asian fusion food.

I have tired the saucy porka sandwich but I recall it being a bit messy since it is loaded with pork and kimchi goodness.This time I tired the Asian paella.

I wish I knew what makes that flavor. all the meats in the rice were delicious! mmm....sausage :POther people had the chorizo eggroll, a variety of bacos, the arroz con pork, the pork pho noodle, the short rib sandwich. everyone liked their foodThe service was uber friendly and accommodating. can&#39;t wait to go back.

The bacos were fun and the prices were your typical lunch fare prices in downtown.The space was clean, the service was great, and it is great for a speedy lunch.

I was impressed!I tried a Miso Braised Rib Baco and a Thai Curry Chicken Baco To go. The guy at the counter offered Sriracha on the side. Bacos are full of meat!Thai Curry was a little spicy. Definitely not unbearable, but it had a kick. Personally I thought was OK, but I can see people liking it depending on your taste preferences.The Miso Braised Rib was really nice! I would&#39;ve liked it better with rice I think because it was so dense. It reminded me of Korean pulled Ribs. On the sweeter side. I liked this one better. There is a rice bowl for this one. Might be something to try next time.One note though, I tried the bun seperately without the meat, and I couldn&#39;t taste anything. Maybe it was because the meat had so much flavor, but I wished there would&#39;ve been some sweet/saltiness on it.Worth trying."

I believe I had a pork carnita baco as well which was yummy, but see above, miso short rib, dream, etc.I also had a side of the chorizo egg rolls which were heavy but delicious, and delivered quite a kick that I wasn&#39;t really expecting! My spice tolerance is incredibly high so nothing fazes me anymore and I wasn&#39;t expecting much out of chorizo, but damn this was good.In case you haven&#39;t figured this out already, just a PSA--you WILL be in a food coma immediately after you scarf down your meal."

The coffee was my least favorite part of the meal and the only reason I can&#39;t give 5 stars. It was WAY too sweet for my liking and pretty difficult to drink.

They&#39;ve never seated me unless my whole party is present, even though I&#39;ve never seen the restaurant full. I know this is pretty standard at some places but it just seems unnecessarily strict when theres so many empty tables. I once called to make a reservation at 7pm and the woman who answered literally said &#34;Really? At 7pm, our most popular time?&#34; (it was very much a &#34;how dare you?&#34; tone) she managed to &#34;fit us in&#34; and when we showed up the restaurant was practically empty. The last time I was there my friend and I were waiting for one other person and not only would they not seat us, they made me sign in on their waiting list. The restaurant, again, was far from full and the &#34;list&#34; was a blank sheet of paper!

If you are not a vegan you must be open to trying somethings new. I tried this restaurant with a few friends some were vegetarian some vegan some just open and a carnivore but willing to try.  I enjoyed the dishes we chose to try and would come back for other I wanted to try but had not room for. The other three guest had very mixed feelings for the food. So back to what I said in the beginning you must be open minded to try &#34;something different&#34;.  The room is dark so reading the menu was a challenge, their concept is sort of sharing plates like tapas. The service was good, space is pretty tight. The staff was friendly.Again my experience was good as I had no expectations and I was open to trying something different, I would go back to try some other things on the menu, would only come back with like minded people but honestly I am not in a hurry to revisit"

This is the kind of place you take your non-veg friends or family to and they just don&#39;t get excited over veg food from it. It&#39;s good but not great and nothing particularly stands out to make them order it over meat.Service was friendly and there&#39;s a cute, intimate setting of booths as well as a bar. Most menu items can be ordered as a small or large portion, depending on the size of your group and your hunger. We split all of the following amongst our group of four:- Mana Sliders: Brown rice and mushroom based. These were served with a spicy (bright orange) mayo on a potato bun. The bun could certainly have had more going on and almost out-trumped the burger in size. Burger itself had good flavor and was definitely homemade. The mayo was also a bit overwhelming. The burger had solid flavor without so much bun and sticky mayo - side note, I&#39;m not a big mayo fan ever.- Caponata: This was good. It was a mix of eggplant and tomato and quite saucy. The toast, similar to the bun of the burger, was nothing special. The dish was good but we&#39;ve had better caponatas and nothing stood out (not super garlicy or fresh tasting).- Saag Paneer: Being married to an Indian, I&#39;ve tried my fair share of Indian dishes while dating, etc. This was off the mark, sadly. Our dining companion had raved about it, so we got the large serving. You didn&#39;t taste the dish, as they tried making the whole dish incredibly creamy. Spinach was there, but also barely noticeable because of the cream sauce itself. And almost no spice at all! Not the best Indian copycat. Filling, though - so if you&#39;re hungry, could be a good order.- Sweet &amp; Sour Tofu: Tasty and a good mix of sweet and sour. The tofu was seared well and you could combine it nicely with the other flavors, so it didn&#39;t have too much of the plain tofu flavor to it. Brighter flavors in this one.- Curry: Our favorite dish of all. By no means would we call it a traditional curry, but it had more flavor (still not spicy) than the saag paneer and a very comforting feel to it. We loved the mix of the cauliflower, lentils and mint - really adding to the flavor punch of this one.- Mushroom saute: Good but again not outstanding. Polenta was cooked well and wasn&#39;t too buttery or oily. It had sort of a mashed potato texture - a plus in my book! A solid amount of mushrooms well-sauteed on the top of the polenta, but the mushrooms didn&#39;t have that much flavor to them. They were juicy and large but not well-spiced.Nothing in particular was bad, but nothing stood out as amazingly good. If we lived in the city it certainly wouldn&#39;t be a regular spot for us, but maybe if we wanted something we knew we could order most things on the menu without having to have a special eye for vegetarian options, we&#39;d go back."

The curry and lemongrass noodles are one of my favoritesMost items come in a small size or large size which is great for sharing and trying lots of thingsThe goat cheese appetizer is a great - lots of bread- it&#39;s pretty big. But it&#39;s mainly goat cheese not a lot of the marinara sauce like it states.  Not like the usual goat cheese marinara dip where it&#39;s mainly sauce with cheese on topMy only negative thing is the service. Been here Multiple times and although the servers can be friendly then are not very attentive. Both times I felt like I had to wave them down for more wine and take out boxes and our checkOtherwise I highly recommend - even for meat eaters

We were looking for a great last meal to end my day on and I looked up &#34;food&#34; on Yelp and found Mana Food Bar with it&#39;s 4.5 star rating. I was a little skeptical since I personally am not vegetarian/vegan, but I wanted to give it a shot anyways.This is probably the fanciest little vegan place I have come across. Their outdoor seating is quite pretty. There was actually a wait for this place so we put our names down and waited for a text message to come our way. We were seated at the bar and given our menus. The place is very dim so it was sort of hard to see unfortunately. I decided to go with two popular items: the ravioli and the potato pancakes.The ravioli comes in a small and large portion. I opted for the small. The ravioli is filled with artichoke which I unfortunately could not taste due to the overpowering sauce. The ravioli is literally drowning beneath a blue cheese tomato sauce. The sauce is delicious, but the blue cheese overpowers every flavor on the plate. All I could taste was a rich blue cheese, hint of tomato and the texture of the ravioli pasta. Sadly, no artichoke.On the other hand, the potato pancakes were a hit! I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect but I was very surprised. It comes with sweet and white potatoes and an apricot currant chutney. The pancakes were crisp and I loved the combination between both kinds of potatoes. I would never think of potatoes pairing with apricots but I liked the combination! The apricot chutney wasn&#39;t overly sweet and had a very nice tanginess to it. I liked the small chunks in the chutney because it added some texture to each bite. The only thing I didn&#39;t like was that after some time, the chutney on top of the pancakes would start to make the pancakes mushy. Picking them up with the fork would cause everything to fall apart and it was hard to eat.Portion size wise, it&#39;s pretty small. If you&#39;re looking for a really hearty and filling meal, this might not be the place for you if you&#39;re trying to get your moneys worth. I was happy with just a small meal that night so it was enough. For both small dishes, it costed around $20 without tip. The food does seem like it is made from high quality ingredients though.Service was decent, but could have been better. My ravioli came out and the rest of my party&#39;s food came out. The waitress left telling us to have a good meal without mentioning anything about my missing pancakes. Thankfully they came out a few minutes later. The bartender was our server, and although he was friendly, he was busy half the time. We did get our water refilled once at a timely manner. They also were willing to split our checks which we appreciated.Overall, the place wasn&#39;t my cup of tea but I did enjoy trying something new. The flavors were there, but in my opinion, just needed to be balanced and structured better."

Sadly, I didn&#39;t feel any of those things at Mana.My boyfriend and I went to Mana on a Friday night for dinner and it was just alright. Nothing special and I probably wouldn&#39;t go again. We did as a matter of fact have one stand out item - the baked goat cheese with tomato sauce and toast was delicious. However, I&#39;m pretty sure you could find this anywhere so it&#39;s not anything super unique. Honestly, it tasted like a cheese pizza when you put it all together which is probably why we liked it so much. If you do go to Mana (or if you are on Yelp at Mana right now), get it! It was pretty good.The rest of the meal was pretty lackluster. We got the Ma Po Tofu, Ravioli, and 2 sliders, so we could each have our own. While the eggplant in the Ma Po Tofu was pretty good, the tofu was absolutely flavorless and there was barely any rice in the dish. The Ravioli was fine also - it tasted like a ravioli and sauce that I could have made out of a box at home (yay for Buitoni). And those famous sliders that I haveheard so much about. For $3.50 a pop, I&#39;d expect them to have a little piece of gold in them, or at least taste like a little piece of heaven in my mouth. Instead, it was bread encasing a salty mush that had no bite. The texture of the slider was all soft and there was absolutely no interesting element to the slider.Overall, I probably wouldn&#39;t recommend Mana in general or as a vegetarian restaurant. Tofu should never come completely flavorless and the prices are a bit high in my opinion for the quality and quantity of food presented."

The food is mildly flavorful at best, overpriced and bland at worst. These were certainly healthy options with quality ingredients, my gluttonous taste buds were left wanting more in both taste and texture. I recommend avoiding large options (when available) for this reason. The Cucumber Sakerita was decent (refreshing for outdoor dining in the summer), but any sake flavor was overwhelmed by what I presume was sour mix.To summarize, Mana Food Bar provides healthy, vegetarian options and friendly service that may, unfortunately, leave some (particularly omnivorous) diners mildly unsatisfied."

The experience was quite odd from the moment we made contact with the waitstaff.We were seated outside, and two employees were working total in the front area. They seemed to be chatting with each other and other guests for long periods of time, and we waited at least 15 minutes to order despite a somewhat empty restaurant.We started out with some drinks, the seared tofu with brown rice, and the sesame noodles. The waitress tried to tell us something about ordering an additional item with the tofu (something along the line of other guests enjoy it more with a side). It was quite odd, but we decided to start with those dishes first.When they did arrive, they were less than stellar. The portions were tiny for the price (coming from a SF/Bay Area guy that is more than wiling to pay for good food). The tofu was a salt attack, and I could barely finish the portion. The random brown rice on the side was tasteless.The sesame noodles were average at best, but certainly not worth the price.We decided to end our meal and head elsewhere for a better dinner. I thought the food at the Protein Bar was much better for a fraction of the price with larger portions.I will say that the polenta with mushrooms and the pasta on other tables looked much better than our dishes."

Of course, though, I definitely wanted to try the food. It&#39;s hard to find good vegetarian places that match my tastes and my apparently but unintentionally high expectations. I was with my friend, and neither of us were averse to vegetarian. We decided to small plate. We ordered the beet salad, bibimbap, linguini, and one slider.First, the service was slow, yet amiable and personable. The slow service was nerve wracking since I had parked on the street, and disgruntlement to my friend who hadn&#39;t eaten dinner last night nor breakfast and lunch today. The beet salad (yellow beet, arugula, Amish blue cheese, hazelnuts) came out first. It was so delicious! I totally recommend. Unfortunately it was the only dish we ended up really liking.Next was the linguini, which actually had ground red chili, chopped tomato, and clumps of cheese, cooked in olive oil. It was quite good: a subtle flavor that became increasingly spicy towards the end, ending with a little salty.Next came the bibimbap. My friend was most excited to eat this. Unfortunately, my friend had a bite, pronounced it extremely salty. I tried three to four grains of brown rice: yup, saltier than eating plain salt. Thankfully, our waiter was kind enough to address the problem. Since we were also waiting on the slider, we decided not to switch the order but cancel the dish.The slider was quite interesting. The patty is made of brown rice loosely held together the same way clumps of steamed white rice are - by the starch - and then roasted? It was held together in the shape of a patty. It was stuck to the bun by way of a spicy mayo that was more sweet and lightly tangy than spicy. My friend liked it. I thought it was just okay. It came with lightly pickled cucumber - basically cucumber soaked in vinegar.I would have liked to come back for the smoothie, but the food was overall a bit disappointing. The only thing we enjoyed was the beet salad. I will try to come back to try the smoothies.I really liked our waiter. He was funny and personable.I want to give Mana Food Bar 4 stars, but I think it is an overall solid 3/5. The food was adventuresome, but I think the long wait time for such small dishes spoiled our enjoyment because we were quite hungry, and would prefer to fill our bellies with food and not water. In the end, I&#39;m giving it a four because personable waiters have become a rarity considering some experiences I had, but I implore people to be mindful of the wait time. If there are more friends, it is a great chatting place as you wait."

After deciding not to come here the first time due to way too long of a wait, we were lucky to get in here with only a few minutes waiting time. Score! We were seated at the bar, which was more than okay by me if it means not having to wait absurd amounts of time.The menu has a ton of stuff that looks really delicious and the prices aren&#39;t cheap for a &#34;$$&#34; restaurant, so we had to choose carefully to keep it in the more affordable realm. We decided to split two entrees: the cold sampler and the large potato pancake. It irked me a little that we never mentioned anything to our server about wanting to split the food, but the sampler came out first with two plates and then the pancake came out also with two plates. It worked for us because it&#39;s what we decided, but I found that just a little odd. Maybe our waitress was just that observant!Now, on to the food. The tree cold appetizers were all good. I especially enjoyed the one with red onion and avocado in it. The quinoa was also quite good. My favorite was the potato pancake, though. The first thing that struck me was that it looked darker, thinner, and smaller than I was expecting. I wonder what the small size would have looked like? It was cut into different pieces and had this incredible sour cream (maybe it was vegan--I don&#39;t care!) to go with the pancakes. It was definitely a struggle to have to share with my girlfriend.Even better than the food was the service. I was so impressed that our friendly waitress/bartender gave us free samples of a really great lemon drink with real bits of lemon in it. She was very friendly throughout without broaching being unprofessional. I thought, &#34;She&#39;s definitely someone I would hang out with.&#34; Girlfriend agreed. I look forward to going back or just ordering out. Yes, that&#39;s an option!"

My fiancee and I went during restaurant week after we&#39;d been looking to try it for a while. We&#39;re both vegetarians so it&#39;s nice to have a classier option, but this is the type of place where open-minded meat-eaters could walk away happy. It&#39;s a cool atmosphere with lots of natural wood and plenty of bar seating, in addition to a few tables. The servers were very friendly and helpful, not the quickest but that&#39;s OK at a place like this. Really eclectic menu with so many small plate options. Try something new you haven&#39;t had before! Prices are reasonable for the quality of the food, but it&#39;s definitely not an everyday place. I love going somewhere where I can try new things I could never prepare myself, and that&#39;s Mana! Check it out."

Even the cocktails are terrific.Most things on the menu come in two sizes, so you can order many things, or just a few, based on your appetite and the size of your group. There&#39;s a number of cold items, as well as hot.We ordered several things and loved everything. Standouts were the mushroom sauté over creamy polenta, potato pancakes, gyoza, spanakopita, and the panzanella salad.The only thing I didn&#39;t care for (but I was the lone dissenter) was the artichoke ravioli, which came in a bleu cheese tomato sauce. I just didn&#39;t like the flavor combination.I would definitely go back, but probably on a day of the week when it was less crowded.

Unfortunately, that&#39;s where our service peaked. Our waitress was unfriendly and didn&#39;t offer a lot of guidance with the menu, and she was very inattentive. The food runner was similarly surly.The food did not impress us. The star of the meal was the mushroom and polenta dish, which is delicious (especially if you like cheese).  The rest of the meal--the pickled veg, the avocado salad, the Thai noodles--all good, not great.

She loved it! She loved it SO much that we went on an impromptu date to Mana last night. It was alright. It&#39;s just not my scene. I&#39;ll readily admit that it was good (which is why I rate it A-OK) but nothing really captured me.The atmosphere was tight (rather than intimate), busy (not ebullient), and rushed (instead of chill).The employees were absolutely friendly and obviously dedicated and good at their jobs. I loved them and wanted to hang out with them; however, they were juggling too many balls and could hardly dedicate much time to any single group.We went at 6:00 PM on a Friday and we had a reservation. I sat at the bar until M came and (because the bar tender was so nice) we chose to forgo our table in the new back section and stay at the bar. It was a good time and vantage point to see how things are at Mana.I liked my Almond Horchata and Nigori cocktail. I had two of them. It was sweet and creamy and I liked the flavor partner of the rice wine. M had a margarita (also made with sake) which was sweet and refreshing.We ordered the beet salad, the gyoza, two sliders, and the curry. I did not find the beet salad to be satisfying; however, the dressing was very fresh and had a strong taste of raspberries. I did not like the tofu cubes in the gyoza, but M LOVES tofu so she was a big fan. The sliders were a tad too salty and soft for my preference, but M LOVED them. It was kind of like eating a sloppy joe sans barbecue. Neither of us liked the curry and brought about half of it home.I asked the bar tender (who was cute as pie) if the tofu was non-GMO and she said that nearly everything at Mana is non-GMO. That&#39;s great! I hope it&#39;s true.By the end of the meal we were eager to go home and relax on the couch. We just needed some time away from the hullabaloo. M had to eat a couple snacks when we got home."

Mana isn&#39;t cheap but it is wonderfully tasty.I love the fact that Mana serves food that isn&#39;t trying to be vegetarian but just is. No weird texture issues with fake chicken or fake cheese or any of the above. The food is almost always on point although service here can be a true hit or a miss. I&#39;ve been here at least five or six times over the past three years so you can bet your bottom dollar I know a thing or two.AMAZING:- Bi Bim Bop: trust me, I&#39;m Korean and I know what good bbb is. This one isn&#39;t trying to be authentic because it has its own amazingly wonderful flavors and sauces. I&#39;m not one to usually say this, but the carrots in this dish are weirdly PHENOMENAL.- Mushroom Sauté: Everyone&#39;s favorite - I see every table get this all the time. The polenta is creamy in your mouth with the tanginess from the asiago cheese. The juiciness and garlicky-fragrance of the mushroom sauté is to. die. for. *The mushroom can sometimes be a wee bit salty but this varied on my different visits.DECENT:- Avocado, Arugula and Tomato: pretty straightforward, great dressing- Brussel sprouts: Crunchy and zingy. Can be too salty sometimes.- Mana slider: a lot of people wax poetry about this little guy so I guess it makes it on the decent list. Not the most mindblowing thing I&#39;ve eaten but they&#39;re downright dependably tasty if they&#39;re not too charred!SKIP:- Potato Pancake: think latkes! and then think, wet soggy latkes that are nothing like latkes. this is a sweet potato pancake that lacks the crunch factor so beloved in savory pancakes. it&#39;s not really worth your time.- Maki: BORINGJuice:- apple, pineapple and cucumber = refreshingService:- Blegh, it&#39;s a small place that can get pretty crowded. Come at off times because it&#39;s infuriating when you wait 15+ min between your dishes while the party that came after you somehow seems to receive all the things you&#39;ve ordered, first. And when you point it out to the waitress, she just rolls her eyes."

Brown rice and tofu just can&#39;t compete with a juicy steak or fresh slices of raw fish. Meatless dishes often lack that spark of flavor and sometimes taste dry and bland, or worse gloppy and gooey. So I decided to order cocktails with dinner instead of wine like I usually do. Cocktails, while tasty, generally overpower the food flavors.Once I tasted their food, I regretted my cocktail strategy. Their perfectly prepared and well-crafted dishes really deserve a nice wine or sake pairing. All the vegetables were slightly crunchy and seasoned just right. The polenta that came with the Mushroom Saute was one of the best polentas I&#39;ve tasted, with just the right amount of asiago cheese. The miso pepper sauce in the Bi Bim Bop more than made up for the lack of beef. Ditto for the ground pork in their Gyoza, which had a nice texture, not too hard, chewy or doughy.The cocktails were good but nowhere near as good as the food. I can&#39;t wait to come back here and enjoy their food properly with a nice glass or two of wine or sake."

That being said I asked them to cater my wedding (April 2013 - really late review!). They hooked me up with Sara Barg to plan the menu and rentals needed. Sara is literally the best person I have every met in my life! She did so much more than coordinate the catering. She made my wedding organized between every vendor, contacting them herself to schedule organized drop offs and deliveries (dj, liquor, officiant, an a capella group, a cupcake truck, photographers and more). She met with me at the venue multiple times to go over everything and was nothing but sweet everytime. She literally comforted me when everything was overwhelming.  I digress...The food at mana is spectacular. I love their pickles and use their recipe when I make my own. Bi bim bop, mushroom polenta, you really can&#39;t go wrong. We served the brussel sprouts at the wedding and people would come up to me saying they never liked brussel sprouts but love those! We also had the seasame noodles and caponata for finger foods before the meal and mac n cheese, ravioli, brussel sprouts and potato pancakes for dinner. Everyone loved it and I was very happy with the food and service.I felt the price was fair and certainly in line with other catering quotes I had recieved which is what made the decision easy.Thanks Mana and thanks again for hooking me up with Sara!"

We arrived again on a weekday night and they were able to seat us at the bar after only a few minutes. Score! The place is tiny, which is why it can be so tricky to snag a table without waiting at least 45 minutes. It being tiny also meant that, while sitting at the bar, that the woman sitting next to me kept accidentally elbowing me in the arm.The service here was IMPECCABLE. Both the host and the bartender/server were very friendly and I felt that we were well taken care of the whole meal from start to finish. While perusing the menu, we were given a sample of a lemony drink, which was great. We decided to share two dishes. I chose the cold sampler (basically three salads for $12) and he got the large potato pancake.Salads were our server&#39;s three favorite and they were great. One had avocado, one had quinoa, and one had red onion. They were great! Very small portions of each, though. The potato wasn&#39;t what I was expecting. It was thin, not thick, almost burnt, but it tastes AMAZING. One of the best potato pancakes I&#39;ve ever had, for sure.My only complaint is that I found the portions to be too small and too expensive for what you get. I could have easily eaten two of the &#34;large&#34; potato pancake and I&#39;m not a big person. I ended up reducing a star for that, but food is definitely five star-worthy. The Michelin bib gourmand designation certainly didn&#39;t mislead me here. I will absolutely be back to try more! If I find a dish that blows me away (small portions and all), I would upgrade a star to perfect."

Forgot to include the soda that we were charged for, which is just annoying. Slider was delicious, spicy mayo and quick pickle were great accompaniments. The chili was also nice, good garlicky taste and definitely provided that needed warm up on a cold night feel. Green curry noodles had a good flavor but would have benefitted from a touch of salt. Seaweed and cucumber salad did not work for us. Not a great combination of textures, and normally I&#39;m a big fan of seaweed.Would definitely go back for those sliders, but other than that not a lot calling me back."

It&#39;s about the size of a Smart Car, super popular, and they don&#39;t take reservations so you can imagine the wait at times. If you do decide to try your patience in line or grab a drink nearby (which they let you do) the menu is absolutely amazing from start to finish.You can share almost everything and I suggest you do. Between the two times I&#39;ve visited I&#39;ve only gotten through about half of the menu but can verify that the trio of salads, sliders, mushroom polenta, veggie burrito, brussels, goat cheese dip, toasted ravioli, and beet salad are all unbelievable.They serve beer and wine as well, but drink wise the most buzzworthy option is the freshly squeezed juices.

I was running late, but my friend put our name in. It took about 30 minutes to be seated. We sat at the bar, which was a little tight, but not unbearable.The staff was very friendly and we started off with sake cocktails. I opted for the pineapple and ginger saki cocktail. It definitely wasn&#39;t sweet and I really wasn&#39;t a fan. However, the food blew me away. My friend told me we definitely had to get the Mana Slider. It&#39;s a brown rice and mushroom burger served with spicy mayo. It&#39;s tiny for $3.50, but sooo good. It&#39;s hard to describe but I savored every crumb that fell on my plate. Everything else we shared (which I highly recommend doing). We got the Baked Goat Cheese which was delicious especially with the spicy red sauce. We also shared the spinach ravioli. Definitely go with the large order if you&#39;re hungry. Large comes with 8 Ravioli while small comes with 4.These past few years I have definitely become a fan of Vegetarian eating.

The service was excellent and while the ambience was not my style, it was in line with the philosophy of the food so all is well.My wife and I shared several dishes (she needs GF) and they were all fantastic. By far the best dish was the special potato soup with roasted garlic and relish. The broth was perfectly smooth with a creamy, but not excessively thick texture. The relish on top had a fantastic acidity that balanced the dish smoothly. While not the finest potato soup I have tasted (that honor goes to hot potato cold potato at Alinea), this was pretty darn close. Seeing as you get a full bowl of it, that is impressive. I had two complaints about the dish, both of which attest to the quality. First, it was a special item so we had no price. Had we known it was only $4 we would have ordered 2. Second, it was so great, that even the amazing dishes that followed fell short of this one.The second dish we had was the veggie chili. It was flavorful and not overwhelming. Even with big pieces of Jalepeno present it did not burn. While the flavors were fairly 1 note, its chili so its not supposed to be so deep.The third dish we had was the beet salad. It was just ok. The ingredient quality was top notch but the balance was a bit out of whack. The blue cheese really overwhelmed everything and the sherry vinaigrette was not enough to bring it back. I think an aged balsamic would have been bold enough to stand up to the cheese and bring out the sweetness of the beet.The fourth and fifth came out together and it was an amazing contrast on what a &#34;curry&#34; is. One was rice noodles with a green Thai curry and one was okra with an Indian Curry. The Thai curry was herbacious and lovely with a light burn of heat. The Indian Curry was much more assertive with heavy spices and tons of flavor. Both great dishes in their own way and contrasted well.The last item we ordered was a slider. It was really for me because it was not gluten free. It really just made my mouth happy. I would really consider coming and just ordering half a dozen of them, a couple beers and call it a night.Overall great experience."

Totally not worth the amount you pay for getting this kind of quality and quantity of food. We ordered ma po tofu which was awful tasting. We did not eat more than two spoons. The service is very slow too.... Disappointing!!

I took friends here who were in town from out of state and they were pretty excited. We didn&#39;t make a reservation and when we got there we only waited 15 minutes which was golden for a Saturday night. The only problem with this place is the service--it&#39;s terrible. Every time we ordered a drink it took 15 minutes or more to get it which I thought was ridiculous. The food took a very long time as well. I know they&#39;re cooking fresh but I felt like I was sitting there forever waiting. One of the friends in my party basically didn&#39;t get to eat with us because apparently the kitchen was taking forever to make 2 sliders. Everyone sitting around us who showed up after us were getting all of the sliders they ordered and we had to ask our server three times where the sliders were. I know that can sound ridiculous but when you&#39;re eating a tapas style place and someone orders two sliders it really should not have taken literally more than an hour to make and we shouldn&#39;t have had to ask three different times.I will say I gave Mana two stars because the food was delicious and so were the sake mixed drinks. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d come back to this place because of the service.

Optional because you can pick from size small or large.Everything we ordered here was amazing, one of the dishes that really stood out was the slider- best veggie burger ever!! You must try this magical slice of heaven! Also, the goat cheese was good, the pumpkin ravioli was great, but the potato pancakes were too heavy for my taste.My only compliant is that the size of this place is painfully small!

We went on a Monday night and waited about 30 minutes to get seated, but it&#39; was worth it.The staff is very friendly and the food is delicious. Everything that I have ordered has had a great blend of flavors. My favorite is the mana slider. You definitely have to try it! I would also recommend the mushroom saute. The polenta is very creamy, and it goes great with the mushrooms. I also loved the gyoza. I was not in love with the bi bim bop, but it might have been because I was pretty full by the time it came. However, the small portion is more than enough if you are ordering a bunch of stuff.I will definitely be coming back here to try more dishes.

It was highly recommended by a guy I met while traveling and I&#39;m glad I got the chance to visit.I started off with the small Bulgogi. It was good. It&#39;s basically a block of grilled tofu with some soy glaze on it. My only complaint is that the glaze was incredibly salty which wasn&#39;t an issue when eating the tofu but there were a couple slices (literally) of mushroom on top that were completely inedible because of how salty the glaze was. I also would have liked some more mushroom on top of it...maybe about 5 pieces that weren&#39;t doused in the soy sauce.Next came our sliders. These were adorable. They&#39;re simple (mushroom and rice patty) and the spicy mayo on them pulled the whole thing together. They are also served with some spicy cucumber slices (pickles I guess). They were delicious. My meat-eating bf had 5 of these sliders so he definitely enjoyed them. I liked them too.Then I had the small potato pancake. It was delicious. It&#39;s a bit like a dessert to be honest. It&#39;s sweet but not too sweet and the creme they serve with it makes it taste so rich. It&#39;s delicious. I just wish it was thicker since the edges were quite burnt and the pancakes is incredibly thin. For $7.50 I would have liked for it to be thicker/bigger.Even though I was full I really wanted to try the rice noodles. I&#39;m soooo glad I did. It was delicious. The server brought a bottle of some green pepper sauce to the table with the serving of noodles and some chopsticks. The pepper sauce is delicious; my bf and I loved it on the noodles. If you like Thai inspired flavours and lots of ginger, get the noodles!Altogether, we thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at Mana. It&#39;s a bit loud in there so I don&#39;t know that I recommend it for a first date but definitely good for couples, just be prepared to speak loudly. My favourite thing about Mana is that they have small and large portions of most of the menu items so you can order several small portions so you can try many at your individual visit. I recommend you check it out if you&#39;re vegetarian or not. Next time I&#39;m in Chicago, I&#39;ll be going to Mana for lunch or dinner for sure. :o)"

I love that this place is veggie-centric, but doesn&#39;t necessarily depend on carnivorous imitations or soy stock. They have plenty of items w/ just richly earthy organic ingredients and fresh and so clean-clean veggies.The hummus may be some of the best hummus on the block. It has a thick, smoky taste--incredibly flavorful and served with a pile of rustic bread and raw veggies. I highly recommend this item.I also had the goat cheese and the avocado/arugula salad. The goat cheese is sinfully divine. It&#39;s thick, potent, and mixed with a SPICY tomato sauce on the bottom that really gets the taste buds moving--also served with a wondrous pile of rustic bread. The avocado and arugula salad is a delightful mix of arugula, avocado, pickled onions, and salt/pepper in a zesty vinegar-based dressing. Amazingly mixed with perfect proportions of dressing to salad mix.I highly recommend Mana--to vegetarians, vegans, and meat-eaters alike. It&#39;s just that kind of joint--it brings us all together over absolutely delish food.TIP: They have a $7.50 sliders and beer happy hour everyday from 4-6PM!!"

It was a wonderful way to freshen your palate.  The seaweed and cucumber salad pleasantly surprised me, since I was expecting more of a Japanese style seaweed salad and what we got was more salty and spicy.  The Bi Bim Bop was disappointing.  The spices in the Bi Bim Bop just seemed off.  The Mana Slider though, was amazing. By far my favorite dish.  The mushroom and rice patty was just about as perfect as a veggie burger patty can get.  The menu is big with a large variety in cuisines, so there will be something for everyone.  Even your non-vegetarian/vegan friends will find plenty of things to enjoy."

And I ordered a half dozen of the chino oysters from VA (with garlic ponzu).The Chino oysters were very good. The garlic ponzu dressing must have made these babies, because I think I&#39;ll be dreaming of them for a while. A chewy oyster with a crisp finish.The Blue points were bland as an oyster, but the shallot dressing certainly elevated their creaminess.   Weird, because I never find bluepoints to be creamy at all. The dressing was a little vinegar And maybe a little bit too salty. But I enjoy living life on the edge with high blood pressure. So it worked for me.I like places that can put their own spin on oyster condiments, so this place moved to the top of my list as an oyster special place. Also the oysters were well shucked, and the oyster yield included the connective tissue, which I love. So yay!DRINK: I ordered the Kobayashi Issa, which tasted like a lighter, crisper version of an old fashion. Certainly some citrusy undertones in the drink. And the base flavors very characteristic of Japanese whiskey, full but lacking smoke. The drink had what appeared to be a hand-chipped ice cube. Great for not watering down the drink.Certainly a boozy drink. I started to feel it 2/3 of the way through. That, I appreciate.SERVICE: They accidentally dropped off a singular oyster in front of me that was for another person. I thought it was a tester, for me to order some of those In addition to the oysters I had ordered. I did enjoy it, so I ordered a half dozen.As an apology for delivering the wrong order, they comped me an order of wagyu beef potstickers, which were delicious with a great kick. I like when establishments can admit a fumble and make up for it. That, to me, speaks to a dedication to customer serviceThe bartender was absolutely adorable. Very high energy and great timing in terms of knowing when to check in and when not to bother because I&#39;m scrolling through Instagram.In CONCLUSION: Great oyster happy hour. Between here, Union sushi, and Tortoise club, I think I found my oyster trinity."

Then it turned out the omakase did not have many sushis (only 2 actually) and the sushis were pretty awful.Sushi should never be placed on ice!Sushi should never be placed on ice!Sushi should never be placed on ice!Low temperatures make the rice so stiff that it won&#39;t complement the texture of the fish.But then, the grill was totally above my expectations. I don&#39;t even like cod but the grilled cod was amazing. The American wagyu was ok. I kinda wish the waiter told me that I could upgrade it to Japanese wagyu. That would have been sensational.I really like the Japanese hot pot (risotto actually) with rice mushrooms tofu and fresh truffle. That was the epitome of vegetarian food in my opinion. So well seasoned too.Dessert was fine. I loved the mango sorbet! So refreshing!It was a lot of food though. I think I left at least 30% of all my food, which I feel pretty bad about."

But...their prices suggest it&#39;s not just about the food - the experience. In that case I think they need to rethink their service to price ratio.Specifically picked for their $1 Oyster Tuesdays - we had a group of 5, checked in with the host - reiterated our excitement for $1 Oyster Tuesdays, asked if they were still in stock, yes they were, okay so she shows us to our table. Waiter comes around we are ready to each put in our order of 30 oysters and he promptly tell us is that is only available in the lounge (10 feet away) so we would have to move. You have got to be kidding me. You are going to move an entire table over a special? If I&#39;m moving - it will be across the street to Sunda (ha! we should have) Manager comes back - we remind him we told the host our intentions - he says &#34;well she is new&#34; hey man, your staffs level of knowledge, time they have been there, etc. is not my problem. Yadayada, he says he will check with the chef but the chef is going to be pissed? You know who is pissed, your customer who is about to drop $400 at your restaurant (which we did).In the long run, they let us stay at our table. We ordered oysters - and half the menu - and plenty of drinks - and tipped as if they were great service. But I won&#39;t be back."

(wait for it...), good service.  Not everyone&#39;s gonna have the same or even similar expectation, but a good restaurant worth 5-stars will make it &#34;right.&#34;Not so at this swanky, dry ice infused, ice-gobbling eatery. Not even if you purchase the most expensive item on the menu for $129, and not even if the restaurant calls it their &#34;decadent&#34; dish.Having a business dinner with four VIPs, we all order the &#34;decadent,&#34; however, much to our dismay, when the first dish arrives, the tartar, only two plates are served for a party of five.  I give the waiter a quizzical look, and he tells me we are to share.  I tell him I&#39;m uncomfortable about literally sharing a plate of food with someone I just met a few hours ago, and he looks at me like I&#39;ve got an extra eyeball growing out of my forehead.  So, to preserve the mood, I move on and hope the next plate is a bit more tailored for individual consumption.Not the case...We&#39;re continuously given plates of food and dipping sauces to share amongst the four.  No serving spoon, no separation, nothing tailored for individual consumption whatsoever.  I&#39;m disgusted and ask for an extra sauce, and the waiter slams it down in front of me while I&#39;m attempting to have a conversation with my business partner, (and this is the best part), the waiter says &#34;YOU&#39;RE WELCOME.&#34; Loudly...I attempt to ignore him, but my guests are obviously troubled by this waiter&#39;s mannerisms, or definitive lack thereof.When I speak with the managers on duty, his response is: &#34;well, if you had asked we would&#39;ve gotten you separate plates.&#34; To which I replied, was three separate requests for individual plates not sufficient?  And does your waiter speak and understand simple English?"

We sat in the lounge area by the front of the restaurant, which had adequate seating on a Saturday night around 8:00pm. I didn&#39;t get to go to the back of the restaurant, but it seemed to be a pretty spacious restaurant.There&#39;s outdoor seating, a lounge area to the left of the entrance, and main dining area in the back. I love how the bar has a wrap-around shelf with drinks inside as well as the wooden decor. It definitely gives off a trendy, modern vibe. You know those restaurants or lounges where the music is so loud that you have to shout at each other until your throat hurts? Not here! You can have a normal conversation yet can still hear the music if you focus on it.We ordered the following off the menu:- Toro tartare: Served cold with ossetra caviar, quail egg, and taro crisp. I&#39;m always skeptical about anything raw, but this was delicious and definitely tasted fresh. You&#39;re supposed to spoon a bit of the toro tartare onto the taro crisp and eat the whole thing. The taro crisp wasn&#39;t overly salty by any means so it didn&#39;t overpower the flavor of the toro tartare.- Crispy squid: This was my favorite dish. It has chili flavoring, and you squeeze the lime over the squid. It was served with a sauce on the side. All the flavors just worked well with each other. Yum!- Shrimp and lobster dumplings: This definitely had a unique flavor, in a positive way. I can&#39;t quite put my finger on what it is, but this was pretty tasty.We also sampled some of Rich&#39;s (the GM) creations, which were fantastic.If you come here starving, it will be quite an expensive meal. If my friend wasn&#39;t there, I would most certainly eat everything we had in a heartbeat and then some. However, I demonstrated self control and avoided looking like I hadn&#39;t eaten for days.Service was impeccable. Rich made sure we were taken care of and was awesome blossom. Our server was friendly and attentive as well.I definitely recommend checking this restaurant out when you&#39;re in the mood for a fancy place. I&#39;ll definitely come back to try the sushi or happy hour next time."

So after 3 failed attempts to get a reservation, we finally got a table at Roka Akor.The restaurant is so cool and modern, beautifully decorated. When you walk in there&#39;s a giant bar with seating to the left. To the right is the main dinning are with a huge sushi bar and various seating options.We started off with some cocktails I&#39;m a bubbly girl so I got the La Grande Dame which consisted of Hennessy VS Cognac, Black Tea, Lemon, House Made Yuzu Bitters, Mint, Moët &amp; Chandon &#34;Impérial&#34; Brut.  Follow by Of Fruit &amp; Fire which consisted of House Made Raspberry Puree, Agave, Lemon, Peychaud&#39;s Bitters, Charles De Fère &#34;Cuvée Jean-Louis&#34; Blanc De Blancs both cocktails were delicious.For dinner we started with Butterfish Tataki and Wagyu Beef and Kimchi Dumpling appetizers. The butterfish melted on your tongue it was heavenly. The dumplings were pretty yummy as well.  For our main course my friend and I shared the Prime New York Strip Loin with Bone Marrow and 5 different kinds of Chef Selection Sashimi. The bone marrow was seasoned to perfection and the New York Strip was one of the best steaks I&#39;ve ever hand. The sashimi was fresh and oh so delicious.  We ended this amazing meal with a Dessert Platter that consisted of warm chocolate cake, green tea custard and a selection of fruit and ice cream.Overall one of the most amazing meals I&#39;ve ever had. I won&#39;t lie our bill was pretty pricey but it was SO worth it.  A definite must try restaurant if you&#39;re ever in Chicago!!!"

Wagyu Beef and Kimchi Dumplings2. Robata Grilled Japanese Shishito Peppers with Ponzu &amp; Bonito Flakes3. Shrimp and Lobster Dumplings4. Rock Shrimp Tempura with Wasabi Peas and Sweet Chili Aioli5. Spicy Fried Tofu with Avocado Relish, Fresno ChiliEverything was really delicious and we didn&#39;t feel experience buyers remorse on any of the items we chose.  Also, our server was fabulous.  Intuitively arriving when we needed something otherwise laying low to allow us to take all the time we needed because it was obvious my table was having a wonderful time.I&#39;m glad I was able to give this place a second chance because it is not in my nature to do so.  Maybe I need to revisit my stringent policy on no second chances!"

Perfection. Even though this place seems to be popular for their sushi, this is also a stellar place to order a steak.

The place has cool decor and the staff is extremely friendly. Definitely a cute place for a date or maybe a celebration dinner.I came for lunch and the waiter recommended a bento box. I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and my friend got the Maki set. The bento box style lunches all come with the Crispy Butterfish Maki, White Miso Soup and Wagyu Dumplings so you get to try a little bit of everything. The Crispy Butterfish Maki was nice and fresh but nothing special. The White Miso Soup was also pretty good and consisted of quality mushrooms. The Wagyu Dumplings were also good but a little salty. The Chicken Teriyaki was cooked perfectly and was really tender.The reason I would give this place a 3 star is because I didn&#39;t really care for the flavors. It was a bit too bland for me since I am a huge fan of flavor and spice. I will say the food there is excellent quality and the service is great as well as the ambiance.

We also had seared scallops which was in a league of its own. Sweet and meaty. Wagyu beef dumplings were divine. NY strip robata served with its own bone marrow was incredibly flavorful and melted like butter. And then the dessert platter wowowowowow!!! First the presentation was gorgeous. And then we dug in and every bite was like fireworks in my mouth. We had mango sorbet and mixed fruit sorbet which were sweet and fresh. Had the chocolate cake with coffee ice cream which was gone in five seconds. The green tea and banana pudding thing was unique and definitely my fave. Loved it!! The service was top notch.

Their decadent omakase is the BEST THING EVER. I&#39;ve been to plenty of Michelin start restaurants including Alinea, and I have to say I actually prefer this place to those fancy places who are lost on the journey of making everything a big show of presentation and the most cutting-edge molecular gastronomy experiment. Roka Akor does it right. They actually focus on making things taste fantastic.It&#39;s also great to not really know what&#39;s going to come next. Then they never fail to impress us, every single time.We started with some beef tataki, seafood dumplings, and tuna tare tare. Everything was good but not particularly impressive. It only gets better though.Soon enough the &#34;real deal&#34; came on. It was a giant boat of assorted sashimi and nigiri. And REAL WASABI. Real wasabi from the root that tastes a zillion times better than the fake synthetic wasabi you get 99.9% of the time. My friend didn&#39;t even like wasabi (the fake kind) but now she&#39;s a fan. All of the fish was also so fresh, so soft, so.... I can&#39;t even. I thought I was good with words.Then we had a few hot dishes, such as a perfectly seared piece seabass, some fried lobster pieces with an awesome wasabi sauce, and giant spicy shrimp pieces. Then we had a hot pot of basically risotto which was a little bit too filling, but they very kindly packed most of it for us.THEN we had this giant piece of wagyu steak. So tender. So rare. So delicious. So beefy.... my friend actually immediately decided that we should come here again even just for this.And when we thought this couldn&#39;t get any better, we were proven to be wrong. The dessert was another giant giant bowl filled with fruits, 3 different types of sorbet that all taste like an explosion of fruit flavors in my mouth, chocolate cake, mocha pudding, and a sweet potato pudding that is a perfect mix of sweet, savory, and aroma.I wish I could write more about this if I weren&#39;t in such a food coma...."

Unless you eat like a bird, be prepared to spend a mint for dinner. I&#39;m not against spending money for good food but it wasn&#39;t more than average. I made a reservation because I wasn&#39;t sure how busy it would be on a weeknight. I really didn&#39;t need to make one and they gave me a seat against the window. It was a nice spot but it was terribly cold. In winter, you&#39;d probably have to wear your coat.I asked about the omakase because I was very interested. I was disappointed to learn that basically there was no sushi /sashimi in the omakase. It was appetizers, steak, some seafood, and dessert :( It&#39;s also $98 per person which is fine and dandy but pretty highly priced for Chicago. You can get way better fish in Las Vegas or really any other large city.They also don&#39;t have a chef selection nigiri which was super irritating. In the end, I started off with the chef&#39;s selection sashimi for $22 and the 6 traditional nigiri for $22. The fish was fresh, sure. But it was the cheapest fish- salmon, tuna, yellowtail. The sashimi was only like 6 pieces and I&#39;m talking teeny tiny pieces. Soooo small. The nigiri were also on the microscopic side. The wasabi was sloppily placed and the server spilled soy sauce onto my dish and didn&#39;t apologize. The general manager saw it happen and came over only to offer a misogynistic remark &#39;oh, he gets flustered around pretty girls&#39;.The sashimi and nigiri didn&#39;t fill me up at all. I got the salmon avocado roll which was average at best and the rock shrimp tempura which was good. I had a few cocktails that were tasty but lacked any punch. All that set me back about $150. I got back to my hotel and ate some dessert because literally I felt like I had not eaten barely anything."

This was our first time visiting, and we had just had a full meal close by, and yet we got some complimentary rolls.The softshell crab was good but not outstanding, it could have been juicier and more umami. Instead it was rather dry and did not have the crab juice which makes such rolls pop with flavor.The prawn roll was better, being well balanced in flavor, texture, and presentation."

The edamame were piping hot and perfectly salted. They tasted really fresh. We got the peppers at the suggestion of the waitress and they were good but I wasn&#39;t blown away- no real noticeable flavored besides char. Continuing with appetizers the group got the beef dumplings that came stuffed with finely shredded beef and a delicious dipping sauce- comes with 5 dumplings per order. We also had the beef tataki (comes wrapped with asparagus spears) and it was such a delicious little bite.We tried a whole plethora of rolls. The hamachi and scallop dynamite were both amazing - simple and fresh. That was a overall theme - minimalistic and FRESH (no fried / heavy mayo rolls on this menu).They were able to accommodate a group of 8 walk in on a Tuesday night and it was greatly appreciated!

He was great at helping us look at the menu and he even gave us a complimentary tuna sashimi.My boyfriend eats the basics of sushi, where I am more willing to eat any of it. The spicy tuna wasn&#39;t as flavorful as I thought it would be. The California roll also did not have any flavor. The fried tofu was delicious tho.

I especially enjoy the Spicy Tuna Rolls. Our servers have always been polite, professional, and attentive. They even gave us a free fish sampler for being return customers!

The kimchi dumplings with wagyu beef was good but nothing special. Typical gyouza flavor, can&#39;t really taste the Kimchi or the wagyu. The flavors don&#39;t complement each other. The salty of the dumpling sauce overpowers the flavor profile the kimchi adds. It does have a nice spicy lingering heat which is good but for the price I&#39;d suggest trying one of their other delicious options.Yuzu Palmer mocktail was light and refreshing. The white peach blood orange margarita mocktail was also good.Ordered uni from Japan. Usually they&#39;re only available from Santa Barbara. Absolutely delicious. Creamy and sweet.Robata scallops were a good appetizer. Smoky. Great texture. Crispy outside, tender inside. There&#39;s wasabi in there but didn&#39;t taste it.Hamachi Serrano chili is nice. Light. Fresh. The small bit of cream is delicious and helps to make it stand out with the texture of the crunch of the pepper.Would easily recommend this place."

The waiter was absolutely incredible. We were treated like queens, and that might have been my favorite part of the experience.The food for lunch is a great deal. I ordered the $22 bento box sushi set. It came with 4 pieces of really incredible maki, 2 waygu dumplings, and 1 small cup of miso soup. The quality of the sushi was very good though not the best I&#39;ve had. The hamachi was incredibly tender that it melts in your mouth. The texture sushi should be. I didn&#39;t like the tuna roll as much since the quality of the tuna was unimpressive. But what I LOVED was the salmon nigiri. Only two slices  but I could easily down a plate of that.My friend&#39;s mushroom risotto was INCREDIBLE! For something vegetarian, I didn&#39;t think it could taste SO good. Also, the skirt steak was so tender, savory, and cooked to a nice medium-rare. I loved the umami flavor of the sauce on the side though it looked very small."

Came here for lunch on a Monday and they had plenty of open seats. They had a lunch menu as well as the regular menu to order from. The waiter gave an overview and recommended the bento boxes for lunch, which turned out to be a great choice! If you&#39;re thinking a wooden box with dividers, think again! The bento box was more like sashimi arranged by color on a bowl of ice lit up by lights. Seriously. I got the chirashi bento box which came with soup and maki. Light yet filling meal. The portion size was perfect.Everyone at the table got something different and we were all pleased with the meal. What really made this a 5-star visit was the service. Attentive and knowledgable. I would definitely visit again!"

The Japanese Rice Wild Mushroom Hot Pot is great, and I say that as someone who dislikes the texture of mushrooms (also I think the dish is better without the Truffles, is a bit saltier for some reason, and those are better on beef tataki anyway). Rotating flavors of deserts tonight included Brown Sugar Bourbon ice cream (so delicious and creamy, the brown sugar brings out the flavor of the bourbon). Yuzu Cheesecake ice cream (also creamy but with light citrus twist), Mango sorbet (tastes like mango, like it could honestly have been pureed mango that was frozen, superb), Mixed Berry Yuzu (more berry than yuzu).  Staff made today&#39;s visit particularly exceptional, great treatment, food paced well, certainly set the mood for a graduation celebration.  If you are looking for a special event location reach out to Ben and he can help make it happen."

He expressed appreciation for my review and came across as sincere. I have every reason to believe that the environment will improve both for patrons and employees.ORIGINALThis beautiful restaurant has a very nice happy hour. Unfortunately, the manager detracted from the classiness of the establishment. My husband and I luckily didn&#39;t interact with him, but we observed some questionable behavior. First, there were a couple of Latino guys sitting at the bar. The manager, who was a white male, seemed to know them, and when they mentioned something about football (soccer), he asked them if they wore bandanas and drank margaritas while they watched the match. Perhaps there&#39;s an inside joke that we didn&#39;t get, but it seemed a little racist. A few minutes later, I overheard the same manager make a comment about a pregnant co-worker&#39;s belly. I wish I would&#39;ve written down exactly what he said; but whatever it was, it made jaw drop. It was awkward at the very least. I really wonder how the gentlemen at the bar and the pregnant employee felt about this manager&#39;s remarks. Maybe they have relationships where that kind of banter is acceptable, but it seemed a bit off-color for such a lovely space that attracts a professional and rather affluent crowd."

Stop by Roka Akor! Their happy hour is between the hours of 5 PM to 6PM. They have an assortment of small dishes that range from $5-6 each (half of regular price).My fiancé and I got off work early and found this modern sushi/seafood restaurant. We loved the ambiance of this restaurant and the amazing service we received. We loved their Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon - only $5 per glass btw. Our waitress gave us tons of recommendations and was super attentive. They serve each dish one at a time as they are served.We highly recommend the tataki trio, crispy squid, hamachi serrano chili roll. The butterfish tataki melts in your mouth. The sauce with the crispy squid (similar to calamari) is delightful. The hamachi roll is super fresh!This was such a classy restaurant. We&#39;ll consider coming back for their Omakasu when we save up a little more $$$."

Coming from San Francisco, I&#39;m used to making reservations all the time and as a rule I will only eat outside without a reservation if ramen is involved. So, out of habit I made a reservation at Roka (the day of) for 7.15 (prime time!). This is unheard of in SF, I don&#39;t even know who do you have to be or do to make this happen in SF but I digress. Also, I don&#39;t know why the Roka in Chicago would be $$$ on yelp but the one in SF is $$$$. If anything it should be the other way around, we are the city who asks for a million dollars for a 400 sq ft loft (parking not included btw), thus the show million dollar listing SF is kind of useless since that&#39;s pretty much every other house. However, as with all Bravo shows, the show is useless but extremely entertaining (go Fichelson!) but I digress, again.I started off with the Roka mule - Slightly different than the regular Moscow mule, this one has an after taste, which I happened to dig.Lobster Tempura - Saw this on someone&#39;s table as we were entering and I started salivating immediately creating a puddle that the said lobster can swim in. So, in the spirit of reckless abandon we went ahead and ordered the $56 lobster tempura. This dish was without a doubt the highlight of the evening - loved the presentation and the taste. If you like lobster and spending money, I don&#39;t see why you shouldn&#39;t get this amazing preparation.Shishito Peppers - Can be totally skipped or replaced by the lobster tempura (though it might be hard to rationalize that kind of swap from a $ perspective, the Roka mule might help with that decision making)Chicken Yakitori - Good, not the best I have had, can also be replaced by the lobster tempura if the Roka mule has kicked in.Madagascan jumbo tiger prawn - I liked this preparation, the flavors were great and the prawn was fresh but this is not an entrée portion, this should be in the hot plates section. The dish comes served in the prawn shell with about 7-8 pieces of the prawn. If you think this is your main course, good luck finding a burger king after dinner.Japanese wild mushroom rice hotpot - This was the one I had read a lot about and was really really looking forward to but unfortunately was my least favorite of the night. I was expecting something umami but the preparation was overpowered by an herb that I can&#39;t put my finger on, could be lemongrass, tarragon, a combination of both or a whole another mystery soap type herb - I don&#39;t know, it just tasted soapy.To round things off, we ordered the warm chocolate cake and green tea custard - talk about redemption!!! Both these desserts were absolutely amazing. The cake was rich and moist and worked perfectly with the coffee ice-cream while the tea custard was super light and airy. So long story short, lobster tempura and desserts make up for the 4 stars. Oh, and the service was super nice too."

Talk about consistency, Bravo!!!My 13 yrs. old son has never had Sashimi and I thought this would be the perfect place to introduce him to real authentic sushi. He absolutely enjoyed everything.Anthony, our server was absolutely wonderful. We told him that this is my son first time eating Sashimi. He made my son feel comfortable and explained the menu carefully. This guy knew everything on the menu. That&#39;s true professionalism of a fantastic server. We ended orderingOmakase. It was a true delight to see my son experiencing these wonderful dishes.The food was too beautiful to eat. We got a chance to say Hi to Chef Boyd. As always, he has such a happy smile and so friendly. He was happy to see us again.This is a perfect restaurant to take friends out for birthdays, anniversary or any special event.I give these guys 10 stars if I could.Definitely put this on your list of top Chicago restaurants to dine at."

That thing must have weighed 3 pounds with 80% being ice and decorations.  Beef and kimchee dumplings and butterfish were good.  The best entree was the ribeye with side of Bok choi. Nice selection of drinks too.

I prefer the downtown location because there&#39;s more variety in the menu, minus the dishes are few bucks more in comparison to the suburban location. For a chain, I&#39;m very proud there they serve quality and good food. The price is on a higher end and smaller portion, but the service and food makes up for it. I would not recommend this place for large group, bu perfect portion size for max of  4 people.Ask for the oyster special - certain days,there is happy hour for oyster or $1 on weeknights.Chef&#39;s selection - Typically, it&#39;s average fresh nigiri. There was one experience that it was exceptionally good (reminiscence the fresh and good nigiri i had in japan) and the top notch nigiri was served (snapper, madai, yellowtail, and etc)Robata grill - the steak is a must -order. My preference is med-rare, but the medium would give a more flaming charcoal taste.Robata favorites - corn, brussel sprouts, and sweet potatoe (very flavorful with the charcoal taste and sauce)Grilled cod and grilled salmon - cook to perfection and not overdone.beef tataki - very tasty and fresh seared beef. Oh i wish this wasnt a bite size portion.Scallop - it comes in 5 pieces? with a wooden stick on top and the scallop was a generous size (considering how much it shrinks when it&#39;s cooked)dessert - the chef pastry comes in every morning and prepare the dessert fresh. My favorite would be the chocolate cake with peanuts.Next time, I would try the wagyu steak which is about $30 per ounce. This is probably one of the restaurant in chicago that serves wagyu and I have faith that Roka will do a good job!"

Knowing the value and awesomeness I got last year made it even more of a letdown.Our reservation was at 7, it&#39;s not like they couldn&#39;t have notified us! Reservation was on Opentable so they had all my info. Disappointing and probably won&#39;t be making the trip to River North again. We stood on the corner and Yelped. Oak + Char saves the day, see next review...ADDENDUM: they can have the 4th star back for classy (and ridiculously fast) response to this review.

For $98/person, the menu is pre-selected for your table to share and get a taste of things from every portion of the menu. This is an awesome way to go, especially if it&#39;s your first time here. The waitress will course everything out for you and all you need to do is enjoy every last bite!We started with the Heirloom Tomato Salad (so good and light) and the Robata Grilled Skate Wing (a little salty to me, a little heavy for an initial course, but good). We were also given the Hamachi and Mebachi Tartare which was very light and had great flavor!We next had the Butterfish Tataki which I could see myself eating all day every day.Next we had Robata Grilled Japanese Shishito Peppers - they were perfectly charred and were so flavorful. I would definitely get these again!We were brought some excellent Prime Rib Eye with Wafu Dressing. This was cooked perfectly medium rare and the wafu dressing was kind of like a peanut sauce...but a million times better (if you like your meat more well-done, I suggest you let them know how you like your meat cooked before you order this entire option).We were also brought a beautiful display of sashimi - I have never tasted, nor expected, fish so fresh. It was served with Japanese mint leaves and freshly-ground wasabi. It was incredible.We received a bowl of their Brocolini with Ginger Shallot Dressing - if you love the taste of something immediately off the grill - so smokey, so good - this is for you! I found the taste to be a little salty, but this was pretty dang good.We got Crispy Brussels Sprouts with Wafu, Mustard and Bonito Flakes. I love brussels sprouts and am eating the leftover brussels sprouts from Roka Akor right this moment, so you could say that I liked them!I have, at the moment, mixed my brussels sprouts with the Japanese Wild Mushroom Rice Hot Pot. This is kind of like a risotto and is very excellent!Things to note:-Because we chose this option, they did not include any maki rolls because rice fills you up so quickly. We&#39;d definitely go back and try a few maki rolls.-They do a great job explaining what each dish includes and before ordering, take into consideration what food allergies/restrictions you may have.-Just let them know if you feel like the food is coming out too quickly - they were happy to accommodate!-Get the Omakase option - it&#39;s so fun and so excellent!"

Although the fish is extremely tasty, they ruin the experience for you by throwing all of the food down on the table at the same time, even when you ask them repeatedly not to. This shows a complete lack of understanding about how a Japanese restaurant is supposed to work - by allowing you to experience and savor high quality food, contrasting the different flavors of different courses, not having to shuffle things around on your table just to make room for all of the dishes that come at once.We had previously had a good meal here, so we came back for a birthday dinner, but they seem to have exchanged quality for cashing in by turning the tables over quickly - even though our reservation was for 8:30 PM. When they put half of our dishes on the table at once, we asked them to slow down, and they gave the excuse that all of this was the sushi course and was supposed to come together - this was obviously a lie, given there was salad, tartare, and a maki role, which is supposed to come after the sashimi, not before, if you are serving &#34;sushi courses.&#34; At any rate, we asked them to slow down and they promised they would. Minutes later, they turned up with our dumplings, which we sent away as we were still eating out many cold dishes and there was not even room on the table for them. I told the waiter that we felt like we were being rushed out of there, he apologized, but then a few minutes later the dumplings turned up yet again. At this point, we complained -- our waiter&#39;s response was &#34;that is just how the kitchen works&#34; - to which I said &#34;unacceptable.&#34; At the prices they are charging, they should be doing this properly.Literally five more times they tried to give us subsequent courses while we were still eating the first load. The manager was apologetic, and said this was an aberration, but we saw another table of four people having to shuffle their dishes around as they had nine - I counted them - dishes brought to them while they were still having their appetizers.There are much better Japanese restaurants around, and for much lower prices - Kai Zan, Arami, Iszakaya Mita are all fabulous and don&#39;t rush you through your meal in order to turn over the table. Around the corner is Union sushi, about half the price and far more professional.This place was good once, but now it is all style over substance. I won&#39;t be going back."

I am on a time table when I come in for lunch. I don&#39;t have time to sit and relax for over an hour. The food, was really amazing. I do have to say. The seaweed salad, tempura roll, dumplings, and skirt steak. Our server was hard to track down, he was preoccupied serving the people behind us wine non stop, which is totally fine, but we were in a bit of a hurry and could have used a little more focus. The food was really just too slow to come out for lunch, bottom line. Everything else was great. Maybe I&#39;d go back for dinner, but probably can&#39;t swing it for lunch unless I have nothing else going on!"

Came here for restaurant week. I think it might be one of the best restaurant week deals there is. They don&#39;t skimp on portions like a lot of other restaurant week menus. The rock shrimp and yellowtail apps were delicious. All three of the entree options were a hit: miso cod, lamb cutlets, and strip. My personal favorite was the cod. The chocolate lava cake dessert was the perfect ending to the meal. If you&#39;re trying to decide on a restaurant week place... You&#39;ve found one of the best!"

For the price point, though, you may wish to save Roka Akor for date-night.Summary:Quality ingredients, excellent service, and overall a really nice experience.  I have my share of choices for sushi where I live, and it was cool to see high quality such as this away from home.  So many other places to eat in Chicago that I may not return soon, but that doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t try it!"

Unfortunately,  for the money spent, this was a pretty mediocre experience.To start, the service was less than ideal. Our waitress was not very attentive. For example, she dropped off our drinks, told us she had to drop off another drink and would be back to explain the menu. She did not return for at least 10 minutes. Also, my husband tried to mention it was my birthday and she completely ignored him. Throughout the meal, at no point did she explain to us what we received. The bus boys did a better job of that. The only slightly redeeming quality was that she realized the chef made something we specifically requested against and she rectified the situation immediately.Now for the food. We went with the premium omikase meal. For a meal this costly, I was hoping to be blown away.The most major offenses were the 2 dishes that should have been the best. This was probably the worst Chilean sea bass I have ever had. It tasted old and fishy. I think what almost made me cry was the wagyu steak. It was overcooked! How can such a beautiful piece of meat be cooked to well done! Travesty I tell you. The scallop ceviche, beef tartare, nigiri, tiger prawn maki, and tiger prawn main dish was just average. The best part of the meal was the lobster tempura and the wild mushrooms and rice.It will take a lot to consider coming back here."

Impressively, this is my go-to spot in all of Chicago for whenever I have a friend in from out of town or for a fancy date.The cocktail menu is fun and creative and the food is consistently fantastic. There is nothing bad on the whole menu. The pork ribs off the robata, the Brussel sprouts, and the nigiri are mind-blowingly good. If you&#39;re a mushroom fan, the cold mushroom salad app is really unique tasting and tasty.This isn&#39;t a quiet spot, but for that lively night out you can&#39;t beat the ambience. Beautiful interior and exterior. Service has been on point ever since my original review and whether I&#39;m a walk-in or have a reservation, the girls in front always have us seated in no time.Over the last 5+ times I&#39;ve been there, I can&#39;t think of any negative criticism.Rock on, Roka Akor."

Danielle was excellent on timing and staggered the meal so that we can really immerse ourselves in not only the experience, but also the array of flavors.At the end of the meal, we had the executive pastry chef (Jesse) come out to personally greet us with his dessert plate.  Let me tell you, the Apple-mint basil sorbet which is made in-house is to die for.I would highly recommend this place.

Wide choice of wine, sake and spirits.It took them more than one hour to bring us the first courses... that&#39;s why I only rate it 4 stars and not 5.

Portions are excellent and end up hitting that safe spot just below bloated and right above too light. Definitely go for the sashimi 2 of a kind. They&#39;ll bring out 2 pieces of 7 different varieties. We also had the wagyu dumplings (delicious), one of the steaks, and the pork ribs, all standouts.I&#39;d dock a star because they try too hard to emulate a club atmosphere, but the music is way too loud and overwhelming.

The burger was good, the tuna salad pretty meh even though they pack it pretty thick.Right off the bat the dinner disappointed me, the sandwich wasn&#39;t premade, everything was put into a standard lunch tray with two pieces of bread on top. The gravy from the potatoes got in EVERYTHING! The beef was cooked perfectly, but everything else in the dinner (corn, salad, potatoes) were average.Overall I&#39;d try this place again if I can get the actual sandwich."

I do not normally care for rye bread but wanted to order the sandwich the way they make it.  There rye bread meshed with the sandwich really well and I did not get overwhelmed by the flavor in the bread.  They also give you a small plate of corned beef for free when you arrive.The restaurant itself was very buisy.  It was a bit shabby but dont let that scare you the food  is worth staying.

Old school yes, but classic too- and that never goes out of style!I want to make it in there and try the mac &amp; cheese and other high cholesterol food.  I hadn&#39;t realized how close I was to it until (after trying the corned beef,) I was shopping at the Pete&#39;s Fresh Market grocers across the street. The exterior is old school too, which caught my eye.

The potatoes were great and i added onions and peppers with that.The raisin toast was slathered with real butter.My partner had the corned beef sandwich that can easily beat  AP Deli and Manny&#39;s Deli it comes with a tiny bag of chip and a can of soda. The corned beef was freshly cut and the juices were bursting off the meat.Now the drawback:The place is a dive and needs a good sandblasting wash.The employees are quick and attentive.Boot leg movie guy still sells movies at a reasonable price.I do not recommend buying any jewelry from anyone in MOONS because it is FAKE!Free parking on street.I would hold off on any visit to the washroom you will think you were shipped back in time to the 1950&#39;S.You can phone in order for pick up if you are one of those new DAINTY west siders who live in the overpriced condos near by.I would give MOONS 3 1/2 star on price and just plain west side flavor!

But still wouldn&#39;t fit in with the locals hanging out here just yet!I got the tuna salad on wheat with lettuce and tomato, which was the only thing on the menu apart from the grilled cheese that a vegetarian-leaning pescatarian could order.  It was tasty, and they were super generous with the tuna-scooping!  It was well-made tuna salad, too.  But sparse on the veggies, as is the case with the menu in general.My mom got the famed corned beef and thought it was good, but maybe a little stringy.  But we were both truly amazed at the value of the meals here, paying about $12 for both of our sandwiches!

Corned Beef is just constantly being sliced in front of you to fill their endless orders.When we sat down the waitress was just so nice and happy.

We placed out order and then the owner came by because we were in uniform and went up to our biggest guy and said &#34;You&#39;re a big fella, lets arm wrestle&#34;.We all have the Famous Moon Corned Beef sandwich and it was so delicious. There was a behemoth mound of corned beef in between the buns!!! It was very fresh, rich and moist. It was far from dry (I hate those). The rye bread was not over powering in taste and soft as well. I also had a side of hashbrowns with my sandwich. They potatoes hit the spot! This all hit the spot! I was giggling like a little school girl. Extremely filling and very inexpensive. Food and Service was A++I will definitely go back there and try the Jumpball! It was so mouthwatering but I could not do it.

The meat was a little drier than what you&#39;d get crock-potting it yourself.

Not only was the Corned Beef perfectly salty and seasoned, but the bread and the SIZE were extraordinary. You can easily stuff your face for $8.00 on the sandwich alone, and walk away 100% satisfied. On top of that, the place itself is charming and friendly. The staff was cool, the patrons were cuttin&#39; it up, and the music was humming. I really don&#39;t understand now why it took me so long to hit this place up. Me and the family will definitely be coming back here quite often, as it&#39;s never a bad idea to chow down on good food at cheap prices.BTW, here are some tips...1. It can get busy, and the seating is counter only, and few at that.2. Carryout is a good move.3. They take Visa I am sure of, not so sure about MC.4. You CANNOT TIP ON C.C.!! Bring cash foolio...5. There is ample street parking just north of the storefront. Then go right..6. Don&#39;t dilly-dally as the place is fast paced. Make up your mind and move...Enjoy Suckas&#39;!!!"

According to my roommate - &#34;A good solid pork chop sandwich&#34; as well.One of the key things that I remember is the customer service.  Not only were all the servers genuinly happy and excited to be there, they fully enjoyed seeing their old customers come back in to visit them.  In fact, the meatloaf sandwich came out to $5.09.  As I was grasping for change, the server just said &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it... what&#39;s nine cents, right?&#34;Ultimately, affordable food, good quality, friendly people, and a landmark that has been around for decades.  Great service that is focused on the customer, and definitely a place that my roommates and I plan to visit again in the future.Corned beef?  Not quite as good as Manny&#39;s Deli in my humble opinion... but also significantly cheaper and delicious.Take a visit!  You&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised..."

This is a 1920&#39;s sandwich shop that has managed to survive in a struggling area of Chicago. It is a very unique place that is a throwback and a true piece of history. It is not polished, it is not fancy and don&#39;t expect a great deal of &#34;presentation&#34;. They are famous for their corned beef which is excellent, I have had it in an omelette, in a sandwich and by itself. I can say I personally am not a fan of their house specialty corned beef dinner with the brown gravy slathered on top as it is just to heavy and does not taste like a good match to me. Many people like it, I would suggest taking a pass on the gravy.  However their omelettes are excellent, I love their grits and all their breakfast type food is quite good. My favorite is a ham and cheese omelette with a side of grits. The food is honestly probably more like a 4 star overall, but the atmosphere pushes it over the edge. The short order cook there is mesmerizing to watch, I don&#39;t know how he can multitask like that and make that much that fast. If you like old school diners and sandwich shops and appreciate a good traditional breakfast, I highly suggest checking it out."

If you think it is, you are wrong. If you think that any shop or deli in Chicago sells blow-your-freakin-mind-omg-so-so-so-good-best-thing-ever Jewish fare, you are also wrong.However, Moon&#39;s comes awfully close when it comes to corn beef. Having been to the famous NYC delis, I have tasted what is probably the pinnacle of Jewish fare in the states (or at least accessible Jewish fare; maybe there&#39;s some unknown amazing place in Nowhere-ville). I have been to Moon&#39;s twice, and both times their corn beef sandwich has been consistently moist and delicious. It doesn&#39;t blow my mind, but definitely concussion-oh-wtf-just-happened-oh-yummy-sandwich good.Yes, I have been to Manny&#39;s. Yes, this is better than Manny&#39;s, much much better. Yes, I have been to Manny&#39;s more than once and I still think Moon&#39;s is better.I think my fellow Yelpers and foodies should be aware of a few things before they go out and hunt down Moon&#39;s:1. A corn beef sandwich is $8 and change after tax. I am cheap and eat a lot, and I still think it is sizable and well worth the money.2. The area is not the best. Honestly, it&#39;s pretty ghetto. The prices probably reflect that. But I went there and I am still alive, and I never once feared for my life, or my sandwich.3. Ample parking around the shop."

I walked over and ordered a corned beef on wheat with extra mustard only. I guess the cashier/owner was having a bad day cause he said a corned beef on rye with extra mayo? I said NO on wheat with extra mustard who orders a corned beef  with mayo? NOT ME EVER.

They came in a cast iron pot with a flatbread cooked over the top of it - which became mushy and gluey from the steam. The sauce was not very flavorful and the mussels were consequently pretty bland.I will say that I enjoyed the sangria and it&#39;s worth noting that they served us the best cappuccino I have had in Chicago, no lie.

So she kept asking us to get up to seat people in the middle? Maybe sit the middle first so guests don&#39;t have to get up while eating in an already crowded restaurant.I think there was one server for the whole place. He was trying his best but he was just pacing the length of the restaurant taking orders. He only spoke to me which pissed off my boyfriend because he felt like he was being ignored.We ordered two small plates (seed crackers and something else) and then two larger plates. There was literally no coursing to the meal. We got the heaviest thing first and then randomly got the seed crackers last.. It was very awkward and we didn&#39;t eat the crackers at all because we were full from the heavy stuff. I also had to ask another employee to take all the empty plates away because everything was just left in between us and there was no room for anything else.Maybe this place is just much better at dinner.

The long bar is most welcoming to travelers, locals and anyone who is looking for a casual yet elegant meal. I&#39;m a huge fan of eating at the bar because it&#39;s lively and you get perspective from the servers who handle food the most. Plus, I love geeking out about wine lists and bar menus :)I ordered the kale, radish and tabbouleh salad to start which was perfectly seasoned and had just the right amount of acid. The crispy quinoa added a nice little crunch and the beets a proper amount of sweetness. It was really good. For my main course, I ordered one of the specials; the seared albacore with fennel, tzatziki, and apricots.

Yeah, I&#39;m looking at you, Avec. I see how it is.We ordered the following:- Whipped brandade: Very savory and delicious! Ration out your bread though because there&#39;s wayyy more dip than bread. Though you&#39;d think there would be cheese in this dish due to the consistency, there isn&#39;t any surprisingly.- Slow roasted pork shoulder: This was also delicious and a nice-sized portion (granted it&#39;s $26). It was tasty, but it&#39;s not a dish I would absolutely order again necessarily.- &#34;Deluxe&#34; focaccia: I didn&#39;t eat this since it was made with primarily cheese, which wouldn&#39;t agree with my lactose intolerance. However, my friend said she absolutely loved it.The food was great, and I wouldn&#39;t mind revisiting. However, I felt that the food was a bit on the pricey side for what it was. Although the dishes I ordered were good, they weren&#39;t necessarily dishes that are a must-order.Our server was pretty attentive and friendly. She really took the effort to make me aware of which dishes I can order due to my food allergies (as in she crossed out dishes on the menu that I couldn&#39;t order and wrote down notes on the menu). + brownie point."

Kelly, our server, was really nice as was everyone else we encountered here, but I&#39;m adding the 5th star for Blake who was fantastic!The layout is simple, narrow, and cool. I like how, depending on where you&#39;re sitting, you can see the cooks and servers hard at work. For food, we went with: Chorizo-stuffed medjool dates, Charred beet tartine, Smoked Salmon tartine, and the Avec burger. All the sandwiches and tartines come with a choice of marinated lentil salad or spiced chips as a side. We got both.Everything was great. The bread that came with the dates was nice and crusty and perfect for sopping up the remaining piquillo pepper sauce. Each tartine had it&#39;s own unique flavor as did the burger and everything was made with quality ingredients, precision, and care. I did prefer the marinated lentil salad over the chips, but they weren&#39;t bad. A great spot for lunch, brunch, or dinner. I definitely intend on returning for all the above."

We all love food a bit more than is probably healthy, we tend to overindulge while traveling, and we have a vegetarian in the group. We chose to have dinner at Avec when first getting in to Chicago and our only regret was that it was tough to find places for dinner the remainder of the week that lived up to our meal at Avec.We decided to just go veggie for the whole table to keep it simple and we ordered a trio of cheeses (say yes to the honey. do it.), olives, the foccacia, the kale salad, the tabbouleh, the burrata, an amazing bottle of wine, then dessert because you always need dessert, right? Everything was light, fresh, and just generally delicious.The space is on the small side, but very comfortable and it didn&#39;t get super loud despite being quite busy on a Sunday evening.

Very resonably priced too! The roasted pork one is also great. Only complaint is they tend to be a little messy to eat (large chunks of meat that may or may not be semi falling as you bite into it) if you&#39;re the super dainty type.For dinner, I honestly feel like there are just way too many good choices:- Chorizo stuffed dates: a classic and many folks swear by it, but personally I think it&#39;s a little too saucy for me. The pepper-tomato sauce feels a bit blunt - I like my flavors &#34;harmonized&#34; with each other better if that makes sense?- Butcher&#39;s steak: beyond awesome in terms of how much the beef tastes like beef- Pork shoulder: Very soft and beyond substantial.

Turns out this was a great dish and now he&#39;s open to having it again.  They were tender and the lime citrus note was good), chorizo dates (very good... love the sweetness hits you first then the paprika and pork flavour comes afterwards.  LOVED the sauce... we used all the bread to sop it up), paella (WARNING this is a LARGE portion.  Like more than enough for 2 people... we&#39;re talking probably 4.  it came with 5 large head on shrimp and 3 chicken legs... plus a ton of crispy bottom rice.  Great dish but damn we were stuffed), and ended with kumquat flan (LOVE this... my dining partner thought this might be too eggy and it was more like creamy milky heaven... the caramel was so good).We did over order but wow, great flavours and execution.  I love the constant changing menu and how it does offer a variety of vegetables, seafood, and meats... not just a constant focus on red meats.  For those of us who like to eat more vegetables, Avec will be a constant on my list of places to eat in Chicago."

I never detected anything French or Basque about it. And there was a hint of Mediterranean. As of my most recent visit, it&#39;s still very high-end, trendy, American.The service is top. The food now is okay. Since my visit in 2008, the small plates have seemingly become entrée size. My advice would be to order linearly, not all at once if you think you may not get to enjoy a large plate because the small plates are larger than expected.I had a shaved brussel sprouts salad that had grapes, slices apples, crunchy peas, and some flavourful cheese in a tasty vinaigrette. This came in a large bowl. The other dish I had was a huge bowl of mussels. This also was supposedly a small plate. The mussels were a bit mushy, opposed to the al dente lima beans. Having had mussels at other restaurants in a sauce accented with saffron, the sauce on the mussels at Avec made for an okay dish. And instead of toast for better sopping of the sauce, there was something akin to doughy naan. The server paired both with wine, a white for the salad and a red blend for the mussels, and both pairings were spot on.Avec is a happening spot, so reservations are recommended. For the food, I give 3 stars. The service bumps my rating up because the servers are very good with offering suggestions. I got the opportunity for a return."

Like most restaurants of its ilk, Avec doesn&#39;t take reservations and can handle around 30 people at capacity, so the wait for dinner is typically 1-2 hours during the dinner rush. This may be a blessing in disguise if it&#39;s a nice day, since it gives you the chance to enjoy an aforementioned Atomium (a crisp, flavorful Belgian ale) in the small standing area outdoors. Inside, you&#39;ll find that the long, narrow venue is constructed floor-to-ceiling from shimmery reclaimed wood. The seating is communal, so be warned: you might find yourself shoulder-to-shoulder with a couple on an awkward date.The Mediterranean-inspired menu is subject to change, but thankfully there are some standouts that seem to be permanently in rotation. The shared dishes vary in size, but are all both filling and surprisingly affordable. There are no wrong answers here, but I personally was not a fan of the whole roasted fish, and others have reported that the paella is subpar. My favorites:Medjool Dates - Avec&#39;s most popular dish and with good reason: it&#39;s a masterpiece. The savoriness of the bacon and chorizo are cut nicely by the sweet, fruity tones of the dates. The smooth sauce is tangy and satisfying -- soak it up with the firm Ciabatta.Pork Shoulder - One of the largest courses on the menu, the slow-roasted meat is tender and succulent. The broth is mild and the white beans give it a nice earthy consistency.Brandade - If you don&#39;t like seafood, you may want to avoid this one. But for the rest of us, this dish is a knock-out. It comes with a creamy, rich puree of white fish that you can spread on sliced toast. The fish is mouth-watering and warms you right to your core.Foccaccia - A large, thin serving of hot, perforated flatbread with taleggio and ricotta cheeses baked in. Not one of the more filling options, but definitely one of the tastiest. Ask for a side of honey to really make the flavors pop.The servers are always highly professional and don&#39;t try to insert themselves needlessly into your dining experience; I appreciate that. The venue is gorgeous and you can share some sensational food for $30-$45 each. Make plans to go this weekend and don&#39;t look back."

I&#39;ve also tried a couple of the fish tartines, all of which have been consistently good. My favorite was the the smoked salmon taramsalata--the flavors of the smoked salmon were light and came together very well with the frisee and tangerines. The brunch pizza was also amazing--the crust was thin, light, and crispy, and the runny egg was perfectly melted into the cheese. For dinner service, the foccacia and honey is always a solid bet. The one entree I&#39;ve gotten that I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of was the pork shoulder, which I found a little overwhelming because of its rich and heavy flavors  (though it would be great to share with 3-4 people).Overall, avec&#39;s prices are very fair for the portion size and the quality of the food. The only complaint I have would be the setup of the restaurant--the communal seating forces you to sit elbow to elbow, and often times I find myself practically shouting at my friends in order for them to be able to hear. Other than that, though, avec is awesome and I will definitely continue to come back for the food."

It hit the spot and really gave me the push to update my review - yum!Here&#39;s my review for December:The place is a bit hard to find since the door is camouflaged with the wall. Once you find the door - push, don&#39;t pull.I was expecting the place to have a more formal or semi-formal ambiance based off of the info I read online (queue the dim lighting, semi dressy attire, and music with volume that is loud enough to cover eaves dropping but soft enough so that you won&#39;t lose your voice from screaming) - my expectations were let down. The lighting was faintly dim, workers wore jerseys, and I don&#39;t think music was playing at all.The restaurant menu is setup suggesting that people share plates family style. They recommended that 1 large dish or 2 small dishes be ordered for 1 person.Kale Salad (small) -Delish! The salad was light yet full with flavor. If you&#39;re looking for greens, I would highly recommend this option! --- 5/5Chorizo Stuffed Date (small) -The spice of the chorizo, saltiness of the bacon, and sweetness of the dates really made this an interesting dish! I enjoyed trying it after noticing the hype from Yelp; but a try was good enough for me. The dish comes with 4 stuffed dates; we had 1 each and had the rest for take away. --- 3/5Pork Shoulder (large) -The first thing I thought of when I took a bite is that this reminded me of a taco - in a good way! The pork was very flavorful and reminded me of flavored meat in tacos. I, as many, would recommend this dish. --- 4/5Steak (small) -Good. Nothing less or more than my expectations. This was the last dish we settled on for our dinner order. --- 3/5Apple Crostata with Ice Cream -I love it when warm breaded dishes meet cold ice cream! The apple pie wasn&#39;t as warm as I would have liked it so that was a bit of a let down. They don&#39;t mention it on the menu, but this dish has raisins! My bf is allergic to raisins so he wasn&#39;t able to try it which was unfortunate. --- 4/5 (with the caveat that it&#39;s not cool to leave out ingredients that people can be allergic to)Turkish Coffee Gelato (Special&#34;) -My bf ordered this since he recently came back from Turkey and has declared turkish coffee one of his favorite types of coffee. Unfortunately, he was let down from this ice cream rendition. --- 3/5There were three things that really caught my attention:1. The bathroom sink/dryer combo - I&#39;ve never seen something like that before! Pretty nifty!2. The &#34;kitchen&#34;! Are the back 2 ovens behind the bar the main part of the &#34;kitchen&#34;? I noticed it on the way out so I didn&#39;t have a chance to ask, but it&#39;s such an interesting setup! It may be why the dessert took much longer than expected. I would say dessert took over 15 minutes to be served.3. About 5 minutes after we placed our dinner order we noticed a &#34;specials&#34; board and wanted to change one of our dishes for a special. We were told that they couldn&#39;t change it since they dish was already made - unfortunate since we really wanted to try to scallops, but fortunate since the kale was amazing!Maybe I&#39;ll come back in the summer time."

Perhaps it was just the welcomed solitude after constantly being around people for a week.

That&#39;s what you would call an unbiased, unclouded experience!I dropped in during lunch and was happily seated at the bar. I overheard the host tell guests that the wait for even groups of two were at least 20 min for a table. (However, they do take reservations for lunch now!)I considered ordering the famous pork shoulder, but after consecutive meals at the Girl and the Goat and the Purple Pig, I was all pork-ed out haha. I ended up deciding on the kale and carrot salad with mint, dill, green harissa, and sunflower seed dukkah and the popular chorizo-stuffed medjool dates. The server was so kind to half the portion of the dates (from four to two) so it was more reasonable to finish -- and it was perfect! I loved how refreshing the salad was, with a hint of spice from the harissa. I&#39;ve never had dukkah before, but I didn&#39;t mind it at all! I would have preferred smaller slices of the carrots though, much easier to eat! The half portion of chorizo-stuffed dates was just right with a good balance of sweetness from the dates and saltiness from the bacon and chorizo. But the pepper-tomato sauce was such a hit, I was devastated when I ran out of bread to dip into the sauce.Definitely would come by again, perhaps stop by its sister restaurant Blackbird next door next time!"

It&#39;s good, but it is definitely not exceptional.Chorizo-stuffed medjool dates (5/5):This was probably the highlight, then everything went downhill after this...It was creamy and flavorful and just brought me to another level.Focaccia (2/5):bro... it&#39;s a simple dish. But it does not stand out. There&#39;s an overpowering flavor of truffles which is not pleasant. The whole thing is basically just bread + cheese + truffles. not worth the money or the hype. I expected more from avec.slow roasted pork shoulder (4/5):solid pork shoulder. Besides the strong note of salt there is not much going on with the dish. It is homey in deed, but nothing creative or makes it stand out.Creme caramel (4/5):nothing to complaint about besides a little too sweet. nice balancing of flavor with the edible flowers and crunchy things"

Coming in was a bit of a surprise, the place is squeeze tight small. You&#39;ll have some room to walk around, but there is bar seating (which has long waits) and communal seating which is a free-for-all. You can get more privacy at the bar, but the communal you will basically be seated at a table with open seats. You might be squished into the middle, or if you&#39;re lucky, you will get the end seats. It&#39;ll be difficult to get seated with more than 4 people in my opinion, but you can try your luck.Came here with my gf and we luckily got the end of the table. Ordered some drinks which were good, and got two small plates - the butcher&#39;s steak and the whipped brandade. The steak came around medium and I enjoyed it, but my gf likes steaks more well done (I know...). The whipped brandade didn&#39;t do much for us, I would recommend trying the dates. I didn&#39;t try them, but someone next to us got them and they looked fantastic... bacon chorizo and some sauce, just get it. I recommend one small plate for a couple.The large plates are pretty enormous. We got the wood oven paella and the slow roasted pork shoulder. Wood oven paella was amazing. I loved the slow roasted pork shoulder as well, the lemon yogurt was amazing with the pork shoulder. The serving sizes seem pretty large - we orderd two small plates, and our waitress recommended half-plate of the paella and we couldn&#39;t even finish the pork shoulder dish that much. Stick with one small plate to share between two people, and individual large plate per person.It gets pretty cluttered but its a very casual feel. If you get stuck in the middle of a table you might hate the experience. The food is really good though. As long as you aren&#39;t uptight and demand perfection, you should have a good experience here. It takes a while for the food to come out, so maybe order your large plate as your small plate comes to you. Still, I&#39;d recommend Avec to anyone."

This is my go-to spot for taking guests who are visiting the city. The staples -- chorizo dates and focaccia -- are remarkably consistent in quality, and are always a pleasure.The other parts of the menu, which change seasonally, are nearly always worth trying. I fondly recall sumac salmon, squid ink spaghetti, poached eggs, and many other great seasonal dishes. That being said, I&#39;ve also had ones that weren&#39;t so good (duck egg pizza this season, for instance), so there&#39;s some variance among the seasonal items.The gelato and sorbet selection, which changes daily, is also always worth going for. Not only is it usually very well done, but it&#39;s almost always an interesting and compelling flavor.That being said, the music and atmosphere are great too. Avec manages to be intimate and feel vibrant while maintaining a high level of polish.Service is usually great. I have only once ever had an unhelpful server."

I&#39;ve had better bacon wrapped dates at other restaurants in Chicago.Slow roasted pork shoulder (3/5): The meat was tender, but it wasn&#39;t very flavorful. I could only taste the saltiness of the broth, but didn&#39;t have much flavor otherwise.Baked Egg (2/5): This dish was recommended to me by the waitress. She said it would compliment the other dishes that I ordered. However, the sauce, kale, cheese and the chickpeas just didn&#39;t work together in my opinion.Service was average as well. Perhaps it was because the restaurants was so busy Sunday morning. Overall, I feel like this place is over-hyped. Or perhaps due to the hype, I had higher expectations."

Girlfriend ordered a tea and gin inspired drink, which actually arrived after our first plate of food - the only downside to the meal.Food order included the dates (they are everything that other reviewers have mentioned and more. you need these in your life), mussels with fresh naan and flavorful lemony broth, greens with feta and fennel (needed something green.. right?), focaccia bread which was more like dry flatbread with creamy cheese in the center (wouldn&#39;t order again), lamb shank with calabria chili sauce and apricots (wow!), fresh yogurt and berries, and finished with olive oil chocolate cake. Dates were easily my favorite thing, followed by the lamb and mussels.The place is loud and busy (rightfully so) so expect that going in. You&#39;ll sit in close quarters and stare at the surrounding plates wondering - hm should we order that? Yes. Yes you should.

Yes, it&#39;s super cramped, and you dine at long tables smooshed up next to total strangers, which is not my thing at all, HOWEVER that is not my biggest issue. The tables/benches/chairs are AWFUL. The chairs are super tiny, basically little wooden squares with backs that are approximately one inch tall (that is not an exaggeration). I am a pretty small person and I could barely even cross my legs under the table, which was built for Smurfs.

I was prepared for a long wait, so I wasn&#39;t surprised once we got in around 7 and was told there would be about a 45 minute- 1 hour wait. We used this time to go in for a drink a couple doors down and a western restaurant for the wait.Atmosphere:I really did love the atmosphere it even though it is indeed a slim fit restaurant that has apparently be open for 12 years, so they must be doing something right. The lighting was great, the embroidered napkins were a nice touch, and the plating dishes were perfect. Yes of course it was loud but for the conditions, I think anyone could handle it.Food:Hands down amazing, I can&#39;t complain about a single course. The char-grilled sweet potatoes was sweet with a tahini and grill taste, the Brussel sprouts salad was fresh, and the olives and bread was a nice starter but could&#39;ve done without. Entree wise, my mom got the fresh fish which was good but was frightful of bones, and lastly my tangine was hearty for a vegetarian dish a  tang of the yogurt. I agree with others who said that two small plates or one large plate is standard as a filling meal. The proportions are perfect for any time of the day. Outstanding!Dessert:Two out of the three of us went for the special desserts of the day where my dad got the lemon ginger sorbet and my sister got the mint chip gelato. Each had special touches, the sorbet with a torched meringue, and the gelato with two small shortbread cookies atop it. finally, I had the greek yogurt cake which was moist and creamy with a crunch and the currants inside made for nice collected components.Conclusion:. Wouldn&#39;t regret this visit at all, Even Due to Lenten obligations, we had to pass on the chorizo stuffed dates, but next time it&#39;s a must. However, I learned my lesson that other reviews can&#39;t scare me anymore because they made me think I wouldn&#39;t like it. Don&#39;t forget that everyone has different looks on everything which was something you always have to keep in mind. sorry I was sidetracked! Great food, interesting atmosphere, good service, and really good food :)"

But the wait wasn&#39;t too bad the hostess was very nice and helpful. When we were finally seated it was a tight space. I&#39;m not a big person but it was tight and they are communal tables so you might need to move to let other people out. To eat here with more than one other person might be tough.We split a pizza to start and then split the pork shoulder as our entrée. The pizza was cooked perfectly. The cheese on the pizza was a little too rich but it was very tasty. The pork shoulder was so yummy. Again cooked just right and full of flavor. All of the dishes of our dining neighbors looked great as well. It just would have been nice to have a bit more space.It&#39;s a very small place and again they don&#39;t do reservations, so perhaps I would come back for lunch but dinner might be too much of a production for me."

There are a few downsides although including a small crowded space that get increasingly louder the closer to peak dinner service you stay.  The chairs are extremely uncomfortable most without a back rest and simply hard wood.FOOD: I had the cauliflower tabbouleh both nights and it was a great blend of crunchy and smooth along with sweet and spicy.  It is unlike any other tabbouleh and I highly recommend it.  The seared trout was another great dish with a warm trout and chilled shrimp.  The gyro sausage was another hit and highly recommended.  We enjoyed the paella (although the bottom was more crispy the previous night) with sausage and head on shrimp.  As well as the pork shoulder with so much pork we couldn&#39;t finish it.  For dessert it is a must to get the nutter butters which are conveniently bite sized and curiously crunchy.  On the other hand another reason for the 4 stars is that i did not quite understand the apple dessert.  It came out hot and crispy on the outside but the apples on the inside were cold...very cold and I am not sure if that was there intention but I believe they did not realize when trying to quickly get it out to the table.  They also have nice teas, coffees, and cappuccinos!"

What a disappointment our experience here was.Firstly, the restaurant is very small, doesn&#39;t take reservations, has shared tables and is EXTREMELY noisy! I could barely hear my fiancée and this made conversation difficult and uncomfortable. Furthermore, our table neighbors (seated in our same table and with which I constantly rubbed shoulders) were annoyingly loud.Food was just OK.We started by sharing the Serrano Ham platter and started with the wrong foot. Simple, uncreative, boring. No other way to describe it. We followed with the salmon starter and it was an improvement, still nothing impressive. We continued with a whole fish that was actually pretty good! But definitely not worth $42. For desert, we concluded with a cheesecake &#34;with chocolate&#34;, which turned out to be a chocolate cheesecake (and I&#39;m not a big fan of chocolate).Overall, our experience was only ok. I am disappointed because I had heard great things about Avec and there was nothing great about our dinner.The only &#34;great&#34; thing was the bill: UBER EXPENSIVE and totally not worth it  (and we didn&#39;t even order wine)."

We also ordered the brandade which was very rich and creamy. The salmon was also cooked nicely, and my friend ordered the dates which she enjoyed. For dessert, we shared the lime and coconut gelato in strawberry soda, and the fruit tart. The fruit dessert was nothing particularly special, but I loved how unique and refreshing the gelato float was. Altogether, a great dining experience that I would highly recommend.My one criticism for the restaurant is that the booths at the communal tables don&#39;t work!

The smooth and creamy chicken liver pâté was to die for.. the stone fruit mostarda with fresh herbs to top the crostini..amazing play of creamy, crunchy, sweet, salty, fresh. I wish I could eat this every day.Chorizo Stuffed Medjool Dates. Another great one. Came in 4 pieces and again, the sweetness of the dates and saltiness of the chorizo and bacon were perfectly balanced. The tomato pepper sauce added a nice touch of acidity that really complimented the dates and made this dish different from other bacon wrapped dates I&#39;ve tried. Definitely recommend!I also tried the Whole Roasted Branzino. Cooked and seasoned perfectly but since it is a mild tasting fish, I always found it a bit boring. They topped it with some wonderful colors which included carrots, parsley, cilantro, garbanzo beans (which were undercooked). It was good but I think the others items on the menu were better. The Pork Shoulder was also pretty good. Super tender with a generous portion. Loved the smoked yogurt that was on top.

The mussels were so-so, but my companions loved them. I did like, however, how the pita was draped over the mussel cookware it was served in - you can tell it was baked fresh on top.

It&#39;s likely me, not them. But, nonetheless, I will continue with my 3 (gasp!) star review.First impression: Casual atmosphere with foo-foo menu items with which I have absolutely no familiarity.Menu: the menu made the dishes out to be complex.  I didn&#39;t quite know what was in each dish as my mastery of culinary lingo is incredibly subpar.  Not totally a big deal as, from my experience, high quality restaurants like this usually deliver on taste.Food: Overall everything was tasty and good.  Nothing was ever at the level of &#39;omg this is to die for&#39; and conversely nothing came close to being spat out.  Everything was just...good!Chorizo stuffed dates (of course we got them- every single Yelp tip and review mandated the ordering and consumption of these ahhhhmaaaazzzing dates):  My thoughts:  they were.......good.  Nothing more, def nothing less.  I&#39;m not going to rave about them as, for me, they don&#39;t deserve all the attention.Brussels Sprouts Salad: Good. (That is all)Mussels: Buuuuttttter!  (Which allows this item to hover between good and pretty good.) Lima beans were a good addition.Atmosphere:  Pretty cool vibe.  Casual environment.  We were seated at an upscale picnic-style table (if there is such a thing) which  was backed up against the wood wall.  Loved it until 3 different groups rolled through at various times throughout our meal and conversation, requiring us to stand up and allow them through.  At one point, whilst mid-chew, we stood up allowing a group to sit down beside us. However, the area in which we were standing became quite congested with the waiter who was attempting to deliver drinks, the new patrons, another table of ~5 getting up to leave, and us.  All ten of us were jockeying for position in 2&#39;x2&#39; space.  Whilst being excused this way and excused that way I was able to finish chewing the chorizo stuffed date with bacon.  Folks, the bacon made this situation tolerable. Therefore, I think the bacon (and I suppose the chorizo stuffed date to which it was attached) is due an upgrade on its ranking to &#39;great&#39;! Ha.Anywho.  Everything was good. Glad I ate here once.  Unfortunately, I do not have a desire to go back at this time.Pro-tip:  weekday 6:30 seating was easy peasy.  7:30-9 it was hopping- people were waiting."

It&#39;s one of many successful restaurants under Paul Kahan, a wine-focused dining space that first opened in 2003. Although the restaurant has received more praise for the eclectic, ever-changing menu that pulls from many different cuisines and genres, it&#39;s nonetheless yet another quintessential Chicago restaurant.We arrived on the early end of a weekend brunch, as Avec does not take reservations; thankfully, at the time, there were only a few other parties present, so we were quickly greeted and seated at a table. The dining room is bright, featuring light woodwork, and the single row of dining tables in addition to the bar seating can be deemed minimalistic. It&#39;s a clear counter to the diversity of dishes found on their menu, which are small(er) plates, and best when shared. Each is as tempting as the last, and it&#39;s not difficult to overorder; three dishes is a good starting point between two people, unless, of course, you have sizable appetites like the two of us.One of the must-order dishes at Avec is the Chorizo-stuffed Medjool Dates. Lovers of the combination of sweet and savory will instantly appreciate this pairing, which consists of plump medjool dates stuffed with diced chorizo and then wrapped in a strip of smoky bacon. The dish is served in a spicy-tart piquillo pepper-tomato sauce, a perfect foil to the flavors, and can thankfully be ordered in a small (2) or large (4) size. We weren&#39;t as impressed with the Poached Eggs, which were served on sourdough with &#39;nduja, a condiment made of spicy, soft pork sausage. Perhaps it was the preserved lemon hollandaise, which tread towards being too acidic, but the pairing of ingredients didn&#39;t seem as harmonious.There&#39;s also a dish listed as the &#34;Deluxe&#34; Focaccia, a dish that wound up being the equivalent of a flatbread pizza. The focaccia was a commendable texture, simultaneously crisp and doughy, and held a center layer of ricotta. There were a few herbs to add some freshness as well as the all-too familiar drizzle of truffle oil; while delicious, it became rather heavy towards the halfway point. In hindsight, it would be better to serve a smaller portion of it as an appetizer, as it would make a perfect starter for a group. We barely had room for the Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder, a hefty serving of tender pork served in a lentil stew with onions, brussels sprouts, raisins, and a few slices of apple. It was a delicious and well seasoned dish, and ideal for the colder months, especially as the pork shoulder had just the right ratio of lean to fatty meat.I have to commend Avec on delivering a strong dining experience, from the delicious and well-executed food to the thoughtful service. They were kind enough to let us linger after our meal as we tried to figure out our next course of action (limited in scope given the nature of Chicago winters), and if we hadn&#39;t had to board a plane that afternoon, I&#39;d have been tempted to return that evening for dinner."

The latest rendition I&#39;ve tried, with smoked clams and arugula, was very, very salty - hopefully that was just a one-off occurrence.And man, I&#39;m not a fan of truffle oil in most foods, but I think it actually pairs really well with the soft taleggio in the focaccia.I&#39;d love to try Avec&#39;s other offerings...it&#39;s just hard to stray from the staples above.

It&#39;s decently crowded as deserved, but the service is fantastic.Highly recommended!"

I highly recommend the chorizo stuffed dates and the lamb burger. The portions were decent sized too. The one area for improvement would be how close together everyone was sitting - we felt like we were on top of each other. Thank goodness we didn&#39;t have to use the restroom mid-meal.

You&#39;ll either love it or hate it. I don&#39;t recommend going in a large group, the place is small, no reservations, and seating is cramped and it&#39;s a pain in the neck to get up to use the restroom. It&#39;s like sitting in an airplane (you&#39;re that close to total strangers, and you could be seated in the middle between them - the tables are large and not broken up). Someone is always having to get up and interrupt their meal to let someone else out to use the restroom. It can be awkward for this reason. Service is good. Sometime feels rushed. But the food and drinks... Phenomenal. You must get the pork shoulder &amp; dates. Always go for dessert as well. Don&#39;t miss it. It&#39;s hard to go wrong here with anything on the menu. This place is high energy but it&#39;s got the 5 star reputation for a reason."

The food is superb!! Nothing super fancy but a very good interesting take on some dishes you know and you realise how could they can actually taste.For example, we have had the dates wrapped with bacon and the deluxe focaccia with truffle oil. Both are dishes that we had had before but we were amazed how great they tasted here in contrast to other places we had visited.The atmosphere is also laid back and the staff is really friendly and attentive.

Everything I ate (with the exception of the bread, I felt I could have cooked better myself and for a fraction of the price. I also found the seating style to be obscene and obnoxious: we were seated in the middle and we finished eating before the party at the end, so two of the three of them had to stand up IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR MEAL to let us out. I think communal seating can be okay when you&#39;re in the mood for it, but not like this...you should be able to get up without disrupting an entire table.Here&#39;s what we ate:Chicken Liver Crostini: This was the first thing they brought to the table. It took them 30 minutes (which was confusing because it&#39;s clear that they had the liver pate sitting in the fridge and just spooned it into the container they served it in...there&#39;s no reason it should have taken that long, especially considering that they brought the second dish out (a hot one) 5 minutes after we started eating that one. This was pretty good. If you like chicken liver you will appreciate this...but it wasn&#39;t exceptionalBrandade: This was the second dish that was served. This was decent but WAY too salty (they buttered the bread with salted butter and then generously seasoned the fish as well.Trout with shrimp:  The trout was cooked very well, but the shrimp were not good...the quality just did not seem good (maybe farmed and previously frozen).Pork Shoulder: This had to be the biggest culinary disappointment of the night. The conceptualization of this dish was ridiculous: Pork with clams in a salty broth covered in creamy yogurt sitting in &#34;cracked wheat&#34; that is soaking in the broth. WHY? I would definitely avoid this one.Amaretto Cake with Peaches:  This was okay, but it did not seam fresh...we agreed that it must have been sitting in the fridge for hours (not in a good way...like, maybe hours was actually days).The Alcoholic Ginger beer was excellent (it&#39;s bottled, not something they make in house); I thought the cucumber cocktail was not good, but my boyfriend liked it (I would only recommend it if you really really love artificial cucumber flavor).I&#39;ve given this 3 stars because I think the technique was there, but the flavors, execution, and concept are are not great.P. S. they put a ton of raw parsley on EVERY DISH with the exception of the cake."

I should state the men were the ooc ones, the ladies with them were well mannered.We order a mix of plates - we didn&#39;t the infamous dates - might have to grab em at some point. Since we love meat, we had the lamb, pork shoulder, steak and then a fish pate to get some variety. Also had a wine. Everything was good and the pork was outstanding.

I was extremely excited to see one of my favorite Thai apps on the menu, mee krob. It is so delicious and I have had a hard time finding a good (or any) version in the city.Silom has really good reviews, so I was very surprised by my experience, which was not so stellar. The food, that came oddly packaged like Seven Eleven salads, really was a miss for me. I even stuck to the most popular picks (how can so many people be so wrong?!?). Here&#39;s the rundown:Mee Krob - Not good. Came in the form of crunchy noodles and tofu with the tamarind sauce on the side. . .so you had to toss it. . . yourself! This meant a lot of sauce congregating in the bottom of the 7-11ish plastic container. Uggggggh! Even when I did get some sauce, I wasn&#39;t excited. Overall, I won&#39;t order it again.Paht Thai - Really disappointed. Ordered it with chicken. but it also came with tofu?! So it sucked up the sauce and was REALLY dry. Also, there weren&#39;t any veggies in there. This dish was the biggest disappointment of the bunch.Panang Curry - Star of the show. Really good and the spice was right. I could have drank the sauce with a straw. Would order again.Cucumber Salad - Too much sauce alert (I am probably starting to sound like Goldilocks here)! It was OK. Lots of cucumber, sauce was good but soupy.Overall, I won&#39;t be ordering again from here any time soon. There are much better Thai options in the hood (Thai Lagoon, here&#39;s looking at you!)"

The curry sauce was as thin as water; wish it had at least a little substance to at least sit on top of the sauce and not saturate it. They only provided a small container of rice - definitely not enough for two to share!Beef with Flat Noodle - 5Probably the most simple dish, and definitely the best dish of the bunch. The beef was tender and the noodles were perfect.Pineapple Fried Rice - 2The 2 is only for the seafood. It was mostly rubbery calimari, but also had shrimp, octopus and tough pieces of bbq pork. There was also some weird textured stuff (pork?) on top...it resembled cotton candy. Skip it. My companion was so grossed out by the whole dish, I ended up taking the leftovers so they wouldn&#39;t go to waste.

All in all pretty disappointing to pay so much for so little.For a $12 Shrimp Green Basil curry you get 6 medium shrimpFor the $8 Banana Wonton dessert you get 3 tiny pieces of banana deep fried in wonton with about 3 tablespoons of ice cream...Also, the size of the veggies in the curry is way too large coupled with the skimpiness on meat just makes it feel like you are drinking curry with a few pieces of meat and a leftover veggie tray dumped in. The veggies are the only thing you end up tasting with this amount of meat so couldn&#39;t we at least get nicer sizes?

I have tried so many Thai restaurants with some being pretty good and others being disappointing. Still, I have yet to find one that I would be happy ordering from until I die, or the restaurant closes. Silom 12 was close to taking the spot, but still didn&#39;t hit what I&#39;m looking for.My partner and I decided to order it for delivery. I ordered the Paht Siew with chicken and my partner got the Paht Thai. The first thing I noticed were how big the portions were. I was very pleased with that. I find that many, if not a majority, of Thai restaurants serve smaller portions and charge a relatively high price for it. There was an excellent amount of chicken in my dish. The flavor was spot on. The stir fry sauce was flavorful without being overwhelming. The rice noodles where nicely cooked, and not crunchy/hard like some places. I really enjoyed the dish.Throughout my dish I had a really optimistic outlook. Did I just find &#34;my Thai place&#34;? Unfortunately no. My partner and I swapped dishes to try each others. The Paht Thai definitely had a great sized portion like my Paht Siew, but that didn&#39;t make up for the flavor. It did not have that peanut flavor that I look for in my Paht Thai. It was a little sweeter instead, which I can say isn&#39;t something I wanted. The noodles were dry as well. They stuck together in clumps. I also noticed that there was less meat in the Paht Thai than in the Paht Siew. My guess is that because they put tofu in the Paht Thai by default they take that into account as a protein while deciding how much protein goes in each dish. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that, but I would have just preferred more chicken rather than the tofu.Silom 12 is by no means a bad restaurant. I&#39;ll honestly probably order from there again just for the Paht Siew. However, because one of my favorite Thai dishes (Paht Thai) wasn&#39;t up to snuff, Silom 12 wasn&#39;t able to become &#34;my Thai place&#34;."

To be honest, they tasted like the smell of a barn so I wasn&#39;t able to eat more than a bite. Unsure if I got a bad batch or this is how they should taste, because they are a higher rated item on grubhub.I&#39;ll keep ordering and trying new things here because I also got the Chocolate mousse and it was delightful. I&#39;m also going to continue to watch Empire because Terrence Howard is sexy AF (really sucks he is a wife beater though)"

From the online ordering process to the interactions with their (extremely friendly) staff, to the quality of food itself, 5 stars across the board. Best green curry I have ever had. Chicken satay and pad thai were excellent, too.The prices were fair for the generous portions, and although we took our food to go, the restaurant was immaculate with cool, modern decor. We will be back to dine in soon."

I ordered the Larb Gai and the Drunken Noodles with Chicken and a side of jasmine rice. The Larb Gai was outstanding and was a larger portion. The Drunken Noodles were very good and quite flavorful. I ordered the rice to calm down the heat from the Drunken Noodles and to soak up some of the sauce. The Larb Gai with the rice would be the way I will go the next time. This restaurant is not close enough to where I live to be in the rotation, but anytime I am in Bucktown it will definitely be the spot for an inexpensive meal out.

Also got the panang noodle dish with fried tofu (which they charge $2 extra for). The sauce was perfectly tasty and the dish was really huge, you definitely get a lot of food for the price! The only thing was that the noodles were a little soggy and there was a lot of sauce - I would&#39;ve liked a little crispier noodle and less sauce (or at least some extra rice to soak it all up).

I once again had to request them to add white onions to my basil stir fry (still, so weird that it doesn&#39;t already come with onions) and instead of charging me $1 for this, they charged me $2!  Seriously?  $2 to add onions to a stir fry dish that should already come with them?  Unfortunately, the Thai food here is so far above and beyond anywhere else in Chicago that I will still come here, but I still think that&#39;s ridiculous."

Not only does the orders arrive within the time expected, but the food has always been flavourful. There hasn&#39;t been one dish - and I get the curry dishes - that I didn&#39;t love to the point of repeat orders. So, I decided to go to the restaurant to have a sit-down experience.What took me so long?The complimentary rice crisps and dip are a hit, and that&#39;s just the free goodies. I had tuna tataki that I will order when I return. Notice I said, &#34;when I return.&#34; The larb tod was a bit salty and didn&#39;t have the curry flavouring that I love most, but I gobbled it to completion. And then there was panang curry with shrimp. Let&#39;s just say that I was a happy man with each scoop of the panang dish with accompanying rice.Silom 12 has this whole lounge vibe going, and I love it. With it being in Bucktown, I&#39;m sure it fills up quickly after 5:00 PM and on weekends. It was a good thing that I went during the day on July 4th. But that&#39;s okay. I came. I ate.

Robbed.  Even Opart (best thai in the city) charges only $7.-Pad Thai: bland, slightly dry, but at least the ingredients seem fresh.-Chicken Satay: average, decent flavor and peanut sauce matched well-Pineapple Fried Rice: Weird.  So the dish is composed of rice, pineapple, some veggies, and awkward seafood.  In a rice dish, just stick to stuff that will not be difficult to balance on a spoon.  The seafood in the dish was also overcooked and too rubbery.  I felt bad for the baby octopus so carelessly thrown into this mess.However, there is one redeeming quality to save it from a 1 star review.DELIVERY RAMEN.It does NOT hold much of a candle to Wasabi down the street, but if you are in a pinch or lazy or hungover... and want ramen delivered... Then give &#39;em a ring.My recommendation: 1/2 mile north on milwaukee ave = blue sprout."

Went there based on yelp reviews, and am sure glad we did. It was pleasantly full for a Sunday night, not too busy, but still a lively and fun atmosphere. Very modern ambience, but not stuffy at all. The host was very friendly and led us to a great table.I had the panang chicken curry, and ordered it mild. Would definitely agree with other reviewers that their food is spicy. The mild I requested still had a big kick. My husband and mom got the Tonkotsu Ramen which according to him was &#34;good, especially for a Thai place.&#34; Sister got Pad Thai which was solid. HUGE PORTIONS.About ten minutes into our meal we noticed water started to drip down the wall behind us and got us a little wet. When we asked to move tables, the staff was so nice and very apologetic (although it was very obviously the unit above them that was leaking and not at all the restaurant&#39;s fault). At the end of the meal they gave us a $10 gift certificate to come back and apologized for the water--- again very nice and not necessary but such a nice touch!The thing about this place is that they have a large menu with many Thai and Asian varieties, but they do it all well. It&#39;s not like your typical Asian fusion place that does one or two categories well but lacks in the other categories. Everything we got was great! We will definitely be back here."

I think Dan Thai has a challenger! And surprisingly, it&#39;s not in LA, at least not yet, but from Dan Thai&#39;s own backyard. Who knew that in Bucktown, of all places, there would be a Penang Curry that rises to the challenge?!Went here for a birthday. It&#39;s BYOB! They have some really interesting drinks on their menu. I was specifically craving any of their lychee cocktails, as 1) I love lychee, 2) I love lychee-anything bubble tea, and 3) I&#39;ve never had a lychee cocktail! Their food menu was also interesting. Considering this is a Thai place, the back of the menu had like 5 different kinds of Japanese ramen noodles. Who woulda thunk it? Their menu is very big, and they even have vegetarian choices.The place was already predetermined, so I was Yelping to find suggestions, and I was surprised that a specific Chicago Suburbs Community Manager who loves Thai and vegetarian menus has not reviewed this place!TOM YUMI enjoy Thai food, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m fully educated on it yet. I always get either Tom Yum or Tom Kha - extra spicy. Obviously, like Korean places, the spelling can be different, but here you have a choice of Tom Yum clear or creamy. Tom Yum &#34;creamy&#34; sounds like Tom Kha...but then they have a Tom Kar Gai, which fits the description. So...I&#39;m really not sure what&#39;s what, but I ordered the Tom Yum Clear - extra spicy.The spice level was perfect! It&#39;s sweat inducing, but not tear jerking. See, tear jerking is where I draw the line. To help understand how spicy this was, let me put it in perspective. For me, BW3&#39;s Wild is sweat inducing, and Blazin&#39; is tear jerking. So, when I asked for &#34;Extra Spicy&#34; I got the equivalence of Wild.The top layer is basically floating mushrooms - and I love mushrooms! There are a lot of &#34;landmines&#34; in the soup; however, all of them sink to the bottom, so you&#39;re pretty safe.Now taste. The seasoning, I&#39;d say, was acceptable, but the flavor was lacking. I don&#39;t know how the &#34;creamy&#34; tastes, but clear tastes watery, actually! The spice kept me going, but it was like spicy &#34;Tom Yum flavored&#34; water. I&#39;m thinking Tom Kha might be the way to go here. They brought this out the same time that my curry did, so I only got to finish about 2/3 of it, so that I can move on with my main dish.PENANG CURRYServed in a long boat, with a side of rice. First thing, the sauce is thick! If you dip your spoon in it real fast, it might drip a little, but the spoon would be, essentially, coated in it, which is just the way I like it. The taste of it - very rich in flavor, without being too basil-y. Seasoning is also right on (which they all usually are). Plus, I asked for &#34;extra spicy,&#34; and just like the Tom Yum - they got the level PERFECT!The beef was a little chewier than other places, but this almost felt and tasted like pieces of steak. Still, it wasn&#39;t rubbery or tough or anything, it was good. The flavor of the curry was just so spot on, I can&#39;t even explain it well! The best word to describe it was &#34;rich.&#34; Not overpowering on any specific flavor, but very well balanced. Scoop of rice, scoop of curry + beef, and it&#39;s eclectic!Last but not least - no land mines!Flavor and seasoning-wise, this and Dan Thai are pretty even. Beef is better here though, and I think the curry itself is a little thicker here, which I also like better. But probably the most important thing...when I say &#34;extra spicy,&#34; it&#39;s actually as spicy as I want it here. Dan Thai doesn&#39;t quite understand my &#34;extra spicy.&#34; So, I&#39;m going to have to award the crown to Silom 12! Who knew Bucktown had good Thai?!SILOM #1!That was a great matchup, Silom 12 vs. Dan Thai, but we have our victor! Dan Thai will still remain on my 5-star list, but it will have to live under the shadow of Silom 12. I&#39;m not sure I understand the &#34;12&#34; in its name, but it could be &#34;18956&#34; for all I care. It&#39;s VERY hard for me to come back here - but I will be back!"

The crab Rangoon made it worth a repeat but unfortunately I&#39;ll have to find my curry elsewhere from now on. The search for the perfect Thai place continues...

Very attentive and he seemed truly sad when I left. Now that&#39;s being made to feel at home.While the decor is modern, the food and experience are still excellent.The Skewered Chicken Satay was delicious. Plump, moist chicken with a not-too-spicy peanut sauce. And the cucumber salad was excellent.I found the Seaweed Salad to be just ok. Perhaps the dressing they used was not to my taste.I chose the Green Basil Curry for my entree. Yes, it was a bit rich, but they put LOTS of chicken in there and the coconut sauce made me not even notice it contained eggplant!I will definitely return to Silom 12!"

A few people said that it was great, best food EVER, and some told me it wasn&#39;t worth it, it was overpriced, and the portions were small.It is not cheap, sure, but everything we ordered was good: paht thai (aka pad thai), egg rolls, fried veggies, fried rice, and some organge chicken dish that was phenomenal. I&#39;m a chicken person and usually don&#39;t like how restaurants prepare/cook their chicken, but that chicken was awesome. It was crispy but yet tossed in a dressing (which I could&#39;ve done w more, but I&#39;d say it was the perfect amount so it didn&#39;t get soggy). The rice was a great combo of tasty, clean, and yet &#34;greasy&#34; yumminess. We will definitely order from here again (although sparingly bc it is a little pricey, but worth it). There was nothing small about their portions. Also the delivery was prompt for a Saturday evening."

The only complaint I have is that they do not serve traditional Kra Prao Chicken (Basil Chicken) with minced meat. They only have sliced chicken for this dish. The chicken slices just do not absorb the flavor of the sauce the same way that minced chicken does. I would order from here much more often if they prepared this dish the way I like - unfortunately I only come here when i&#39;m craving noodles.

I prefer my Thai with zero decor and a lot of sour and funk to the food.BUT - that being said I definitely appreciate Silom 12&#39;s place in the world. They do very good food across a number of different styles/types - really a pretty large menu. Everything I have had has been between good and very good. They are also open late and deliver in a huge range, right up until closing. They really package all their food for delivery with care, and it is tough to find a place where you can get well made food at 11p at night."

In city full of great Thai restaurants what makes Silom 12 stand out, is the atmosphere. Silom doesn&#39;t go for dated looking gold elephant pictures or cliche Asian art, but rather an upscale modern feel.The prices, while maybe on the higher end for Thai food is still very reasonable. Service was excellent and our entire party of 10 all loved their dishes, which consist of standard  Thai fair and some of their own specialties. The overall vibe and food quality make Silom a great date option as opposed some other Thai restaurants with less pleasing esthetics."

However, I appreciate Silom 12 attempt at providing very delicious thai food. The take out order always come in the nicest package and the yum nuer that we normally order is our favorite dish. We love the panang curry and the tod mun, as well as the pad kee mow. My only gripe is the sticky rice. While offered in a nice corn husk wrapping... It has been steamed too long and becomes so gelatinous, it&#39;s almost impossible to eat. That is comfort food and I wished it was a little more authentic.

My boyfriend and I drove by this place all the time and just randomly thought to try it the other day and let me tell you, this place is seriously a hidden gem!To start off, the atmosphere is really nice. It feels like a trendy Japanese sushi restaurant or something. I was kind of amazed at how NOT busy it was on Friday night. In fact, I even hesitated reviewing this place and giving it 5 stars in fear that it will start to become another Nori or Cumin, because that&#39;s where it&#39;s headed.We started off with a couple drinks. Mine was a ginger vodka with iced tea and my boyfriend got a Long Island and they were both great! Our crab rangoon came out quickly too and it was delicious.Next up, I got the panang noodles and they were AMAZING. I always crave curry, but I love noodles, so this was a perfect fit. My boyfriend was jealous and I think we&#39;ll probably both order it next time. He did get a really amazing seafood noodle basil dish though, but the curry noodles were off the charts!I definitely want to come back, and I could not be happier that I&#39;m moving to this neighborhood!"

Came here for lunch on Sunday at around 2:00pm, and it was quite empty. We ordered the Pad thai and the Panang curry - both vegetarian with tofu. The pad thai was delicious, I would have preferred it to be more spicy, but I had asked only for medium spicy. So I know for the next time to order extra spicy. I enjoyed that dish - it was a blend of flavors with fresh vegetables and the tofu was the perfect texture. The panang curry looked really good, and tasted even better. Yum!! The curry has a nice thickness, I am not sure if that is the authentic way of making it. But it sure was delicious. The vegetables were fresh, there was basil - lots of it which is the way I like it. It is served with a side of white rice, hubby and me were in curry heaven!! The service was pretty good and attentive. The decor is quite nice...

This will be our go to Thai place from now on!Crab Rangoon: 2/5 -- very small little purses with thin dough which was nice, however they were lacking any flavor other than cream cheese. The sweet chile sauce to dip in was good though!Cashew Stir Fry with Beef: 4/5 -- The sauce in this dish was delicious; typically sauce in a cashew dish is very thin. This was a nice, rich, caramelized brown sauce that enriched the flavor of the veggies and went perfect with beef. The meat could have been a little more tender.Pad Thai with chicken: 3/5 -- Good as far as pad thai goes, definitely ask for spicy if you like a little heat. We found it to be bland. There were LOTS of peanuts though, which was great!Massaman Curry: 5/5 -- Absolutely delicious. Just the right amount of coconut flavor to compliment the curry.

Silom 12 is likely not for you.The flavors are highly Earthy, basic, and unpredictable. The Summer Wraps, Gui Chai, and Banana Wonton all have a flavor that you&#39;d never expect... not naming anything in particular, but their tastes are unusual, satisfying, and unique.Their main courses, by delivery, are a fair sum above average, but are not truly different enough to call them out on a higher level that is worth discussing on any long term basis.It is my opinion that the chefs/cooks/etc here are amazing and have a large amount of potential to create truly groundbreaking cuisine... but may have a management level that prevents their primary initiatives from hitting their highest caliber.But, like most ethnic foods of Chicago, I cannot hold much against minor imperfection, so... and so, with a shot of Maker&#39;s Mark held high, I rate Silom 12 5/5 despite its shortcomings."

Every time I go down Milwaukee and see Turbo Tacos, I used to think, &#39;I&#39;ve never seen anyone go in there before...is it closed down?&#39; Then, a few months ago, a friend recommended me this spot saying they make some of the best tacos. I was shocked, now having this knowledge of a human being stepping into this restaurant, but I vowed to myself that I would check it out one day. Today was that day.I ordered three tacos al pastor and an horchata. The casher (who I assumed was the owner) was an incredibly nice guy. Always checked in on me every 10 minutes while I was dining in as well as the other customers at the time, making small talk and having a couple of laughs; it was everything a owner should do that gives a place an extra piece of greatness to it.The tacos itself were great. Yummy al pastor that actually left me satisfied as I was starving when I walked in. Great price too! $1.50 for tacos, $2something for gorditas, and about $5 for burritos and tortas.Don&#39;t be me and overlook this place. If you&#39;re sick of Los Comales or Arturos or Lazos or whatever, make sure to check out Turbo Tacos one of these days if you&#39;re in the area. Hell, you don&#39;t even have to be in the area, check out this place! I really appreciate small joints like this."

Having moved into the neighborhood a few months ago, I&#39;ve kept a curious eye on Turbo Tacos.A Saturday afternoon trip led to a purchase of a taco, gordita, torta, chips &amp; guac, and the post-order realization that I must have been a bit more hungover than I thought.First, the good news: As a number of others have pointed out, the staff is quite friendly. I don&#39;t know if the gentleman who took my order was the owner that is mentioned in some other reviews, but regardless he was very friendly and patient.Second, ignore the woman who claims the place is dirty. The building has very clearly been remodeled recently, so there&#39;s nothing inherently unclean about the place and all the tables were spotless when I visited.Now to the food. Again starting with the positives -- everything was very fresh. I watched the protein for my order go on the grill, the aforementioned gentlemen cut up an avocado to make my guacamole, chips were fresh out of the fryer, etc.Yet we start to go a bit downhill.  The guac was fresh, but the kitchen forgot to make it until I noticed that the bag felt a bit light.  As above, the guy was super pleasant and apologetic, but in the rush to make up for his mistake it tasted like he went a bit sparingly on the salt.The gordita was good, but was very one note. The sandwich was exactly what you&#39;d expect from a torta and not one bit more. It sucks because it&#39;s not as if any of these items were bad, leading one to believe that Turbo Tacos is within reach of being really solid. Case in point: Other reviewers have correctly noticed that the steak is very bland. Yet out the corner of my eye I saw a fellow diner who figured out that applying some fresh lime juice and cilantro turned a bland taco into something delicious.Unfortunately, we have to judge on what was instead of what could have been and in that context these five star reviews from other folks make no sense.  Single tacos don&#39;t seem to come with the critical lime, guac was forgotten even though I was the only order up, but most of all too many things were just average. I appreciate the really kind service, will always defend a place against unfair accusations of dirtiness, and will go back hoping for improvement, but three stars for now."

He brought me home some tacos, 2 steak and 1 al pastor. I enjoyed them. I think they are simple and tasty. No frills, which I like. I did think they were a little bland, probably just needing a little salt and pepper. The tortillas were a bit dry and too thick. I felt like the tortilla was too prominent in my tacos. With that being said, I think this place has great potential if they work out the kinks."

Gets longer if you have a large party. It was only a table for two for us and it still took us at least an hour.  Restaurant is small! so expect to shimmy against each other if your near the bar.Multiple stars..Person working the front: 2 starsOur waitress: 4 starsFood: 4 starsHere&#39;s why.Person working the front (the shorter then the two), seating people is equivalent and reminds me of the soup nazi in Sinefeld.  You would think host/hostess are nice, personable and inviting... this guy has some issues.  There is no wait list to put your name on, he says its in his head... um okay. Sure.. At first we were giving the guy credit. Then he seated the guys behind us who came in 10 minutes after we did. How did we know that, its because we were talking to the guys when they walked in. So my husband went to tell host with the baditude that, and he was flat out rude! he starts telling my husband with an attitude... I told you it will be an hour and a half wait. My husband says the guys were after us, and he was wrong.  He says he&#39;s never wrong.  The people next to us who were Chicago locals overheard... and later asked us if we were on the list.... they were joking of course, cause theres no list.  Its all filed away in metal cabinets in his head. These Chicago locals specifically told us that they try not to go there because of this. So beware of the grumpy dude.Our waitress, she was bubbly, quick and nice. I liked her!! She delivered our salads rather quickly.  Our waiter always consistently refilled our waters, took away our plates and items quickly.Our food.. well now here it is. I was really excited to try this place. I saw the review to this place, even saw the video and I was intrigued! Pizza that looks like a humongous muffin, flip it and it becomes a pizza. Its like a dam transformer.  We choose the 1-pounder, Pizza Pot Pie with Mushrooms with wheat crust. about 20-minutes later.. viola the dam muffin looking thing is in front of you. ready to be flipped. Our waitress flipped and knifed the dish until it flops on to the plate.  First taste, the melted cheese is fabulous. Watch the video.. its not just mozzarella. its a combo of cheeses that make this dish so fabulous. You like cheese,come and get some! The meat sauce too was very tasty.  I&#39;ve had meat sauces in different restaurant and I always feel like its 20% meat, and 80% running tomato water. This sauce was meaty and flavorful. perfect.. just perfect. Just to mention, the wheat crust was different, it actually felt grainy so perhaps oder it with the white."

The reality is they won&#39;t remember you,  and there is no way of telling how many that came after you got to eat before you.  I know because they asked me to wait another 2 hours after 2 hours.The pot pie is basically a bread bowl with tomato  meat sauce, half mushrooms, and alot of cheese.Another Chicago thing."

The entrance was located downstairs. The restaurants are much bigger than the place appears!On a Friday evening, an hour before closing, we were hoping there wouldn&#39;t be a wait for three, but boy were we wrong! Once we walked in, our waiter immediately told us that it&#39;ll be a 45 minute to an hour wait. There&#39;s a bar area for you and your party to sit at while you wait to be seated.The pizza pot pie is a must try! I never had such a unique pizza before and I&#39;m glad I discovered this.The wait for the pizza is 30-40 minutes.

If it weren&#39;t for the old timey signs sticking out you could walk right by it. It is a very narrow restaurant with a low ceiling (at least for me). It&#39;s just barely big enough to handle the kind of foot traffic it sees. When I arrived with friends we were greeted by valet. Which I highly recommend you do! They will park your car for $10. When we got inside we were told to wait by the bar for 45 minutes. We expected an hour wait no matter what...and you should too!But by some great blessing we were seated within about 25 minutes...maybe less. We were blown away! We took a booth and sat down.Great selection of beers.For an appetizer we did the Mediterranean bread. It was a HUGE flatbread covered in spices such as basil, rhyme and parmesan.  It was delicious and surprisingly filling!  I also recommend you ask for some oil to dip it in. So good!We ordered the pizza pot pies. I mean why else would you come here? For first time visits just get the pies!They come in half pound and one pound. I was hungry so I did the one pounder.You get a choice of meat or vegetarian sauce and if you want mushrooms. Otherwise it&#39;s the same cheese. The crust I think could be wheat.The pot pies are so unique in presentation - and they tasted great! They are simple...but effective.We ended our meal by trying the Tortoni which was rum flavored vanilla ice cream covered with almonds and macaroons. Very yummy and a great way to end a meal here.Yes this place is kinda expensive to visit, but it&#39;s worth it. That being said it isn&#39;t TOO expensive being Chicago.The staff were also surprisingly quick and attentive given how busy it was.In short, this may not be the best pizza place in Chicago. But it IS one of the most unique pizza experiences I&#39;ve ever had. Check it out. You won&#39;t be disappointed.Oh and BRING CASH...they are cash only here. There is an ATM inside though."

When you walk in, the atmosphere is that of a classic Italian restaurant.The ambience is great, and the host is a unique individual, who doesn&#39;t ask for your name but remembers the order in which people walk in.I made a point to go in at an early hour - but if I stopped in later in the night I would be sure to grab a couple beers at the bar. One thing to note - they are a cash only place, but do have an ATM by the front door, keep in mind there is a $3 service fee.I went with the 1/2 half pounder, with sausage and mushrooms. The &#34;pizza&#34; was really good, but I was still hungry after putting the whole thing down. The cheese was gooey, the mushrooms were full button mushrooms and were good if you like mushrooms.I also tried the meatball oven grinder - the portion here was great and definitely didn&#39;t leave me feeling hungry. On my next visit I think I would go with the pizza pot pie again, and try one of the antipasto salads."

(It was tasty, but I wonder if).  It&#39;s larger than the plate it&#39;s served on, therefore we had to flip it on itself to avoid sitting on the table.Pot pie pizza: Think of it as a pasta meat sauce (we had the sausage and mushroom) and a hand full of white mushrooms  under a layer of melted white melting Cheese (it&#39;s not mozzarella).I loved the Mediterranean bread.  I could be satisfied just eating that.  The pot pie was tasty good, but I prefer to have everything piping hot.   It was only warm which is very odd to me.   I mean, for faster prep, I figured they would use meat sauce that was simmering...but apparently the sauce is ladled on cold, then Cheese then baked.   Disappointing that it was not served hotter.By 7pm on a Friday night, the tables turned about three times.  The booths next to us were all two tops and they ordered way too much food.  The antipasti salad (who eats salad at this place really?). It&#39;s what tourists would call Chicago sized.  Fit to fully feed two people.   If you get a salad, don&#39;t bother ordering the bread or your own personal pot pie.This is my second visit to oven grinder.  Both times not too impressed.  Perhaps it&#39;s because I&#39;m not a fan of hype built up thru waiting. And it just does not stand out to me as must have for my taste buds.It&#39;s a popular spot (and its been popular for years!) and worth taking your out of town guests.   (Just make sure that your guests hold the spot in line while you take your time getting there.Happy eating folks!"

First of all, expect to wait for around 2 hours on a Saturday night. The line snakes throughout the restaurant and spills out into the streets with people milling about with drinks as they wait. I don&#39;t know how they kept all the people waiting straight, as there was no numbers given or names taken by the host. It was chaotic and cramped inside the small space. So the strategy is to show your face, grab a drink, wait in the open air with the rest of the herd and have faith they will remember you when a table is ready.My second lesson is that take out is not as good as eating in. Seeing the wait, we opted for take out which takes about 20 minutes and elbowing your way back and forth through the crowd. The pizza crust was buttery and light, the sauce tangy with large pieces of mushroom and a thick layer of cheese to seal everything in. Unfortunately, the deliciousness doesn&#39;t translate through when cold. The cheese congeals into a rubbery slab that refuses to integrate with anything else. Lessons learnt for next time: plan better, wait longer and eat there instead."

I dragged a couple of my friends to this place a few weeks ago, and although some were skeptical, each and every one of us loved this whole experience! From the waiter flipping each and every pizza, to being able to customize our pies (mushroom vs no mushroom, veggie or meat sauce, wheat or white crust) to our specifications.The pies were perfectly made and seasoned--the crust was chewy, but crisp. The sauce was flavorful, hearty, and perfectly balanced. The ingredients are quality, and it is something that you definitely can taste! The mushrooms were DELICIOUS, and so fresh. Their fresh, homemade Italian seasoning is TO DIE FOR. You have to try it with your pizza!The only thing I have to comment is that they only take cash, which is really a bummer. And, on normal nights, they&#39;re usually PACKED. Call ahead of time to check the wait, for sure!"

This was our first visit and after hearing and reading about the crazy wait times we decided to come right at 11:30am when they opened. Little did we know that the place was already packed! We entered at 11:20am and the 99% of the seating was taken but we were fortunate to get a tiny booth that seated four adults. According to Tyler, due to the demand, the restaurant has been allowing customers in by 11am. By the time it was 11:40am, FORGET ABOUT getting a table. Wait times immediately became 1-1.5 hours.Food wise we ordered the Mediterranean bread, salad and one pizza. The Mediterranean bread is raved by many but we didn&#39;t Think it was anything special. Bread with some Italian seasoning for $8 was a bit steep but it was a large portion. The salad was standard but their house made dressing was AMAZING. The pizzas were super cheesy and very delicious. It&#39;s heavy due to the dough and slobs of cheese but oh so good! Good food and great service by Tyler, as I wrote his review the wife and I are back for the second visit."

Its not easy finding this place if you haven&#39;t been here before or don&#39;t have a gps. But once you find it, you&#39;ll wonder how you&#39;ve ever lived without it or not knowing about its existence . It certainly a gem that needs to be discovered by every single person.When you walk in to the institution your greeted by a host who grabs you a table. If theres a wait for a table you can grab a drink at the bar and chill there till its your turn to get seated.All the staff that work there are absolutely amazing. Really nice, polite and helpful with suggesting whats good and popular.On to the legendary pizza pot pie which is the main reason you wanna come here for. Its stellar!!!! The flaky buttery crust is the perfect thickness that melts in your mouth. The ooowy goowy cheese with the 8hour simmered, made from scratch sauce they put inside is so incredible! The whole mushrooms that go inside are just a delicacy that i cant imagine life without. Its absolutely the most comforting meal you can have in a package similar to a composite of pizza.If your in the mood for a pizza that you cant get anywhere else in the world, come and give this place a try, it&#39;ll leave an imprint on you that you wont ever forget.

The food here was just AMAZING...drool...We ended up having the Mediterranean Flat Bread and the Pizza Pot Pie. Both were just out of this world and full of flavor! So if you&#39;re or live in Chicago and haven&#39;t been yet, do yourself a favor and put it on your list of things to do. The only down side is the wait is ridiculously long. The place it&#39;s self is really small, in the basement of a building, so it gets really hot in there and crowded. The average wait time was about 45mins-1.5hrs, but well worth the wait!

A Chicago treasure that is loved by many. There is something amazingly charming and humbling about this restaurant. I feel like this place has remained constant through the ever changing ways of society and I find that incredibly authentic.I recommend coming earlier or on an off dinner or lunch time. Be prepared to wait. You can wait up to two hours for a table, this restaurant is pretty small. The maitre d is one of the most interesting people I&#39;ve ever encountered. When you arrive, let him that you want a table and the amount of people you are dining with. That&#39;s it. No name, no number. He&#39;ll remember you. Trust him. Trust the system. The pizza is worth the wait. But grab a snack before you come and grab a drink at the bar while you are there.The pizza. Oh the pizza. I&#39;ve never had a pizza pot pie before I tried Chicago Pizza Company, but I think this my favorite way to eat it aside from thin crust. Sorry deep dish, but you&#39;re not as wonderful as people describe. It&#39;s cooked upside down, as in they put cheese then sauce then dough atop little ramekins. The waiter or waitress brings the little concoctions to your table then flips them right side up onto your dish. Pretty cool.I recommend a half pound per person. You will get full. They have a meat and veggie option which you can then add full-size button mushrooms to your pie. If you like the shrooms, add them it&#39;s so good. For an appetizer, the Mediterranean bread is awesome. It&#39;s so large it overflows the plate.If you are looking for a nostalgic classic Chicago restaurant, look no further than Chicago Pizza And Oven Grinder Company."

Between me and two friends, we shared the Country French Salad, Mediterranean Bread, and the one-pounder Pizza Pot Pie. The salad wasn&#39;t super impressive or anything, but it came with a tasty sour cream dressing. The Mediterranean Bread on the other hand was so good, although it was bigger than the plate it came on and leaned onto the table. Why they don&#39;t get bigger plates, I do not know.Finally came the pizza pot pie. I was actually super excited for this because I&#39;ve never had anything like it, but was very underwhelmed after finishing it. After taking my first bite, I noticed that the cheese after the first layer was unmelted, to the point where I could separate slice from slice. The meat sauce was pretty good. The mushroom wasn&#39;t cut, so I couldn&#39;t eat it with the pizza.In the end, each of us paid about $19. **Keep in mind, this place is CASH ONLY!!"

Cash only.Mic drop, so you&#39;re just eating boiled ground pork in sauce (at least that&#39;s what it tasted like to me), unpleasant, but the whole pizza pot pie idea is cute. Take a bowl, layer the bottom with cheese, add the sauce, and pop the dough on top and bake. Once it comes out, flip it out onto a plate, and chow down.Back to the the beginning. The wait in a Friday evening around 5:30PM was 30-40 mins. Just let the maiter&#39;d, guy in the red shirt, know how many in your group, he&#39;ll let you know how long, and remember your face. No names, so if you&#39;re undercover you won&#39;t need an undercover name, but you may need a disguise.Ordered the Mediterranean bread to start. It&#39;s finger food draped onto the table. Don&#39;t be afraid to make a mess. They&#39;ll wipe it off. Tasty, herby, but could use some dipping sauce or stringy cheese. There&#39;s only one pot pie pizza on the menu but you can get it mushroom-less or meat-less. Chocolate came with the check.The service was impeccable. We got a cheery chap that was helpful and patient. The booth style was cozy, though if you have long legs, may pose as a challenge. Ordering three separate pot pie pizzas was certainly more expensive than ordering a whole pizza at one of the other touristy destinations. Certainly fresh, but doesn&#39;t guarantee tasty. They had grinders (aka sandwiches) that sounded really good."

It&#39;s unique, it&#39;s fun, and a clever spin for a city that loves pizza! For me, the concept is really the highlight because the actual product was only average. The only option for ingredients inside the &#34;pizza pie&#34; is either vegetarian or pork meat sauce and with or without mushroom (3 whole button mushrooms shoved inside the pot pie). Some may appreciate this because it makes the choice easy but then for others like me, I felt limited.When the pot pie pizza arrived, it was steaming and the dough was oh so soft! There&#39;s a good layer of cheese and the meat sauce was pretty tasty. The pork was literally ground pork - not &#34;sausage&#34; so this whole thing reminded me more of a lasagna than pizza. While the meal satisfied my hunger, this is not a meal that I&#39;d ever crave or would want to bring any of my &#34;foodie&#34; friends to since the flavors were nothing to rave about but I could see how tourists would love to experience the novelty concept of a &#34;pizza pot pie&#34;."

The place was nostalgic and cozy. Do not come here if you are in a hurry, there is always a waitlist. We waited for an hour and 45 minutes for a table and it was during the week. Can&#39;t even imagine how the weekends get. The guys ordered a Pizza Pie and Margherita Bread. They said they were good but nothing too special. (I couldn&#39;t have them since they weren&#39;t gluten free) the server was nice enough to bring me a Pizza Pie minus the gluten so essentially it was the meatballs and cheese that are in the the pie. So I was able to try it and I also agree that it was good but nothing to rave about. I feel like this place is one of those, I did it for the experience and not so much the food, kind of deals. I think the video hyped up the Pizza Pie but the taste didn&#39;t deliver."

But not enough for me. Next time I&#39;m getting the 1 pounder.This place is definitely unique when it comes to Chicago&#39;s pizza scene.

I waited an hour and this was 45 minutes after they opened. It was well worth it.  The waiter was one of the best. Very helpful and a great sense of humor. The antipasto appetizer was something special without a doubt. I ordered the 1/2 pound pizza pot pie. I haven&#39;t had anything so amazing since Gordon&#39;s Ramsay&#39;s steak house in Las Vegas. This place is the best hidden gem I have had the pleasure of eating at! The prices are great!! I will fly from California again just to come back here. This place is completely out-of-bounds!!!!!!!

The service is what it is; I haven&#39;t ever had outright BAD service here, especially considering how busy they get, so as long as you know the wait times for the pizzas and your server brings you beverages when you need them, I don&#39;t know what more you could ask for.And hey, while you&#39;re waiting, the Mediterranean Bread is delicious too, especially with plenty of the restaurant&#39;s homemade seasoning."

We arrived 5 minutes before it opened and there was already an hour wait!  The host doesn&#39;t take names, he just remembers the order that people pour into this restaurant. I have to admit I was super skeptical of this so called system but he didn&#39;t disappoint!Me and my 2 girlfriends ordered the Mediterranean bread which is full of flavor and you have to try all the sauces they offer. Their dressings are oily and magical. I loved trying all the filling combinations.  We ordered 2 pizza pot pies, one with mushrooms and one without. The mushrooms are whole, so be sure you like them before you commit.  They bring them fresh out of the oven and spoon the pot pie out of the bowl right at your table. The cheese oozes out and the crust is incredible.  Our leftovers even tasted great!You might be tempted to walk away when you see the crowd and hear the wait time, but I promise you will not be disappointed."

The 45 minute wait in the beginning went fast, as we were excited to get in and get our food, but the 30 minute wait for our pizza pot pies to be cooked felt much longer. With how crowded the place was, one would think they would have a constant flow of food into the oven instead of it all being &#34;made to order&#34; even though they are all the same. It also took an extra half hour for the server to get our money and bring back change.The pot pies were good, but a little over &#34;hyped&#34; from other Yelp reviews.It&#39;s definitely worth the experience, but I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s somewhere I will be making a regular stop while in Lincoln park."

If you&#39;re coming with a group of 15-20, forget about it unless you want to split up. I&#39;d say cap it at 8, there was one table for 10-11. And if you have a big group,  make sure one person comes here 30-60 minutes before to hold your spot in line.2) The sign for the restaurant is not huge, so as soon as you get 0.25 miles near the restaurant, start scanning for it on the first floor of an apartment building. Better yet, look for &#39;Riccardo Enoteca&#39; which has a huge green sign and look directly across and you&#39;ll find this place.3) You will need to open three doors to reach the short sorta old waitlist man (do not stand in the first room thinking he will come to you!!). It gets more and more crowded as you open each door. After you open the third door, wait for the short man to come by and make eye contact with him and tell him &#34;I&#39;m new&#34; and he&#39;ll ask &#34;how many&#34; and you&#39;ll reply &#34;6&#34; and he&#39;ll say &#34;okay 1 hour and 40 minute wait, wait at the bar or close to the entrance&#34; and then you&#39;ll start to wonder why he hasn&#39;t written your name down on the waitlist until a regular standing by will tell you &#34;this is how it works here, he memorizes your face and has a mental waitlist&#34;.... and now you wait, wait and wait until the genius man tells you your table is ready.4) if it wasn&#39;t clear in number 3, I waited 10 minutes to put myself on the waitlist.4) Parking. there is valet parking for $10 but why would you do that if you can park on Clark for free. No joke, the street this restaurant is on has free parking and a couple blocks nearby have it as well. I uploaded a picture of a map that shows free parking in green on Saturday night.5) This place is slammed from 6-9 on Saturday nights. You better be okay with having people all around you while you wait and be willing to walk through a crowd when you enter and exit. In other words, if you have claustrophobia, avoid this place during extreme busy hours. Call ahead to find out!6) The pot pie was definitely good. But, sadly, I have to say that there are better pizza options in Chicago and the greater area. I will never ever come here if the wait is 2 hours long. 30 minutes is okay bc it will give me time to mingle with friends, anything above 1 hour is enough for me to choose elsewhere. While we were waiting in line, people were telling us it&#39;s totally worth the wait and that we&#39;ll love it... so I guess it&#39;s on you and depends on what style pizza you like.7) Everything about this place is unique. It&#39;s special in it&#39;s own way and can&#39;t be compared to deep dish. I&#39;ll probably visit this place once a year, but it was &#34;one and done&#34; for my friends who came here. Again, there are a plethora of pizza restaurants in Chicago, and many of them are much cheaper then the $18/person you&#39;ll pay here.8) The negatives:- No jalapeños!!! Huge downside for me. The only spice you can add are the crushed peppers or tabasco sauce- Our Mediterranean bread was touching the table, anyone who is in the health field knows how nasty that is (our phones, wallets/purses were in the center of the table until the waiter asked us to move it). Why can&#39;t they get bigger plates?- the price. $13 for the half pounder alone. add in the appetizer and drink and you&#39;re looking at $18 easily without tip. If you&#39;re a hungry man, a one pounder is $25 which is more expensive then a deep dish pizza at peqouds that serves 4.- cash only9) No matter what I say on here, or what anyone else says, this place is banking and consistently busy. You should give it a shot to formulate your own opinion.m"

It was an hour wait, which wasn&#39;t bad compared to what I&#39;ve heard. It was Sunday at 6pm.We tried a Mediterranean bread. I thought it was ok. It needed something. Maybe dipping sauce? HahaThe pizza pot pie was great. 5 stars for originality. My only complaint was that the sauce tasted more like pasta sauce than pizza sauce, but really, it was good! It&#39;s definitely worth the wait to try it out at least once. Service was also great for how busy they were.  Everyone that worked there was busting their tail making everyone happy."

After another 15 mins we were told that we needed a bigger table because we had a &#34;bigger&#34; person with us. So it would be a minimum of 30 - 45 mins more. So after standing outside for over 2 hours and being told what we were told we left.So if tou5 are going here make sure you have a big party and are not overweight.

There was a generous amount of cheese and some sauce and whole mushrooms (some were cut) underneath. The flavors were just okay. There was nothing too spectacular about the sauce. I did enjoy the cheese a lot. The bread was also just okay. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d try this pizza and wait in line for it. However, it was tasty...just not amazing."

It was busy and we were told it would be an hour and forty minute wait. The difference in their system is that your name is not taken. Their hosts remembers faces and will come to grab you once your table is ready, a little unsettling for customers. The wait time actually ended up being quite a bit longer (for us it was 2.5 hours. Were we actually in the right seating order we should have been? We&#39;ll never know.) but you can grab drinks at the bar and bring them back out while you wait.We ordered the Mediterranean bread and a 1 lb. pizza pot pie for 3 people to share. The bread is AMAZING. You can choose white or wheat bread and the seasoning mix they top it with is plentiful and delicious. The pizza pot pie in my opinion was just ok. Flavor wise it wasn&#39;t anything I could see myself craving. The sauce is more of a bolognese style (which my friend really loved) and the mushrooms where whole and large, baked right into the pizza. With having the bread first, I think 3 people sharing the larger pot pie was plenty of food.I definitely would not come back for to the wait again (but would be more inclined to if there were a more traditional wait system). I did find out that they take call in orders that you can pick up at the bar. I would do that for the Mediterranean bread!"

Chicago is a city that hails some of the best pizza in America.  Most people equate deep dish when they think of pizza in Chicago, but this gorgeous and world class city offers something you&#39;d be hard pressed to find anywhere else.  What could that be????  A pizza pot pie!That&#39;s where Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Company comes in.  So, what exactly is a pizza pot pie?  Imagine a bowl made of the softest, most tastiest dough, filled with fresh ingredients and topped with oh so much cheese!  According to their website: &#34;The Pizza Pot Pie is an individual serving, &#34;made from scratch&#34; with triple-raised Sicilian bread-type dough; a homemade sauce consisting of olive oil, fresh garlic, onions, green peppers, whole plum tomatoes and a special blend of cheeses; and doorknob-size, whole, fresh mushrooms.&#34; These heavenly creations come in a half pound or one pound size.  Yes, pound. A half pound will comfortably feed the hungriest of the hungry and the pound is great for parties of two or more.Since I don&#39;t eat pork, I always order the Vegetarian: Tomato sauce, brick and Swiss cheese, eggplant, onions, olives, mushrooms, red and green peppers, Romano cheese, garlic oil and Italian spices.Also, the pizza&#39;s do take a while, which is why I would highly recommend ordering the Mediterranean bread which can comfortably serve 2-4 people.  I genuinely believe it is something that shouldn&#39;t be missed.This meal is pretty decadent but so worth the splurge.  Also, they&#39;re CASH ONLY!!!"

First of all let me just start of by tell you the way you get a table is very chaotic. There was a long line out the door halfway down the block and after waiting in this line for about 15-20 min we make our way in to the building only to find out this line was to just put our name on the list. BUT the catch is they don&#39;t take your name or give you a number or give you any type of pager. The guy simply says it would be 1 1/2 hour wait and I&#39;ll come find you. This boggled my mind. How is this one guy going to remember the order of who goes next and come and find you. With all that being said we waited 1 hour and 45 min and then after asking him how much longer he said 30 more min which only ended up being about 15min so a total of 2 hours just to Be seated. With ALL that said just go prepared to wait 2 hours and not try to understand their system of seating people because it will NEVER make sense.Now on to the food! With all that waiting was it worth it? The pizza pot pie was very unique and quite delicious.  Not sure if it was worth a 3 hour wait which is how long we waited all together from the time we got there and actually received our food. I think it&#39;s worth about 1 1/2 hour wait. They have some amazing garlic herb flatbread that was amazing and we highly recommend it as an appetizer.I would go back but choose a time that wasn&#39;t so busy where we didn&#39;t have to wait as long. If you do go during a busy time just be  prepared to wait. Over all I would recommend this very unique type of pizza place.

You may be waiting a while- The staff wasn&#39;t the friendliest. They just wanted to keep things moving; They seemed rushed.- The Mediterranean bread was essentially a hugeeeee garlic pita bread. Twas good, but be warned...ITS HUGE. We shared it between 2 people and it was more than enough- The pizza itself is baked upside down and when they come to your table, they flip it over for you. It&#39;s FILLED with cheese. You don&#39;t really get to customize what&#39;s in it. It&#39;s only available with certain toppings and you can only remove items. The taste itself was underwhelming. It was your standard pizza with a whole lot of cheese made a little differently.Overall I&#39;m glad I tried it, but I wouldn&#39;t come back. More of a tourist trap."

The pizza looks cute since it&#39;s shaped like a bowl and melty cheese on top.  Flavor wise, taste just like a regular pizza. Texture of the sauce was too watery for me because of the whole mushroom inside it. Mushrooms let out a decent amount of water when heated, so baking it inside the marinara sauce would just make it thinner....Mediterranean bread: pesto basil and cheese is thinly spread on the flat bread, and was ok. Would be better if it comes  with a side of sauce for dipping, instead of having to order another starter on the menu to go with it (as recommended by the restaurant).Rum Gelato: tasted like pistachio flavored gelato. And there seemed to be crushed nuts on top. Pretty good."

Perhaps the best thing I tasted was actually the seasonal cocktail - the Adam&#39;s Apple (a confection of red wine, brandy, cider, cinnamon, and raisins) which essentially tastes like a liquid cinnamon roll. It was beautiful on a cold winter night.The pizza pot pie is rightly famous and it&#39;s a somewhat unique, fun dish. The oven grinders (aka sandwiches) were a bit more run of the mill. We had the sausage, which had very nice meats but was a little overwhelming. As one might expect, portions run large.Go just after the holidays or in bad weather for better luck getting a table - apparently the wait can be hours, but we walked in on a Thursday in January and were seated immediately."

The pizza looks amazing, it is something that people see pictures of and think, &#34;I HAVE to eat that.&#34; but if you do, plan on waiting around 2 hours no matter what day of the week or time it is. Good for you guys, you have a real gold mine there. The pizza is pretty cool, not the greatest thing of my life, but if you put a decent bolognese in a fresh baked bread bowl with cheese and mushrooms, you really can&#39;t lose.Service was kind of curt, not impolite, but not really welcoming either. I understand they&#39;ve done their spiel 40 times that night, and a few thousand in the last couple months, but it was a new experience for me and after waiting for hours, I kind of wanted the server to be more excited for us.We had the antipasto, which was a really nice spread, two pizza pie/bowls, and skipped dessert (the food is very filling!) and were out in about a half hour. I liked the food, and might go back if there was no wait, but it didn&#39;t give me the addiction that would make me wait for hours to have it again."

We did wait for roughly 1.5hrs but it&#39;s totally worth it. We were nervous because the host doesn&#39;t write names down, he just finds you when it&#39;s your turn. How can someone remember an order of people 1.5 hours long?? But he did! While we waited we sat outside and enjoyed the weather. Luckily it was nice out. Once we were seating we both ordered the pizza. It takes about 45 mins to cook so order quickly if you are hungry. Once it came out, it was amazing! However, to me, it wasn&#39;t pizza. More of a pizza casserole. Still worth it! Next time we will get the mediterranean bread. We saw a lot of people ordering this and it looked like the best combination of garlic bread and pita. Everyone from chicago needs to go to this restaurant at least once. It&#39;s now one of my favorite crave spots."

I went on in and the place was empty. I asked if they were open yet and the bartender said they would be open shortly. However, as soon as I walked in, a crowd of people followed me in. My boyfriend actually made fun of my because I am an airhead and didn&#39;t see the sign on the door that said it opened at 4pm. Whoops.So the establishment wound up opening 1 hour earlier than expected because there was already HUGE line at the door.They do not take reservations- so I suggest coming around the time they open just for this reason.We were seated right away and were given a gigantic menu.Of course I came for two things- the salad and pizza pot pie.The service was phenomenal. We told or waiter we were in a rush and happily accommodated us.The salad was just EPIC. Super fresh and the two dressings it came with was literally to die for! I will just come back for the salad alone because it was amazing.Our pot pies took about 45 mins to make. My boyfriend was beyond impressed with it because he didn&#39;t know what to expect.The pizza was very good too--cheese, sauce--- everything. I only had a couple of bites because I was so stuffed from overindulging in the salad but it was worth it.I would absolutely visit this place again if I am In the area again.The food was a solid 4 stars, but the service and opening an hour earlier because I can&#39;t read made me feel like it was absolutely necessary to give them 5 stars."

Ben.Well, the first thing about this place that I didn&#39;t like was that the host said there was an hour wait, so as I stormed out of the place, cursing left and right, my cool friend Aaron (that&#39;s me) politely asked how long the real wait was.. and we got seated right away.Second: thing about this place that sucks, dim lighting. It was way too hard to scout out any talent in the joint, know what I&#39;m saying!?!Third: the bathroom was way too small for my butt. Now ladies, I&#39;m not that big of a guy, but I don&#39;t understand how these large Sacilian men do it.Fourth: CASH ONLY. Clearly this place has got some ties to the Mafia. I mean the entire thing reeks of a money laundering operation. From the fact that they don&#39;t tell you it&#39;s cash only, to the the ATM with the three dollar service fee. It&#39;s like, at least let me know when I&#39;m being stuck up.Long story short, this joint is like the prettiest girl in highschool; she knows that she can get whoever she wants, and therefore she definitely doesn&#39;t &#34;need&#34; YOU.That was Ben&#39;s perspective. Now if you want my take, this place is a classic Chicago staple restaurant. The place has a ton of character and the food is phenomenal, just come 20 before it opens or else you&#39;re gonna wait.You have been warned"

Ever since this place become popular with TV sitings the quality has dropped and the wait time is ridiculous. There is a host that does not write names down but I think he secretly goes in the back to write your name down. Cash only!!! we waited 2 hours for a table for 2. The pot pie is not as filling as you think unless you love bread but the sauce is basically marinara tossed with some ground meat... basically spaghetti sauce a few mushrooms and baked cheese.... not worth it in my book in a city full of fantastic pizza options. The mediterranean bread is pretty good and you can choose between whole grain or white... hence the 2 stars. I highly doubt i&#39;ll ever come back. Wait staff also forgot about us and served 3 other tables after he sat us down without any accommodation which is disappointing considering we waited over 2 hours for a table and then had to wake another 30 minutes to order.. just more reason to not return.

It&#39;s like someone just threw a huge slab of rolling fat onto a plate. I have issues with this. It also made the table extremely flaky and there was parmesan everywhere. There were cheese circles on the table when they lifted the plates away.[-1] They was an issue with dishware that was maybe grating on me near the end of the day.S A L A D[+1] Their salad, on the other hand, was amazing.

They weren&#39;t bad by any means - just not worth waiting two hours for (or the hefty price tag).I&#39;d say the salad was actually better than the pizza pot pies - it resembled an antipasto and was HUGE!If you&#39;re looking for a great Chicago pizza experience, you&#39;d be better off at one of the classic deep dish eateries (some of which even take reservations)."

The waitstaff was very friendly, they always made sure we had water in our cups and asked if we needed anything. ( I strongly dislike restaurants that forget you after you&#39;ve been seated.)Now on the the food, I ordered the vegetarian pizza pot pie with white dough. (They do have the option for wheat as well.)The pizza was delicious, the sauce had just enough flavor and the cheese was so gooey and delicious. My only complaint was there weren&#39;t enough mushrooms inside, but I&#39;m sure I can request more on my next visit.Overall I had a pleasant dining experience and will be back."

Waited 2+ hours on a Tuesday so I expected some BOMB food, didn&#39;t happen.SERVICE:The seating and waiting method was archaic and inefficient. You go give an old man your name and he will memorize your face and call you when you&#39;re ready. He doesn&#39;t write anything down. There aren&#39;t buzzers like there are at other popular places such as Giordanos or The Cheesecake Factory. He does not remember as well as he should&#39;ve. I saw groups of two (same size as mine) put in their names later than we did and get in faster. When we asked after waiting 2 hours, he told us that we were next and asked to confirm if we were a group of 4. We weren&#39;t. In fact, I was a bit put off that he mistook us for another group because that means that he doesn&#39;t actually remember some people even though he should! Also, I don&#39;t like to drop the race card, but the only other Asians that had been waiting as long as we did were indeed in a group of 4. This means that we were bypassed many times by other group of 2&#39;s because he didn&#39;t remember us being a group of 2. It was humid, there was no place to sit or wait so we continued to suffer a little while longer. Eventually we made it in and that was a flop too.It would&#39;ve been okay if the food actually lived up to its standards...FOOD / STAFF:The pizza pot pie was not bad by any means. It was good. I&#39;d come again if I didn&#39;t have to wait, but it&#39;s just not worth the hype. The Mediterranean Bread was large and very filling for 2. It was seasoned well, but nothing mind blowing. It was just an oversized pita bread with a bunch of herbs and cheese thrown on it. Ehhh. Decent. The actual potpies were very filling as well. The cheese was abundant, My fork and knife made cheese bridges worthy of food porn, but that was about it. I heard raves about the sauce and I just didn&#39;t think it was as good as the reviews said. It contains homemade sausages but it wasn&#39;t really anything that stood out while I was eating. I didn&#39;t get mushrooms on mine, but my boyfriend did. He got like 3 so it wasn&#39;t like the mushrooms made a difference in the meal. Last but not least, the dough. That&#39;s what it was. Dough. It was cooked but it still tasted and had the same texture as dough. I wanted something more. Maybe crispy or bread-like. I don&#39;t know. I just didn&#39;t want something so doughy and chewy. It wasn&#39;t my cup of tea and precisely why I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll wait another 2 hours to come back.The server also wasn&#39;t personable. She was bland and just wanted to get everything done and over with so I didn&#39;t feel welcomed or warm. The whole meal felt like a business transaction despite the location having a cozy ambiance. It was strictly business. Eat. Pay. Get out. There&#39;s just so much hype around this place that I had higher expectations from the notorious seater to the good food, this place just fell flat. Would not recommend unless someone really wanted to just try this place out for the experience."

The atmosphere is charming, and the wait staff is very friendly. But there are a few quirks about this place you should be aware of if you&#39;re going to make Chicago Pizza &amp; Oven Grinder part of your evening plans.First, don&#39;t be in a hurry. Plan to make an evening of it. Dinner here will likely eat up a few hours at least. Bring a friend and anticipate a lot of time to sit and chat. If you come alone, just allow yourself to be in the moment and enjoy.I recommend arriving as early as possible as this place seems to be quite popular, and wait times grow exponentially as the dinner hour goes on.Be aware that they don&#39;t have a traditional wait list. I don&#39;t know how they manage things without taking anyone&#39;s name or utilizing any kind of pager alert system, but they do. When I arrived among the hordes of eager diners and asked to get on the waiting list, they simply told me the wait time (which was substantial) and said I could wait at the bar until a table was ready for me. It wasn&#39;t until I was sitting contentedly at the very crowded bar that it occurred to me the host didn&#39;t even take my name or anything. I learned this was normal and decided to just have patience and faith in their unconventional methods, though I was concerned I might get lost in the crowd. But the patience paid off; they took care of me.Something else you should be prepared for is their CASH ONLY policy. So don&#39;t come in expecting to toss around some plastic. Bring bills.I ordered a pizza pot pie with mushrooms, meat sauce, and white crust. It was cheesy and delicious when it finally arrived (again, don&#39;t be in a rush). They bring it out and flip the bowl over onto your plate in front of you. While I was waiting for my pot pie, I munched on their Mediterranean Bread creation, which is basically a giant, Italian-style, naan-like flatbread. It&#39;s supposedly one of the most popular items on the menu and is definitely an item portioned for sharing. It&#39;s tasty as well as handy for sopping up any extra sauce from the pot pie. In my opinion, it would go well served with a small dish of pizza sauce to dip in."

Some of the best I&#39;ve had in the city. Nashville hot is great, as well as their standard recipe. Biscuits are gigantic and out of this world. Combine them, and you get some delicious chicken sandwiches. Breakfast is also A+ if you manage to roll out of bed in time on the weekend.Menu is short and simple, as they stick to what they do well. Sides and desserts are traditional comfort food and well done.One drawback: As others have mentioned, it&#39;ll take a little while even when the place isn&#39;t busy because they fry to order. This combined with the fact that it *does* get busy means that you can be waiting for a while on a Friday or Saturday night. It&#39;s a relatively tiny space, which compounds the issue. I think you can call ahead, which I haven&#39;t tried but I&#39;d recommend."

Even though it wasn&#39;t written on the menu, they said the peach cobbler wasn&#39;t available until 11am (FYI for people wanting pie for breakfast because that&#39;s how we like to roll). We both ordered spicy chicken sandwiches which came topped with some cucumber coleslaw on a delicious biscuit. The sandwiches were great with the perfect amount of spice.I&#39;d give this place five stars, but they said the mac n cheese wasn&#39;t ready yet only after we already ordered it. They asked if we were willing to wait and since I heard such great things about the mac n cheese, we waited, but the mac n cheese they gave us was lukewarm. I was expecting it to be hot out of the oven since we had to wait, but I was definitely disappointed. I guess I would suggest going after 11am, unless you only want the items on the breakfast menu. Besides not getting the pie and satisfying mac n cheese, it was tasty food in a nice hipster joint. Oh, we also appreciated the Time Out Chicago magazines on the tables since we were looking for things to do that day."

Roost in North Center has a small little storefront on Irving Park and I passed by so many times with intentions of stopping in. Fortunately, earlier this year I was finally able to.I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich which had nice heat with a good kick to it. I appreciate that their spicy chicken was actually spicy. The biscuit it was served on was fantastic. The sides of mac n cheese and chips were good, although not as good as the sandwich. I decided to get the cobbler for dessert and honestly, the cobbler was expendable, but everything else was a solid 4.My one primary issue, other than the cobbler, was that my sandwich was so messy and crumbly that it essentially became a knife and fork dish, which isn&#39;t my preference when ordering a sandwich. But I&#39;m not gonna complain too much because the chicken and biscuit were tasty.Roost is a small store so expect communal and close seating to your neighbors. Also, even though it&#39;s counter service, they make everything to order, so expect a regular &#34;restaurant&#34; wait time after placing your order (i.e. 15 -20 minutes).I enjoyed my meal at Roost and would definitely recommend it if you&#39;re on the north side of town and needing a fried chicken fix."

Great mac &amp; cheese--they add a lot of pepper to it which gives it a special touch. Just a side of this could be a small meal!!I had the spicy chicken sandwich which comes on a fresh biscuit bun. The chicken was succulent and very flavorful. The biscuit flavor was on-point but was a bit too flaky to hold on to such a big sammy...it crumbled quite a bit. Better that than the other way around though.Our order took over 40 minutes and many people who ordered after us got their food before us. I think they lost our order or something of that nature. So the wait sucked big time especially watching everyone else eat!!!!

It&#39;s funny because most people think I&#39;m crazy because I don&#39;t like dark meat.

The biscuits that everyone raves about was just a biscuit.  Very dry and not much flavor.  The Mac &amp; cheese was cheesy, but once again not much flavor.Overall I would probably give this restaurant only 2 1/2 stars."

Customer service is terrible and I can find good food anywhere so I will be going elsewhere.It all started on New Years when I ordered using their online service and was charged for a meal that I could not eat. Not to mention I waited an the 45 minutes of time that was suggested by the website. To resolve this I called 2 days later when they were open and spoke to someone who said he was a manager (barely spoke English) but never followed up or did anything to help my frustrations. I had to call again the next day to speak to another manager only to find out that I still hadn&#39;t been compensated for the money I spent. He apologized and gave me 2 free sides for my trouble.From this point on, I refused to use their online service to order my food anymore. My personal solution was is to call. In faceted I called in order last week but for some reason today they told me they stopped taking phone orders 2 months ago. I reluctantly TRIED to order online but their website doesn&#39;t allow for cash transactions and GrubHub would not allow for me to pick Mac and cheese and bread pudding as a side. I called back to hear the person on the other line undermine my intelligence by telling me she just received an order from grub with those options on it.

The food might be great but we will never know. Why offer delivery and why would it show up on our GrubHub as available if you are not delivering to our area? Apparently Roost works with a third party delivery company and that third party didn&#39;t want to drive the 10 mins north of the restaurant. GrubHub is baffled. We are baffled.

Hipster chicken places that you want to hate because they&#39;re so trendy--until you actually taste it and it heals your soul.Roost is making their own buttermilk biscuits, fried chicken (strips or bone-in or sandwiches) and the all the appropriate accouterments (mac &amp; cheese) like it&#39;s their artistic mission in life. The biscuits are exactly right--light enough to cut in half with no trouble, strong enough be an important part of the overall flavor of each bite.Yeah, if you order at the counter you have to wait almost table-service times (10-15 mins), but this is because they are personally frying goodness just for you. I&#39;m going to try not to break down into little tears of joy.My only complaint? Why not serve their breakfast chicken biscuits all day?

I&#39;ve pretty much eaten everything on The Roost&#39;s menu and I&#39;ve never once been disappointed.The sandwiches are great, but nothing beats good old fashioned fried chicken. I always get Nashville Hot or Spicy. Mexican Coke is a nice added touch. It&#39;s weird that I&#39;ve been eating here throughout their mac and cheese evolution. My first time eating here, the mac was very basic and came in a plastic container. Now, the mac has a spicy kick to it and comes in a tinfoil container that&#39;s convenient for oven reheating.Ordered delivery from them a couple nights ago.

My only complaint is the chicken isn&#39;t super crispy. I was then told that Carolina style normally isn&#39;t. So, I wasn&#39;t super wow&#39;d because I was expecting that crispy chicken. I don&#39;t like the soggy crust and biscuit all meshing together. Flavor is there though, 100% Then I had the Mac and cheese and chips. Both has great spice to them.

I can&#39;t really think of a better chicken sandwich now that I mention it.  A very simple menu, very few items, but everything is pretty solid.My main complaint with this place is the service and the wait times, but you have to pardon the wait because it is fresh and they are up front about it.  I would not recommend coming here on a weekend due to the line and the wait.  I may be nitpicking, but when you&#39;ve been standing in line for 10 minutes staring at the same menu board with the same 5 items as everyone else has been staring at, and when they get to the cashier you hear time after time from each of these clueless yuppies in front of you, &#34;what sides do you have?&#34;, you kind of want to hurt someone.  How could you not know after staring at the menu for 10 minutes? Oh Lawwwdyyy!The service is usually just a notch or two below &#34;friendly.&#34; Indifferent is how I would describe most of the attitudes I encounter here.  Although there are a few shining stars here and there that will smile or offer a pleasant tone, that is not usually the norm here.One example:  I went to throw away my bottle cap and a couple napkins and found the trash to be overflowing onto the floor as I made an attempt to place these small items on the top of the heap without them falling over as well.  As I was sitting there, I heard this woman come out and exclaim, &#34;Oh geez, I guess I actually have to empty this trash.  I hate emptying the trash.  I&#39;ve been trying to avoid this all afternoon.&#34; I guess she was talking half to herself, half to her co-workers a few feet away, but as a customer who had to deal with the overflowing heap, it was pretty disappointing and a bit frustrating to hear that this employee had been deliberately avoiding the task throughout the day.As for the food, chicken sandwich with slaw and ranch is out of this world.  Chipotle ranch is just amazing! Mac and cheese seems to vary day to day and is usually on the salty side with a bit of spice.  Chips are good, but way on the salty side.  Desserts are decent, but not great.  Now that you can&#39;t get the desserts as a side with the meal without paying extra, I doubt I will order their dessert in the future.A tip, when they say 20-25 minutes, they mean 25 minutes.  It will not be ready sooner!  I have tried, and it is never ready sooner.  So the 20-25 minute lead time makes it something that you have to plan ahead for if you&#39;re out and about and just randomly think of ordering some food.I would order more often if: wait time was shorter, staff were friendlier, you could still get desserts as sides, they were open later.  That said, I still order regularly and the food is reliably very good quality."

I saw the size of the biscuit through the window and immediately made a detour to get a taste.  It was a bit pricey $2.11, but it is was everything I want in a biscuit.  Buttery, moist while still fluffy, and with a crispy exterior,  Probably not something you should eat everyday, but Lord, I wish I could.I saw they did breakfast, so I ordered take out the very next day. I had the Brittany (Biscuit with boneless spicy fried chicken, fried egg and cheddar) and it was perfect.  The chicken was juicy with a little kick and the egg was perfectly cooked.  I will be stopping in every time I am in the neighborhood and highly recommend others do the same."

Or the people that work there, they are super friendly.I&#39;ve been back a few times since my last review and you know what. They still haven&#39;t figured out order processing. It BLOWS my mind how inefficient it is.I watched three different couriers come in to the restaurant after I had ordered... pick up food for delivery customers and then come back again to to deliver again.Apparently I am a TOTAL FOOL for supporting this place in person because it takes a full HOUR to get food while people are ordering on grubhub and seamless instead get their food hand delivered to their homes 45 minutes after ordering.The solution is so simple, analyze your in person order volume by date and time (you have over a year of data at this point) and restrict online ordering during those times that you can&#39;t handle the volume.Also, having to double check on my order and then having to find out that they &#34;accidentally&#34; must have given it to someone else is not cool.The food however is as good as ever.

I had 4 pieces of the herb seasoned bone-in chicken with sides of a biscuit and coleslaw. At first I thought I ordered too much--but 4 pieces ended up not being too much.

The biscuit was terrific and I liked the the coleslaw along with the cucumber slices. Service was friendly. The made to order chicken takes about 15-20 minutes.

Biscuit when I ordered Kaiser. Wrong side. But the last time I went in was the final nail in the coffin of this relationship.I decided to try their buffalo chicken on a kaiser roll. I saw the guy manning the fryer drop my chicken in. I watched him pull it out. Witnessed the dip in Buffalo sauce. When it arrived and I took a bite, everything was soaked in ice cold sauce. The chicken itself was hot. But the bun was cold, the sauce was cold. Maybe that&#39;s their jam? Maybe they&#39;re different. But it makes no sense to douse a fried hot piece of chicken in cold sauce.It&#39;s a shame to be consistently dissatisfied with a place that has a great rep.

She took the time to not only read my review on Yelp but to read all of my reviews and understand that I&#39;m reasonable and balanced as a customer. She took my feedback to heart and is using it to revamp their processes to ensure that what happened to me doesn&#39;t happen again.She offered to make recompense and has gone above and beyond to be available for my feedback.I still give only 4 stars, because I haven&#39;t actually had the food."

If you do not like pretty spicy food, I would do anything hotter than the original.Biscuits were fabulous and airy and buttery. The only thing I wasn&#39;t a big fan of was the mac n cheese. Not quite what I was hoping for. I wanted thick creamy mac n cheese.I will be back here, but not often or I will have a heart attack."

It does have some spiciness to it, but I was fine with it, and it reminded me of the level of a jalapeno-style spiciness. Guess I should try the original version at Prince&#39;s(where this was inspired from), whenever I revisit Nashville someday?It&#39;s too bad about some of their sides being slightly weak(like I mentioned in my 1st review), since if it wasn&#39;t for that I&#39;d say 5 stars. Still it&#39;s at least 4.75 stars, in my book."

That&#39;s the only way to describe how I feel about this place. Being a transplanted Texan in Chicago, and growing up spending most of my summers in Alabama, I have grown very accustomed to excellent fried chicken. I am very happy to say that I have found what I was missing and longing for, here in Chicago. The Roost is my favorite place to go to get that little taste of home.It&#39;s not little in flavor, but it is little on space. It&#39;s a small joint, so avoid going with a large party.I am in love with their sides of macaroni and peach cobbler, although I&#39;m usually too full to finish it all in one sitting. I always have a doggy bag of cobbler for a snack later on. And the sweet tea! Can&#39;t get enough of it.You absolutely can&#39;t go wrong with your choice of chicken and seasoning. I have yet to try the Nashville hot, but look forward to experiencing it on my next visit. The food isCooked to order, so you may have to wait several minutes to receive your food. Trust me. It&#39;s worth the wait.Get to The Roost as soon as you can, but save a spot for me!"

I have been wanting to come here for a very long time, and I was very happy to finally make it.The inside is very casual with a long communal table and a few individual tables. We ordered a medium quarter dark piece with cole slaw and peach cobbler, and a biscuit sandwich.. Nashville hot! The biscuit was crumbly as advertised, so I ate my sandwich with a knife and fork. The flavors worked very well, and I enjoyed the extra heat. I am not a fan of the painful spice, but this heat added some flavor. The fried chicken was also fantastic. Cole slaw was unique and tasty, but the highlight of the side dishes was the peach cobbler. I did not expect it to be that tasty!Overall, I would give this five stars for great, reasonably priced food.. except it took us 50 minutes to get our food. We came at 5 PM, and were promised a 20 min wait. I understand there were some big call in orders, but the restaurant didn&#39;t look that busy and we were waiting for three pieces of chicken. If we were extremely hungry, this would not have been a good look, but hopefully this day was an aberration."

It was that good.When I came for dinner I had chicken strips (Nashville hot), Mac and cheese, and peach cobbler. The strips were spicy and tender, just like you might find in Nashville or Memphis (places I have visited many times). The Mac and cheese was good but nothing to write home about. The peach cobbler is some of the best I&#39;ve ever had, warm and sweet and fresh tasting.The service was great, the restaurant (Irving Park location) was clean, and they play phenomenal music.

(Mind you, I mean compared to delicious godly dark meat - some people like breast meat.)HOWEVER!  After receiving my feedback, the owner of Roost reached out via Yelp to make things right.  That kind of customer service speaks volumes, so I am happy to return the stars I had knocked off for the previous experience.That all said, I definitely recommend Roost.  The chicken is perfectly seasoned, crispy (perhaps a touch less if delivered, but that&#39;s the nature of the beast) and even the herb-seasoned has a tiny, delightful kick.  The mac and cheese is rich and decadent and gooey, the biscuits are melting with buttery goodness, and the chicken (ESPECIALLY if you get dark meat) is tender and juicy.What more can I ask for?  Oh!  Mashed potatoes and gravy.  But, the sad lack of taters and graves still won&#39;t keep me from coming back to Roost and recommending them again."

The  macaroni and cheese taste like it came from Kraft, and the peach cobbler was slimly. I had takeout. When I came home my biscuit was drenched with the hot sauce and broke apart.

Especially, the juicy, spicy, crispy, delicious chicken we&#39;ve had at Hattie B&#39;s. We had sworn to never have fried chicken again if it wasn&#39;t from Hattie B&#39;s. But after reading the reviews for this place we felt that maybe, just maybe we have found a replica of the chicken we&#39;ve had in Nashville (and b/c they have named one of their flavors Nashville hot). Sad to say we were a bit disappointed. The chicken was not Nashville hot nor it was anything like the chicken we&#39;ve had in Nashville.However, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s fair to this place, we did come here expecting way too much and we shouldn&#39;t have. The chicken here was good, it was way better than poppyes and KFC, so if you&#39;re looking for fresh fried chicken, definitely try this place out.  It was tender, moist, and juicy, not quite as spicy or crispy as I would have liked. The oil that they use definitely needs to be changed more often because we can taste the stale oil. Considering this place has a long wait to order in and a place is extremely small and very busy, I am sure that&#39;s completely affordable. The sides that I tried were mac and cheese and cole slaw, cole slaw was not bad, however, mac and cheese tasted like kraft dinner and not homemade!Prices are not bad and the staff is friendly. Place itself is a small, cute place where while you&#39;re waiting, you have choice of playing chess (neat idea)!

The Nashville hot sandwich is amazing. The chicken inside has a perfect layer of fried coating but the taste of cayenne pepper was extremely strong.

Biscuits are crispy on the outside, creamy and smooth on the inside. I enjoyed the mac and cheese too. Bread pudding was average.I really should stop by again to taste their other non-spicy sandwiches next time!To note: When we went, it took a bit of time for them to get our orders out even though there were only 1-2 people in front of us.

The rest of the food3. The service1.  Excellent overall.  Either bone in and bone out are not greasy with a nice crunch and great flavor.  The Nashville Hot is not too hot (compared with Thai and Korean type heat) and has a pleasant peppery flavor. White breast meat can be dry.2. Mac n cheese has a simple twist with a speckle get of black pepper.  This can make or break it for purists.  It&#39;s different, but I prefer a sharper cheese or horseradish for contrast.  Coleslaw is downright bland, dry and dotted with too much celery seed which gives it a sandy mouthfeel.  Not right.  Peach cobbler is spot on, but again, it&#39;s southern peach cobbler with a pie crust top rather than the crumble which may turn some off.3.  My first visit was great.  There&#39;s really not too much to expect here as it is counter service, but the guy (the owner I suspect as it just opened) was friendly, took our order and fried the chicken as well.  Recently, when I ordered to go, the girl on the phone was rather curt.  After I picked up my order, I called them again to say the order was incorrect and that they gave me spicy when I ordered original, which the online menu states that it&#39;s mild.  She tried to correct me and say that there&#39;s always going to be a bit of spicy on it because of the recipe.  Well someone&#39;s lying or doesn&#39;t know their shizz.Can&#39;t rate it higher because only the chicken was good."

Still, when I took a sip of the sweet tea, I knew I was hooked. A lot of sugar and top quality tea make for a wonderful combination. Not a trace of granulated sugar in the cup, either, which is somewhat miraculous for how sweet this tea was.I also ordered a Stevie, the chicken, egg, bacon and cheddar special.How is this place not 100% full at 10:00 on a Saturday?The fried egg was perfectly runny and the bacon thick, and the slice of cheddar perfectly melted. This is all true, but the biscuit and chicken separately were exemplary.I haven&#39;t had a chicken sandwich with moist, tender chicken like this. The breading provided more than a hint, but not too much, in the way of cayenne (among other spices). It was also crunchy, which is good, because the biscuit is quite soft, actually. And had a strong buttermilk flavor.The sandwich as a whole is probably 4-5&#34; tall, so you get your money&#39;s worth. And from what I can tell, several people ordered ahead for pickup.Fortunately you don&#39;t have to run a 10k to earn these sandwiches... just make a quick trek up to Wrigleyville."

They said it will take 1 hour, is that okay? Coming all the way from Long Grove, I gave in and said ok. Then I said can ya make that 4 meals? The 4 dudes in the back jaws just dropped. So cashier asks tough lady cooking the chicken if that was possible. They whisp whisp whisp and the verdict back to me was you&#39;ll have to wait till 5:30! I said no way!!As I&#39;m waiting for my 2 meals, I noticed other couples were there before me. Sad, they had that whupped look, sitting at the communal bench quietly waiting. 15 minutes later, they get called. That means they must have been there 25 or even 30 minutes for their 2 chicken sandwiches!My observations says these are the causes for the bottleneck -1) Only 3 fryers used for cooking chicken to order.2) More orders going out for delivery than serving dine in customers first.3) 4 staff packed like sardines working in the small open kitchen.4) Wasting time folding clunky cake boxes for chicken orders at cash register.5) Was not cooking chicken ahead of time to anticipate walk-ins.I guess Roost&#39;s chicken was good but so is Brown&#39;s Chicken at half the cost and afraction of the wait time.C&#39;mon people, its just .69 cents a pound chicken, soaking in buttermilk salt &amp; peppa, rolled in flour and cornstarch, then dropped in hot oil for 20 minutes.

You order in the counter and then grab a seat. We came here on a Saturday night and the place was full. But we did grab a seat. All the fried chicken will take about half an hour to fried and prepare. By the time we got our meals was 8:45pm already. I usually do not est so late but we did.The Mac and cheese was just average nothing amazing.We ordered 1/2 fried chicken and a chicken sandwich.The Nashville hot is too spicy that it kinda ruin the flavor of the chicken so I would recommend the spicy one instead. I expected fried chicken to be greasy but I didn&#39;t finish my second piece because I felt like heart burning cause it was hot.It is hole in the wall kind of place and it took us a whole to find a parking on the street because the side streets are permit only.Overall, we enjoy it but I don&#39;t think this will be my go to fried.

This fried isn&#39;t your average fried chicken where pieces aren&#39;t just tossed in a deep fryer and come out bland. This chicken is tender where it comes right off the bone. But what really separates this fried chicken is the delicious choices for seasoning. There are three choices (graded upon spiciness). All levels are equally delicious. The sides are also fantastic. I usually end up getting the bread pudding as a side (YUM) and their biscuits (also YUM).  As for the restaurant itself expect a casual atmosphere perfect for a night out after work or catching up with an old friend.

I love burning my mouth off with hot sauce and this sandwich had great flavor and just the right amount of heat. I was hesitant to try it on a biscuit because I figured it wouldn&#39;t travel so well, and the kaiser roll is sturdier. I&#39;ll order extra pickles next time for sure.Now, the sides. The chips are freshly-made and have a great crunch. The mac and cheese....is why I&#39;m subtracting a star to be honest. It wasn&#39;t spectacular, but not awful, just &#34;meh&#34;.

Everything else varies. I&#39;ve had some good and not so good; although most of it seemed to be a difference in taste buds.I would also recommend the fried chicken with piri piri sauce.

This was on a long list of recommended brunch places our friends picked so we ended up choosing to come here and I&#39;m very glad we did!We got a table for six pretty easily around noon on Sunday. The layout of the restaurant is pretty fun and there are pretty deliberately sectioned off parts of the restaurant. We were ushered to the back right of the establishment. Just glancing at the menu I knew this was probably going to be a great brunch. That, and the fact that there is an &#34;!&#34; in the name of the restaurant makes me expect big things.The menu was big. Like reallllly big. There were breakfast/brunch options on one side, and then more lunch/dinner options on the other. Lots of dishes to choose from. We split three pitchers of sangria between the six of us throughout the brunch and it was delicious. We got the regular house red and the white peach. They don&#39;t put way too much ice in their pitchers like you see at some places, for which everyone was thankful.As for the food, you&#39;d think with a menu so big, everything might be one note and taste the same. That&#39;s definitely what I was expecting going into it. That was not the case AT ALL. We probably sampled 12-14 dishes between the six of us and each dish was unique and had its own flavor.Some standouts for me: The Pan Catalan, bacon mac and cheese, bacon wrapped dates, and the patatas bravas. All of these were incredibly tasty, and something I&#39;d recommend you NEEDING to get while you&#39;re there. I thinkt the patatas bravas was my favorite. I&#39;ve had them done a dozen different ways by different Spanish restaurants, but the sauce they put on them here really stuck out to me. It had a nice spicy kick but wasn&#39;t too much for people who aren&#39;t a huge fan of spice. Just really well done.The only thing I wasn&#39;t crazy about was the shrimp and grits and the paella. The shrimp and grits were a little bland and the paella I thought was just sort of &#34;Meh.&#34; I&#39;m not a huge paella fan so take that with a grain of salt.With all the dishes we had and the sangria, I&#39;m pretty sure we all got out of there for less than $40 a person which was incredible considering we all had our fill of drink, and were stuffed to the brim with food. It&#39;s probably not the first place you think of when you hear &#34;authentic Spanish cuisine&#34; but it&#39;s pretty damn good. Only my second brunch in Chicago but I&#39;d say if you&#39;re looking for some great food and sangria, this is your place."

Both were delicious and I would keep ordering them if my tight pants have enough give for them.Their banana caramelized dessert is also a solid winner.

We also ordered the cured salmon after seeing another party get it. It was like a Spanish version of lox, but tasty nonetheless.I would love to come back and try the other tapas on the menu.

I&#39;ve always sat towards the front of the restaurant and didn&#39;t pay that much attention...the tables are still small as heck though. Good thing that the servers are typically quick to pick up used plates because there&#39;s not a lot of room to place the various tapas that you will undoubtedly order.As for the tapas itself, I can&#39;t think of a single one I&#39;ve tried thus far that I didn&#39;t either like or love. What falls into my love category?1. Baked goat cheese2. Pretty much anything with chorizo in it3. Last but certainly not least, the bacon wrapped dates. I don&#39;t even eat bacon, but I will if it&#39;s wrapped around those dates!I went for weekend brunch and you get to order from both the brunch menu and the regular one. Highly appreciated.Price is reasonable but keep in mind, because these are small plates, and depending on the size of your party, it may take you quite a few to get satiated. In other words, don&#39;t be surprised if your bill falls into the $30-40 range. The one cost-effective tip I&#39;ll give you: if you have a party of 2-3, split a sangria pitcher, instead of going glass by glass. I split a pitcher of red with another person and felt like I got a whole lot of sangria out of that thing...definitely my money&#39;s worth.Ba-ba-reeba is consistent and I&#39;ve yet to have an awful experience. Great place to celebrate a birthday, introduce out of town friends/family to tapas, or have a date."

But the sangria was strong and good."

However the tapas aren&#39;t particularly original and the sangria is lacking. Wish theyd hone the menu down a little and focus on what they do best. The service is slow and they can get very very busy, but the ambiance is fun. We enjoy it but more for the vibe than the food."

Not only because of the flavors and presentation of the food, but also because we surprisingly didn&#39;t break the budget doing it, spending around $20 per person(I was fully expecting to spend twice as much). First thing to note is that this place is gigantic. It has like 5 different rooms, two semi-floors, walls of bread and bundles of ham swinging from the ceiling. They really do try to capture the dim but bustling atmosphere of a restaurant in Barcelona, and in my opinion they do so fairly successfully. Ordered 7 tapas between 3 people, including the warm potato and onion omelette, spicy potatoes with tomato aioli, beef empanada, chicken and ham croquetas, buttermilk-fried chicken thighs, seared Spanish sausages, and skewered chicken + chorizo sausage. All the dishes were good, though my personal favorites were the potato dishes, the croquets, and the skewered Spanish sausages. The beef empanada was also good though for a single $6 empanada I would probably wait for happy hour. Speaking of which, they have a solid happy hour here, where their dishes are priced as they were when they first opened 30 years ago, meaning you essentially get 50% off a lot of their favorites(patatas bravas, empanadas, roast dates, chicken &amp; ham croquetas, pintxos, etc.) along with $16 pitchers of Sangria. It&#39;s every day from 4pm-6pm, along with Friday sand Saturdays from 10pm-midnight as well, and you can definitely get full off of $10-15 or so if you come by around this time.All in all tapas are never cheap, though with the right orders, along with plenty of complimentary bread and olive oil, you can actually get fairly full without breaking the bank. We averaged around $12/person on just food, and with drinks it just brought it a little higher, which is not bad at all. Also, they knew it was our first time there, so they even brought us out a trio of desserts, on the house, which was a great way to end the meal and start off the night. For that and their happy hour, they are definitely warrant another half star(4.5/5)"

My boyfriend and I ordered grilled squid  (way too salty), beef tenderloin with blue cheese (beef was dried and tough), Brussel sprouts salad (too much cheese, made the dressing too creamy and the beef empanada, which was delightful. The desserts were below par as well. We ordered caramelized banana and the flan, it just didn&#39;t have a lot originality.  The good part was that we got the desserts for free as a part of checking in via yelp. Overall, not very good food and was a disappointment given all the rave reviews.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong things?"

We split a pitcher of sangria which was amazing. I easily could&#39;ve drank an entire pitcher by myself (one woman did. She was throwing up in the bathroom. Happens to the best of us). I would recommend the berry.We got a variety of different plates-some of my favorites were the Brussels sprout salad, chicken with peri peri sauce and steak with mashed potatoes. My favorite was hands down the burrata: the bread was crispy and light, the spread, which was sweeter than I anticipated, complemented the fresh mozzarella perfectly. Its like biting into a little cheesy piece of Heaven. The chorizo dates, which are $2 for one, are worth a try as well. They were warm and amazing and I probably could&#39;ve eaten 5 more.I got the butterscotch dessert tapa, and it was rich and perfect. I tried the dessert ones my friends ordered and we passed around, and we all agreed the butterscotch was best.I know there are a million more tapas restaurants to try, but I will definitely be back here soon!"

At the same time, the menu can be quite overwhelming, again because of the number of options. My favorites were the citrus french toast, the short rib sliders, the serrano ham eggs benedicts, and the spinach and artichoke crepe. We got a ton of other tapas which were also fantastic but these were probably the ones I would definitely order again. A few of us also split a pitcher of the pear sangria which was a sweet sangria but it didn&#39;t really taste very much like pear unfortunately.The best part is you get a free dessert tapas with each person who checks in on yelp! We ended up with a couple of desserts from the check ins including the caramelized banana, natilla flan (which has a really great saffron flavor), the almond caramel bar and the chocolate truffle cake.

Be aware that the portion sizes are not typical for a tapas restaurant. They are quite generous and each plate is good for two people.I&#39;m giving 4 stars because the service was so so.

Potatoes and aioli2. Spicy meatballs in sherry sauce3. Beef empanada4. Ham and chicken croquetas5. Melted goat cheese in tomato sauce6. Octopus with smoked potatoesAlthough I could just lean back, relax and tell you that each of these were phenomenal, let me just give you a brief description of each tapa we ordered. The potatoes and aioli are simple, but amazing; the aioli is finger-lickin good (quite literally).  The meatballs are juicy, and the sauce they are in is wonderfully flavorful.  The beef empanada was like a meat filled croissant - it was awesome.  The croquetas were amazing - that&#39;s all.  The melted goat cheese in tomato sauce came with garlic bread and the flavor mixed perfectly together - this was one of the best deals as well.  And finally, the octopus tasted like they fetched it straight from the sea; it had all the salinity your heart could desire, not to mention it was chewy but tender in the most perfect way.  Biased as I may sound, all of these tapas are a &#34;must-get&#34;.  Yes, there&#39;s so many others to choose from but these were freaking amazing.But hey, guess what?  The empanada, meatballs, croquetas and potatoes are all $3 or less during happy hour which is 4pm-6pm, Monday-Friday.  That way you can try more of their tapas for a little less money.  You can only take advantage of these happy hour deals if you sit in the bar area, but why not?  You still get the same great atmosphere and service when sitting in the bar so take advantage why don&#39;t ya?Now, I&#39;m not done - oh no, not even close.  My fiancé and I got the seafood paella after all those tapas.  I had high expectations for the paella since my fiancé has said it&#39;s the best he&#39;s had, and I was anything but disappointed.  The paella exceeded my expectations, and I can say it is now my favorite paella as well.  The saffron is very distinct, but not overwheleming, and the seafood was cooked perfectly.  I had some left-over and it still tasted just as good the following day.  That&#39;s impressive.  I don&#39;t usually have a burning desire to go back to the same restaurant twice, but I&#39;d go here 10x over to indulge in this paella.And after the paella, we had dessert - not one, but four to be precise (we pigged out just a little).  We had the black raspberry sorbet, caramelized bananas, natilla flan and the butterscotch mousse.  Don&#39;t even ask what my favorite one was there - they satisfied the sweet tooth like no other dessert ever has.  I&#39;d say that you definitely should try the butterscotch mousse and the caramelized bananas...if you really have to choose.  Each dessert is only $3 and they&#39;re small so you should choose to get more than just one.And finally (as if that wasn&#39;t enough, right?) We got a pitcher of sangria that lasted throughout the entire course of our meal.  That pitcher is huge, and it&#39;s not filled to the brim with ice so you truly are getting a whole lotta sangria.  We got the red sangria which is only $17 for a pitcher during happy hour - hell yeah!  The sangria was awesome, maybe a little too awesome since I walked outta that place a little tipsy.  We also got some Spanish beer that was on draft and it was also very good...and yes, I was double-fisting it for a bit there.The atmosphere and the service made this dining experience even better.  The waiters and bussers were extremely attentive and always came through picking up our dirty plates.  We definitely didn&#39;t feel ignored, even though we weren&#39;t sitting in the main dining area.  In fact, it was kind of nice because it felt like private dining be for all the dinner crowd came.Ultimately, we left in some pain because of all that we ate, but can say that we came, we saw and we conquered."

Maybe not a fan of sausage but it wasn&#39;t anything special.Bacon wrapped dates. 4/5. Very good. I was already expecting it to be quite amazing, given the Yelp reviews. Not disappointed. I would order again. There are about 6-7 to an order.Dessert. 3/5. I ordered the caramelized bananas tapa. It was a nice small size - good for one person who just wants to finish off the meal with something sweet. However, it&#39;s pretty ordinary. The banana could have been warmer too.

The food has always been good here and I&#39;ve always enjoyed their paella and sangria options, but note that you can easily surpass $30/person price point making it a $$$ experience rather than $$ as listed.On our last visit here, we did the rioja-braised short rib, summer melon salad, buttermilk fried chicken with piri piri sauce, seared Spanish sausages, grilled octopus with potatoes and olives, &amp; porky paella (pork shoulder pork belly, chorizo, &amp; chicharrones). Overall a solid meal. If there were items I could live without, it would be the seared sausages and the buttermilk fried chicken. Sausages were good but nothing that really stood out for me and the buttermilk fried chicken was tasty but kind of out of place in my opinion for a Spanish tapas bar. My favorite was probably the braised short rib due to how tender and flavorful the meat was. The melon salad I really enjoyed the serranos and the smoked vinaigrette they used. The grilled octopus was good, but some of the pieces of octopus were had a bit too much char in my opinion. And lastly, for the pork paella... be ready for a mouthful of pork flavors and textures. Really good, but after a few bites I was definitely overwhelmed and needed to balance it out with other bites from the other dishes. On a final note, their classic sangria is my go to and goes great with any of the food here.&#39;Til next time, cheers!"

And Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba was it. Brunch is fantastic, but I LOVE their dinners. Truly one of my favorite restaurants in the city.I like the way they designed their menus with favorite items and/or chef recommendations highlighted in red. Because they do change the menu pretty frequently, it&#39;s nice to automatically know some of the newbies you should try.Some things you should absolutely order:-a pitcher of sangria. We shared it among 4 people and we each got two full glasses and then some. The pitcher costs $26, while a single glass costs $7. Huge savings, and well worth sharing among a small crowd.-on the pinxtos menu, the date stuffed with cheese wrapped with chorizo is to die for. Embarrassingly enough, I always order 2-3 just for myself. They have something similar on the full size menu, but it&#39;s not identical, and these are sooooo fantastic that I don&#39;t even chance it. Get more than one. It&#39;s all of the flavors you would never expect to work that just do.-spicy potatoes. They aren&#39;t over powering, and contain just the right amount of kick... And that chipotle mayo sauce is delicious!-beef tenderloin with blue cheese = perfection. It&#39;s cooked medium rare and has a slightly salty taste from the cheese. Mmm, mmm, good!-goat cheese with tomato sauce. It&#39;s super creamy and warm, and when placed on top of the garlic bread, it melts.Some other menu items we thought were tasty (though not at the same 5+ star level as the above list):-ham and cheese croquettes. They came four to an order and were jam packed with flavor. Although they look like mozzarella sticks, the cheese isn&#39;t melty, it&#39;s more cream-based.-hanger steak. It was cooked medium rare and came with roasted potatoes and harissa sauce (which we all thought was similar to sofrito, but I&#39;m not sure if it was the color or the flavor that led us to believe that!).-octopus! It was many of our first times trying octopus, but it exceeded our expectations. Ever so slightly chewy, but great pop of flavor.Tips:-Check-in on Yelp and you get a free dessert. Surprisingly, because we all checked in, they let us all get a free dessert. It was NOT one per table. We tried four different ones and passed them around the table in true tapas fashion. They were about 5 bites a piece and hit the spot! My personal favorite was the rich chocolate cake!"

Located in Lincoln Park community, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! was super busy on a Friday evening, with different ages crowd. The wait for a table was 1.5 hours, but luckily you can order off the main menu at the bar as well. We were there around 8 pm and were barely able to snag the last 2 seats at the bar. This place offers a variety of Spanish tapas. If you order a paella, make sure you specify for how many people. It was two of us and they must have assumed we ordered paella for two and boy was it A LOT of it! My favorite part of the evening was the passion fruit sangria - it was DELISH! Very easy to drink too hahahaThe cafe offers valet parking, as well as plenty of Ubers driving around.I would go back!"

We also had the tuna with melon slices (that was different) but good.Everything was delicious except the calamari - I&#39;ve had better.The different flavors of Sangria was just a treat!

I came here once for Sunday brunch, and continue to come back. Its a place where food is meant to be shared and they accommodate large parties exceptionally well. I celebrated a birthday here last week, and CBBR accommodated our party of 8 and didn&#39;t hesitate to split the check 8 ways. My only complaint is that if you order pitchers of sangria, they don&#39;t replenish water. My friend and I had to ask for a water refill.I like how they space out the tapas, and their initial recommendation to order 1-2 tapas per person. This provided enough food for everyone to share.At my most recent dinner experience, we ordered the following:chorizo-wrapped medjool dates and cheese-a popular tapa that reminded me of Avec&#39;s prosciutto-wrapped dates.spicy potatoes with tomato aioli-one of my favorite tapas here and at Mercat a la Planxa. I prefer M a la P&#39;s patatas bravas over the spicy potatoes at CBBR, but for the price point, CBBR hits the spot.grilled octopus-this was one of my favorites tapas at CBBR and I would order this again. Don&#39;t be afraid to try octopus. It&#39;s not fishy tasting at all!scallop empanada-flaky crust, generous scallop filling.buttermilk-fried chicken thighs-Mmm. Not what you&#39;d expect if you&#39;re a Nando&#39;s fan. This is a marriage of fried chicken doused in peri peri sauce.grilled hanger steak-sliced for sharing, moist and succulent meat.seafood paella with squid and squid ink-Our entire party&#39;s favorite dish, this is a special that should be made into a regular offering. Instead of rice, this dish contained vermicelli noodles, with a generous seafood portion. Highly recommend ordering this before its no longer offered!"

My friend and I came for brunch recently, and really loved our experience here. Making reservations was easy since they are on Open Table, and I was able to snag us a table the day before our Saturday brunch. During brunch you have the options of choosing between the brunch items, or the dinner items on the other side of the menu. The fact that there are so many options is dangerous, because everything sounds delicious. I decided to focus on items from the brunch menu, because I know I&#39;ll come another time to try the dinner items.Our waitress was very attentive and answered our questions about the menu well. My friend and I both didn&#39;t order any cocktails, since we both were more in need of caffeine, but I hear their sangria is amazing.  To eat I ordered the citrus french toast  stick, deviled egg, and baked eggs.Citrus french toast stick: It had a light citrus taste, and the flavor was not overpowering . The outer texture was crispy, and the inner part was soft. I almost wish I had ordered two instead of one, because it was my second favorite item from my visit.Deviled egg: It was good and had a little bit of a kick to it.Baked Eggs: I am head over hills and in love with their baked eggs. The eggs are covered in cheese,  a tangy sauce and are  perfectly baked.  The tomato bread is seriously some of the best bread I&#39;ve ever had, and it paired perfectly with the baked eggs. If you enjoy eggs, tomatoes, and cheese, then this dish is for you.The price point is excellent for the quality of the food here. My whole bill before tip was a little over $12, which wasn&#39;t bad at all."

I&#39;m not sure what else there is to say.If Ba-Ba-Reeba were located in a small town, I&#39;d rate it higher (3 stars)... but it&#39;s located in one of the largest cities in the US, so the quality, flavor and freshness should be compared with places like Boqueria (Flatiron) and Olea (Ft. Greene) in NYC. Or even Spain? I&#39;ve only lived in Andalucia (Southern Spain) and I think the comparison is similar to Chinese food in the US (babareeba) vs. Chinese food in China...The Bloody Mary bar should be avoided at all costs. Even their &#34;spicy&#34; mix is just a tad spicy at best. Plus, the choices are overwhelming... your drink will just taste like tomato juice with random spices in it.The food was just off. I felt like I was at a commercialized chain restaurant eating processed food (The Cheesecake Factory was the first place that came to mind).1) Patatas Bravas: They put a coating on the patatas (paprika?), which make them taste funky. I appreciate that they don&#39;t want to serve up traditional patatas, but this iteration tasted starchy, processed and strange.2) Brussel sprout salad: This was admittedly the best dish from what I tried. However, the ratio of cheese and dressing to sprouts was off... So I felt inundated with the fixings, I could barely taste the sprouts.3) Octopus: Check out my picture, does that look appetizing? It was overly oily and rubbery. My cousin had never tried octopus and I convinced him (Since I savor the octopus at Taverna Kyclades in Astoria, Queens and even Boqueria). Our server said &#34;it&#39;s everyone&#39;s favorite...&#34; (This dish reaffirmed why I left Chicago after living there for 3 years).4) NOW for the worst part of the meal... DESSERT. I received a free dessert through Yelp and our server recommended the marcona-almond caramel bar. It&#39;s basically a glorified snickers bar, but worse... So we looked on Yelp and saw that folks reallllly liked the butterscotch custard. So for sh*ts and giggles we ordered that too... #fail. It tasted like overly sweetened condensed milk with flavoring.Silver lining? I got to hang with my cousin, who I haven&#39;t seen in a few years... so I did enjoy the company, thus the 2 star rating."

You can log on to their website and sign up directly there (right panel).Secondly, there&#39;s almost always a Yelp checkin special - also for free food.

They normally have a seasonal, but I love sticking to the traditional red - Not overwhelmingly sweet and shared among a few friends, a decent value.I&#39;ve been here more times than I can count. Without writing an essay for you, my recommendations:- brussel sprouts salad, marcona almonds, manchego cheese ($6)- spicy potatoes with tomato alioli (patata bravas) ($6)- rioja-braised short rib, manchego mashed potatoes, roasted seasonal vegetables &amp; rioja wine glaze ($12)- grilled hanger steak with charred green chili chimichurri &amp; fingerling potatoes ($10)- grilled octopus with green harissa, smoked potatoes &amp; olives ($12)- buttermillk-fried chicken thighs, piri-piri sauce &amp; shaved vegetable salad ($7)Now keep in mind, these are tapas so the portions are far from big. Normally when I go with a big group I get a few servings of the Paella to make sure we&#39;re all full. I normally go with the seafood paella with shrimp, monkfish, clams &amp; green beans ($17 per serving)PS: They also have a happy hour. Last I checked, it was $16 pitchers of sangria, and select tapas at 1985 prices. M-F 4-6. Go get&#39;em."

I was a little apprehensive about eating so late because that&#39;s not my usual style, but I think eating late and embracing the Spanish/European habit of eating late made the experience all the better.This was my first time here and I was amazed by the sheer size of the restaurant. There are so many different rooms that all have their own atmosphere. My friend and I were seated in one of the back rooms, so it was quiet and made for a really pleasant and private dining experience.Our waitress was really nice and attentive, and gave good recommendations. We ordered a half pitcher of the Classic Red sangria. It was delicious, and red wine is not usually my favorite. We really debated between the Classic Red and the seasonal special, which was white with mango. Next time.This is definitely a menu you have to approach with a plan. Because we were only two people, we wanted to maximize our plates, so we ordered one plate from each category:32. Goat cheese baked in tomato sauce.42. Grilled squid with olive oil &amp; garlic.51. Short rib with mashed potatoes.58. Meatballs with sherry tomato sauce.They were all AMAZING. I wouldn&#39;t change what we ordered and I would order them again -- but first I would try everything else on the menu. I was seriously impressed.The meatballs came out first and they were the perfect start. When we finished the meatballs, we dipped the table bread in the sauce -- YUM! The squid, short rib, and goat cheese came out pretty quickly after that.The goat cheese was so fresh and creamy and the tomato sauce complemented the cheese very well. With the garlic bread that comes with the plate, these 3 make the perfect bite. Amazingly fresh and vibrant flavors.The squid was wonderful. I&#39;m not used to having grilled squid and it was so refreshing to actually taste the flavor of the squid and not fried breading. The sauce was really light and made this dish a great choice for something lighter, especially compared to the short rib.The short rib was definitely the heaviest of the dishes and wasn&#39;t my favorite. The short rib had a great flavor but the mashed potatoes were kind of bland and eh (IMHO). The veggies that came with also weren&#39;t mind-blowing. I&#39;d like to try the other meat choices.We also got a free dessert for being first-timers (so I got to save my check-in dessert for later!!!). After the richness of the meal, I probably should&#39;ve opted for a lighter dessert choice, but I couldn&#39;t resist the chocolate truffle cake. It was deeeeelicious. Definitely super rich and maybe not the best choice after such a rich meal, but it was amazing. I would for sure order this again.Overall, an amazing dining experience. I want to come here for brunch now, too, to see what they have to offer."

But it wasn&#39;t what I&#39;ve come to expect from that brand either.In fact, they brought us one wrong dish, a misunderstanding, but since our server didn&#39;t come by for at least 10 minutes, we just ate the wrong one at that point.We had paella, which was alright (we had seafood one)...  The manchego mushrooms were ok, but not special. Our friends liked the short rib a lot. We ordered about 16 things and most were just not noteworthy.The best dishes we had?

The restaurant is great for both options - huge space, but has more intimate seating as well.Things I love: spicy potatoes (crispy potatoes with this amazing tomato-based sauce), bacon-wrapped dates (duh), goat cheese baked in tomato sauce (the most succulent goat cheese atop a ridiculously good tomato sauce, served with bread), buttermilk fried chicken thighs.Service could be better, taking a star off for that.

We tried the following:*Garlic Shrimp*Meatballs*Buttermilk Chicken*Hangar Steak*Bacon Wrapped Dates*Caramelized Banana (free with yelp check-in)Favorite was definitely the meatballs and the bacon wrapped dates. The hangar steak was also very good - smaller portions than the other tapas, but very tender meat and went great with the chimmichurri sauce.The caramelized banana we got as dessert was good and came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, but it was nothing special."

The hubby, some friends and I decided to go check it out. Half a block away we could already smell the amazing food. We started with a pitcher of peach sangria. Lovely!One friend got the grilled squid with olive and garlic. I&#39;m not a fan of arugula or tons of garlic, but this dish was perfectly balanced! So yummy. The shrimp skewers and cheese plate were good, though I didn&#39;t care for the guava cube or the orange marmalade.However the absolute BEST thing we had was the shrimp paella. I&#39;d heard of paella, but had never had it. We ordered the smaller portion to split 4 ways, and it was FANTABULOUS! I&#39;m talking lick the plate clean and think about ordering some more...The server was excellent, keeping tabs on us, but not hovering too much. Also, because there was a Yelp coupon, I got a free butterscotch pudding which was frankly the best I&#39;ve ever had.The ONLY problem with Tapas is that its so good and you are having such a good time that is is really easy to rack up a big bill.

The meats have always been juicy and tender and nothing has ever been dried out or over/under cooked.I came here for my 3rd time over the weekend. We had a half pitcher of their blackberry raspberry sangria and their seasonal blood orange sangria. Both were a great combination of fruity and just a little tart. We had the flank steak, spicy potatoes, beef tenderloin &amp; blue cheese, and my favorite the chicken paella. *Note - order the paella first because it takes awhile!* We also had some desserts which were perfect small plates (what else would it be?) so we got to try a few and they did not disappoint.Great atmosphere, quiet and romantic!As a side note - make sure you make reservations a little in advance.

Our server (whose name escapes me but was a delight) was extremely knowledgeable and made wonderful suggestions.We had baked goat cheese, short ribs, olives, spicy chorizo and chicken skewers, stuffed mushrooms and the almond desert.  For the size of the tapas I was impressed - it was honestly a lot of food for just two people and we couldn&#39;t finish everything.The exterior of this restaurant is deceiving, because this place is huge.

We enjoyed a large assortment of tapas and all were excellent (patatas Brava, squid, Brussel sprouts salad were just a few). The paella is excellent and a larger portion than the tapas. The sangria (four varieties) is refreshing although the alcohol content seemed low - not a bad thing. The desserts (we tried two- the chocolate cake and the marcona almond caramel bar) were the perfect size to end our meal on a sweet note. Only complaint is that the noise level is a bit high so it made it challenging to converse with our group."

The place looks small from the outside, but its huge once you get in.  We came here for Restaurant week, but the R week menu was pretty lame so we just ordered off the regular menu. It was Sunday brunch, and there was a Bloody Mary bar which was pretty cool. The bacon wrapped dates were my fave, followed by the patatas bravas, that orange chipotle mayo is to die for. The jamon eggs benedict was surprisingly good. I would pass on the hanger steak it had a weird after taste. We finished the meal off with some French toast with jam and goat cheese, not too sweet and a great savory dessert. Overall great tapas, great brunch!"

We were able to be seated right away arriving around 5:30. We chose the chorizo-wrapped date and the laughing bird shrimp for a bite-sized pinxto ($2/ea.) Hubs enjoyed his date; my shrimp was good, but I wasn&#39;t prepared for the actual strip of chewy white fat adorning the top of the skewer, which I removed and didn&#39;t eat. When they said &#34;topped with fat&#34; I guess I assumed it was drizzled with a little grease or something; I personally don&#39;t eat solid pieces of fat like that.We shared the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, which was really delicious ($8), and had a plate of soy-orange duck wings which were the special that evening and should go on the permanent menu, they were so tender and tasty. We attempted to order 1/2 a pitcher of the blood orange sangria (also a special for the evening) but apparently the server heard &#34;HAVE a pitcher of sangria,&#34; and brought us a full one, which we didn&#39;t figure out til we looked at the bill. I thought it was a little generous for a half, but didn&#39;t ask! Oh well. Guess someone&#39;s gonna have to drink all that extra sangria. Shucks!We also ordered 2 portions (the minimum order) of the seafood paella with shrimp, scallops, and monkfish. I could only find a single piece of monkfish in the entire pan, but there were a more reasonable number of shrimp and scallops. The paella takes about 30 minutes to cook to order, so they ask you to be prepared that it will take a little longer than the tapas orders. Though we were stuffed by this point, my Yelp check-in earned us a free dessert tapa, so we chose the caramelized banana with vanilla ice cream and pistachios, the perfect sweet but not too heavy ending to our delicious meal. We ended up spending about $85 for the meal, which earned us 1 point per $1 for the Lettuce Entertain You group&#39;s frequent diner reward program - there are so many affiliated restaurants, it&#39;s a great program to enroll in! We would definitely eat at Ba-Ba-Reeba again for the delicious food!"

There is also a substantial wine and sangria list, and a separate cocktail menu.I particularly enjoyed the house smoked salmon.Bacon wrapped dates were nice and crisp on the outside without being mushy on the inside.Buttermilk chicken thighs seemed mis-named, and were more like chicken tenders with a wing sauce on them.Beef skewers were tender and nicely charred on the outside, although the horseradish sauce could have used more kick.The empanadas had a delightfully flakey pastry.Service was friendly and attentive.

Last time was my first time dining here, and everything was perfect (the food and excellent server)! I was soooo looking forward to coming back so I recommended this place to my friends for one of us&#39;s farewell dinner since she was leaving town.Okay, checking on us is good. But coming and asking too frequently whether we need anything else/ whether we&#39;re gonna order some more is a little uncomfortable. To me, experience is the second important thing (of course, the first thing is food) when I evaluate a restaurant but it was bad today. It felt like she wanted us to either order more or eat quickly and just leave. Yeah, more people started to come in for dinner but it wasn&#39;t that busy like last time when I came during the weekend. There were still empty tables. Also, when we got out receipt I wrote down my LettuceEats number on the receipt but it seemed like she didn&#39;t add it so I asked her and she said she&#39;ll add it later. I checked and it&#39;s not added.The supposedly warm/hot tapas dishes we ordered were generally quite cold when it came out. Seems like it was sitting there for a while before it was served to us.  Also, I told my friend that grilled octopus tapas they have here is so soft but what we actually had today was hard to chew. Since I had a really great time last time, I was really disappointed. I felt sorry to my friends for recommending. Before today I always recommended this place when people asked me some good places to dine but I don&#39;t think I will anymore. Well, they might have a good experience like when I first came, but I&#39;m afraid they&#39;ll have a bad experience like i had today so I don&#39;t want to take that risk."

We also had the ham croquet, chicken empanada, meatballs, and the mushroom toast thingy. They were all small flavorful bites. My bf also had the grilled octopus but was disappointed that it was a bit too salty. We also order the pork paella. It came out really hot and well seasoned.  Overall, ton of food!Since we were there, we absolutely had to try the sangria! We had a pitcher of the white peach one, and it was one of the best sangrias I have tried. I also wanted to try another one and the bartender was nice enough to give me samples of them all. So my second favorite was the black raspberry followed by the passion fruit. The plain red was my bfs favorite, it really has that red wine flavor! And the sangria of the day was mango which was a little too sweet for me. I would definitely come back here for just drinks and small bites at the bar."

The drinks are as amazing to drink as they are fantastic to watch being created. Then you get to sit back and sip on art while watching more art getting created! It&#39;s like a hands on art museum with no kids that you can get drunk and eat in while chilling with the artists. Is there anything better than that!?!Did I mention the burger I had?

The drinks here range from strong and bitter to fruity and sweet. But I have never had a bad drink here so that should comfort you.They have a fairly extensive food menu as well. Although the food is hit or miss, the burger and Mac &amp; Cheese are off the charts good.Overall The Bird can appeal to many tastes  ranging from fancy $12 cocktails to someone who just wants to drink a Miller Lite. So come relax and stay for a while, ask for Sammy, trust me you won&#39;t get a bad drink, pair that with some Mac and your night is set. Drop the mic!"

I think it has cucumbers in it which gave it a refreshing taste.After my second drink, I went next door to Pequod&#39;s and within minutes we were seated.  Had a lovely time at Drinkingbird catching up with a friend and feeling nice a tipsy.  Loved the ambiance and the servers."

It&#39;s a little tiny spot between an Asian restaurant and a pizza place. You could miss it - so be paying attention. Because the food is super delicious! We ordered the lamb meatballs and the cauliflower steak. Yea - we like to mix it up. The cauliflower steak with lentils was a perfect balance is flavours - lentils being heavy in the palate while the tangy cauliflower very light and refreshing. The lamb meatballs come in a polenta and cheese base. I could swim in it! Super delicious. But the meatballs were a miss. They tasted like something from a box ( and that&#39;s a minus 1 star). We ordered some cocktails and those were spot on. I would definitely go back. This time i would order the lamb meatballs - without the lamb!

I told him to make us whatever he wanted, and instead of making 3 of the same drink (like any other bartender would probably do), he made 3 different drinks, which were all AMAZING! It just felt like Richard genuinely wanted to make sure we had a great experience. I will definitely be back whenever I come into Chicago and I&#39;m so so glad to have found this place!!

Great vibe, friendly people and amazing food/ drink. Very laid back place with tons of quality liquor to choose from and lots of different foods to try. If your looking for someplace to go and relax while you get your buzz on, I highly recommended this establishment... I heard the owner is pretty freaking cool too, if your lucky enough maybe  you can have a drink with him!"

My friends and I easily got a table on a Friday night, but the place emptied out after an hour or so. I loved the retro decor and my awesome Pimm&#39;s Cup, but our server was super slow and rarely checked on us. I sat for almost a half hour with an empty glass while she ignored us.One tip: stay away from the Miss Noma. It sounds delicious but tastes like an ashtray!The food looks pretty good and I wouldn&#39;t mind coming for the whiskey and wing night!"

My fiancé and I came here on a Sunday night before catching a movie. We ignorantly thought we would go to Pequod&#39;s but the wait was undesirable. So we stumbled in here instead. I really like the decor. I like mad men and chevron patterns, so I was into the mod-60&#39;s vibe. They had a little patio in the back that was nice too. It was half priced beers, so our beers cost $3. Always down for cheap beer! The food was bomb! I got the Waldorf sandwich and frites. The frites had Parmesan cheese melted on them-yum! And the sandwich had the perfect balance of savory and tart flavors! My fiancé got the Mac n cheese which had four types of cheese. So good! Service was good too! All in all, those folks who come and have a drink here while waiting for a table at Pequod&#39;s, should just drop the light up buzzer and eat here instead!"

The place itself is really cool, intimate, and has awesome music. Situated right across from the theater, it&#39;s in a great location for a pre- or post- movie drink or meal. My roommate and I came for a late dinner before an even later movie and were excited to try out the cocktails and charcuterie and cheese plate, until she realized she forgot her ID which is always awkward... So I just ordered beer (from their fairly extensive draft and bottle list). Our waitress was super slow and didn&#39;t seem to make serving a priority. She also had no idea what was on the charcuterie plate for that evening which was a bigger delay... We also ordered the kale salad to share. The figs, goat cheese, and pistachios went really well with the vinaigrette dressing and I probably could&#39;ve eaten a whole salad myself. Luckily we had a heaping pile of meat and cheese and pickled veggies with grilled bread on the table to enjoy as well. There was a spicy sausage, a more mild sausage, a cheddar cheese and another unknown type--because no one bothered to let us know. It also took me about 5 tries to flag down our waitress, who seemed to just be sprinting by our table each time she passed, just to order another drink, which I ended up having to chug really fast to make the movie on time. All in all the food and drinks and music are great here, but the service is just really lacking in efficiency and friendliness."

Besides being one of the most cleverly and tactfully decorated bars in Chicago, the drinks are top notch. The bar caters to just about anyone. The retro 1950&#39;s/60&#39;s decor is really cool - complete with awesome neon signs, mood lighting, and cool bar stools and tables. A TV also lets the sports fan catch the game at the bar.The cocktails are my favorite part - the list is simple and not too long, so those who are undecided can quickly make up their minds. For those who want to order off menu, the bartenders know their shit and have been able to make anything I ask for. The wait is not long and the place is never too packed. Specials are also great, with half-off craft cocktails on one night, split of champagne and oysters for $12 on another night, etc.I would try the food, but who are we kidding, I usually end up eating at Pequod&#39;s on the same trip as the Drinkingbird."

Looking for a place I haven&#39;t visited and this was the half way point for meeting up with a few friends. The $7 cocktails and $2 PBR made for a good combination. Start with the liquor first, obviously.Fries and croquettes were summoned for something to munch on while slurping down those delicious cocktails. The fries are legit so do yourself a favor. The Old Fashion was right on the money. One of the better ones I have experienced in a while. The bar keep also whipped up a Manhattan, which isn&#39;t very difficult, but it was well balanced. Hats off.Our server was pleasant and tended to our needs. No need to wave her down or wonder if she had taken a 30 minute cig break. Pleased for sure. No experience of the smugness or discontent with the staff.This is a place to enjoy the company you are with and the drink in front of you. The dimly lit front room is relaxed and the booths in the back lends itself to some seclusion.There are two TVs situated above the bar and that&#39;s it. They did have the Blackhawks game on but it was definitely an after thought. Just steer clear if you are looking to to drink shitty draft beer and watch a game. Speaking of which the rail featured a nice selection of drafts if PBR doesn&#39;t do it for you.Three people, 4 rounds each, croquettes, and fries for around $75 (one straggler had a couple beers). You can&#39;t beat that for a Thursday night. But we were left wanting to finish up both the sporting events so down the the street to Zella&#39;s to cap off the night."

So much so that when I needed a relaxed and lovely place to get married, I chose BK. It holds a special place in our hearts beyond the excellent food and coffee and patio.And as such, despite knowing Birchwood was no longer, we headed to this address to try Americano 2211 on our anniversary.Flawlessly redesigned and appointed, the dimly lit and sultry confines of 2211 W North Avenue certainly have taken on a very nice direction. The space is gorgeous without being over the top, sleek yet still inviting. Truly a 5-star overhaul.While focused a bit more on its cocktail, beer and wine offerings (as the long bar would indicate) they offer a lovely menu of sharing plates that we enjoyed immensely: the highlights being the brussels sprouts, farm green salad and hangar steak. Excellent.Those drinks -- well, you are in for a treat. We split a bottle of the Cab Franc and then I indulged in a glass of rose sparkling (selected by the owner), but surely I&#39;ll be back to sample the stunning cocktail list.The service was exceptional.The only question left is -- what are you waiting for? It&#39;s as good as its predecessor, and stands out. Worth the few steps off the beaten Wicker Park track to make this a mainstay."

Although the menu serves alcohol, we opted for coffee, served in a carafe on a cute wooden tray accompanied by a cheery red mug, and an Americano, which the barista altered to specification perfectly.The food was crazy good, mostly due to unique flavor combinations: Rosemary biscuits and homemade peach jam had both of us reeling. Bruleed grapefruit was at once bright and smokey, the quiche came individually-portioned in a nest of crust that flawlessly contained its buttery goodness.  Favorite for me was a sauteed combination of peppers and eggplants, served cold, with a melty portion of mozzarella cheese and perfect chewy flatbread.None of it was stupid expensive, all of it was delicious. You order at the counter but the service is really accommodating, friendly, and attentive, and at noon on a Sunday it seemed at about half capacity. Go have a fantastic little brunch!"

Short, simple, but delicious menu made even better thanks to the pastries and baked goods. Met a friend here for a late lunch midweek and we both left happy and fed. We decided to split a couple of items. We had the chickpea salad (good sized portion), rosemary biscuit with butter and jam (so light and fresh), and the cocoa-crème fraiche coffee cake (also light and not too dense). All was great and it was the perfect amount of food for the two of us. We were there at about 1:30 on a Tuesday and unfortunately they were out of the quiche of the day so if that&#39;s what you have your eye on, make sure you come a bit earlier!The interior feels very open and the back patio is wonderful on a warm day (some tables had umbrellas for the sun-averse). Staff was very friendly and chatty. You order at the register, get a number for your table, and they bring your order to you. Pricing is definitely fair. We didn&#39;t order any of their drinks, but all of the café options sounded great as did the alcoholic beverages."

For an extra $.25 cents you could sponsor a child in Africa... Or you can upgrade your coffee to a large!!When I walked in I wasn&#39;t sure if it was a sit down restaurant with food or just a grab your food at the counter place. It didn&#39;t have a hostess so I assumed it was an order and pay now kind of deal. Then the cashier said go ahead and sit down so I left the counter only to be told no order first then sit down. Haha who&#39;s on first? Little miscommunication there.We ordered the seared halumi sandwich and some dish with spaghetti sauce and egg with some toast on the side (shakshumi or something like that). Food was interesting. Seared halumi sandwich was like spicy and looked like pesto but tasted like organic pine sol lol. Spaghetti egg dip was pretty good although not much to the dish. I think there was kale in it? It must be healthy right?Anywho we sat outside on a nice Sunday afternoon. It was new... It was hip and the coffee was legit. That whole self serve water and utensils was kind of weird. Also having to tip before food comes out needs work. You should be able to order food sit down then pay after you consume therefore allowing you to tip after. Needs some wifi and it would be a hit amongst the hipsters that live in the area. Ooh free parking on North Ave too if you&#39;re hungover from Saturday&#39;s Shenanigans.Boom! Wow look I accomplished something on a Sunday.

This place makes a perfect macchiato, which is a rare treat in this city.The breakfast options are interesting, slightly more adventurous than other cafe restaurants in the neighborhood. I liked the creamy buratta with spicy eggplant relish. I have also tried  the toast for something simple and light and quick:  fresh bread with a berry-rich jam.The space is well decorated - fresh flowers on each table are a nice touch.

The menu, while limited, is creative and unique-- I had the shakshuka and a prosciutto + gruyere croissant. The croissant wasn&#39;t bad, but I&#39;ve definitely had better elsewhere; however, the shakshuka was delicious with all its simplicity. There was just a touch of hearty spice in the tomato sauce, which went quite well with the poached eggs and toast.Will definitely be back-- the vibe itself is enough to warrant another visit, and the rest of the menu sounds extremely interesting as well."

The house ham &amp; cheese with nordic creamery cheddar and piccalilli (Indian pickled veggies)?--I had to tell myself to slow down--so good! (Though I would wish the sandwich sear on the one we received was a little less black on the top--added a burnt taste to parts.)At $8-10, prices were really reasonable for the quality of lunch.Coffee options are serious, including Chemex pour-over.Counter-ordering was pleasant enough, although once our party of four sat, the four dishes trickled out separately, which made it hard to have a polite start to lunch.The interior atmosphere is white-washed brick and American-Amish dining chairs, but I think the back deck has a lot more potential for warmer days."

The food is diverse and you have a lot of options that are delicious and diverse. Had a group with a lot of allergies - gluten, dairy, protein limitations, etc. - and everyone still had a few options to pick from. Shakshuka is especially delicious (not spicy at all though - we had to add some hot sauce). The coffee drinks were outstanding as well. They have a very nice patio - great addition tk the experienceThe only complaint is that the food did nt come out at the same time. One of the grain bowls was brought out in 4-5 minutes, and the second one took over 20 minutes to arrive. These guys should do a better job making group orders around the same time.

My local go-to brunch place was gone. Then weeks passed by and I noticed a cute little smiling egg-looking sign hanging where Birchwood Kitchen used to be.We decided to give Americano 2211 a try today not knowing what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised. They definitely spruced up the space into a more comfortable modern clean interior. Menu was very simple. The big sign displayed coffee and housemade ice creams. Current menu sits on a table counter for you to browse. Still an order and sit down kind of place.Food:Shakshuka: Lovely. The tomato sauce had quite impressive flavors. It was concentrated without being salty or overly seasoned. The cilantro was delicious with the sauce. The egg was pornographic. Yolk was not quite entirely runny. It was that half gooey, half runny consistency which is perfect for spreading on the grilled toast. They really allowed each ingredient to shine through in this dish.Ham &amp; Cheese sandwich: Comes with potatoes. Potatoes were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Kind of tasted like fries from an amusement park which isn&#39;t a bad thing. Sandwich itself was as simple, yet unique and full of flavor. I think there was some kind of pickled cauliflower in it. It really helped cut through the heaviness of the ham and cheese. Well balanced.Cocoa creme fraiche coffee cake: Crust was a little crunchy and inside was moist. Awesome paired with the Caramelized Banana Choco Chip ice cream which they make in house.Cold brew coffee: solid.Staff was very helpful in describing each dish and portion. They were really friendly.So happy we have a new local brunch place!"

The only thing odd was that both times we visited - we have seen people fill up their water glass at the self service station and accidentally walk away leaving the water running to spill everywhere... just strange.

One of the owners used to sell organic ice creams at the farmers markets. They were excellent then and are available here too.

The weather was beautiful, and their back porch allowed us to take full advantage. Cappuccinos were top-notch. Food was great: the fiancee and I got the eggplant burrata and the weekend&#39;s special, biscuits with merguez gravy. Both of these hit the spot, definitely an appropriate portion given their richness.We even got a bonus mushroom quiche when the server accidentally brought over our burrata to the wrong table. He did send it directly over to us after confirming its first recipient did not touch it rather than sending it back to the kitchen, an offense that *SOME SENSITIVE TYPES* (shade: thrown) might dock a star for, but I am neither thin of skin nor constitution, and also appreciate that their instinct is to serve food rather than waste it.Being pleasantly full, and able to walk away from the table under our own power, we did the sensible thing: order coffee cake. Chocolatey, crumbly and served warm, in other words, perfect.If I were a nitpicky type (see above), I might suggest to the owners that their porch configuration could use some work. Our lovely city is full of some wider denizens, myself included, and it would have been nice to not squeeze up against my fellow brunchers in getting to and from my seat. Also, I&#39;m not sure that I love the order, and then be served model. I think I would rather they commit to full service, but they probably have their reasons, and I can respect them.Anyway, those are some minor points against a backdrop of an excellent experience. I&#39;m looking forward to returning, particularly once their liquor license has been approved. I&#39;m not looking forward to the waits that will surely grow once people get hip to their offerings."

The tacos are simple with just the meat, onions and cilantro. They come with a side of limes and there are spicy sauce bottles on the bar table. Simple tacos with flavorful, juicy meat. Staff are friendly and keep the place super clean. What more can you ask for.This place is a no-fuss establishment. Come in, order your food, eat, and go. Seating is pretty limited.

The tacos are a little on the pricey side, but very generously filled with meat, onions, and cilantro. Each order comes with a generous serving of tomatillo salsa, which I absolutely loved--chilled yet wonderfully spicy, the salsa topped off what was already a very solid taco.It&#39;s a small place with limited seating and cash only, but the solid food makes it worth it and a great place to stop by for a fast meal."

Which I have to say is quite expensive for a burrito. But worth it and filling.The chips looked pretty good too so maybe split the burrito with someone and get the chips. While waiting, someone was eating a Cuban, that looed really good too! I will be back and try some new things.

Must remember to bring cash, no cc accepted.Service: I called my order in and was told 5 min (super quick). The service over the phone was exceptional as he was patient and very nice.Food: I wish they labled the tacos bc when u order so many you want to be able to easily identify them. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and 7 tacos. Below are my reviews on each:Barbacoa taco - not impressed. Won&#39;t order this again.Beef taco - not bad, not great, no complaints.Fish taco - a really great grilled taco with pico de gallo. Was my favorite taco of the bunch.Pork taco - 2nd best taco. I would order it again.Steak taco - not much flavor, but was tender. Slight tweekn and this taco could be good.Glad I tried their food and if I lived closer would probably come back, but I don&#39;t live close by so probably will have to stick to pilsen area for my occasional taco fix.

I&#39;m all for trying new things but the consistency was rubbery and it was hard to shake the feeling that I was ingesting brain.

We met up here because I told her &#34;I&#39;m feeling tacos and margaritas&#34; so she suggested this place. We sat on the patio because this weather has been phenomenal (cross my fingers that it stays like this ). Their tacos were not the greatest; tasted just plain nothing special. If their Tacos were good this place would easily get a 5 star from me. I ordered a Mango and a Peach margarita and let me express how tasty those were! I mean I wanted to try every flavor but I had to drive my ass home.This is definitely a place to come for a nice flavorful and refreshing Margarita! My drink didn&#39;t lack a thing. It was made exactly the way I love it. Our check was really cheap as well so I will definitely return to try more of their drinks.Our server was really nice and attentive. She didn&#39;t bother us every 5 seconds but came around enough for us not to be smothered by her.

Well, since I&#39;m old and these 2am rendezvous don&#39;t happen as much as they should in your mid 20&#39;s, I dragged my hubby out on a Thursday night around 8pm just for a casual dinner. Was it worth coming out from the suburbs? Probably not. However, was it super delicious and definitely worth trying? Yes. The place is a hole in the wall, this is not your trendy or colorful Mexican joint, this is literally perfect for that 2am stop before going home to fill up on crazy, amazing burritos. Anyways, despite the environment, the guys working there seemed super friendly.We ordered the Pastor Burrito which I had and my hubby had the Carne Asada Burrito and I must say the Pastor was much much better. It was a big portion for $6.99 and it came with a little soup and salsa. The burrito was full of veggies and flavor and the pork was super moist, tender and had so much flavor. Like it was really good to the point that I&#39;m clearly still thinking about it. The only issue is that it&#39;s too far from our house. We need a place like this open super late on the weekends that is that good.Only annoying part about this place is that it&#39;s cash only so keep that in mind. And who wants to count exact change when you&#39;re super drunkie at 2am, when you&#39;d rather have him swipe that credit card. Well, in any case, we will probably be back after a downtown rendezvous whenever that will happen, but we won&#39;t be coming back for a simple burrito dinner from the burbs just for fun. That, was a one time only wonderful experience. But taqueria, keep on doing what you&#39;re doing and expand to the burbs!"

A long night of cocktails and conversation behind us and we&#39;ve officially burned through the modest sized dinner consumed earlier in the evening. We were hungry. Yelp pointed us towards Traspasada, a well rated burrito joint steps away from our friends apartment and open until an astonishing 3:30AM - not a rarity by my hometown (NY) standards but certainly worth mentioning in Chicago.We arrive. The staff is halfway through the usual choreographed cleaning dance; flipping the stools, wiping the tables, and sweeping the floor, Semisonic may have been playing - it&#39;s all a bit foggy. We beg, plead, and negotiate for two more burritos to be made. After some back and forth, a beacon of hope comes in four words, &#34;we only have steak.&#34; I think, only steak... well I guess THE BEST POSSIBLE OPTION will suffice. The urge to broverdose into visceral grunts of happiness, and game winning high fives was overwhelming. After what seemed like hours of pensive anticipation our burritos were delivered. A tear of joy almost rolled down my cheek as I pulled back the foil blanket the little bundle of joy was wrapped in. Buttery tortilla perfectly toasted, freshly minced onion and cilantro, hot off the grill steak melting the cheese around it. It was a masterpiece. A $7 masterpiece.Yes, I had a few cocktails. Yes, my dinner earlier that evening wasn&#39;t amazing, but it wasn&#39;t terrible, nor was I intoxicated to the point where a dollar slice can be confused for edible. Nonetheless, I had my doubts. How could a stumbled-upon 3AM burrito surpass all that NY, SF, LA, and every other place that arguably has &#34;the&#34; best burrito? I don&#39;t know. Further investigation was required.Round two was during normal business hours. Instead of the carne asada I chose the chicken. The TV was playing Ghost Rider and while Nicholas Cage en español was an experience in itself, the chicken burrito proved that my suspicions were true. These are the best burritos ever.Thanks for ruining every other taqueria. Until next time Traspasada, until next time..."

And I am completely hooked on their pozole! It&#39;s so good: big portion, enough to feed a group of four. And they hook up all the fixings.La Traspasada doesn&#39;t look like much. It&#39;s TINY. Just a little counter with a few spots for dining in. So you&#39;re not coming here for a date. On the other hand, they do a great carry out business, and the young fellow usually working the front counter is always very pleasant and helpful.But if you can be bothered to stay and dine-in, La Traspasada will sweeten the deal by giving you a complimentary cup of their daily soup, which is always good.Highly recommended if you&#39;re looking for a high quality, low cost Mexican lunch or dinner!p.s. They&#39;ve also got a location up at California and Belmont with a lot more seating."

They were tasty, and ready in under 60 seconds, which is probably a record for Chicago-area taquerias I&#39;ve visited, and also indicates that they had the steak already cooked &amp; ready--which some might say isn&#39;t a good thing.The tacos were tasty, but I have to give them a low rating because they don&#39;t serve free water.

Yea, I couldn&#39;t say that in English, it wouldn&#39;t do it justice. I&#39;ve also had the carne asada tacos and cecina tacos, those are equally tasty.The multi-tasking cooks (cooks, waiters, cashiers, busboys) were so nice, they&#39;re the only ones running the joint and they&#39;re doing a perfect job.

A perfect balance of sweet, spicy and crunchy. I enjoyed it alot and it also cost me $13.50 but worth it for a once in a while experience. 4/5 for food.Bad: The minute we sat down it felt like we were being rushed by our waitress. She came to our table and mumbled the specials while clumsily flipping through the photos on the iPad. Then she basically rushed us into ordering, which we thought was super unnecessary. I also had a friend show up at the last minute and the host refused to give us an extra chair for her. He said that we couldn&#39;t add a chair. I noticed another table that was about to leave and it was clearly easier to fit a chair there and he refused to do it. In the end, my friend decided to leave and she left. I felt terrible and this place definitely lost a customer that day. Besides the good food, the service needs a little work.

Definitely my new favorite breakfast/brunch place probably because their menu is geared more towards brunch meals than your traditional breakfast menu.My friend and I didn&#39;t have time to stay for the 1 and 1/2 hour wait so we decided to order carry out at their take-out counter inside the restaurant (You can&#39;t called your order in ahead).We ordered the Chicken and Sweet Potato waffle, a half order of Blueberry french toast and an Egg-white omelette with shrimp. Wow! I thoroughly enjoyed all 3 of those meals.My favorite was the Chicken and waffle which is served with a melted butter and maple syrup combined sauce. The Sweet Potato waffle was cooked to perfection. It was a great texture, had great flavors and even had little pieces of chicken made into the waffle. The chicken that came with the waffle was a light piece of boneless chicken that was not overly seasoned or fried which paired deliciously with the waffle.I also enjoyed the egg-white omelette with shrimp. The shrimp were huge and had a great rich flavor. The shrimp were served on top of the omelette and then the whole dish was covered in a very rich and flavorful sauce. However I could do without the cheese-covered hash browns that come on the side of this dish.I also liked the Blueberry french toast but I am glad that I only ordered a half order because while it was great, the other two meals were much better. The french toast was thick and drizzled with the butter-maple syrup sauce and a ton of blueberries.Overall excellent brunch meal. Batter &amp; Berries is my favorite breakfast/brunch restaurant in Chicago. Definitely worth waiting in line, or ordering a take-out order."

The host asked us as we were being seated if anyone wanted coffee and it arrived immediately. Huge points for that and the fact that Batter &amp; Berries serves ICED water and not room temp yucky Chicago tap water (ahem! Little Goat and Yolk).Our server was nice and funny! He noticed that my fiancé was wearing a Louisville Cardinals shirt and joked that he might enjoy the apple bourbon pancake special (as bourbon is made in Kentucky). It was great that he was making jokes and connecting with us.The specials sounded great but we ordered the French toast flight and the biscuits and gravy off the regular menu. The food came out really quickly which concerned me a little bit.My French toast flight was delicious but could&#39;ve been warmer. The maple butter is mouth watering! I liked the caramel and the blueberry French toast the best. The lemon French toast was good but missing a little something, a drizzle of syrup would&#39;ve made it perfect. The strawberry French toast had a pile of fresh berries on top.I did also get a side of the cheese crusted hash browns which had gooey, melted cheddar cheese mixed into the potatoes and a really tasty cheese crust on top. For $3.50 you get a great sized portion. I had quite a bit left that I couldn&#39;t finish.It was a little loud in the restaurant and it&#39;s hard to tell if the restroom door is locked (scary considering guests are eating right outside and within view if someone opened the door). They also don&#39;t have diet sodas.Overall, I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more of the menu. Great spot and I definitely recommend to others!"

The most popular is the &#34;Flight of French Toast&#34; sampler which consists of four flavors of (Lemon Strawberry,Blueberry &amp; Carmel). Delicious!!I also had the &#34;Cluck-N-Gaufre (Goof)&#34; which is a chicken-stuffed sweet potato waffle With a lightly batter chicken breast drizzled in nutmeg hot sauce and maple butter...Best chicken and waffle combo I have tasted thus far! No syrup was needed, the sweetness of the fresh fruits was more than enough. Everthing was freshly made. All  chicken/pork sausage made in house.Our server was above excellent and took care of all my family&#39;s needs. We had so much food on our table we needed help arranging our drinks to fit. Prices were very reasonable $10.00 -$12.00 on average. There is only street parking only (meter) but parking is not expensive. Hours are 8AM-3PM. I visited on a weekday morning,  so I can only imagine the weekend crowds. Thank You, Chef Derek Rylon for a fantastic breakfast experience :)"

We went during the week just a little after noon and there was a wait. The hostess mentioned the wait was about 35 minutes so we put our name on the list and waited for our text. Surprisingly we only waited about 20 minutes (which was great because we expected an hour with the amount of people before us).This place has daily specials that they write on a board and the waiters always suggest great dishes. Our waitress was exceptionally phenomenal I wish I remembered her name because she made the experience above all. She suggested my boyfriend try the chicken and waffles and I tried the total flight.When our food came out extremely fast and she made sure our food was prepared properly/ She even went back to the kitchen for some more hot sauce for the chicken and waffles so he could get the FULL experience. GREAT taste when putting the chicken, waffle, hot sauce in one bite. My total flight which included all of the different flavors of french toast was a PERFECT amount of food with a different taste in every toast.Overall, we didn&#39;t spend too long there because there really was no need. The wait for table was quick, our food wait was short, our portions were perfect and our waitress was always on top of things. Definitely coming back again soon!"

The breakfast is some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. And every time our waiter list off the specials of the week my Hubz falls in love. There is also a special flavored French toast every week. To make things easy we always order the &#34;Super Flight&#34; which is all the main French toast plus the &#34;special&#34;. Overall this is the best breakfast place for a true foodie.I took a star away because they refuse to seat you even if someone is outside just paying the meter. Oh yea and don&#39;t not feed them because you will be enjoying the food so much you won&#39;t notice the meter maid writing the ticket.

I went on a Wednesday morning around 10am. I have visited the restaurant other times but never felt like waiting the 45-90 minutes to get a table and decided to go elsewhere. As expected, there was no wait. The restaurant was loud and busy but not crowded. Unfortunately, when I walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand. Several servers and busboys walked by but no one greeted us or offered to help. Everyone just looked at us and turned away. Finally, one hostess pointed to an empty table and told us to sit there. Surely not the best service to begin our dining experience but also not unforgivable.When our server finally came to the table, she explained what the specials of the week were. It was nice that she had an iPad to show us pictures of the entrees not listed on the menu. This was really enticing and effective method as both my mother and I ordered items based on the photos presented to us. Unfortunately, that&#39;s not what arrived to the table. My jerk crab omelet was incredibly flavorful but swimming in oil. The carrot cake french toast arrived to our table barely lukewarm and with few fixings. The hash browns that came with our meals were cheesy but overcooked. None of the items were as pictured. My mother also ordered a pulled pork sandwich to eat later in the day and was also underwhelmed with that selection.We spent $70 and aren&#39;t likely to return. This place came highly recommended but if the quality of the service and food is subpar on a Wednesday morning then I certainly can&#39;t imagine waiting for an hour or more for a similar or worse experience."

The Flavor of the jerk scallop omelette was full and thoughtfully put together. The cheese used for the omelette perfectly completed the seared scallops. I thought scallops and cheese might be odd together, but that&#39;s certainly not so.  The hashbrowns are out of this world. They were honestly my favorite part. The chicken sausage is clearly made in-house, as there are delightful bits of apple incorporated throughout the patty.SERVICE: The Food came out fast, and the waitress bought glasses for our champagne.WAIT TIME: The wait time gets pretty ridiculous here. So I would suggest coming earlier or coming on a weekday, if you are looking to avoid the line. Our projected wait time was 90 minutes, and our actual wait time was true to it. It would have been closer to 70 minutes, but there was a technical difficulty. I dropped my parents off to check in while I parked the car down the street, and I suppose the hostess marked our party as incomplete. (They will not seat incomplete parties.) So I walked into the staging area past the hostess, and sat with my parents as several groups of 2 and 3 got seated before us. After about 20 mins, we asked what was going on, and she noted that our party was marked incomplete still. So if you are waiting on people, be sure to notify the hostess so when the entire party is present."

I am not a fan of their deconstructed omelet - I&#39;d rather have my omelet assembled - but all the yummy flavors and textures were in the crab special.

The food is definitely made with skill and love!I took a star off because of the atmosphere. It is a very popular spot and the tables are close together  (reminded me of dining in NYC) and we felt rushed, not necessarily by the staff, but from the other diners hangrily staring down everyone while waiting for their table. I get, food is outstanding and lines are long so it must be torture to wait but it makes for an uncomfortable dining experience."

It includes the French toast of the week.ATMOSPHERE:- It was Friday afternoon and it seemed busy but no line (only if you come on the weekends). I would say people kept coming in every 5 minutes.- Besides the outside sign, there is a yellow &amp; purple theme inside.- Small in sizeTHE FOOD:- None of the Juices are fresh- As I mentioned above, I ordered the super flight french toast. I liked the blueberry toast the most, followed by strawberry. The white chocolate raspberry rum wasn&#39;t too bad. A little on the sweet side (I&#39;m not a big sweet tooth) but I enjoyed the raspberries. The caramel toast was too sweet for me. The caramelized nuts add an interesting flavor though. Not sure I like it with french toast. The maple-flavored syrup tasted fake to me (I use real maple syrup and no high corn fructose syrup at home so there is a distinct difference). Barely used it. The butter has a nice flavor.SERVICE:- I was greeted by the hostesses right once I entered in and placed on the center table (came solo). The center table seems to be used to place a party of 1 to 3.- My waiter was nice. I noticed how he served others at the table. Followed up on everyone.- My meal was served by one of the part owners, Chef Rylon.- One of the owners was present helping to serve.- The wait for my meal was normal (estimated time: 15 mins)Would I return back? Nope, not for food.Props to great customer service and the culinary creativity on french toast."

We went on a Monday and got right in. The staff is lively and entertaining. With the way they described the chicken and waffles, that was a must to get. My hubby got that and I got their scallop omelette. Secretly, I wish I just would have gotten what he got. The omelette was delicious, but his meal was out of this world! A waiter came up when we first got them to make sure that my hubby eats them in the proper way with a little bit of everything in the bite and then just stood there waiting for his reaction. And, there was quite a reaction! I would highly recommend going here. They have a full menu of breakfast goodies. The portions are HUGE, so you might want to consider sharing."

After months and months of watching the crowds line up and hearing car horns honking because of coveted parking, I finally had the opportunity to try this place out this morning.I got there a little past 9:30am. I thought I was early enough to miss a big crowd and long wait time. NOPE. I told the hostess it was just me, so I needed a table for one (womp womp). She estimated a 50 minute wait time. DANG! Every table was filled. There were at least 4 parties in front of me waiting for tables. Fine...I&#39;ll wait...better be worth it, I thought to myself.I sat down in their &#34;waiting area&#34; which is a little section of a couple of benches and chairs near the back. Guess what? I ended up waiting a little under 20 minutes. Score! See? It helps being a party of one :)Now breakfast is my favorite meal of the day at any time of the day. So even though this place is called Batter &amp; Berries, their omelets and other non battered and berried items sounded delicious. But no, I had to stay focused, I had to try at least one of the two.I decided to do their &#34;French Toast Flight&#34;. I asked about their &#34;Super Flight&#34;, and it&#39;s like the regular French Toast Flight, but with an added &#34;special of the month&#34; french toast, which this month is Tiramisu. Truthfully, I&#39;m not a fan of Tiramisu, so I passed on the Super Flight. I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs because my body literally NEEDS some sort of protein in the morning. I&#39;m pretty sure I get &#34;Lack-of-protein-headache&#34; like others get &#34;lack-of-coffee-headache.&#34;My food came out FAST. Within 5 minutes fast! Whoa!This shiz is delicious. I must say, I enjoyed every kind of French Toast, but blueberry was probably my favorite. My server asked if I wanted maple syrup, but I declined. That would have been sweetness overload! The eggs were soft and well made. They tasted a wee bit too buttery for my taste, but I enjoyed them.My server was super nice. She checked up on me often. The other workers were definitely on top of filling my water and coffee cups. Speaking of, the coffee was really good. Tasty and strong! They have a very efficient system of workers running this crazy busy restaurant.All in all, I enjoyed my experience here. Obviously the more people you have in your party, the longer you have to wait. This place is small so be prepared to eat closely to your neighbors.I would definitely come back."

However, if you&#39;re picky it can&#39;t have certain ingredients, be sure to ask what&#39;s in your meal. I had to send my meal back because there was cheese in the omelette and on the hash browns.The atmosphere is really welcoming and not intimidating at all.

Seriously nothing short of amazing! I got to try a piece of the crab cake benedict and scallops omelette and both were pretty good as well. We ended our breakfast with an order of the French toast super flight...WOW! aghhh I love french toast and this flight gives you a taste of the different flavors they have.Completely happy with the breakfast here, you must check it out.

The restaurant definitely did not disappoint.The food was phenomenal! I ordered the super french toast flight which included the apple pie, lemon, caramel, strawberry, and blueberry french toast. I&#39;ve never been a fan of french toast but I literally devoured all of them. From the freshness of the fruit and the sweetness of the caramel, I was very pleased. The bread wasn&#39;t soggy at all even though there were plenty of toppings on each piece. My other item was the jerk lobster omelette(no mushrooms or broccoli and used regular eggs instead of egg whites)! This was by far the best omelet that i have ever had. It was topped with a nice portion of real lobster and all of the seasonings and ingredients worked extremely well together (i didn&#39;t even have to add any salt or pepper which is a big deal for me). Just thinking about it makes me want to plan my next trip to Chicago (yes it&#39;s that serious,lol). Also the side of hash browns were delicious! Other items at the table were the fish&amp; chips (great) and the crab cake benedict which was my other favorite!The customer service was superb. The General Manager, Don, was very personable and went around to every table to ensure that all the customers were having a good experience while also recommending items from the menu. He also took the time out to take a pic with me when I told him that I had a food blog. Our waitress was also very pleasant and went over the items with us and answered all of our questions.I will definitely return every time that I am in Chicago. Not to mention that the establishment is black owned and is also BYOB. Great food, great service, great restaurant. OAN, be prepared to wait.

Was visiting Chicago over the weekend and stayed nearby and when we searched on Yelp for a breakfast/brunch spot this gem popped up and soooo glad that it did. I mean just to give it 5 stars is maybe not enough to express this amazing location.First, the food here is simply amazing. It was a group of four or us and we ordered the following: Chicken and Waffle ( sweet potato) , crab cakes Benedict, scallops omelette , and the super flight of french toast! If the names simply doesn&#39;t call you, trust me you must try this place. Everything was just amazing, freshly made, the service was quick.The location here is great, located in a nice quiet neighborhood with real nice clean streets, i felt like I was definitely in a nicer side of Chicago. We didn&#39;t drive here so not sure how parking can be around this area.The staff here was amazing, we were sat down quickly, although i think we got lucky and there was an available table for us right away. Either way our waitress ( think her name was Paula) was soooo informative about every single dish. Made us understand that there just simply isnt a dish that people dont like on the menu and now i know why.Again this place was amazing, prices are fair as well so I would definitely want to revisit this place whenever I am back in Chicago again. Simply great people and atmosphere as well.Compliments to the Chef (s) at this location!!!"

Although the wait was about half an hour, the food and service were good. They even let us bring our suitcases in when it was super cramped without making us feel bad!They have a special menu which is not on the paper menu but on a chalk board in the front and back of the restaurant so remember to ask for it. They have really delicious meals listed but seriously everything looked and sounded so good I would&#39;ve ordered everything. But then again I feel that way whenever I enter a restaurant. I am a true fatass.One bad thing though. My steak was fully cooked when I asked for medium rare.

The hubs and I waited for 35 mins for this byob&#39;d gem and it was well worth the wait!Everything sounded great so out took me awhile to decide on what to order. The regular menu looked incredible, but I do try to order what&#39;s on special whenever I eat out. Those selections tend to be the freshest. I tried the crab Benedict daily special and we split the kid sized special French toast of the day.....apple pie. Let me start by saying that I hate runny eggs and white sauces. But that crab Benedict was the real deal! The crab was ALL blue crab. Being an east coast girl, I was ready to harshly judge, but was super pumped that I didn&#39;t have to! The French toast was ridiculous .... And that butter....good lord! You could eat that stuff by itself, and by the spoonful!The hubs got the sweet potato waffle with fried chicken from the regular menu. Another ridiculously amazing choice! The portions were plenty, so we both had leftovers for another full meal! Another thing I want to mention is the house made hot sauce. Holy cow.

THAT&#39;S ALL, JUST MIND YO BIDNESS!  #namethatreferenceThis place is sublime from walking into the door until you get your check, pay and walk back out the door. They considered this menu. They made sure it made sense! They gave something for everyone. OH DAYUM, I can&#39;t choose, order the french toast flight that allows you to try all of the french toast because YOU HAVE TO TRY ALL OF THE FRENCH TOAST! The biscuits and gravy...CHICKEN SAUSAGE! When does that happen??v Those hash browns...cheesy goodness! I want to take these hash browns on my honeymoon with me! BYOB! Umm, sloshy breakfast anyone?? I haven&#39;t had anything here that I didn&#39;t thoroughly enjoy.The service. Crazy enough, I&#39;ve had the same server both times I went. He&#39;s amazing. He knows the full menu by heart, this man basically knows what you&#39;re going to order, before you do! I&#39;m promise, I&#39;m not lying.The sitting, the arrangement, the kitchen placement, they thought about this restaurant. And it shows in every aspect. The wait can get RIDICULOUS. So, I highly recommend going during a time that&#39;s not typically really busy, early in the morning. It&#39;s delicious."

We were sat in the back (on a cold winters day, the front of the restaurant gets very drafty with the thousand people opening and closing the door - which the server sporting long sleeves knew what she was getting into when she got her section that morning).Our server was bubbly and sweet, Leslie.  Very animated, I felt like I was at Disney!  Even though there is madness ensuing around me, she stays peppy and informs us of the specials and how many orders they have left of the more popular items that day.  With an iPad system, its like clockwork, a tight run ship.  I am very impressed.  She brings us a bain marie (in kitchen lamens terms its a cylindrical shaped insert for soups or sauces to be put into a hot or cold table in the kitchen).... not sexy, but serves the purpose.  She offers us OJ for our mimosas.  Ahhh, now the bubbly is here!If you&#39;ve read any of my reviews, you know that I&#39;m in search of this cities&#39; best chicken and waffles...  Of course I order the Cluck-N-Gaufre.  It is a crispy waffle made of sweet potato, and topped with a perfectly fried breast of chicken.  The spices are on point.  Served on the side is a ramekin of nutmeg hot sauce (which I tried, but the maple butter was good enough for me).  Oh my (if I could swear here I would), that waffle, every morsel was just holy.  I imagine church goers singing hallelujah coming here after service to indulge in this divinity.  The combination of the sweet potato and the saltiness of the chicken cured any Friday night ailments I may have had.  A real stand up dish.The cheesy hash browns were cold, and before I could complain, a server came and scooped the plate up, and replaced it within 60 seconds with a brand new plate of HOT cheesy potatoes.  Maybe a little salt needed, otherwise pretty good.Also had the bruleèd banana waffle.  Very tasty, nice thick pieces of biased sliced bananas, with a light layer of burnt sugar and creme anglaise.  It definitely could&#39;ve had more anglaise.The GM came over and was the jolliest of fellows (I&#39;d like to invite him over for dinner kind of guy), asking us how everything was and our input.  I am stuffed and tipsy at this point, and happy.  Belly happy.My only negative comment is the glazed mosaic tables.  The edges of the table and in the middle are very uneven, so you have to be very careful where you situate your glasses."

The wait was about 30 minutes on the day I came- not too long. It&#39;s a small locations but on a Monday afternoon it was surprisingly crowded. The server was friendly and knowledgeable offering images for all food. I found this very helpful. I ordered the buffalo wrap. It was drenched in sauce and came with sweet potato fries. The fries were good. My niece had chocolate chip pancakes which they loved. They were very accommodating of children. It was a big sugar rush for them. My sister got the fish and chips. It comes with a load of fries and 3 pieces of thickly battered fish. The restrooms were clean but you walk out and your right next to the kitchen.... Not sure about that. The owner is present and walks around. The volume was loud!

It was 11am on a Wednesday so there was no wait. Our server came promptly and told us the specials. He was so attentive to us and made us laugh several times. Now on to the main attraction, the food! My oh my was it amazing! I had the garlic shrimp omelet and I&#39;ve been craving it every day since I had it. The cheesy home fries were okay, Ib my opinion it&#39;s not a must have. What is though, is the French toast super flight!! The additional flavor of the month was jack Daniels and while it was sweet but you definitely got a kick of whisky. My friend had the sausage omelette and also raved on how great it tasted."

The only reason I give it 4 stars is the horrible coordination and wait times. They should definitely invest in a more efficient reservation and seating system. Tables were open yet the staff was joking and chatting to much to notice that the tables had been cleaned. BYOB was a plus of the establishment that I will take advantage of it we return. I would definitely try it for yourself if you are all about visiting the hottest spots. Please support black business as much as you can."

I went here with a couple of friends to try it out since my buddy was referred to this place before. This was honestly one of the best breakfast places I have ever eaten.They are famous for their chicken and waffles as well as their flight of French toast with over 100 unique flavors. I ended up getting the chicken Alfredo omelet and it was very tasty. All omelets come with their cheesy hash browns, which were also very good. I am not a big sweets person so that&#39;s why I did not get the French toast but my buddy said it was one of the best things he&#39;s eaten.This place is extremely popular with long lines and sometimes there are waits to be seated with it being a smaller venue. Very quick service so sometimes it may feel rushed but that is only because they need to turn over tables quickly with how busy it can be. Some people may not enjoy that but it did not bother me. All in all great breakfast spot and most people wouldn&#39;t notice unless you paid attention since it&#39;s a smaller location."

I asked for medium well it was burnt around the perimeter other than the burnt taste killing my taste vibe it would have been a 4 star. My friend had the veggie omelet, veggies were seasoned well, but they were not incorporated into the omelet they were all on top which we didn&#39;t prefer. Customer service was outstanding. Prepare to wait 1.5 hour. It&#39;s time for them to get a bigger space they clearly have the demand. Will visit again for the pancakes and to explore more menus items."

I can not stress enough how good this food was.On top of this amazing food they had the nerve to have a super awesome server. This man knew his stuff! hit every question out of the park like babe Ruth hitting a softball and he even gave us suggestions on places to visit in the city.Because I am a yelper I have to give a critique. YOU WILL WAIT TO GET IN. Do not go to this place thinking you are going to walk in and sit down. It isn&#39;t going to happen. you can hang it up BUT the wait is worth it for amazing food and great service.My only suggestion to them is that they should allow people to call ahead.

The servers are okay at they&#39;re jobs but it&#39;s the bus boys who fill up my coffee and water and check to see how we are all doing.The host was very rude when we came in and I asked if my sister and I could sit while we waited bc I wanted to get something in my tummy. I&#39;m 7 months pregnant and needed to get some juice or fruit bc I was hungry and yet I still needed to wait. She didn&#39;t even offer a juice in  a to go cup or anything. I will say that set my mood to be very annoyed with everything after that.Our server made it all better bc he was very nice and answered all of our question.

We were seated by the door and our coffee either was served cold or the wind gusts brought on by 8 degree weather made it become iced coffee. I couldn&#39;t really enjoy the food because my feet were cold inside of the restaurant.I would like to think that the owner lives in Chicago and that he knew that we have winter months and he should have prepared for this in september instead of subjecting his customers to cold food and even colder coffee. But my other companions really enjoyed the French toast flights and would like to go back.I had the lobster benedict which even though it was lukewarm is was pretty good considering the wind gusts in the restaurant.We do plan on going  back in the summer so we can see what it feels like having hot air coming into the restaurant.

Figure really can&#39;t go wrong when you saw bunch of good ratings(normally). When I walked in,  the place was cozy, wasn&#39;t anything fancy but it feels welcoming.I am a big tea lover, normally brunch places only have a few options, but this place have over 9 flavors. From the basic green tea, mint, earl grey to something unique and fruity: flower teas, peach, roasted almond(which is highly recommend).For my main course, I had the lobster and shrimp Benny(highly recommend if you did stop by). Their pouch eggs are so buttery and fluffy, which goes perfectly with the lobster and shrimp pancakes base. Not to mention, their hashbrown on the side were super cheesy.Eventhough I was there by my self, I got carry away by their French toast options. After all, quote to quote, this place is &#34;home of the famous French toast fight&#34;. So I ordered myself a lemon French toast in the kid size(super low key). It was just on point; very mild sweet with lightly tastes of lemon peels.I really wish I could go for 5 stars if the waitresses didnt&#39;t give me the wrong order of my drink and almost accidentally charge me extra for something I didn&#39;t order. But besides that, food and drink were right on the spot. Highly recommended for brunch."

I ordered the French Toast platter and was NOT disappointed. It came with 5 pieces of french toast, each one delicately laid out in a beautiful and colorful fashion. My waitress was very friendly and gave clear instructions a specific method and order to eat them in. There were fruity ones (blueberries, strawberries) and also nuttier ones (almonds). The butter was also a special concoction of flavors - not too sure what, but I loved it. I was instructed to eat from left to right, and I loved the order. I felt like I was being taken on a journey, from the more rustic wooden earthy nutty flavors which were warm and toasty for a cold Chicago winter, and then went on to the more sweeter and delicate fruit flavors.My friend got the chicken and waffles which were also really good, &#34;best chicken and waffles in my life&#34; according to him. I&#39;m a vegetarian so I didn&#39;t try it, but I trust him on it. Overall, incredible brunch place. I would give a 6 out of 5 stars if I could!"

He was friendly, knowledgable and extremely entertaining. Words in a Yelp review cannot do justice to convey the awesome service. He knew every special, had the most random jokes, and was on top of his game in every way. Great job, man. I&#39;d give him 5 stars of his own!On to the food, which deserves 5 stars in itself. We got the French toast flight - great as a nice appetizer and it gives you a taste of their amazing, incomparable maple butter. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it as a meal though.Entree - I got the blueberry waffle which was truly amazing. It&#39;s crazy...there was no syrup and no need for syrup at all. Have you ever had a waffle where you didn&#39;t need syrup because everything about it was so damn good? No? Me neither - not until I tried this place. We also ordered one of the specials - it was some type of lamb, goat cheese, spinach, mushroom omelette - also amazing. It was a great savory balance to the sweetness of the waffle and earlier French toast.I travel often and make it a point to do my daily foodie runs. I came out here expecting to fall in love with the pizza or something more &#34;typical&#34;...but this place takes the cake (or waffle? Lol) for the best of the 15 places I ate at over these past few days. I&#39;d dare to say this beats any breakfast place I&#39;ve eaten at in New York, LA, SF, Vegas, etc. I&#39;m not exaggerating. I&#39;m not kidding. I&#39;m coming back just for this.Lastly, they&#39;ve got the right balance of &#34;home feel&#34; but &#34;modern&#34;. The setting is like a cool home-like cafe, but they are on top of technology. They text you when your table is ready, they use iPad mini&#39;s to take your order and payments. They&#39;re extremely efficient - the wait is worth it.Cheers to you guys. See you soon."

My beautiful date brought me here with one of her besties and I had such a lovely time. We went on a weekday for brunch and there was no wait, which is unheard of on the weekend. I can see why.I had one of the specials: egg white omelette with mushroom, asparagus, onion, and huge seared scallops. It was delicious! I also had an order of the cheesy hash browns and was in love. My dates had the chicken gouf, crab cakes Benedict, and we all shared the french toast flight.EVERYTHING was good. Nothing was out of place. I would make pilgrimages to Batter n&#39; Berries for their specials alone."

I always go on a weekday because they aren&#39;t as busy. If you go on a weekend, I suggest getting there early or being prepared to wait.I always get the chicken &amp; waffles or french toast flight. I won&#39;t order these anywhere else as I&#39;m not a huge fan of the dishes, but this place makes me want to have them every single day for brunch! The food and service is always excellent. Only thing I could say they could do to improve is to build another location, or expand this one somehow because it is a bit cramped.Best breakfast place in Lincoln Park by FAR!"

And I very much enjoyed the salmon executive; perfectly cooked and the sauce was the perfect balance between the egg whites and hash browns.  Well executed mean. The waffles were a little heavy but the maple butter was legendary.The Bad:Service is really not good. Let&#39;s start with hostesses; poor communication.  It&#39;s an electronic list and both have iPads that are managing the seat roster. There&#39;s a preference for large groups so if you&#39;re 2 people and all other 2 tops are full, they will make you wait until a 2 top opens, even if there&#39;s a 4 top available. One hostess (blonde) had no idea what the other hostess (African-American) was seating.  Not well organized.  Furthermore, the hostesses just throw the menus down at the table after your seated; not just for us but we noticed it for EVERY table.  We also noticed this with the food servers (not the waitress); he would come to your table and lifelessly ask what you order and plop down your food.  My server was personable but when she noticed I didn&#39;t have sugar for coffee she came back and stuffed like 15 packets of Stevia in my hand with a &#34;here ya go.&#34;OverallThe food was good enough to almost overcome the frustrating seating. However, it wasn&#39;t enough to overcome the service. People rave about this place and I thought it was just OK as someone who considers themselves a breakfast/brunch fanatic in Chicago.  Prices are comparable to what you&#39;d pay at other establishments in Chicago; two entrees (egg dishes), 2 coffees and pancakes and french toast will run you an easy $60 not including tip.  I encourage you to explore other options if you haven&#39;t been already given there usually is a very long wait (we waited 90 minutes for our table) and the line is usually VERY long.  No reservations. The hassle of waiting and getting a table doesn&#39;t beat out the food experience unless there&#39;s something on the menu that you absolutely love or can&#39;t get a close facsimile somewhere else."

Such amazing flavors and bold and daring combos of hearty and satisfying food perfect to supplement your lazy sunday vibes!WARNING: Lines will be babout 45 min to 1 and half. I was on vacation and ran to the restaurant at 10 am to get a table at 12. Smart move if you can do the same!For lunch ordered the lobster cake eggs benedict and hash browns and the lamb chip trio. LOVED the lobster cake. If you are a crab cake fiend like me -- MUST Order. Also loved poached eggs and this smiffy seafood/egg pairing was the bomb! For the lamb chops -- not the best i&#39;ve ever tasted in terms of seasoning (i thought they were a little too oily) but cooked perfectly and sat on top of hash browns with gravy and the cutest little caramelized onions. Also had a sunny side up fried egg on top -- DELICIOUS!!LOVE chicago and LOVED this restaurant and will be back to try their other specials as well as that chicken and waffles!!

Came on a weekday around lunchtime and the wait was minimal. They text you when they&#39;re almost ready and then have you sit in the waiting area in the middle of the restaurant while they set up the table. Pretty warm and welcoming place. Also BYOB.We had the French Toast Flight to share (with the special add-on of the day, which was Honey Jack), and I got the Biscuits and Gravy. Worth it. Everything. The gravy was mouthwatering and delicious. My friends got other things, I don&#39;t even know because I was lost in my gravy. I&#39;d want to come again to try the chicken and waffles because.. chicken and waffles, but I wouldn&#39;t mind another order of the Biscuits and Gravy. Serving sizes are really good and the prices are affordable. I wish I lived in the area, but this would be a great place to have in any neighborhood."

We were greeted warmly at the door and shortly after sitting down our drink order was taken and our server explained all of the specials and her personal favorites. The service was fantastic, very informative, attentive, but not overbearing. She had great suggestions for what to order and even on how to eat what we ordered to get the most out of it.I ordered the enchiladas omelet, OMG amazing. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and everything with it was to die for, the chicken was seasoned perfectly, the enchilada sauce was divine, and all of the veggies were nice and crisp.My BF ordered the Chicken and sweet potato waffle, wow, so perfect, it wasn&#39;t too sweet and all of the flavors of the waffle, chicken and the hot sauce perfectly complimented each other.It is very clear that the chef, owner, and staff are well connected and it shows in the food, service and atmosphere.

This spot has the rare combination of amazing food &amp; a warm, homey feel. My only suggestion- bring your friends so you can order &amp; try it all: Spot-on breakfast staples (those cheesy potatoes tho!), creative twists like crabcakes benedict &amp; a lamb omelette. Sweet potato waffle with fried chicken was amazing, and the cantaloupe french toast was a darkhorse favorite - and I don&#39;t even LIKE cantaloupe!  Service was warm and wonderful, and our table cozied up against the window was the perfect spot to watch passersby while still admiring the place&#39;s brightly colored walls and funky paintings.

My husband is big on ambiance and exclusivity so I never figured he would not appreciate the often crowded, busyness of this place. I encouraged him to come. I ordered the steak omelet and he had the lamb chop omelet. The food arrived so quickly i was convinced it was the wrong order. It wasn&#39;t. After his first bite, my husband asked why I hadn&#39;t told him about this place sooner. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor of my steak omelet. I tired the lamb chop. There was a burst of wonderful flavor. We were in food heaven.The server was incredible. Personable, non-intrusive, yet attentive and engaging despite the busyness.

We went in the afternoon on a Sunday evening and had to wait about 1.5 hours. I came super early on a Saturday at around 9AM and still had to wait until 10. My cousin has had experiences putting her name down, going to eat somewhere else with a shorter wait and returning home before ever getting a text that her table was ready.For people that MUST try and prepared for the wait -- They do text you when your table is ready! I would walk in, put your name down and even strongly consider coming back or exploring the block. There&#39;s a couple of bars and cool toy store (Rotofugi) at the end of the block. If you haven&#39;t gotten your drinks for the BYOB yet, there&#39;s a 7/11 down the street with a acceptable selection. You could probably find a good coffee shop (or bar) in the area and just wait it out.The wait aside -- the food is quite amazing. I think the savory options are kind of limiting as I wasn&#39;t a fan of the steak in the red wine sauce (which comes on the menu three different times) but the burger I had was quite good. I&#39;ve heard the Chicken and Waffle is only &#34;ok&#34; and the Lobster Benedict (a special, not on the menu) was good but dense and hard for my friend to finish. Either way, if you find something you like, it will be absolutely delicious.To share, and what brings this place to the coveted 5-star area, is the French Toast flight. I would always advise to get the SUPER flight which includes the French Toast of the day (i have had the pecan pie, and banana pudding which are both great!)  The Flight is basically a sample of each of their french toast and each one is amazing. You will be doing yourself a disservice if you do not try it. My friend and I each got our own dish and shared the Super Flight at about 3PM -- we did not eat dinner that night.Last but not least, the pitcher of orange juice (or whatever juice you like actually, we got a mix of Orange and Pineapple) comes at 6.50 and they let you bring your own bottle. Great service for what it&#39;s worth including uncorking it for you. A mimosa at other brunch places will put you down 10 dollar per but here you can get many off of your bottle of choice. An amazing deal!"

However, once I had Batter &amp; Berries version, I can conclude that it is better.A sweet, yet savory sweet potato waffle with crispy fried chicken and some sweet hot sauce on top might sound weird, but boy is it incredible. Do not be alarmed with this combination... It has the right about of sweet, salty, spicy, and just the right amount of variation in textures that it is amazing.My boyfriend got the french toast flight, and thought they were good. I&#39;m not sure he was sold that he was getting his money&#39;s worth since it is essentially only two pieces of bread and he&#39;s paying over $10 for it.If you&#39;re in Chicago come in here for the Chicken and Waffles and let it blow your mind."

It was delicious :) :) The B&amp;B maple butter is a must! I loved it!! My boyfriend got the chicken &amp; waffles; there were chicken pieces in the waffle and he was in love with the dish!!

Portions are large (split a few dishes to try a variety)Now that we have the formalities out of the way, enjoy this amazingly succulent food made with the most TLC imaginable.  That was a bit dramatic, but seriously, the food is spectacular.  Once we were seated the service was fast and friendly.  Although it was crowded, everyone seemed to be engulfed in their plates presentation and the taste of their meals.  It was like being in a slow-mo movie.  The food is prepared and plated to perfection; colorful, flavorful, strategic and downright mouth-watering.  It&#39;s apparent the Chef, Derek Rylon, puts his heart into his work.Lobster Benedict - 5/5Veggie omelet &amp; Hash - 5/5Waffle - 5/5Batteries &amp; Berries is in a class of its own when it comes to breakfast.

It was a very tasty experience and I recommend you give them a try! The wait can be a bit long, but it&#39;s worth it. You give them your phone number and they can text you when your turn is coming up and again when your table is ready. We waited about 1 hour after being given a 1.5 hour estimate.They sat us at a communal table and were very prompt with our drink order. We got pineapple-orange juice to go with the bubbly we brought (they are BYOB) and one of the employees opened the bottle for us with ease.The food order didn&#39;t take long to appear. Aimee M got the Crab Cakes Benedict, Angela P ordered the Cluck-N-Gaufre (Goof), Osi V had the Executive Pork Chop, and I also went with the Cluck-N-Gaufre (Goof). We were happy with our choices and also enjoyed the others. The chicken and waffle with a sweet potato batter and sweet-n-spicy sauce was good, but I personally preferred the benny and the pork. Their pork chop was so tender! The pork sausage was good too, but next to the fried chicken it was a bit too much of a muchness. The cheesy hash browns were a nice side that went well with each entrée, though.We couldn&#39;t decide what kind of French toast we wanted so we made the logical choice to try the Flight Of French Toast, which gives you a sample of the Blueberry, Strawberry with whipped cream and maple butter, the Caramel with nuts, Lemon with shredded zest, and Chips Ahoy cookies and chocolate. I gotta admit that I was disappointed by this dish. The Strawberry was the crowd pleaser and I think that&#39;s because it had the most flavor and was the most moist. The Lemon came in at a close second, but all of them had a superficial flavor. It&#39;s made with a thicker toast and I don&#39;t think they were dipped in egg long enough. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s their normal way of prepping it, but it seemed rushed.We would definitely come back, but maybe arrive closer to 12pm so we can wait it out over at Atlas Brewing across the street."

This place is legit, and I love the burgers and ambiance. If you&#39;re a metal-head or just love burgers, definitely check out the corner, known as Kuma&#39;s. Not only do they have absolutely mouth-watering 0.5-lb burgers with crazy toppings and great metal music, they also have an awesome mac N cheese selection. I&#39;m not a big mac-n-cheese dude, but this place is great.This place has a cool outdoor patio as well, in the back, and the inside dining area is somewhat small... I estimate about 14 or so tables, but the tables are pretty close together, so prepared to shuffle your feet and between tables to get to your seat. No biggie really. If you don&#39;t want to wait to be seated, you can ask the staff to sit at the bar; wait times for the bar is usually shorter than for a table.Although this place has heavy metal music pumped out from their speakers, the music isn&#39;t super-loud where you need to yell at each other to hear what the other person is saying. Lighting here is a little dim, but overall, a great place to take a date or to just chill with the boyz.I got the &#34;Metallica&#34; Burger, which consisted of blue cheese (I&#39;m a sucker for it) dressing, lettuce, tomato, onions, buffalo sauce (sucker for it too!), and bacon. Cooked to however you like it, I went with &#34;medium&#34;. The burger was cooked perfectly and the burger was huge. In the past visit, I got the &#34;Lair of the Minotaur&#34; burger, and that was money too!. Pretty much, I have yet to have a bad burger here.They also have a Happy Hour from 4-6PM where they have some discounted beers on tap, so if you&#39;re in that area at that time, definitely stop by for some discounts (funny how neighboring Square Bar doesn&#39;t have HH specials, as of Sept 2016).For mac-n-cheese, you can pick your toppings. We went with the chicken and bacon. Note, if you don&#39;t like scallions/green onions, make sure you tell them, or else they will sprinkle them on top. The mac-n-cheese was nice and creamy and the macaroni was cooked perfectly. I&#39;m telling ya -- a skeptic like me, who thinks &#34;what&#39;s the big deal about Mac N Cheese? Why would people pay for it at a restaurant?&#34; the mac n cheese is definitely something you should try.BATHROOM REVIEW: Located near the back (near the open -air kitchen) the bathrooms are one-stallers. Inside, the bathrooms are rather dingy, and there is graffiti on the walls. Kinda cramped too. But hey, you&#39;re here for the burgers. Sit or squat? Squat!"

Today was National Cheeseburger Day and I&#39;ve read that Kuma&#39;s usually has a big line. This means there is going to be a ton of traffic and they didn&#39;t effectively handle it. We waited somewhere from 40-50 min for our food. Our server was good with checking in on us however I ordered a side of FRIES with my Iron Maiden burger but I got chips. Also the burger bun was cold but the burger itself was still warm so I think it was a time issue and they were trying to push out orders and didn&#39;t bother toasting the bun. Also it came on a pretzel bun which was too chunky so I ended up with a bunch of cold bread. And I don&#39;t want to seem nitpicky but I ordered a medium burger and it was well done (granted medium is a bit tricky to pull off but well I was worried about getting something too raw and figured tipping towards overdone would be safer since this was my first time here). I got beer as well and it came in a cracked glass.I probably should have said something because xyz happened but they were really busy and I was in a good mood and couldn&#39;t really be bothered. In retrospect, will I come back? Eh probably not. My advice would be to run better quality control because this was 3/5 so-so rather than all of those rave reviews you hear about. Either that or I was seriously unlucky."

Shame on me for waiting so long.I have heard TONS about Kuma&#39;s for years. Unfortunately, I had never gotten around to trying it out. Mainly because I was told it was small and there&#39;s usually quite a hefty waiting time/line (this became apparent and true the longer I was there Saturday). Aside from the popularity of the restaurant, I also heard the food was just plain awesome. My friends and I stopped here before our Revolution Brewery Tour Saturday and oh my gosh am I glad I finally got the opportunity to visit.One little secret about me: I love metal, heavy metal, new metal, old metal. Yes, I&#39;m talking Metallica, Slipknot, Trivium, etc. No one had told me Kuma&#39;s Corner was the coolest heavy  metal themed restaurant in Chicago. Walking into Kuma&#39;s was the biggest most pleasant surprise, ever. The walls are red, there are &#34;hipster killer&#34; beers, guitars, band t-shirts, beer signage and all things heavy, odd and in-your-face. Fortunately, when my gang and I had arrived at Kuma&#39;s we got seated right away. The waitresses and employees all had the same look: tattoo sleeves, dark hair and crude t-shirts. I loved it. Our waitress in particular didn&#39;t have the most outgoing personality but served us well. She was very accommodating, filled our waters constantly, made trips to our table to be sure we were taken care of and had the most beautiful tattoo portrait on her forearm. Respect.We had ordered fried pickles to start. These were easily the best I&#39;ve had. They were of decent size, there was a sufficient amount of them and my boyfriend and I agreed they had the tastiest and crunchiest breading. I wasn&#39;t even planning on ordering an appetizer but God dang I&#39;m glad I did. Two of us got burgers and two of us got mac &amp; cheese. I can only speak for the mac &amp; cheese but the men in my group both agreed it was an AWESOME burger - juicy, big and the fries that accompanied it were great too. The mac &amp; cheese comes with breadcrumbs and scallions on top and allows you to add ingredients from a list for $2 extra (list includes ingredients such as sun-dried tomatoes, bacon, broccoli, etc.) I had ordered the chicken for my mac &amp; cheese. This dish was VERY cheesy, tasty and the serving could literally last me 3 days. It was easily like 2 lbs of noodles. We were on our way to a brewery tour so we weren&#39;t interested in purchasing drinks but I would absolutely love to come back to try some of their beers.Overall, Kuma&#39;s Corner had already sold me with the theme of the restaurant. I&#39;m so happy Chicago has a place like this. No Katy Perry playlist or DJ blasting in your ear here. The food just confirmed my love for this place. I will DEFINITELY be back."

I forgot which burger I got but I subbed in a veggie patty. Apparently Kuma&#39;s Corner used to be very proud of not serving a single thing that was vegetarian/vegan friendly but have since come around to providing one option. And honestly, I wish they never did because the thing they pass off as the vegetarian burger is awful. Which is a damn shame because if they&#39;re so creative with toppings, they could make a bomb chipotle black bean burger from scratch that people might actually be able to eat. I would absolutely come back here to drink and hang, but I&#39;d pass on the food. Though if your priority is to get a burger to Instagram - then sure, grab a menu."

Hot damn this place is good.Came on a Wednesday and only waited about 30 mins for a table for 3. That&#39;s outstanding at Kuma&#39;s unless you&#39;re coming really late on a week night. Service is always really solid and they do a great job explaining the specials. I ordered the Pantera, an enormous hunk of meat on a pretzel bun with a huge roasted poblano pepper, several cheeses and tortilla chips. It was so freaking good. I could hardly hold the thing in two hands and get my mouth around it. Fries were really tasty too.One of these days I&#39;m going to get the mac n cheese and not just eat off my friends plate, but the burgers are always way too good to pass up. Kuma&#39;s is small, it&#39;s way out there in Avondale, and yes they play metal music pretty loud...but they have some of the best burgers anywhere.

The burger was one of the best I ever had.On Tuesday I visited Kuma&#39;s around 5pm to beat the rush, and excitedly ordered the fried picked and the plague bringer.The fried picked were very good. While the restaurant was quite empty, the burger arrived cold. The bottom pretzel bun was completely soggy and fell apart as soon as I picked it up. The burger patty lacked sat and paper, and was surprisingly bland. The tortilla strips were stale and chewy instead of crunchy indicating that it was not fresh. I left the restaurant very disappointed.The service at the bar was friendly and attentive."

I also had the Kuma&#39;s burger with chicken tenders and the Slayer Burger. There&#39;s a lot of options for the burgers and toppings. Mine were perfectly cooked as well.The Slayer burger was a meal in itself, there was a ton of fries, peppers ,sausages, and chili. Spicy too as I came to find out. I wished they would included some garlic bread or something so that you can make an actual sandwich. As it is, it is literally a patty laid on a bed of fries.The Kuma burger is pretty much your standard gourmet fare with a sunny side up egg to top it off. Chicken tenders were breaded well and cooked to perfection. It tasted good, but the egg got all over everything.Everything was great!The menu hilarious. What happened with the waffle fries?Overall, good food and you get some bang for your buck."

They play metal over the speakers. I didnt realize this was a metal themed restaurant till I looked around at the menu and establishment. They have a great selection of beer. They have pretzel buns. The pictures of their food is amazing. But sadly, I was not impressed. I ordered the Neurosis with bacon and an egg. Halfway through eating it, my tastebuds were not dancing with joy. The biggest problem is the beef. It doesnt pop with flavor. It has some flavor, but not much. The pretzel bun was quite sturdy in holding everything together; Too bad it wasnt as soft and moist as I wanted. The cheese was probably the only thing that really stood out. The fries did their job, but nothing to rave about. I didnt like the fact that adding ingredients bumped the price of my burger to $16.Overall, I loved the idea of this place, but unfortunately, the execution did not match the hype. i dont know if its because Im from Texas and grew up with amazing beef, but I doubt that this is to blame."

The wait can be long so go on a weekday or before 8 pm. The music can be really loud at times they should lower it. service good12$ Jalepeno poppers: amaiazing! Best one i ever had! Its not just like ur typical poppers. The outside is supper crunchy due to the panko bread crumbs n their not greasy or burnt. The jalepeno is fresh and big not supper small. The cream cheese filling is amaizin theres chorizo inside but wish there was more chorizo because theirs not alot. The dipping sauce is what makes it great, its a sweat sauce so it makes the dish sweat and salty. Would order again its not supper spicy as u would think cause theirs no seeds n the veins of jalepeno have been taken out. My only complain was it needed some salt it is busy so maybe they forgot to seasonMac n cheese $14: this is one of my favorite mac n cheeses. Its a huge portion its not ur typical lil container so be warned to not order more tjen 1. I got it this time with bacon and chicken. The chicken was flavorful not dry not alot of pieces and there wasnt alot of bacon in it either so plz add more! It was really cheesy no american cheese thank u cheese but it wasnt as creamy as i remember it was maybe they make it a new way? Still good the love the bread crumbs on top wish there was bread crumps on all of the mac n cheese not just the middle though. some of the pasta didnt have cheese on it so they might not have made a béchamel wish u must so its really creamy. I understand presentation is important but putting raw onions on sometjint is a no no the raw onion flavor over powers everything n ruins the pallet  still a really good mac n cheese one of the best ive had just fix the issues n itll be even betterSlayer $16: (we warned its huge couldnt finish it all) first lets talk about the actual burger its so flavorful!! Like u could jus eat the patty by itself its seasoned beutifully not bland at all. Then the size of it is huge ur really get ur moneys worth. Its cooked to perfection supper moist. The chili is the star of the dish its so flavorful one of the best chilis i ever had. It adds so much richness and depth to the dish. My one complaint is theres not enough chili, the chili is what makes this dish so Add more plz. Then theres fries omg omg their fries are so good perfectly fried u can tell they fried it more then once their supper crunchy without being burned or greasy i love these fries omg so good. One issue is i wish the fries were on top so they would stay crunchy n wouldnt get soggy Another issue they season them with sea salt so they could be a lil salty though but that can easily be fixed by changing the salt they use, n if u get an order with fried it comes with ketchup i think thats childish fries should always get served with an aioli still one of the best fries i ever had. Omg there is so much cheese I love it! Nothing goes better with a burger then cheese! Theres pickled peppers which add a nice acidic heat that cuts through the richness of the dish! Love the heat! Theres andouille sausage which i love but i like my sausage charred on the grill its a personal prefference just it makes sausage taste so much bettter but i loved the sausage its so much better then bacon. I wish they would add an egg to make it more rich and more decadent since thats what their going for, even adding some bbq pork would cut down some of the richness and the saltiness of the dish.i would order this in a heart beat one of the best burgers i ever hadYob 15$: based on the description it sounded to plain but it really is delicous perfect combination of sweet and salty. The bell pepper is really sweet and cooked nicely i dont like my vegetables to crunchy, the sweetness pairs beautifully with the saltiness of the burger. I dont like gouda cheese but in the burger it goes perfect with everything the smokey cheesy flavor makes the burger decadent, so mych so, that u will not stop eating it. Then theres bacon omg yes nothing makes a burger taste better then bacon. The sauce on the burger makes it so rich but its not to overwhelming with the garlic which is a good thing I have no complaints of this burger but next time i come i wanna try the more adventurous burgersFries:I jus wish instead of ketchup they would serve aioli cause ketchup is to basic. An issue with the fries is since they use sea salt they could be salty but this can be fixed with regular salt, or u can just remove the salt yourself.Bbq fries 13$: the fries are Their perfectly crisp. The fries have been fried multiple times without being greasy or burnt, it is very hard to make fries correctly and kumas corners does an amaizing job! I jus wish instead of ketchup they would serve aioli. The bbq pork is really tender and flavorful not dry or old which bbq pork can be. The bbq sauce is sweet but not overwhelmingly sweet. The saltiness of the fries and the sweetness goes perfectly togethe"

I reccomend ordering the burger medium, I got it that way and it was still a little raw."

Lair of the Minotaur- caramelized onions, bacon, Brie &amp; a poached pear burger on their pretzel bun. My friend got the Metallica. The pretzel bun is needed to withstand all the ingredients.

The music is by no means too loud and the windows provide plenty of natural light. The décor is a mix of quirky funny stuff and... of course, metal (albums). The bar is large and can seat more than a few, there are a bunch of tables (with plenty of room to move), and place is kept rather clean. We sat at the bar and had a full view of the (small) kitchen, so we got to see all the delightful treats the three cooks were making.Bathroom: Two words, clean and graffiti haha.Staff: Since we sat at the bar we only had the bartender(s) but they were super nice and accommodating. The place was full, not overly crowded, so everyone was busy, but we were well attended to. The cooks did an amazing job with the food as well.Food: We forwent on beers, just weren&#39;t feeling it, and instead had a root beer (from the tap, very tasty) with our burgers. We had a Kuma Burger (perfectly cooked medium) with fries (delicious) and a Black Sabbath with chips (delicious! Perfectly cooked and had a side of horseradish mayo that was outstanding!). The burgers are big, the sides are plentiful, and everything is delectable.Value: A (beef) burger + side is $10, how can you go wrong? Add in the cool atmosphere, music, and friendly staff and this place is a complete gem.We are huge fans of Kuma&#39;s Corner and already cannot wait to return to try one of the other burgers."

A house salad with basil vinaigrette was the perfect accompaniment to the massive Burger. The service was excellent as well.

I know it already has almost 5,000 reviews and all, most which are great reviews, but I feel it best to write an objective review for this location.My friends and I were craving a burger and since Kuma&#39;s is down the street from our new place, we finally decided to give it a shot. We started off with a round of Bloody Mary&#39;s which were tasty, spicy and delicious. An order of their Mac n Cheese and fried pickles to share.First dish to come out was their fried pickles. This dish and the bloody Mary&#39;s may be the only contributing factor to this 2 star review. If it weren&#39;t for these items, I may have had to give this place a single star.The fried pickles were amazing. Crunchy, airy and perfectly fried. The pickles were fried perfectly so they held onto their consistency and structure. I believe they use Panko bread crumbs so they were extra crispy. Also the batter stuck perfectly to the pickle. Don&#39;t you just hate it when the inside pulls apart from the batter when you take a bite? I do.Next to come out was the garlic jalapeño and chicken mac n cheese. From the photos and reviews we were expecting some pretty awesome mac n cheese. When I think about good mac n cheese, it&#39;s that crunchy crispy buttery bread crumb topping with ooey gooey cheese blend and perfectly al dente noodles. It has the topping but didn&#39;t seem to have much cheese in it, felt kind of watery in consistency. The biggest problem was that the cheese sauce they made was completely broken. It had a mealy texture which made it unpleasant to eat. Let&#39;s jus say there was plenty leftover.Finally the most waited for and anticipated item. The Kuma burger. It looked so good on arrival but as we eating I was truly disappointed. The bun weren&#39;t toasted, too much bread to meat ratio, don&#39;t know why but there were bites that were just so salty as if they had not mixed the meat mixture enough that left pockets of salt in the patty. I could only stomach half my burger.What&#39;s even more sad is that the fries were soggy under salted and just not proper.Had high expectations for this place. Nonetheless we walked out with tons of leftovers."

This place serves a heart attack on a plate. However, if you&#39;re comfortable on your way to heaven via nirvana, then Kuma&#39;s is it.This local tavern come burger joint has existed for a long time. One interesting tidbit about Kuma&#39;s is that it was hip before it was hip to be hip. The staff has always marched to its own beat, with plenty of tattoos, beards, piercings, and attitude. Now that these affectations are the coin of the realm, that the bar and wait staff have a sort of &#39;been there, done that&#39; attitude is merely an earned stripe.At one time, the idea that all of the burgers are named after heavy metal bands and the ambiance is serenaded with the same probably attracted a certain type of music aficionado. Now, it&#39;s just part of the charm. I can&#39;t tell the difference between the music of Goatsnake from High on Fire, but I can tell you the latter makes one helluva delicious burger. There is a precision to the execution of the burgers here, from the chewy pretzel rolls to the hand ground high quality beef. You&#39;re not limited to beef, either. You can opt for a vegetarian patty or a leaner bison patty for for an uncharge. What they put on them, however, puts these things into the the artisanal territory: poblano corn relish, grilled pineapple, brie, poached pears, fried egg, and the list goes on. There&#39;s usually a BOTM or Burger of the Month, which just might knock your socks off with creativity. This month&#39;s Deafheaven offered me a burger with a full serving of pork brisket, honey glazed brussels sprouts, and frizzled butternut squash. That was stupid good. You can opt for house made potato chips or fries on the side with your burger. Both are done crispy and just a bit brown. The chips are my favorite.Because you might not get enough fat from the burgers, they offer a sinful macaroni and cheese made to order with add ins from carmelized onions, to scallions, to mushrooms or roasted red peppers. The portions are ungodly.If that weren&#39;t enough, Kuma&#39;s has been a beacon to beer and whiskey drinkers well before the craze went viral. I love that the servers are well versed in which rotating beer selection might best accompany your menu choice.In the warmer months, you can enjoy your burgers on the patio out back. Otherwise, there are perhaps 12 tables and bar seats for the rest of the patrons. Unless you go at an off-time, be prepared to wait, because Kuma&#39;s doesn&#39;t take reservations.It&#39;s hella-good!"

Prefer the Au Cheval burger with bacon. However I nearly shit my panties here with all the loud music and dark decor. Definitely not for the faint of heart.Food alone was 4/5 stars. But the atmosphere is too much. Hard to enjoy a burger with throbbing eardrums. I can&#39;t imagine a family meal here either.

It is small and does not take reservations, so you will often have to wait, but grab a few beers and all is well. They have a metal theme, as in music, and it is playing loudly throughout. All the burgers are named after metal bands, as well. For me, the black sabbath was where it&#39;s at. It is a burger topped with onion then covered in chili. Delicious. The chili was generously heaped on and tasted great. What really sets it apart is the pretzel bun (I think all the burgers come with it). It tastes more pretzel-like than any bun I&#39;ve ever had, and it is thick, fresh, and soft. Really delicious. While waiting we had jalapeno poppers, which come filled with a cheese mixed with chorizo. Very unique and worth a try.Can&#39;t end this review without mentioning the entertainment. They had TVs above the bar playing snowy night deadly night, a horror b-movie with killer santa killing naked woman with weapons from his jolly red sack.One other note, the place fills up with smoke from the grill, not sure if they need to fix that hood or if it&#39;s just part of their charm, but your clothes will carry the scent of beef with you when you leave. At first that was welcomed because the place had a powerfully delicious smell of burgers. By the time we left, though, the smoke was hurting my poor eyes. Waa."

One of my friends talked about this place endlessly two years ago and I&#39;ve been wanting to try it since. My boyfriend and I got here around 5:30 on a Thursday night and the wait was very friendly. We were seated immediately. Pro tip: they won&#39;t seat you unless your whole party is there! Also take advantage of the beer specials!I ordered the Lair of the Minotaur burger (pancetta, bourbon poached pears, brie) medium rare. It was more medium than medium rare but still really juicy so no complaints there. The pretzel bun was also really good at keeping everything together. It was greasy, but what else do you expect from a burger? The pears were really good and the brie was so, so rich. Gripes: I felt like the patty was underseasoned. It honestly didn&#39;t have that much taste even though I knew it was solid quality. I couldn&#39;t taste the pancetta either.My boyfriend tried the Slayer burger, which was a RIDICULOUS amount of food. He eats a lot already and he was starving when we got there, but he only finished probably around half. I tried a couple of bites when we were there and it was pretty good - a little over the top for me, but hey, that&#39;s how Chicago does food. Unfortunately the overwhelming flavor for the Slayer is salt, so that made it a lot harder to eat. I couldn&#39;t tell from a few bites but he said that it was pretty much impossible to eat towards the end.Anyways, Kuma&#39;s is worth trying if you&#39;re a burger fan, I&#39;d say, but for us, it wasn&#39;t the best burger experience we&#39;ve ever had."

They do play loud Metal music, but you hardly notice after a while. Plus if you&#39;re into that kind of music, it&#39;s a plus right? The staff is friendly, and worked with my newbie-ness. Wish I would have caught the name of the girl who served us cause she was a blast.Over all the bill was a little high, but well worth it. I will be back and tasting other things.P.S.

I&#39;m glad she did because I was able to get a very manageably sized burger for a little over 8 bucks. About 5-6 burgers from the regular menu have lunch portions.Now for that burger! I got the &#34;Darkthrone&#34; which had chipotle peppers, pico de gallo, and goat cheese. The pepper and goat cheese pairing was simply delightful and the lunch portion size allowed me to crush my plate. The only thing left was the ketchup.

I was trying to save my 100th review for NYE, but my experience at the original Kuma&#39;s was too good to not write about it. We decided to visit on a Sunday early evening. For it being Sunday, it was pretty crowded. The original Kuma&#39;s location is tiny, but mighty. When you walk in, it does feel like you are in a queue backstage at a Def Leppard concert or something. Luckily, the bar is pretty big and we were able to snag a spot there while we waited for a table.I appreciated the fact that there was more than one cider option at the bar. They also had a few mixed drinks on special. The bartender was very nice and attentive. We ordered some jalapeño poppers and talked and drank at the bar. I also appreciate the fact that the metal music was not overbearing (unlike the Kuma&#39;s in Schaumburg) and I was actually able to hold a conversation with my friends. Lost Boys was playing on the TV, which was a double plus!We ordered a Mac and cheese to split between the four of us-with andouille sausage, caramelized onions, and garlic. It came topped with scallions anyway so don&#39;t waste your ingredient on that unless you want A LOT of scallions. I&#39;m not a huge Mac and cheese eater, but this was DELICIOUS! Enough cheese to stop your heart in 5 minutes. So goooood!We also ordered burgers. My husband got  the Slayer, I shared the Goatsnake with my friend who traded me half of his Metallica burger. My other friend got another delicious burger, but I forgot the name of it. All of the burgers were cooked great and, of course, were huge and delicious. I think the Slayer will feed someone for 5 days. My favorite burger out of the night was definitely the Goatsnake. Our server at the table was also very nice and was attentive all night. The only slight negative I had for the night was that it was very smoky all night in there (burger deliciousness or fog machine) and after a while my eyes started to burn (since we hung out in there so long).Such a long review, but to summarize: I loved Kuma&#39;s, I had a great time with my friends, we devoured a lot of artery clogging food for a good price and enjoyed every minute of it. I will make the trek to come back!!!!"

Frayed jeans, sneakers, flannel and jean vests were sported by (most of) the patrons and the staff alike. On the flat-screen tv above the bar, a very young and pre-politics Arnold Schwarzenegger was in a 90s movie. It was a Tuesday evening, and a friend and I went around 7:30pm and put our name was on the list- the wait for a table, 45 minutes.  The hostess told us we&#39;d have better luck eating at the bar, it&#39;s first come, first serve.I heard there&#39;s sometimes outdoor seating when it&#39;s warm but when I went a few days ago, it wasn&#39;t set-up yet.  (Sadly it&#39;s still too cold in June.) But anyway, a racing bike was secured to an upside down &#34;U&#34; a short distance from the front entrance, the black metal covered in street art stickers. And apparently Square Bar, across the street, opened JUST to take in overflow from Kuma&#39;s, so I&#39;ve been told.Me: I was like &#34;FINALLY I get to try Kuma&#39;s... give me a burger and a beer and I am a happy girl!&#34;Reading the look from my out-of-town visitor: semi-shock. &#34;What is this place?!&#34; This was not her usual scene... but she was a great sport and I PROMISED that Kuma&#39;s has &#34;one of Chicago&#39;s best burgers&#34; so she went along with it.  A fellow Yelper called this a &#34;pilgrimage&#34; which I found kind of accurate. Kuma&#39;s is a place everyone should go at least once in your life, to taste the burgers for yourself.The hostess kept an eye out for us and once two spots opened up at the left-side of the bar (we were 30 minutes into our wait), she dutifully signaled us to take those prized seats. Those seats, closest to the wall, gave us a little more breathing room, but we were still jostled around in our stools from people ordering drinks behind us.  Though, I live literally, right next to the CTA and ride the train all the time, I guess the jostling was not as bothersome to me.The BURGERS did not disappoint.Here&#39;s what we ordered:[burger] &#34;Iron Maiden&#34; - pepperjack cheese, chipotle mayo, lettuce, onion, tomatoes, avacado[burger] &#34;Absu&#34;- tomatillo salsa, pepperjack cheese, red onion avacado relish, quesco fresco, trio of breaded, deep fried chilis (on the side)[drink] Allagash White on tap[drink] Root Beer on tap (pretty amazing with a burger)The burgers alone were SPOT on. (I have not tried Au Cheval yet so cannot compare...). Kuma&#39;s menu and its atmosphere is one-of-a-kind.  After we were stuffed, kinda cramped and stepped out of Kuma&#39;s into the fresh air, and we both confirmed that Kuma&#39;s serves up some amazing burgers.  You might get jostled around a bit, and be on the brink of losing your voice talking over some heavy metal, but man, that was a great burger. Pilgrimage complete."

Definitely get the Mac and Cheese, but be prepared: the portion sizes are huge.Last point I&#39;ll make: the service has always been great. They were swamped, but no one seemed frazzled, or remotely short with us. I&#39;ll be back every time I&#39;m in Chicago."

There is metal blaring over the sound system and the art on the walls matched that theme. Even the burgers are all named after metal bands like Metallica, Slayer, Mastadon, Neurosis, and more.The place was packed but we were seated almost immediately. It was hot but that tends to happen when the kitchen is exposed like it is at Kuma&#39;s and it&#39;s summertime with the doors open, so no biggie.All the burgers sounded delicious but I finally settled on the Mastadon burger with a buffalo patty. Topped with Bacon, BBQ sauce, Cheddar &amp; Frizzled Onion. Not a super crazy mix of ingredients or anything out of the ordinary but food doesn&#39;t need to be fancy to be good. It was absolutely amazing! I always jump at the opportunity to get a buffalo burger. Plus bacon and BBQ sauce!? Ugh! So good! I definitely plan on going back next time I am in Chicago!"

We came here twice, one time on a Saturday and once on a Sunday. Both times we had to wait but Sunday was a much shorter one then Saturday.The staff here are basically all the goth kids  from your high school now working as servers in a metal music burger joint. Every staff member we encountered was nice though both times so no complaints there.The food here is my favorite part so let&#39;s talk about that a bit.  I got the led zepplin burger which comes with pulled pork on top, I also sub a ceaser which is always fresh and a huge portion.  The meat is delicious.  Perfectly seasoned and fresh everytime. We also had the fried pickles which were good but a lot of breading.The only reasons I can&#39;t give this place five  stars is because 1. there&#39;s no air conditioning, so it it&#39;s hot you&#39;re just screwed 2. No reservations and always a wait 3. The music inside is so loud you can&#39;t hear yourself think or hear what the person is saying in front of you"

Go for the burgers, you will not be disappointed. Try the mac n cheese while you&#39;re at it. We added bacon and scallions to our order of the mac n cheese and I was in cheese and macaroni heaven. I walked out of Kuma&#39;s super full and super happy. I don&#39;t even eat beef, but I&#39;m so glad they had chicken breast and veggie patties as options for non-beef eaters. The Iron Maiden with the chipotle mayo, cherry peppers, avocado and pepperjack cheese was exceptional and so full of flavor.I almost gave up eating all the food in front of me, that&#39;s how large these burgers and mac and cheese servings are. But I ate it all. It&#39;s really, really, really good guys. Just go. Thank you."

Holy crap, is there a better burger anywhere on the planet? Dive-y and oh-so-fun. Heavy metal decor and heavy metal music playing, but not at ear-splitting levels so even us old folks could have a conversation. TV over the bar played campy old horror movies while waited to eat. Totally worth the one-hour wait. Burgers the size of Frisbees, oozing with juicy, greasy deliciousness. I got the version with onion strings, bacon, and blue cheese. Now I am ruined for all other burgers. Crispy fries to die for; ask for a side of chipotle mayo to drag your fries through. I will come back to Chicago just to eat here again."

The pretzel bun was soft and warm while the burger was cooked to perfection. I ordered the original Kuma burger with a fried egg, which was an incredible combination. The fries had just the right amount of salt and were perfectly squishy. Overall, the menu had a ton of options (even for vegetarians).The only downside was the metal music.

Because I saved it for the 300th one. Kuma&#39;s is a big gigantic YES. Everything about this place is a yes. Come hungry. Or if you come at prime lunch/dinner hours, come a little hungry because by the time the wait is over and you finally get your burger, you&#39;ll be starving and ready to swallow the fantastic burger whole. You can&#39;t go wrong with anything you pick here - all the appetizers and burgers are delicious - shout out to one of my faves, the Plague Bringer because the roasted garlic mayo wins (and I rarely like mayo).Everyone should make it a point to come out to Kuma&#39;s if you&#39;re visiting Chicago because it&#39;s truly a pretty unique spot (it&#39;s only a 10-15 min walk from the Belmont Blue line stop). Yes the wait can be extraordinarily long and there&#39;s not that much to do around the near vicinity, but if you come with the mindset that the wait will be 2 hours, you&#39;ll feel much better when it&#39;s only 1. If you&#39;re not a heavy metal fan like me I suggest coming with good company on a nice day and sitting outside to eat instead. If it&#39;s a subpar day, suck it up and talk louder inside because the food is really worth it.Well, I&#39;ve decided I need to make another stop soon.....I miss those days when I lived so close."

After ordering a two brothers beer I placed my order. Having a large variety of burgers an different types of toppings I settled for the kumas burger with my egg fried hard. One of the best burgers I&#39;ve had in a long time. The Long Island was kind of to sweet for me but tasty. I have to admit it&#39;s a heavy metal type of environment. From the staff to the writings on the walls in the rest rooms to the heavy metal music. Good for friends to hang it at. Patio wasn&#39;t open due to it was closing soon. Try it.

We sat at the bar while waiting for our table and were told we would be kicked out of our bar seats if someone wanted to eat there...whaaat???  There were other empty seats and we were drinking.  Anyway we decided to eat at the bar for fear of being evicted. That was a mistake because the bartender was about as crabby and unpleasant as I&#39;ve ever experienced. It was almost comical. Like being at Dicks in Vegas but these people were not kidding around. They were really that bitchy. Now the only salvation is if the food turned out to be amazing.Tried the Kumas burger and it was average.  We have a dozen places in Grand Rapids with better burgers. Also tried the chorizo stuffed poppers which were good, not amazing. All in all, 2 rounds of drinks, 1 burger and the poppers ended up at over $60! Don&#39;t expect much more than a tiny dive bar with loud heavy metal music, pretentious staff and average food."

I opted to share the Pantera burger and was so glad I did. The burger portion was huge and more then enough fries to feed two people. My favorite part of the Pantera besides the patty had to be the tortilla strips, there&#39;s just something about that nice crunch that just satisfies the taste buds.And if you thought the burger was huge you haven&#39;t ordered the build your own mac and cheese yet. We build one with caramelized onions and andouille sausage and it completed our meal. The mac and cheese was the right cheesiness without being too heavy, yum.Being a party of 6 we had to wait over an hour plus, however, the only 6 top they had opened up, but instead of giving it to us (the only party of 6 waiting) they gave it to a party of 3 who could of easily waited another 10-15 minutes for another table instead of making us wait the extra 45 minutes. This did not make sense to me and what got me more upset was the fact that they were going to turn the table next to the 6 top we just sat down in, into another 6 top, which they could of done for us this whole time. So I don&#39;t recommend  groups coming here at all.Also I&#39;m not sure if the vent was broken, but while waiting inside we were suffocated with smoke, yikes."

I know that most people who come to Kumas are getting a giant, beef, medium-rare patty of deliciousness. However, my boyfriend is a vegetarian and I am a veggie patty enthusiast.

I eat beef but their veggie patty was (is??!) so good that I could not resist.Last night I had a really rough day at work. Let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;s been a rough week. A rough month. I knew exactly what I needed: that mother fucking kuma&#39;s veggie patty.Alas, when I got home with my carry out my tastebuds were in utter disbelief. My beloved kuma&#39;s veggie patty was now a black bean-based, southwestern inspired, mass of disappointment.

I had quite a bit of time to kill during my last trip to Chicago so I decided to drop by and grab a burger (or two) to go for my flight home. The thing that sets Kuma&#39;s apart from every other burger joint is the super awesome pretzel bun. SO. GOOD. I decided on the &#34;Led Zepplin&#34; and the &#34;Plague Bringer&#34;, which were vastly different, much like the bands they&#39;re named after.The &#34;Led Zepplin&#34;, much like its namesake, was softer around the edges with Southern comfort flair. It had Bacon, Slow cooked Pork Shoulder, BBQ Sauce, Sharp Cheddar and Pickles. It felt like you were hanging out in a friend&#39;s backyard with cold beer and watching football. The pork was super tender and flavorful as it was slow cooked for days, the BBQ sauce had just the right amount of tangy-ness, and bacon... well... duh, it&#39;s bacon, what&#39;s not to like.The &#34;Plague Bringer&#34; was like a punch in the face, but felt really good. It had Roasted Garlic Mayo, Crushed Garlic, House-made Hot Sauce, Jalapenos, Tortilla Strips, Lettuce, Tomato and Onions. I&#39;m a big spice head so the house-made hot sauce and jalapenos really spoke to me. The burger was amped up with flavor and the tortilla strips added a great textural contrast akin to adding fries to a burger. Pure awesome.Overall, the service was friendly providing some helpful advice and the food is face-melting good. I actually ate the &#34;Led Zepplin&#34; at the airport before my flight and ate the &#34;Plague Bringer&#34; for dinner when I got home. You know a burger is good when it lasts about a 3 hour plane ride and still tastes incredible. A burger here will change your life forever. *Drops the mic*"

I have been reading about this place for years but, the idea of long waits has kept me away for all this time..   As anyone who knows me can tell you, I absolutely hate crowds and hate waiting even more.  A few nights ago, as I was deciding between  going to bed or having dinner, i decided to roll the dice.. Figuring, 10 pm on a Tuesday night would be my bet, i decided to take a run at Kuma&#39;s..I drove up to see from the outside a bar/restaurant that looks like your generic Irish Pub Design.  Nothing special so far, i think to myself.. Well, with all the talk of the heavy metal aspect, i was expecting a blacked out building with a skull and cross bone painted on the outside..I walk in to see the place pretty packed.. A long curved bar that seats maybe 30 people..  The staff all tattooed, ear stretched and septum pierced.. Death Metal blaring, the place darked out, Friday the 13th playing on the televisions with subtitles.  I am greeted by smiles from the staff.. I take my place at the bar and peruse..I look over the beer menu and go right for the dedicated Three Floyds Tap.  They have 4 Roses on Tap, they have Jack on Tap, they have several whiskey&#39;s on tap.. I am driving, I have no intentions of drinking 4 roses.. Though, I hope someone else orders it just to watch the process. They are serving the Kolsch and Zombie Dust.. I order the Zombie Dust and order their classic burger minus the fried egg.  Right now this place is batting a thousand,  I am so excited for this freaking burger..The burger is made to order and it&#39;s a big patty.. I would guess close to 8 ounces.  You can order the degree of doneness.. I asked for medium rare.. I drink a beer and watch the movie:  The burger comes after maybe 15 or 20 minutes.. It looks pretty awesome.. The first thing I notice is the pretzel bun.. It seems really, really solid as in dense.. A little smushed and room temp...The fries appear to be skin on and made in house.. They are hot and salty and delicious..  The burger has a ton of melted cheese, criss crossed crispy bacon.. The burger is served with lots of raw onion.. Everything is checking out.   I bite into the burger and it&#39;s salty.. Salty in a good way, then you taste fresh ground beef cooked perfectly medium rare.. It&#39;s juicy, it beings to pool in the plate.. perfect for dipping the fries.. The bacon is crispy, the cheese is a perfect melty match..  I am a very happy man..  About half way through the burger, i abandoned the bun.. It was too dense and I was getting full... While it was not bad, it certainly was the least enjoyable thing about the burger..  I finish with a knife and fork.. I make sure there is no more burger left on the plate..To sum it up, this is one fine burger.. The setting is fun.. Especially for someone traveling alone, sitting at the bar.. It&#39;s dark, it&#39;s loud, there was a great movie on the screen..I can see this as a regular spot on my Chicago rotation..   Is this one of the best burgers in the country?  I can certainly understand why someone would say that."

It&#39;s pretty far off the beaten path, but was worth the trip!While waiting for a table, I saw a couple sharing the Mac and cheese and it looked SO good. Seriously debated if I should order that, but we came for the burgers, so I passed on the Mac (until next time!).I ordered the goatsnake burger and the flavors were great! I didn&#39;t want to carry leftovers so naturally, I finished the whole thing. Could&#39;ve easily been two meals however.I have recommended this place to my friend who is a self proclaimed burger connoisseur and he gave it a thumbs up!"

Just so-so and cooked medium well when we both ordered medium rare. The theme of metal music should be abandoned and they should really study up on some basics and some common courtesy when dealing with customers. At a busy hour we were all treated like cattle. Word is these guys are into black magic. Watch out or you might end up in their lunch special.

I actually took my girl with me because she&#39;s a burger fan herself. I was told to get there with time to kill because it gets busy since I was going there on a Friday night. I actually got there at around 8, and I see about 10 people outside hanging out, but what&#39;s more surprising is that we all got seated within 15 minutes, and I mean everyone that was outside.  I was impressed. Anyways, I&#39;s a fan of Mac and cheese so I usually order a side order of it where ever I do. This Mac and Cheese was ON POINT. We both enjoyed it so much that we agreed not to finish it because we still have our burgers coming out. The food took a lil long than usually but I usually don&#39;t get mad over it cause I saw how big the burgers are, how busy it is, but if it comes out cold (which mine wasn&#39;t) I don&#39;t care. take your time with my food. I Kumas Corner burger, and that burger was peeeerfect. The beer choices are awesome!

I loved the menu and the burger creation. The atmosphere was a little more hipsterish than I would go for typically. The music that was playing wasn&#39;t necessarily my style, but the music or the hipsters did not distract me from devouring the burger! I loved the beer selection and loved some of the fun ingredients the chef uses in their creations. Absolutely brilliantly laid out menu. The temperature and quality of beef that was served was also top notch. The pricing was also right on point for the caliber of cuisine. Even though I was a tourist in the city I felt like and ate like a local!  I would certainly return."

Heck these days even the food trucks in SF Bay area sell small a$$ burger and fries for 15 bucks so in that comparison Kuma is way better.I have tried at least 50% of all burger types and on my recent visit I tried Iron Maiden. I have to say it was very good.My test of a good burger is that it should be so tasty that I don&#39;t have to use ketchup with it and Kuma&#39;s is that place. Burgers are not just  patty of meat, they are flavorful and each burger has a distinct taste.Kuma&#39;s corner and Hot Doug&#39; (closed now) are two places which I hold at very high regard in Chicago area.

You won&#39;t find such juiciness elsewhere.Visiting Chicago, I did my research on Yelp on some of the best eats. Of course I saw Kuma&#39;s with it&#39;s 4,000+ reviews. Thousands of reviews can only mean that it&#39;s popular among Chicago citizens. Furthermore, a good friend of mine raves about this place saying he could eat it every single day if he had enough to afford it.This was the first meal I had in Chicago and I was shocked by the portion size. You better come ravenous cause there is going to be a lot of food. Since it was my first time, my friend agreed to split a burger and mac-n-cheese with me. You build your own mac-n-cheese here by choosing two toppings. You can choose additional toppings for an additional cost. We decided to go with the chicken and the sweet corn. For the burger, we shared a Mastadon which had BBQ sauce, bacon, sharp cheddar and frizzled onions. The burgers are recommended to be medium although they will do the wellness to your preference. I was very pleased that they will give you exactly what you ask for. Medium is medium and you can see the pink and juices on the inside. Cutting the burger in half felt like a sin but it needed to be done so I could have my half! The meat patty is so meaty and thick. The BBQ sauce is slathered everywhere and I love the texture of the frizzled onions. It adds that hint of onion slice you would get on a normal burger but in it&#39;s own fried way. The bun is a good vessel but I do find that it gets a little soggy. Each burger comes with fries. They are so dark that I almost that they were sweet potato fries. The fries are pretty average in my opinion, nothing too special.The mac-n-cheese was delicious! The bowl and portion is giant. I have never seen so much mac-n-cheese in my life. Between my friend and I we only got through half the thing. It&#39;s perfectly cheesy in every way possible. I never thought of putting chicken in mac-n-cheese but I really liked the combination with the corn. Each piece of chicken was small enough to be present in each bite, without feeling like you were just eating slices of chicken. I love how the sweet corn added some texture and pop of sweetness to the rich and salty cheese. I would recommend sharing the mac-n-cheese with someone!Service was great. Our waitress was witty and had some humor. Food came out promptly and we were checked up on at the right times.There is just something really comforting about eating such fatty burgers and ridiculously giant mac-n-cheese. I can see why my friend loves this place and hopefully I can come back to eat it with him again."

I really appreciate that it is handmade, and feels super fresh, but it is not that much food at all. And it is served on a pretty big plate, making it seem a bit sad.

Loose white...watery and loose, and the yolk was indistinguishable from raw. I think I would prefer it slightly cooked more, poached even, for texture anyway.  I sent it back, and then it came back completely opposite.  Dry quinoa, and the chef suggested over medium (edges slightly browned).  It lacked salt, so, I was....well...I lost my appetite for it.  The grits were tasty enough, and I enjoyed the cheese, however, someone was very heavy handed with the black pepper.  Whoa!  Kinda can&#39;t taste my own own taste buds.  The pancakes were a good sized portion, but a wee bit dry.  The syrup (said to be a bourbon maple), sure had the bourbon in it, but very hard for me to distinguish if it was actually maple or more like pancake syrup with bourbon, Hmmmm... The bacon jam was spot on!  The whiskey butter to moisten the pancakes would have been amazing had it not been for the scallions/chives in it.  The bitterness completely threw the whole thing off whack.  Not a lack of execution, but definitely a lack of formulation.As for the pastries inside, some were underneath glass domes and fresh, and the others (I had read that people were upset they were wrapped in cellophane) looked fresh, but because you have to keep baked goods covered (health regulations), I fully understand why they are wrapped.I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be back, but its off my list to try."

Upon enquiring about our order I was told it was up next. The barista gave his apologies all around and I asked how others received their order before me. He said &#34;we&#39;re not really an in &amp; out coffee shop, plus our orders are just piled up on the counter and they get mixed up and some people are just like I gotta get outta here so we try to get them taken care of&#34;...

One of the most perfect sunny-side-up eggs I have ever had with the tastiest spicy mayo and smoky ham! Not normally a fan of spicy mayo, but decided to throw caution to the wind -- it was not super spicy and was almost a little more tangy than spicy -- so delish! My dad got their traditional breakfast with rye bread -- AMAZING! Some of the best rye bread we have ever had.

Quality of the coffee is high and enjoyably flavorful.One of the previous comments chimed in on price... that would be the only thing I would negatively critique on my breakfast as well.

Nice ambiance and wonderful patio.Unfortunately, the food bombed pretty bad. I ordered a burger with some home fries. The burger was unexpectedly tiny for the steep price. The weird thing was that the patties were ridiculously salty - and this is coming from someone who loves salt. The rest of the toppings were alright. The home fries were barely salted at all and were also nothing special.On a positive note - their ketchup is really good.I wish I had read some of these reviews before I came by.

We thought we&#39;d reach out before we share your review with the staff. Two stars - for an entire restaurant because you didn&#39;t like the grits?We&#39;ll make sure to &#34;work on it&#34; and after we do... just wait for us to call, you know, so you know it&#39;s safe to come back.All the bestResponse:Alicia:I gave Spoke &amp; Bird a bad review for the awful grits.  You then decide to post snide remarks, instead of owning up the shortcomings in making grits.  When I took my dish back into the restaurant, I asked the staff where should I put my bowl.  A kind staffer said she would take it and clearly saw that the bowl was still full.  I got a weird look from her and thought normally someone would ask if I didn&#39;t like the item.   Instead she took it and walked away.  I now presume that she is used to people returning the grits.  She did not even offer to refund me the $5.00 that I paid for that abomination of a southern staple.Now, I see that you are upset---as I can tell in your passive aggressive tone---that Spoke &amp; Bid only got two stars.  Actually, my written review gave you negative two stars for the grits, which is now updated for one star due to you.  I have only visited your place once---in most instances you may have only one shot with a customer.  I made an food ordered, which you represented as edible, and your establishment took my money.  I was served something that was inedible and I will always believe that those were the worst grits ever served.  That was, and will be, the basis of my experience with your place---nothing more, nothing less.  I have zero desire---after my first experience coupled with your response---to really try anything else on your menu.I noticed that in one of your reviews you thanked someone for their positive review and you said you were glad that everything was good.  However, I notice that when the review is not so good, you go after the reviewer.  It is not my fault that you cannot make proper grits or failed at making grits.  So instead of me waiting on you to &#34;work on it&#34; or for you to &#34;call me&#34; when it is &#34;safe to come back,&#34; I&#39;ll just take my money and go elsewhere, never to return to your business.Matthew06/07/2016:So now it seems I am to blame because you &#34;employee [sic] a lot of college student[s]&#34; and haven&#39;t trained them.  That is somehow my fault and not yours as the business owner.And you impugn my ethics and morals because you have made the worst grits ever served?  I am pretty sure you cannot find worse grits than yours!Matthew"

I live in the neighborhood and decided to give this a try for a Sunday brunch.You have to order and pay at the counter, then the food is brought out to you at the table. The ordering place is tiny and awkward if there are more than a few people in line. Hubby ordered the strata and I ordered the mushroom omelette entree - I requested for less chees and only for egg whites. We sat outside - which is great for summer. There are a lot of families with dogs (dogs are allowed) and the atmosphere is very nice. The downer is the food. FOr the kind of prices that they charge, I expect the food to be very good. The strata was two small pieces with a side salad. It was practically burnt. Not on the inside, but the outside crust was black with a few spots of non-black surface. Very bad!!! My omelette was ok - greasy but they made the substitutions that I had requested for. There is a surcharge for only egg whites. So I paid upwards of 11$ for an egg white omelette - which came with nothing else. Not even a piece of toast. Its a total rip off for the quality of the food served. I still give it two stars - and that is only for their outdoor seating, &#39;cos its very charming."

Take a few moments and watch how much time they spend preparing a humble beet. The eggs are always perfectly prepared. This is not your usual north side 10 pound omelet. This is fresh local ingredients, perfectly prepared each time.3. The best damn patio in the city. Ok, outside of the lake or river.

Because the patio is awesome.  The breakfast menu sounds good, so I&#39;m going to come back and give it another shot.  If breakfast sucks too, then I&#39;m done with this place."

The setup is a little strange where you go order on one side of the building and then go find a seat in the hallway or in the room on the other side. Kinda like corner bakery system.The food took about 40 minutes to come out. Portions were extremely small for the price tag. Not particular good either. We got the carbonara and bird burger. The pasta was about a 5 oz portion with sprinkles of bacon bits. The burger is a size of a white castle slider with bigger meat patties.Coffees were ok, not great. If you&#39;re here for the atmosphere, maybe itz ok. I would pass for the food.We also noticed there were cases of milk just left out there in the hallway the entire time we were there.

Like previous comments, the location is rather intelligent and the outdoor seating is great (minus the red bugs crawling all over the place).The ordering area is like a 7-eleven...rather awkward as people sometimes have to cross in front of you to get to the indoor seating or to pickup the beverages in their open cooler. Needless to say, the prices being so high led me to believe that the serving size would be fairly sizable and the the taste, excellent.Not so much...Food was not good. The horseradish or mustard on my brisket nearly choked me everytime I took a bite. The sides were not that great. My wife&#39;s turkey burger was very dry and like ground turkey. The portions were not large either. AND... No bbq sauce. I didn&#39;t find that out until we got the food. The sauce they gave me was absolutely horrid.Great concept and location.

We were very impressed.On April 1, we stopped in for a lunch. The ordering is funky as you walk in and see the cashier off to the left, but the quirkiness is endearing. You figure it out pretty quick. I ordered a smoked hotdog sandwich, a Lagunitas Little Sumpin Sumpin and my wife had a BLT.Prices are above average, but so is the food quality. Everything was incredibly fresh- my smoked dog could have been plucked from a perfect July cookout, and the bacon on my wife&#39;s dish was perfectly thick and crispy. We waited about 15mins for food to arrive and we devoured everything. It is worth the wait and pricing; they set an expectation and met it.In fact, we were motivated to stop in on Sunday April 3rd in the afternoon- their gorgeous, tree-covered patio outback was open, so we ordered a PBR and enjoyed the 70 degree weather.This was a well-above average lunch with great beer selections to boot.

I checked with the cashier after about 25 minutes and was told that it takes 30 minutes for food, but it would be about 10 more minutes.20 minutes later, my girlfriend checked again and a server told her she should ask the kitchen staff directly. Weird. But she asked and they explained to her there was a fire in the kitchen, which delayed all the orders. They said it would be about 10 more minutes.15 minutes later, the food comes out. My &#34;classic&#34; breakfast was subpar. Small portions. The eggs (over easy) were cold, and covered in pepper. Home fries and sausage were lukewarm. If there was a fire in the kitchen that delayed the food prep, why wasn&#39;t the food hot?Girlfriend had the carbonara, which was also lukewarm and nearly flavorless. Her coffee was full of coffee grounds. Probably the only thing I liked about the whole meal was the jam on the toast. Even there they only give you about a half a teaspoon worth. The sausage was all right too, but would&#39;ve been better hot. We ended up going to get a pizza after leaving here starving.Great concept, but extremely poor execution. We won&#39;t be back."

It was a beautiful Sunday morning, so we were fine with that and were lucky enough to snag a table outside pretty quickly.We ordered coffee, which we received right away. We also ordered two meals, so we were given a number to place on our table. After about 30 minutes, we noticed that the 3 groups that had been ahead of us in line still had not received their orders. This was still the case 15 minutes later.At this point, we&#39;d overheard one of the waitresses explaining to the group nearby that there was some kind of hold up in the kitchen. We were never given any information, nor did any of the servers check in with us. Our coffee was long gone, so we ordered beers - hoping our food would arrive soon.About 75 minutes after we&#39;d ordered, we finally got a server&#39;s attention and asked what the wait was about. She explained that they had new cooks and that they had run out of home fries, and offered a timid apology. We asked if we could have some compensation for our time (the beers, for example - which we would not have ordered if we hadn&#39;t waited so long). She said she wasn&#39;t able to do that...and offered us a cookie instead. Fortunately, our food arrived at that moment - over an HOUR after we&#39;d ordered.

The concept is better executed this time and the patio is very kid friendly to have a beer with your stroller.  I&#39;ve come to realize that the prices reflect creative food. Before the food didn&#39;t live up to that. Now I get it since the food improved. Plus they have a small but really impressive and hard to find beer list.

Hah!)Coffee - they brew fancy stuff and it&#39;s typically good.  However, if you just want a coffee, you have to wait in the same line as people ordering food - they only have one register.Food - Mediocre and expensive for a &#34;cafe.&#34; Portions are tiny.  I once paid $10 for an egg mcmuffin with a few dried out home fries on the side.  My girlfriend had the porridge (also around $10 for a cup or less of it) and thought it was quite bland.  Food is never hot, always kind of warm to lukewarm.Wait time - Common them on here, I&#39;m not surprised.  You have to wait in line to order and pay, and then wait for your food.  Rarely enough seating.  Up to an hour total on weekends, sometimes more!  Ridiculous for the quality of food.Staff - Cashiers are mostly friendly.  I was in there once and heard the cooks swearing at each other loudly and complaining about the orders (which I get that cooks do, but maybe not in a building shared by a children&#39;s day camp??).  Servers are young kids who look like they&#39;re in a state of panic at all times.  I&#39;ve seen the owners (managers?) on weekends standing by the door and yelling at their staff to work faster and looking generally pissed off to be there, awkward when you&#39;re standing in line behind them.  Customers seem like an inconvenience to them, god forbid you don&#39;t know what pecornio is or have a food allergy.  I don&#39;t know, bad vibes from the kitchen area in a way I can&#39;t really place.Tipping - I&#39;m really turned off by their tipping system.  If you pay with a card, you get an option on the screen to add a tip ahead of time, and it&#39;s awkward because the cashier is standing right there.  What are you tipping for?  The interaction with the cashier? The food runner?  The coffee refill I have to get myself?This place gets business because they have no competition in the area.  I admire what they are trying to do, but the execution is lacking."

The eggs were meh like they were cooked in a hospital cafeteria or something. Lumpy and barely warm. The sausage was some odd lamb beef thing that was very gamey. It was also Luke warm. Portion sizes are very small as if every bite was so good or savory you wouldn&#39;t need more but that&#39;s not remotely the case.Oh and the price is way to high for quality or quantity of food. Go to yolk for quantity and better quality. Go to little goat or bongo room or eleven city diner etc. It&#39;s a place that looks like it&#39;s gonna be a great little neighborhood place except the food is awful haha.The cappuccino was good the service was good and the location was nice with the outdoor patio. None of that can make up for food that was terrible. So if you want a place to sit and drink coffee this is fine but for food this is a no go.

I tried to give it a visits to be objective, but I am done. The only good thing I can say is it was relatively clean and nice ambiance, hence at least 1 star.   You need to change the price rating on this to $$$$;Now for the rest. I think these folks are abusing the farm to table concept, which is supposed to make it cheaper. beyond that, you are in a park building, so rent is usually lower. it&#39;s as if someone looked at what others are charging, looked at the money in the neighborhood, and just charged 25% more than everyone else. I will pay for great service and great product, but this does not reach that threshold.So first I tried Yogurt that is not really that good. $8 for Yogurt? 3 bites, tossed it.So I thought, ok, bad luck, I gave it a second chance and I tried the Mac &amp; Cheese - underwhelming, cold; Mac &amp; Cheese with a drink that came out for almost $20? Are you crazy? And you want me to tip at the order point of service?  When I tried to tell them it was cold after waiting for 20 minutes, I got the run around from some bearded guy.Fool me once, twice, I thought, we will give them another chance, local joint needs to succeed, etc. 35 minutes, unbelievable.

Next time I want to eat breakfast out, I&#39;ll go to Lyfe Kitchen: better food that&#39;s cheaper, faster to order, and faster to get to my table.My suggestions to the proprietor:* Salt less* Stop overcooking the food* I get that the kitchen is small, so it&#39;s hard to speed up food preparation, but at least deal with the ordering bottleneck (e.g. it&#39;s crazy that if I want to order a muffin, I have to wait 20 minutes in line). I see that you can order with GrubHub, but apparently you still need to stand in the forever queue to pay.* Lower the price a bitThese are all fairly straightforward to implement, and would prompt me to bump my review by two stars.Good luck."

The portions vs what you pay is just laughable. I ordered a side of sausage the root veggie salad and a bacon cheddar biscuit. A side of sausage was one small link, AND they forgot my biscuit.I had high hopes for this place and I still kind of do.

The first visit was a week after they opened. I had a coffee and chatted with the staff and reviewed the menu. Coffee was great (counter culture), staff were really nice, and menu looked diverse, fresh, local, and progressive.Went back today to eat, after 2 months. Ordered the breakfast sandwich, cappuccino, and spinach salad with a side of bacon.Cappuccino: perfect. Little delicious cookie bite to boot.Breakfast sandwich: 2 of these, one for each of us. I  feel this is an item that will showcase if a restaurant has it together. It&#39;s a simple dish that and easy to perfect with some attention. Egg was sunny side up and cooked very well. The ham was lost in there by the hot sauce/mayo mix. The English muffin was soft and not toasted. The whole thing lacked texture. It was soft, sloppy, and messy. Flavor came together, but much to be desired. And so easy to fix. For $8, I felt cheated by this sandwich.Spinach salad: pecorino, ramps, pecans, blueberry vinegarette. SAND IN MY SALAD. I asked my sister about it and we tried to figure... Was it blueberry seed? Was it cracked pepper? Nope. Spinach was not washed well and it was sandy. Pecans were not seasoned or toasted and threw the salad off. Blueberry dressing tasted horrible with the ramps. Pecorino was sparse. $10 for a disastrous plate.Side of bacon: not cooked to order. Dry and chewy.Service. Very good.Overall, $40 with tip for two people. That&#39;s enough to buy my groceries for the entire week. And I blew it on a terrible brunch. And though I&#39;m salty that I wanted this place to be great bc it&#39;s next door and our neighborhood needs this, I have to be honest in my review.I really hope they read this.

The staff is all extremely friendly and I love bringing my dog because they gave her treats and they have a huge patio in a really nice and calm area. I&#39;ve definitely been looking for a place like this in the South Loop. I&#39;m pretty sure that their food and drink is local, which is very cool but on the downside, makes it more expensive. Their portions also are pretty small for the price.I haven&#39;t yet tried the breakfast food but I really loved the jam burger and potato salad. The burger itself if you get a single patty is a good portion size and you don&#39;t walk away feeling stuffed, but satisfied. And the jam is extremely tasty.Not so good: the mac and cheese. It was extremely small and dry. There was hardly and cheese sauce on it and to give it some flavor, sriracha had to be added.All in all, this was a great find and I&#39;ll definitely be coming back. They have a wide selection of food and beer, and the patio makes it all worth it."

It was a little pricey compared to other good brunch places but I just ordered and sat down outside in their large garden area thinking the food would be worth it. I was happy that they knew to bring the food out to us and we&#39;re really attentive about refilling water. The food however was another story. They had huge fancy plates but the portions were tiny! The flavors were very unique in my chicken sandwich at least and not in a great way. The fries were pretty good but not worth the price and not worth the trip since they also got a little dry towards the end. The location is not near any train stations but it is BYOB. Will probably not return just because the south loops has so many great brunch spots to offer and I like big portions!

They&#39;re not made up of questionable meat like the ones you would find at your typical Pho hole in the walls. Their toppings include cabbage, bean sprouts, fried garlic, green onion, white onion, mint, basil, lime and more! Then they have this fantastic pineapple habanero sauce that I can&#39;t get enough of. They should consider selling bottles separately if they don&#39;t already.I recently tried their Vietnamese iced coffee and man oh man...it&#39;s strong and super delicious!It&#39;s nice knowing that I still have a piece of home close to my new home.

FUH was one of the top restaurants that popped up and had great reviews. I showed my friend the photos and she was instantly excited. We&#39;ve never been to a restaurant that allows you to pick your own ingredients for pho.We got off at Lincoln and Webster stop and walked across the street. The restaurant was not busy, which was great, so we didn&#39;t have to wait. The staff member, Molly, helped us with our order. She instantly greeted us nicely and told us about how ordering works.I decided to get:- Half of rice noodles and half of cabbage- Pulled beef- A lot of fresh veggies- Peanuts and Fried onions- Beef BrothThe result was a HUUUUGE bowl of yummy beautiful aromatic pho placed on a plate with chopsticks and spoon. I used my FIU student ID for the student discount (awesome!!!), and made sure to tip Molly. She automatically gave me a cup of water and treated my friend really nicely as well.The pho was AMAZING! Beef was really tender, everything tasted well. We were SO HAPPY with the pho that we wished they would open a location in Miami. There&#39;s no place in Miami so far that allows customers to pick what ingredients they want. Genius idea! My friend&#39;s pho (beef broth, rice noodles, chicken/beef/tenderloin, veggies) was delicious as well. We both couldn&#39;t finish our bowls because there was so much food. You really get your money&#39;s worth!THIS RESTAURANT IS DEFINITELY A MUST TO TRY if you live in or you are visiting Chicago. Service is great, food is delicious, and price is awesome.

You have a choice of building your own pho bowl or picking a preset one with predetermined ingredients. I would consider Fuh a fast food joint.For my first visit, I chose to build my own pho bowl as it was an unique concept that I definitely wanted to try! It was interesting designing our own pho bowl as Fuh also had some non-traditional ingredients like carrots and arugula. While the pho was decent, I didn&#39;t think it was amazing enough to warrant a trip to try it. Fuh doesn&#39;t taste like authentic Vietnamese pho (more like westernized Asian fusion) and the beef broth was quite salty. Also, I was a little disappointed I only got 2 pieces of rare steak (which is quite small after its cooked in the broth). I did like the noodles though.One thing of note was that the service was quite friendly and very prompt.I would recommend only trying Fuh if you were in the area and looking for some hot soup noodles to warm you up in the winter."

While I don&#39;t like cabbage and carrots in my pho it&#39;s nice to have the option to get extra vegetables into your meal and a nice little crunch.But I want real Thai basil! And more than just 3 slices of rare beef or 5 halves of beef balls for $9 with my broth. It&#39;s really actually overpriced for the quality of the pho when you can go to a more traditional place for a more soulful broth and a giant bowl full of everything for ...$7.95.The chicken spring rolls lacked herbs for me and the chicken was unseasoned and dry. I did love the little turd-like piping of the peanut-hoisin sauce. Pretty funny!Kinda seems like they&#39;re trying to appeal to more people by making everything a little less bold and a bit more generic and leave it up to us to customize the taste via sauces. I was also totally missing just good old Vietnamese dipping fish sauce. They have every variation of hoisin and fish sauce you can find but I guess most people wouldn&#39;t like the smell of strong fish sauce so it had to be very diluted.They were really smart to bring this concept to a busy section of Lp. And it&#39;s a good bowl of soup if convenient, but not really worth it if something else is nearby. Or if you really want no frills good pho."

If all that wasn&#39;t bad enough, the next day when i check out my leftovers the &#34;broth&#34; was completely dried up and i basically was looking at a cup of just rice noodles. GROSS!!!Will NEVER be ordering from this place again and advise you not to either."

The concept mimics Chipotle, you go down the line adding whatever you wanted to your initial noodle and meat selection. Customization at it&#39;s finest!The beef broth itself was flavorful but found to be on the oily side. I added brisket and and beef balls to my pho, and damnn, the brisket was soft and cooked perfectly. Falls apart just by touching it!! The amount of additional toppings you could add to your pho blew me away, I wanted everything in obscene amounts. This option was preferable to the small amount of toppings they usually give you at pho restaurants especially when you are in a group of people. The dipping sauces other then hoisin and and hot sauces were a good change from the norms, loving the fusion.At first I was skeptical that a place in Lincoln could make pho in a assembly line fashion, but after trying it I&#39;m a fan. Would definitely come back to try the other sauces. Lesson learned, good food can come in all forms and in the most unexpected places. Happy munching!Ordered:1. Rice noodles2. Beef protein (brisket and beef balls)3. Added: bean sprouts, mint, basil, cilantro, jalapenos, green onions4. Used pineapple habanero hoisin sauce!!!!!!! TRY THIS!!!"

Got the rare steak (came in one large chunk, hard to separate and a small portion), noodles were subpar, and lots of tasty fixings (fried garlic, fried onions, mint, etc.). The broth really surprised me with its rich, full flavors so that was a huge plus. They also have some fun sauces on the side that you can use to level up your pho. The portions overall are small and make you feel jipped  when you know you usually eat almost double the amount, but that&#39;s the price of convenience, i guess. Seating is small and narrow.Overall, fuh is an approachable pho place nearby, but come with the expectation that there are some sacrifices to pay with the easier commute."

Once an Edzo&#39;s, the fast casual assembly line concept has now infiltrated vietnamese food. At first, I was a little hesitant to enter the shop because eating pho has always been a risky endeavor. Why? Peanut allergies. The last time I was on Argyle having pho, my face turned splotchy, beet red just from neighboring peanut powders and garnishes. Alas, a place that I can have pho and feel relatively safe knowing that the peanuts are well contained as an optional sauce.Vegetarians, vegans and carnivores rejoice! There&#39;s options aplenty!Pick your veg and main proteins:-Mushrooms (they had two kinds that day)-Chicken-Brisket-Meatball-Tofu-Flank SteakThen pick your broth:-Chicken-Beef-VeganGarnishes (too many to remember):-Beansprouts-Peppers-Red/White Onions-Jalapeños-Green Onions-Carrots-Mint-Cilantro-Basil-Fried shallots//GarlicDown the line you can order extras like egg rolls, their asian &#34;churro&#34;, vietnamese coffee, or a cold beverage. Their sauces range from the traditional such as fish sauce, hoisin, sriracha to funky like apple ginger, mango serrano and peanut coconut.I got a tofu and flank steak on my beef broth with the traditional garnishes of basil-green onion-cilantro-beansprouts and lime. I&#39;ve braved some awesome pho (::wink wink:: Ca Dao in San Diego) and also some lackluster pho (::cough cough:: Saigon Sister). This is not the place if you&#39;re in the mood for tripe with other exotic entrails. Save that for Argyle. Fuh is fast, straightforward, serving up great bowls of pho, one customization at a time. As for me, I&#39;m a fan of any place where I can have delicious vietnamese food and leave with my face intact."

I have had better pho broth and then I have had worse pho.I love the idea that you can special order your pho to your liking. You want pho ga ( chicken pho) they have it. You want pho with tofu or mushrooms or both, they got those too. And of course your usual beef brisket, pulled beef ( not in traditional pho), rare steak, and beef meatball. However if you are one of those pho connoisseur looking for tripe and tendons like in pho dac biet, you will not find it here. And there is only one size pho bowl.

There was also a suggested menu board, for those who need some inspiration or dont want to bother picking out each ingredient.I got the standard pho. The broth could have used more flavor, and it was quite skimpy on the meat (I had maybe 4 of the thincut ribeye stuck together, and that was about it). My husband got one of their other pre-designed soups. I was hesitant about the idea of brisket and pulled pork; I think it was, perhaps I was thinking of Southern BBQ, but it actually worked really well in the soup. He also had more of a generous portion of meat.The place also had a good variety of sauces, and they mentioned that the spicy garlic sauce was actually house made. I also was excited to see a pineapple habenero hoisin sauce that was unique too.The place was a bit pricey and smaller portion for your standard pho bowl, but it seems more like it&#39;s marketing to a different population.

Also the girl that helped us got the rice noodles out of a plastic tub with her bare hands before putting her gloves on.It resembles a subway in the fact that all of the ingredients are sitting out in the open and you choose what goes in, but it was not working since the veggies were not fresh.Also, the broth.... it was disgusting.

You get in line and get to choose what you want in your pho. You get your food fast and then you sit at a high table on stools. I had the classic pho and it was pretty good. I was also full after the meal, which is always a plus. The reason why I gave this restaurant 3 stars is because I prefer a more traditional pho. I wanted to go to a sit down restaurant where a waiter takes my order and delivers my food. I also like seats with back support but that really wasn&#39;t a big deal. More important, I like my pho with a number of different types of thinly cut meats. At Fuh, I got a single piece of pretty thick beef that wasn&#39;t that tasty. It was definitely different than any pho meat I&#39;ve ever gotten. In addition to that, I like being given a plate of bean sprouts, mint, jalapenos, and lime to put into the pho in the portions that I like throughout my meal. At Fuh, all the ingredients are put in when you order and so I lose that aspect of eating pho that I love. Just to be clear though, you can ask for extra or less of what goes into your pho. My friend put it best when he said that Fuh hit the craving but not the spot. The pho is good but not quite everything you want if you&#39;re used to or want a more traditional pho."

Right away, I noticed the small amount of noodles and meat given. However, being able to get all the toppings without extra charge made up for it. The brisket was pretty good along with the broth. However, the noodles is what prevents this from being four stars. It was pretty hard and somewhat uncooked, which was unpleasant. I can deal with &#39;al dente&#39; even though it&#39;s not common in Asian noodles, but this was not even the case.I did enjoy the various sauces and the veggie/vegan friendly options.Overall, Fuh did not quite satisfy my pho fix, but it did suffice for dinner.

I heard about a Chipotle-esque Pho place opening in Lincoln Park of all places so it was in order for a visit.The interior is nice but not overpowering or anything, and made from some good wood. All the workers were pretty enthusiastic which made everything a little better. You can tell they care about the business.As far as the pho goes, there&#39;s a lot of customization here. I was told the point is that the broth is made a little clearer than normal (not as much spice but still not bad at all) to allow for more customization. For me, it need a tad bit more salt until I added some sriracha to the mix. My suggestion to them is to have some salt (not normal table salt) on the side for someone who doesn&#39;t like to put a lot of stuff in it.Regardless, I thought the pho was pretty good. You can tell the broth was cooked for hours on end and not from some spice cube you can buy at the market. When the guy opened the container full of beef broth, you could see the bones floating in there. Good!I&#39;ll be back - one of the better bowls I&#39;ve had in town.

And pretty darn good pho for a fast food place.I got the vegetarian broth pho and hubby got the noodle dish with Pineapple habanero sauce. Both of them were delicious. The pho more than the noodles - because the noodles get kind of dry, but they have bottles of various sauces that you can help yourself with and my hubby was given a small cup of veggie broth on the side as well. As for the pho, it is a little bit salty - but oh so flavorful. The concept of making your own bowl of soup is awesome. I just wish that htey had more vegetable options like steamed broccoli or bokchoy, but otherwise I loved the pho. The fried tofu was greasy - so the next time i go I will skip that. Its perfect bowlful of goodness for a cold, foggy night. The portions are generous, I had leftover pho enough for next nights dinner."

Only knock against the place is that their pad see ewe was overly sweet and the noodles a little too soft for my liking.In the end, Golden Thai knows how to cater to its customers with heavy flavors and decent portion sizes. A huge plus is that nothing is too expensive considering most of the people that dine here are probably students. Reasonable prices + tasty food is a win."

Thankful that this place was open and delivering today (Easter Sunday, 2016).Our trio had the Roasted Duck Curry spicy, the Nam Sod salad, and the Pan Fried Noodles with Chicken not spicy. I was happy with the spice level and flavor of all three because I like spicy. Our Nam Sod person thought theirs was a little too spicy, but our Pan Fried Noodle person was very happy. The quantities were a little small for the price compared with other places I am acquainted with, but good flavor and freshness. The little printed labels on each dish helped and a nice touch.There are other good restaurants in the area, but I can see myself ordering from this place again. On a par with other &#39;good&#39; Thai places I&#39;ve experienced. One thing I liked too is that they originally told me 45 minutes for delivery; we had the good fortune to have it here in a half hour."

The highly recommend the Green curry. You get a choice of meet but I usually get beef (it was the server&#39;s recommendation).

I thought it was just ehh.. they aint lying when they said baby egg rolls haha.. its really small... but i didn&#39;t really like it... tasted bland and tasted like frozen egg rolls from the store even tho it is probably not..Indian Curry Fried Rice has stir-fried with jasmine rice, onions, tomatoes, Egg and Indian curry powder with your choice of meat in which I picked beef..  I love curry and I love fried rice and when you combine them... it is full of awesomeness! it was good.. it wasn&#39;t overwhelmed with curry flavor.. just enough to taste it..Pad See Ewe has wide rice noodles, choice of meat which I chose chicken, broccoli, and egg.. stir fried with their sweet soy sauce...it was good.. not too oily.. everything was just cooked right..I must say.. they do skimp out on the meat a little.. other then that..

I called and ordered drunken noodles with chicken (spicy) and massaman curry w/ beef. They told me the order would be ready in 15 minutes for my pick up.I arrived probably a little less than 15 minutes later, but my order was ready. They had prompt service and I was on my way home w/ my Thai delicacies in no time. The drunken noodles were delicious. Even though we asked for spicy, they definitely were not that hot. If you like your food very spicy I would ask for extra, extra spice. The sauce was flavorful and there were lots of fresh veggies cooked with the chicken. The massaman was also very tasty. The sauce was thinner than what I typically think of for massaman curry, but I didn&#39;t mind because the flavor was so spot-on. The beef wasn&#39;t great quality, but when you&#39;re paying $8.75 for a dish, what can you expect?Price was very reasonable- for both dishes it was ~$20. They served decent portions- with two of us sharing we had plenty of leftovers.Overall, when I&#39;m craving Thai food I would order from Golden Thai again. Worth checking out if you&#39;re in the area!"

I like spicy food and they do very spicy, but the degree of spicy is far beyond my imagination as well as far beyond most of the restaurants. The next time I will choose the medium spicy not very spicy. If you chose the degree of spicy, I would recommend a lower lever. The beef in the noodled is very delicious as they maybe fried.

It was simply one dish and they couldn&#39;t get it to me by noon. This is very appalling. When the food arrived I called to speak with the manager to ask for an explanation. They said a manager will call me back. The manager never called me. I went on their website to email them. I did and haven&#39;t gotten a response since.

I have done both delivery and had great experiences with each. They were super accommodating with a couple of substitutions that we asked for. I highly recommend the first: adding BBQ pork to the Golden Thai fried rice. The meat is delicious and so is the rice. Also the basil fried rice is great, though I think the only difference is pineapples. So good.We got the Pad See Yew both with plain noodles, and with the crispy noodles. It&#39;s hard to say which I like better. The plain wide noodles here are thin and soft and delicious. The crispy ones are fried. Mmmm. They also use regular broccoli, vs Chinese. This works for me.Green curry was amazing, cashew chicken was out of control good - and something I don&#39;t normally get. Bonus points for having variety on the menu, while still nailing the fan favorites. Egg rolls and potstickers also tasty.

The decor needs some updating because I even noticed an outdated air conditioning device from the 1950s or something.We were seated quickly and we gave our order. The waitress was very polite, friendly and quick with our food.We ordered crab rangoon, spring rolls, miso soup spring dumplings, pepper beef, pad bamee, spicy shrimp, and tofu fried rice.The crab rangoon was delicious! It came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. We did not want crab in the rangoon, so we asked them to exchange the crab with imitation crab. They were nice enough to fulfill our request. We also liked the shrimp dumpling and the soy dipping sauce.The spring rolls were just okay. They were cold wrapped, and full of half cooked chopped vegetables.The miso soup was delicious, and one order came in a large bowl. So a few of us shared the soup.All four of rated our food as okay. The food is good, but you wouldn&#39;t go out of your way to come to this restaurant for the food. If you are in the area and your are craving thai food, that you should come here.

Don&#39;t judge me.) About 20 minutes after making my order, I started to regret not walking and ordering (I could&#39;ve burned off some calories before inhaling those delicious carbs), because the delivery time was 45 minutes. Even though I was a 4 minute drive away. Four minutes. Four. 45 minutes. 45. After getting my food, I ran to the nearest table and ate the food so quickly because I was so hungry. The food was warm and tasted so fresh. The flavors were like little ballerinas dancing on my tongue. I loved it! I finished the chili paste fried rice and was completely satisfied. The crab rangoons...don&#39;t get me started. I died. And then reincarnated. THEY WERE SO GOOD. And the dipping sauce was unreal as well. Overall, the food was amazing, and I will be DEFINITELY going here again. I&#39;ll probably order two orders of crab rangoons next time because guess what?

It is SO good, I order it at least once a month. I&#39;ve probably had it at least 12 times now, and it has been delicious. every. time. I tried it with tofu once and it was really good, but it is perfect with chicken. Another loved item on the menu is the pad see ew. My husband and I always order chicken red curry and beef pad see ew together, it&#39;s kind of our monthly guilty pleasure meal. :) I will say I&#39;ve tried some random chicken or beef dish that came with rice and it was less memorable, and I personally don&#39;t like their noodles for their pad thai (it&#39;s similar to pho noodles, very thin, but maybe they would change the noodle type if you asked? Not sure). Lastly, I recommended red curry to a friend, but she was afraid it&#39;d be spicy (although I don&#39;t find it spicy at all), so she ordered yellow curry instead, and tasted kinda funky - it was a bit too sweet.I&#39;m not sure if this all warrants an average of less than 5 stars, maybe the restaurant as a whole might be less, but because of the amazing red curry and delicious pad see ew, I&#39;m sticking with the 5.

Got there 15 mins later... and got Tom Yum Noodles with bean sprouts. Minor misunderstand, that&#39;s fine. They removed the bean sprouts and then rang up the bill.. which came out to be about $9. When I told them that their online menu lists the tom yum noodles for $6.95 (which is what Yummy Thai current charges), he said that that website is ancient and the price has been raised to $8.25. hell, how was i supposed to know.got home, and my tom yum noodles was worse than yummy thai. that extra dollar something did add anything to the price.. which brought up the question: how does golden thai stay in business?Yummy Thai...is cheaper (and also doesn&#39;t have a $10 credit card minimum)has better service from what I&#39;ve experiencedhas a much more pleasing dining areahas comparable/better foodis only two blocks awayNeedless again, I won&#39;t make the same mistake again."

The portion size is TINY and they offer no refills or additional rice,  literally the rice is 1/6th the size of the curry bowl. Please management if you&#39;re reading this, stop leaving the galangal(relative to ginger) in the soup, it&#39;s impossible to not have pieces in your mouth because you chop it so small.  Also if you inform them the curry is too spicy, although you ordered a mild, you&#39;ll have your curry diluted by adding additional chicken broth killing the flavor.I recommend the Tom Yum Soup(get the large size it&#39;s the equivalent of 6 or so of the regular size), Pad Thai and Red Curry(probably the best I&#39;ve had in Chicago)"

I get it with chicken and add peanut, chillis with juice, as well as red chilli garlic paste that are located in the metal four bowl serving tray that may or may not be on the table. Ask for it if not.BYOB: Bell&#39;s 2-Hearted Ale, Stone Arrogant Bastard BomberCombo #2 (for 2)Appetizer: Crab Rangoon with sweet and spicy, tangy dipping sauce. A refreshingly quality rangoon with flavor and isnt mushy. Careful, they are served directly out of the fryer and can be popping with oil still at delivery.BYOB: Victory HopDevilPad See Ewe entree - Obviously you can see I like the wider noodle dishes. served with brocolli and egg, the sweet brown sauce is wonderful and far superior to other local versions. I wasnt a huge fan of the fried version they offer the one time I tried it.BYOB: Goose Island Pepe NeroSpicy Pad Ped entree - shrimp, beef, chix with eggplant, green peas, bamboo shoots in a spicy red curry; I dont usually get anything with eggplant but this dish is very flavorful and has lots of pop. I thoroughly enjoy this when in a red curry mood. It is absolutely packed with meat and not skimped on the shrimps.BYOB: Goose Island SofieRidge York Creek Vineyard or Pagani Ranch ZinfandelDINNER FOR A KING (see the king of Thailand&#39;s pic)Yum Woon Sen - glass noodles tossed delicately with shrimp, chix, red and green onion, in a delicious Thai style dressing. A wonderful blend of flavors where each ingredient can be picked out in each bite yet isnt overpoweringBYOB: La Crema Pinot Noir SonomaThree Flavor Red Snapper is AMAZING - This is a classic whole fish fry dish with one of my go to finned friends, the red snapper in her sapphire party dress deep fried and coated in chilli, garlic, sweet and sour sauce that will really have you thanking he BYOB gods.BYOB: Ravenswood Dickerson Valley Reserve ZinfandelOther dishes I enjoy (but not as much as those above):Nam Sod Salad (good for a light lunch)Pad Woon Sen (better than Yummy Thai down the street)Pad Bamee (get with pork or beef opposed to chicken)Singapore noodles (loves me bbq pork)Basil, Ginger, Garlic Chix all good stir-fred selectionsThai Fried Rice (extremely fragrant with Thai basil) and way better than Yummy&#39;sRegular Fried Rice (excellent) with a nice selection and variety of fresh veggies. Very clean flavors without the overly oily taste or texture. I like Golden&#39;s better (I am biased by now) but think its a very close competition with Yummy Thai&#39;s reg fried rice, which I also think is excellent and shares a similar taste/texture profile.Beef, BBQ pork, and Japanese Udon noodles are all very tasty as wellI wasnt a huge fan of the Tom Yum or Kar soups, better across street at Yummy.Food is 3.5 stars+ 0.5 star for BYOB and the fact that the owners love NBA games and will gladly change over for youto any channel you desire if thats your thing.+1 star for Free crab rangoon or egg roll with any delivery over $10, this is huge considering our standard delivey order is around 20-30 bucks after delivery charge with this free app. Make sure you mention it ahead."

I once ordered their pad thai (minus the fish sauce, since I&#39;m a veggie), and it was just blah. No flavor, and completely plain noodles and bland veggies.

It&#39;s really more of a 3.5 star review, but I couldn&#39;t really think of any major down sides to knock it down to a 3. Technically I&#39;ve had better yellow curries, but this one was definitely good. Prices are reasonable - every dish my group had was $6.95. We dined in, and the atmosphere is pretty standard for a Thai place. I guess my one complaint would be that there&#39;s no lunch specials - just the regular menu. Portion size was good and I definitely have enough for leftovers for lunch today. Success."

My bf had the tom yum noodles with chicken (no soup broth) and I had the Bami haeng ped (with tofu).  We also ordered vegetable fried rice.Since we were carrying-out, we ordered at the counter and waited about 10 minutes for our food.  The portions are large and our entire meal came out to be $26. Apparently it&#39;s byob too, even though it&#39;s not advertised as such. (I asked the man who took our order) ;)The place is always clean and very casual, and we&#39;ve always liked what we&#39;ve ordered....there are about 10 tables in the place and there&#39;s a large flat screen tv on the back wall which always seems to have sports on.I&#39;ve eaten at Thai Bowl and Yummy Thai (both on Taylor) which are great places, but this place seems to be a bit less expensive and I&#39;ve found the portion size to be larger. If you&#39;re looking for a casual byob thai place on Taylor, I recommend Golden Thai over &#39;Yummy Thai&#39; and &#39;Thai Bowl&#39;."

Perhaps even more than squat, and for that reason I am not listening whatsoever.That is to say, I have engaged my talent for selective listening. In my line of work, it is important to be able to listen to multiple sounds at a time. It is equally important to be able to tune out certain sounds when they are unimportant or distracting.This talent of mine that I have developed over many years does not have much application in my daily life. The few times I get to flex my multi-listening abilities are rush hour at the airport or unobtrusively eavesdropping at restaurants or simply listening to the elevator music while having a conversation simultaneously. Virtually no one ever even realizes that I am doing it unless I burst out laughing after hearing &#34;Hungry Like The Wolf&#34; recorded as a pan flute orchestra.That&#39;s not a joke. I think restaurants like to play songs with &#34;hungry&#34; in the title or lyrics as kind of a subliminal message auto-suggestion hypnosis. They think most people don&#39;t even hear it.But I do.I would normally gladly enjoy the conversation and background music simultaneously. Here at Golden Thai, I have chosen to turn the conversation off altogether for two reasons:A. The conversation is not worth participating in.B. The music here is pretty good actually.&#34;...men can NOT be trusted for any reason whatsoever, and I&#39;ll tell you...&#34;DEFINITELY not worth participating in. Fortunately, my participation is unwanted anyway, and I set my head oscillating at regular intervals to complete the illusion of an audience member.The music being played is nothing I recognize. I would gather these artists are likely Thai or something from that region of the world, but as I said, the music is actually pretty good.Sitting back I stretch my ears out, my head and tongue on autopilot, wagging at appropriate moments, listening only to Thailand&#39;s finest.And I dig it.After the CD changer&#39;s latest grind, I really dig it! Whoever this guy is, he is really good, and his voice is sweet! I envision a giant crooning stick of butter.&#34;...when I was traveling the astral plane...&#34;It&#39;s going to be awhile. It&#39;s just you and me, Butterstick! If there were a reanimated amalgamation of the corpses of Sinatra and Elvis, it would be jealous of this man&#39;s talents.&#34;...the Salvation Army Store wouldn&#39;t take back the scarf! I was out $1.50...&#34;Latin rhythms? This guy is out of control!&#34;...visited by three spirits that wanted to deliver a message...&#34;Oh dear, we&#39;re back in the Shadow Realm again. As long as this CD doesn&#39;t run out, I&#39;ll be alright.The melodic structure is totally different than typical western tastes, and the vocal harmonies totally blow my mind. I need this CD!The completion of the meal was my reprieve from accidentally hearing any more of the conversation. I went up and asked the lady behind the counter who the artist was. When she handed me the CD case, it looked like a microscope slide of squiggly bacteria with a handsome asian man, acoustic guitar in hand, smiling through it. Whatever language it was, I certainly couldn&#39;t read it.I asked her to write the name of the artist down for me and she obligingly handed me a piece of paper that read:---theta - theta - backwards &#34;L&#34; - jesus fish - N------K - jesus fish - jesus fish - N - O - R - backwards &#34;L&#34; - sigma---Oh well. I guess I&#39;ll just have to come back for my Sonic Butterstick Fix.Fortunately, the beef fried rice here is reasonably priced and made just how I like it. Tender beef, lots of egg, flavorful rice and no weird stuff like peas or corn. You&#39;ll have to ask someone else about its authenticity. See my previous comment re: &#34;squat&#34;.I&#39;d come here more often if this place weren&#39;t in a weird part of town that is a major pain to park in. The staff is really friendly. The bathroom definitely needs a remodel.All things considered, Golden Thai is a great place to not listen to somebody. Instead, just float away on a buttery cloud while Elvisnatra shakes its decaying fist."

Although the restaurant was not &#34;packed&#34;, I noticed there were quite a few large carry out orders. It did take them a reasonable amount of time to bring the food. Not fast but not slow and expected for a restaurant that serves delicious food at lunch time.The ambiance reminded me of the Dominican Republic. Loved it. Simple. The food was Delicious! Served quickly after preparing. I had their special Tortilla Boricua which is an open faced omlet. I asked to substitute toast and was offered a delicious bowl of fruit. The service was great. If you need something, ask for it with a smile. This is a lesson in life that well take you a long way. Relax! Also, consider avoiding the weekend lunch buffet if you do not like crowded, busy, delicious restaurants!THE OATMEAL....... ! I&#39;m definitely coming back for the Mofongo!"

We got the buffet. The food was incredibly delicious. The magic oatmeal (it tastes sort of like horchata) is beyond ... the omelets were delicious -- delicately cooked and mine was seriously amped by the addition of a pinch of adobo. They have adobo and oregano as options as well as diced onion, mushroom, tomato, spinach (and maybe peppers?) and cheese and sausage. The yellow rice with pigeon peas is  addictive and their potatoes are deceptively simple: sliced up and cooked with salt and pepper. Not greasy, not soggy, a little fluffy almost. Just seriously potato-y. They also have beautiful cut-up fresh melon and pineapple. The place is also very cute and the staff is lovely--warm, kind and helpful. It is so close to getting 5 stars. I won&#39;t like, most of us went back for seconds on things--I got a little more oatmeal, rice and chicken--even though I was already full. They were that good. The only small hiccup: the delicious small pieces of fried chicken leg on the buffet were a bit dried out. Note to tea drinkers; it seems that they don&#39;t serve hot black (&#34;regular) tea, though they have hot green tea and two lovely herbals. They do serve regular (black) unsweetened iced tea."

That&#39;s how much I loved the breakfast at Nellie&#39;s.A group of us came in for breakfast on a Sunday. They were almost empty when we arrived at 930 (yeah we like to start the day early on Sundays sometimes) but by the time we left, the restaurant was full with a line of folks waiting to be seated.My husband and I went with the Breakfast Buffet--it was the best way to sample some things on the menu and plus, kids under 3 eat for free!  The two others in our group went with the breakfast special and omelet and both looked really good.There is quite a lot to choose from in their buffet--Pastelone de Huevos (which is like an egg strata, with a layer of ground beef and plantains) breakfast potatoes, bacon, sausage links, pancakes, french toast, an omelet station, Maduros (sweet plantains), fresh fruit and the Avena de Coco (the famous coconut oatmeal dusted with cinnamon). There&#39;s also fried chicken and arroz con gandules.My husband and I split an omelet we had made at the omelet station. We ordered what was basically the omelet in the breakfast special. An open faced omelet seasoned with sofrito, cheese, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, salchion sausage and maduros. It was fantastic. Very flavorful and well-made.The oatmeal was not like any other oatmeal I&#39;ve had, it was very creamy and filling. The coconut milk adds so much richness and flavor. Perfect comfort food.My other favorites of the buffet include the little pieces of fried chicken. So crispy on the outside but very tender on the inside. And the plantains--a bit sticky from the carmelization, not overly sweet either. And they use fresh ripe plantains so no hint of bland/bitterness.Service was so friendly and anticipated our needs. Our server was funny and kept us entertained by his jokes and friendly banter.  Our coffee cups never went empty and water glasses were always filled."

I have gone 3 times in 3 years and each time it is the same thing. Nobody comes to check on you. Nobody refills coffee or water. I went Sunday Feb 8 and I am still waiting on my glass of orange juice.Do not get me wrong, everyone is cordial and nice. However you need to tackle someone to get any attention. The only reasons I keep going is because I want to see a Puerto Rican place do well and I hope their service gets better. Every time I have gone, it was to take non-Puerto Rican out of town guests and introduce them to something different. They loved the food but hated the service."

The coconut oatmeal was available, and my husband went back for 3rds. I had to abstain due to an allergy but it smelled amazing.The omelets they make for you are good, but they use eggbeaters unless you request fresh eggs, something I wish I had known about before starting.Nice selection of fresh fruit, and they also offered fried plantains. I got them two separate ways. The first time they were kind of old and therefore not terribly appetizing. The second time, I got them as they were being put out and they were simply divine.A word of caution. The orange juice is listed as &#34;fresh squeezed&#34; but we watched them pour it from a store bought jug.Be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes to get sat as they&#39;re pretty popular.

Very tasty! Coffee was good, not weak, and service was great.On a weekday morning, not many people at Nellie&#39;s, but it started to fill up.

No utensils (I got up to get mine even after the waitress saw us). I was really hoping for a beautiful experience but unfortunately it wasn&#39;t. Thus far its been over 25 minutes since our order and we are on lunch break hello. The food took another 25 minutes to get here and so basically almost a whole 50 minutes has passed and its time to go. My co worker of course was really PO&#39;ed since we are very funny with our lunch breaks! I asked the waiter and waitress for some water and some utensil&#39;s while I looked at my food. I just order the Nellies Special which consisted of Coconut Oatmeal (ummmm I didn&#39;t get the big deal to be honest) and eggs with red/green peppers and onions (typical omelet) except this one had plantains nestled in the omelet, again nothing really popped to me as special.I think that although it was 11:30 and only 2 other couples sitting, this place just  seems extremely unorganized.Now we just over heard that there is no breaded steak? And this person ordered it over 20 minutes ago and they are just telling him no breaded steak? WHAT! The very idea that a restaurant can tell someone twenty minutes after they ordered that there is no breaded steak? Come on now, this is unimaginable. I am utterly shocked.Well the hour is almost up so I took two bites of the omelet (and it was cold when they brought it out) and I had to ask for a take out. This has been the worse lunch experience in a long time, and you all know that I don&#39;t like to bad mouth a business, and I am trying not too. I think that the waiter and waitress should get some kind of herbal tonic because they seemed to of been very unorganized and forgetful.

My friend and I split the Steak Jibarito and the Stuffed Mofongo with steak. I thought the jibarito was amazing! It&#39;s basically a sandwich that uses two large plantain pieces to hold the sandwich together instead of using bread. With the entree we also got the Puerto Rican yellow rice with pigeon peas which was delicious and full of flavor. The stuffed mofongo was a bit dry for my taste. The steak wasn&#39;t as juicy and the whole thing lacked the kick I was looking for. However, the soup that the mofongo came with was absolutely addictive. I kept finding myself sneaking a sip!It seems like the breakfast/brunch has good reviews so if I happen to come back it&#39;ll most likely be for that!"

It&#39;s $15.00 a person with unlimited coffee and OJ. The coffee is not good but if you want good coffee go to Cafe Colao right down the street. I think they are owned by the same people. The OJ is great! The  Avena De Coco is the best I ever had (sorry abuela). Great place to take people from out of town. Be prepared to wait if you go during peak hours but it&#39;s worth it!!

I felt rather cool myself without my coat and was rubbing my arms to keep warm. We placed our order and didn&#39;t get our food until 45 minute later, which was very surprising to have the waitress come back to tell me that they were out of the yellow rice with Pigeon peas. I have to wonder how they decided who got to have the remaining, since I did give her my order before my sister and this guy that came in after us also got to have the yellow rice and his meal before us while I had to accept getting the white rice and beans unless I wanted to wait for them to cook more. This is quite ridiculous considering we got here for lunch at 12:20pm, how do you run out of a main staple item at a prime lunch time hour...? I can&#39;t believe it would also take so long to tell your customer that you ran out. The pork jibarito I had was quite small in terms of portion, and probably the smallest of all the Latin restaurants I have been to. Some bits of my pork were dry and crispy/sharp.

My cousin had a roast pork jibarito, which is a sandwich made with crispy plantains instead of bread.  She also adored hers.The service was friendly, and the restaurant was clean with nice Puerto Rican art all around.  The waiter accidentally spilled our milk, and got some on my cousin.  He apologized many times, and then brought us complimentary coconut oatmeal.  This was super tasty, if a bit liquidy for my taste.  But, a very nice gesture.Lastly, if all of the above doesn&#39;t convince you, just go to check out the bathroom.  It was reminiscent of some chambers in an old Spanish castle, and you could wash your hands while sitting on the toilet if you so chose.  This was entertaining to me."

I think this must have been a Scottish pub years ago since the same heavy doors are used for the men&#39;s and women&#39;s bathrooms!Anyhow, the food:I took a pass on the $14.95 all you can eat breakfast buffet, but it looked wonderful and had a mix of Puerto Rican and American style favorites. I opted for the eggs, sausage, and sweet plantains with multigrain toast (two pieces of real toast, not the single piece in two!). Everything was perfect, and the plantains were fresh and mind-blowingly perfect! Yum in the tum!The menu had sandwiches from about $3 and most everything was under $10. My breakfast with coffee was under $7.They only seem to have regular drip coffee, which is a shame because Puerto Rican cafe is pretty darned good. I had a couple cups off the diner-style coffee and was happy, but thought that I might like an espresso or a cafe-con-leche next time.Now, I sat down then realized that depending on the waitstaff you might have to go up to the register to order. Since it was my first time, I got up after sitting for a few minutes and ordered. The place is very chilled out, and unrushed, so, take this into consideration.The place is run by a family and the kids came in to visit the parents, and there was a big table of people with strollers, so if you can get your stroller past the big heavy door, this place seems to welcome kids.They have free wi-fi and since it was a bar, the long bar might be a place to sit and drink a few cups of drip coffee and surf the net. There are tons of tasteful framed photos of Puerto Rico, and some very cool Puerto Rican national paintings on the wall.I could see myself skipping the places further East on Division and going here instead to try everything on the menu!They are open Wed-Sun."

Let&#39;s go to get brunch!Me: Oh, okay...I thought it wasn&#39;t much of a surprise. Going out to eat is a regular weekend activity for us. Plus, brunch is just eggs and carbs. I wasn&#39;t expecting much at Nellie&#39;s, a casual Puerto Rican restaurant in Humboldt Park. It must be average.I was COMPLETELY wrong. Like, 1 + 1 = Zebra wrong.We arrived at 11:00AM. The wait was 30 minutes. Yikes. This was the result of the Groupon. The neighborhood is desolate, so there&#39;s nothing we could do but wait. The hostess was very sweet though; she is the daughter of the owner. When we were finally seated, I saw that the waitstaff used the cool iPhone ordering system to take our orders. I have never seen those in a restaurant in Chicago (only on Gordon Ramsey&#39;s Kitchen Nightmares)! That is pretty damn nifty.I ordered the El Coqui Scrambled Eggs ($8.50) and side of Plantains ($2.75) and David had the Breakfast Buffet ($14.99). The menu is pretty vegetarian-friendly. Anyway, I didn&#39;t see the buffet area in the back, but David told me it is impressive. Some Yelper mentioned that it was small, but it is not. For a buffet, you get a good selection: sausage, bacon, pancakes, french toast, omelettes (you can choose the fillings), fresh fruit, and ...Avena de Coco. Coconut Oatmeal.I had only one spoonful of it. My boyfriend is a stickler to rules and didn&#39;t want me to &#34;mooch&#34; off his cup of oatmeal and cheat the restaurant, even though I just wanted to have ONE more spoonful to determine whether or not I like it. (He&#39;s difficult like that.) I think my opinion on the oatmeal are fuzzy, since I only had about a teaspoon of it. It&#39;s good, although a little watery. It needed more oatmeal. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s all the big fuss is about with this oatmeal. It&#39;s good, but not THAT GOOD.David ordered orange juice (fresh squeezed), and it was also taking a very, very long time to come out. As I watched David eat his food, I started to wonder what was taking so long for his orange juice.Me: Maybe they are HAND-squeezing your orange juice specially for you, David!*some time later*Me: Maybe they are importing the oranges from Brazil JUST for you, David!*some more time later*Me: Maybe they are growing the oranges JUST for you, David!It turns out that the orange juice was freshly squeeze as they didn&#39;t start serving it to everyone until later. I assume that there was a delay in the orange juice because someone had to squeeze the oranges.My food also took forever to come out. I also started to believe that they went to get the eggs from the grocery store, then the farm, then actually raising the chickens. It was taking a very, very long time for my food.You&#39;d be surprised that I didn&#39;t mind it one bit. You gotta be understand the circumstance they&#39;re in. (I wasn&#39;t that hungry anyway.)When my food finally arrived, I was extremely pleased with what I received:- Breakfast potatoes: Mashed baked potatoes with skin still on. SO GOOD!!- Wheat toast: Thick slices of multigrain bread. Not the cheap crap!- Plantains: Caramelized and sliced.- Scrambled eggs: Fluffy and PERFECTLY cooked with slightly mashed slices of avocado on top. I actually prefer this over the pretty slices of avocado. It&#39;s easier to mix the avocado in with the eggs.I was so happy. I had the eggs with Nellie&#39;s hot sauce, which is pretty damn spicy. Word of caution: It&#39;s very watery, so it&#39;ll pour right out of the bottle. Be careful.Our brunch was a very long brunch, but it was the best brunch I had in a long time. I have paid more money for mediocre dishes with lower quality ingredients elsewhere. Nellie&#39;s is extremely reasonably-priced for the quality and quantity you get, and everyone there was friendly. The artwork was impressive as well. Again, we didn&#39;t care about the wait at all. We had a good time regardless!Nellie&#39;s really took me by surprise. I am very happy to discover such a wonderful, charming place. This place is full of win and 5-stars.PS: Parking is free on Sundays until 4pm!"

Very tasty way to start your meal. Follow that bowl of goodness up with a Rican omelet: plate-sized egg goodness, filled with peppers, cheese, tomato, onion, ham, AND TOPPED WITH PLANTAINS. Dye your hair platinum, cut it into a crew and scream into the void, &#34;Stop the insanity!&#34; Delicious.Now, improve upon your meal by ordering orange juice or coffee. I ordered the lemonade and while i appreciated the free refills, it was pretty watery and I didn&#39;t &#39;get&#39; it. Stick with breakfast standards. If you&#39;re a bread person, you&#39;ll like the slightly garlicky crunchy bread that comes with the meal. It&#39;s not a deal-breaker or game-changer. It&#39;s just there.Stretch out. Relax. Stay a while. The joint is a lot bigger on the inside than what it looks like from the street. This is summer in the city. You gotta do it."

I am going to rant about the employees and management.We made a reservation for Sunday Brunch and showed up on the dot. They had no record of the reservation. However they said they could seat us in 15 minutes. Twenty minutes later a different employee came over and asked if we had a reservation. She had no communication with the previous person.  We told her our story. She said she would seat us in 15 minutes. We finally got seated.We had a group of six people. Four of us ordered the buffet. The other two ordered off the menu.Wait staff were very negligent about refilling coffee and orange juice.We got the check. Like most places they added a tip because we were a group. However the tip was outrageous. They put on a 20% tip. Most places will put on 18% if they do full service. This was mostly buffet! The proper tip for buffet service is 10%.I feel we were ripped off.At this place the food comes with a generous side order of abuse. I will never go back.The good food is not worth taking the abuse."

I wanted to try something new so my breakfast buddy and hooked up and went to this quaint little place. We read there was some big wait times but we go there about 11ish so the wait was next to nothing. Im guess because Sunday mass was still in across the street. I was also intrigued because of the strange hours of operations (Wed-Sun 9am-3pm)  We went with the buffet ($16.00 all you can eat) They had an awesome elderly gentleman there hooking up the freshly made omelets right in front of you all while telling great stories of his days as a young man in Puerto Rico. He made everything with fresh veggies and a special seasoning that he could/would not reveal the secret to. Hmmm They also had French toast, Pancakes, Chicken, Rice and the famous Coconut Oatmeal. Yes. I did have seconds of that. Another awesome bonus was all available juice was included in the buffet! This was quite a good choice and I will be back.

We loved the coffee, but didn&#39;t like that we had to wait for refills. Everything we needed we literally had to flag down someone to help us:  napkins (there&#39;s a 5 year old at the table--a waiter should just set those down first thing!), a place setting for all three of us (until our food was served there were only 2), actual milk or cream instead of those homogenized plastic packet thingys would have been preferred.

I ordered a pizza on a Friday night and knew the wait would be long but I never expected a 1 hr 45 min wait for a small stuffed. The girl on the phone seemed to not know what she was doing, told me my card was declined, and then said never mind it went through.When the pizza finally arrived I gave the delivery driver a really nice tip EVEN though it had taken so long. I kept hearing my phone going off in the next room and when I finally answered it was the manager saying quite rudely and loudly that if I didn&#39;t pay for the pizza NOW she was going to call the cops. That the driver had been knocking and no one had paid! I tried explaining to her that the girl on the phone said it had gone through just fine but was cut off.One we never heard knocking at the door. Two there was no need for her to act up the way she did when it was a simple misunderstanding. And then she hung up as soon as I gave her my card information. I was pissed off.

Didn&#39;t think twice and handed the waitress our ID&#39;s. She took them to her manager.This is when I thought it was highly strange and irregular that they had to take our ID&#39;s out of our sight. So I went back to the cash register where the apparently appointed  manager was running credit cards, I told her I thought it was entirely inappropriate to have our ID&#39;s taken to her and I needed my ID right there.This is highly inappropriate and now I wonder if they are running a scheme. There is absolutely no need for this, the waitress can ID customers without taking their cards where God knows what they can do with them (scanning machine, copies, etc)Very disappointing end to what could have been an ok meal. Now, I am wondering if I will be the victim of credit fraud.I am alerting my credit cards and mentioning them as a potential source of future problems.Oh, and the &#34;manager&#34; acted surprise when i told her I need my ID CARD back.

The final rating overall rating including the terrible service is two stars. Our explaination follows:I will not bore the reading with tales of how or why we ended up eating dinner here on Wednesday July 27 about 5pm.  It does not matter and we absolutely find those stories utterly so self-absorbed that anything the reviewer types afterward becomes suspect.Our server was a chunky male with black hair and he had a short name, but just cannot recall.  Part of our order for the appetizers was the parmesan fries.  He brought out a small plate of regular fries.  When I asked about the parm fries he said &#34;I heard you just say fries. I will take these back to see if they can do something.&#34; About two minutes later he brought the exact same plate of fries, now with some parm sprinkled on them.  I still had to ask for the ranch sauce.Time and time again throughout the meal he would pass by to refill other tables water or beverages, but never stopped at ours.  Several times he had a full water pitcher as he raced past with no eye contact at all.After the meal we sat for almost 15 minutes for him to bring a check.  Another 10 to get the credit card and receipt back.I watched as other servers gleefully assisted their customers.  Not us.We had a view of the entrance toward the kitchen area.  Bussers stood there often. One frequently biting his nails and spitting what he chewed off out onto the floor.The calamari was fantastic.  Chicken chopped salad divine blew my mind with the texture and flavors.  Do not pass it up and the portion was yuuuge.  Now the pizza.....sigh...well....bland. Almost no sauce and just was bland. There is a shaker of some seasoning at each table, please use it because the kitchen does not.So, that sums up the visit. Even though the hotel we stay at is just down the street, on the next visit we will certainly find another pizza joint. This one is just too pricey to give it a second shot and it to fail. Be well, my friends."

How could I not have the Chicago deep dish pizza.After, much debating my wife and I finally decided to go to Giordano&#39;s along with a few friends. We decided to order the bruchetta since the wait time for a deep dish pizza is 45mins-1 hour. For the pizza, we decided to play it safe by ordering classic pepperoni.The bruchetta did not disappoint. The tomatoes were as fresh as they could be and the bread nice and crispy. It had a nice flavor.A little while after getting done with the bruchetta, there it was, the moment of truth, our deep dish pizza finally arrived. The cheese was nice and gooey, the filling was nice and fresh, and the crust was perfectly crispy. All in all a solid pizza. We ordered a medium, which was good for 4 people.Now was this the greatest pizza, perhaps not, maybe because I&#39;m too used to having my pizza New York style on the go with the cheese dripping and the paper plate being greasy. Having said that, the pizza was still pretty solid and would recommend it to someone. The only thing which was disappointing was the service. The servers looked confused and were not very accessible."

Two of us had the small veggie which is 6 slices and ended up saving one slice each for breakfast the next day (take note...equally as good cold as it was warm the night before). There are naturally a lot of pizza options, and we also split a side Greek salad as an appetizer. Speaking of appetizers, I had joined the Giordano&#39;s e-club and had a coupon for a free bruschetta or garlic bread. Unfortunately, I was informed that they cannot be shown on a mobile device, they must be printed, which is fine, but what bothers me is that it is not written anywhere so how would we have known? Anyway, our pizza took over an hour to come out which I should add is completely normal and should be expected (even when we just ordered a small pizza and the restaurant was relatively empty at the time). Our waitress got the job done, though I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to praise her friendliness by any means.

The last few times I&#39;ve ordered for delivery it has taken close to 2 hours for the pizza to arrive  which is not a big deal since they tell you up front that it&#39;s a long wait, the problem is that by the time the driver makes other deliveries and gets to me my pizza is already cold.Second issue is that they stopped accepting coupons as of June 1st so the extra coupons I had (with no expiration date) are no longer valid and they wouldn&#39;t even honor my $5 coupon as a courtesy given that I didn&#39;t know they had stopped accepting coupons.The gentleman who took my order suggested I sign up for email alerts or whatever in order to get coupons via email. Soooo you still issue coupons but you can&#39;t honor mine?

To the racist lady at the bar who changed the Hawks game while I was clearly watching it just because the white kid who just came in wanted to see the Oklahoma game screw you!! That was rude and uncalled for! Horrible! JustHorrible!! I made a point and stated &#34;hey! I was watching that!!&#34;&#34; And she ignored me and kept walking. It didn&#39;t matter to her that I was there first and watching a Chicago team in Chicago play. She changed it because I wasn&#39;t white. Shame on you giordanos shame on you!! Brown people love hockey too!!

Actually, I was going to Des Moines for the weekend to visit my Parents, and Jeff was heading back to Northern California. After checking in at the nearby Hampton Inn, we separately asked for restaurant recommendations and pretty much got the same response (word for word) from 2 different front desk staff. Oh well, beggars can&#39;t be choosers, especially since we didn&#39;t want to get in the car,Giordano&#39;s is one of the Chicago Deep Dish Pizza chains that some people swear by. And so much so that cross-country delivery is available. We ordered cheese and spinach, with a starter salad, and a few glasses of Goose Island beer. It was all delicious and with enough left over for another meal over the weekend. Service was most hospitable for these weary travelers, even though I wish I were a little closer to Chicago proper for this dining experience."

Ordered a small deep dish. Didn&#39;t take that long to come out. Service was good. Pizza was out of this world good Everything was great. Went to the bath room. And it was COMPLETELY a mess. There was a crap in every bowl there was a sign not to flush toiletries, to use  the garbage ..but there wasn&#39;t one in each stall. So there was pads every where. The bathroom was super dark. Someone could a been in the corner and i wouldn&#39;t have even seen them. When I got in there I didn&#39;t even have to use the bathroom anymoreEverything else was amazing. Sad that I had to deduct a star cos of how well they kept the bathroom.Will be back (the restaurant... not the bathroom)"

This pizza changed my view of &#34;deep dish pizza&#34; and I now completely understand why they call it a &#34;pie&#34;! Patch P. and I ordered a 2 person pizza that came with 6 slices and were barely able to finish 2 slices each in one sitting with some beer! We were greeted by the friendly owner who told us his personal favorite toppings are the all-beef meatballs and the chicken sausage.  We went ahead and ordered half all-beef meatballs with mushrooms and then chicken sausage with mushrooms on the other side. The winning protein topping was the all-beef meatballs! We had to get a personalized 6&#34; pizza combo each before we left Chicago.  Each combo came with a bottle of soda and choice of a side salad or garlic fries for $8.95.  We also ordered fried calamari to-go. Everything was delicious from start to finish! We noticed they do nationwide shipping on their website and will definitely have to try that in the future.Tip: Each pizza takes about 40-45 minutes to make, call ahead and order to go, or if you&#39;re dining in, order some appetizers to hold you over! Also, don&#39;t forget to join their mailing list as they offer a complimentary appetizer of bruschetta to try!"

Unfortunately this place isn&#39;t very solo diner friendly if you want pizza and are traveling. They do not do pizza by the slice or offer pizzas small enough for one person. I stayed in a hotel with a tiny mini fridge so I couldn&#39;t really take leftovers with me. I was about to leave but in an effort to try and accommodate me the waiter offered the Beefzza as an option. I decided to try it and it tasted alright but it wasn&#39;t the deep dish pizza I was looking for. Maybe if it had had tomato or Alfredo sauce in it it would have been enough but instead it had a dipping sauce (which tasted good but again, was in the mood for deep dish pizza). Probably won&#39;t eat here again unless I&#39;m with other people and can split something. I gave it three stars because the staff was friendly and attempted to accommodate me."

It&#39;s the Closest one to my house. But sadly the pizza here is garbage. It&#39;s never consistent. I have no complaints about the other locations I go to by my job or my friends house. Maybe it&#39;s jus the cook or something. But I will avoid this location.
