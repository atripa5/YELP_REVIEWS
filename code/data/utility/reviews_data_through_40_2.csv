The food has always been good; it&#39;s the service that has been up and down.The first time I went to Buck&#39;s, service was terrible.  I shared the kickin chicken meal and had a biscuit and egg sandwich; we had to send the chicken back because it obviously had been sitting there for a while before it was brought to our table.  That messed up the entire experience (though the biscuit was amazing).  I was close to not returning, but the server knew she messed up and wisely comped an appetizer.My second visit was much better.  I came with a group of 7 or so, and the food came out reasonably fast and tasted really good.Last week, the third time was the charm.  Alex our server was terrific.  I went back for the biscuit and egg sandwich and the half chicken meal.  The biscuits really are wonderful.  I think I probably like the chicken at Gus&#39;s a little better because they have less breading, but Buck&#39;s sides are better and the space is cuter.  It looks like the service issues have been sorted out (I hope) so this place is definitely worth a visit!"

I love the twist the smoked salmon gave them. Then we got the Mac n Cheese, which had good texture and creaminess, but you might as well call it Mac n Cream bc either the cheese was real bland or there wasn&#39;t enough. We topped it with their hot sauce with improved it tremendously.Main course, I got the 2 piece dark and biscuit. The chicken started off good, it had a good crunch to it, but the flavor tasted like something burnt, and as I ate, I think excess amount of oil in the skin started to turn my stomach. The biscuits were good, though kind of dry, but the preserves you got with it was the star of the entire meal. My husband got the OG which he said was good, but like the aforementioned dryness of the biscuits, said it needed more sauce, which was only on the stop of the sandwich.My stomach didn&#39;t feel good at all leaving Bucks, and as far as chicken goes I&#39;d say Harold&#39;s is a ton better, tho Honey Butter is still king in my book."

We were traveling and stopping through Chicago and wanted a family friendly comfort food dining experience.The ambiance was super dark.  So dark I had to use my phone flashlight to read the menu.  I wouldn&#39;t call that family friendly. There was enough space for us all as we were the only table inside when we were seatedMy sister and I ordered iced tea. It was so strong it smelled like coffee. We both love strong tea but tea that strong should be served sweet at this southern restaurant and with a healthy dose of lemon in my opinion.I ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer. They were not hot or crispy when they arrived to the table.I expected the chicken to take a while but the app took a while too which leads me to believe it sat in a window waiting to be delivered.The chicken is the star of the show for sure. It came hot, juicy and crispy. The Mac and cheese had a cheesy smokey thing going on and was very flavorful. The greens (though we as a family LOVE our greens prepared with vinegar) were as my 5 year old described &#34;too strong&#34;. The vinegar was over powering.The biscuits were amazing, though I would&#39;ve appreciated them more had they come out hot. The amount of time it took to get the chicken the biscuits (which we had to ask for after the rest of the food arrived) could&#39;ve been baked to order.  Maybe they were and the aloof,  preoccupied server just didn&#39;t bother to make sure we got them. The apple butter they were served with is delicious.The service was the cause of the 3 star review. The waitress was wack and inattentive and spacey like she didn&#39;t want to be there.  She also charged me and my sister&#39;s credit card twice for the wrong amounts and I&#39;ve contacted the restaurant 3 times since Monday and no one has called me back yet to address it.If I lived in Chicago I&#39;d go back and sit at the bar and eat and have a whiskey cocktail and I&#39;d be sure to use cash."

The best meal we could have asked for before venturing up Halsted for Pride.I&#39;ve had this place in my bookmarks for the longest time, and only recently had the opportunity to roll in on a weekend brunch date. The restaurant is huge, and has plenty of tables for outdoor seating- perfect for summer days.We cycled through a couple of waiters (apparently we were right in the middle of them changing), and everyone was incredibly friendly and nice. Looking over the menu initially, we were intimidated to see the number of fantastic options available.I stuck with the classic and ordered the Chicken &amp; Biscuit ($9), with two dark meat pieces and kickin&#39; for that spicy flavor. The fried chicken was seriously on point. Golden, crispy, and not over-fried to the point where the batter takes dominance over the actual meat. Despite it being kickin&#39;, it was not at all spicy. The biscuit came out hot and steamy, ready to be buttered and consumed.We drank that all down with a few pitchers of Brunch Punch, which tasted like Ginger Beer mixed with Grapefruit. It was a refreshing and tasty way to start our day.Definitely looking to come back again to try more of their items. Everything looked amazing!"

So it&#39;s a bar and restaurant at the same time. Decor was very nice and there was outside dining as well. Service was actually really really slow. When we sat down, we waited for a good 10 minutes before ordering, which I felt personally was too long of a wait especially in I came in hungry. Then to top it off, our food took over 23 minutes to come out... I only knew that because i was snapchatting my drink when it came out.Food was pretty decent. We had 1/2 a chicken which also came with biscuits and we got some mac &amp; cheese. The crunchiness of the chicken was pretty good. We ordered spicy chicken but there was nothing spicy about it. At least they had some homemade hot sauce which was also not spicy but it tasted pretty great. Mac &amp; cheese was very average, nothing too special. The biscuit was very soft in the inside and it was neat how they give you both jam &amp; butter. Let&#39;s say, when we left, we both devour our food and left full. Pretty decent place to check out but not sure if I&#39;ll ever crave for it. Nothing compared to what I tried out in Tennessee but it will do for some southern food."

Great chicken, and fairly good biscuits. Trendy.Apple Butter was outstanding.  My wife really enjoyed the shrimp and grits, which i thought was just alright. The Pimento Cheese, found on the OG biscuit (among other offerings) tastes like cheddar straight out of a tub.They no longer offer a fried chicken wing topper on the Bloody Mary (I asked). To bad there are a few pictures of this fancy topper floating around.The friend chicken is great. The fiery is not hot at all, and requires some of their really good, house made hot sauce. It is spiced perfectly to accompany poultry. This place knows what they&#39;re doing, and they do it pretty good"

For the most part, my hometown hasn&#39;t quite satisfied my fried chicken craving.Jenny, my pleasant server, suggested that my girlfriend and I split a half-bird and it would be plenty of food. Boyyyy was she right. These were some healthy chickens! Each individual piece was the size of two pieces at Parsons. We went with the spicy chicken as opposed to the classic. It was truly a masterpiece.  Fried to perfection sitting in this terrifically oily sweet and spicy juice.  I loved how many flakey fried little crispy thingys fell off the chicken. Ugh.The half bird was also served with two biscuits, apple jam and some butter.  The biscuits are also outlandishly large &amp; surprisingly not dry at all. Unlike most midwestern biscuits, these were moist and packed with flavor.I&#39;m coming back to bucks. A lot. I promise."

Yes Buck&#39;s is still delicious but they cut out a ton of items from the menu to leave like 5 options (ok I&#39;m being dramatic but a lot was removed).  I ordered the half bird which comes with 2 biscuits along with sides of mac n cheese and collard greens.  The fried chicken is still just as delicious and flavorful while still being juicy.  The biscuits were light and fluffy and the fruit jam they serve it with is delicious.  I could have done without the mac and collard greens since they weren&#39;t impressive.  I prefer my mac n cheese super gooey and thick with cheese and the way it&#39;s prepared here is more liquidy.  As for the collard greens, these were overly salty (moreso than usual collard greens) and had a bit too much vinegar in them.  Overall it&#39;s still a solid spot for fried chicken and biscuits if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for!"

The chicken is also so tender, you don&#39;t even need a knife...soo good.Waitress was non-existant except when she took our drink order, brought our drink and the check, but the manager checked on us a few times which was a nice touch.This place is amazing and I highly recommend it to any lover of southern style brunches.."

My friend and I were looking for a tasty meal and didn&#39;t want to wait hours for a table. Buck&#39;s was that plus more - with cheap prices, casual yet sophisticated atmosphere and friendly, yet not intrusive service.My friend and I started with the deviled eggs ($6). Unique and divine deviled eggs! Filling had an ever so slight kick, was very creamy and topped with smoked salmon. I had never had salmon in my deviled eggs and that really changed &amp; elevated the flavors.My friend had the dark fried chicken meal ($9) which came with a biscuit. Very solid chicken! It was moist with great flavor and that skin! Crispy and packed a punch of spices that was just right.For my main, I had the cheese &amp; egg biscuit ($4) then added bacon (for an extra $2). I absolutely loved this! I&#39;ve been looking for my new go to breakfast biscuit place since Endgrain closed and I do believe I&#39;ve now found it in Buck&#39;s. The biscuit is crumbly, buttery and you&#39;ll only get a few bites in before it&#39;s a mish mosh of bread mixed with the ingredients on your plate, forcing you to knife &amp; fork it. That&#39;s not a bad thing though. It&#39;s all about the taste and this biscuit knocked it out of the park for me oozing with egg &amp; cheese.The biscuit sandwich was so good - I ordered one for later to go!

We were curious to see just how different Buck&#39;s is from Carriage House. While the furniture and layout of tables has changed, it had a similar vibe. The front area is now loungey, though, which looked nice and comfortable. There was a &#34;please seat yourself&#34; sign at the front, so we did, but we did have a server for our table.I ordered a glass of wine while my friend had a drink and we both happened to order the same food item: the OG fried chicken sandwich. It was....just ok. Fried chicken was pretty average, the biscuit seemed a little on the dry side, the pimiento sauce was good. It just really wasn&#39;t worth the calories to me. I probably wont be ordering it again, but that&#39;s because I think I&#39;ll only be back to Buck&#39;s for drinks-only outings. I think it&#39;s a great place for just that, especially because it falls perfectly in the middle between sports bars and craft cocktail bars. It&#39;s casual enough, but also nicer than just going to a bar. I can imagine a lot of Tinder first dates happening here.It wasn&#39;t very busy, but then again it was a cold Monday evening. Service was friendly. Prices were fair. There were TVs above the bar area, but they weren&#39;t on so I&#39;m not sure what the deal is with that. Not a place I&#39;d pick to watch games anyway, but just an FYI."

I had the regular chicken because I was with some individuals who can&#39;t take spicy food. Nevertheless, the chicken had flavour. The macaroni and cheese required a second order. The greens were okay; I&#39;m from down South where cooks know how to do up greens. The biscuits are my Kryptonite. They may also make you weak in the knees.The restaurant has a lot of energy and with it being a seat-yourself affair, I don&#39;t think they take reservations.

I love when places to do this.They have a small menu, but that way they can make sure everything is made the best it can be.We ordered the devilish eggs, broccoli cheddar slaw, fried green tomatoes, and new dish with green beans, tomatoes and hummus (a vegan and vegetarian friendly dish), fried chicken and biscuits with homemade apple butter, and beignets with expresso butterscotch sauce. .The best parts for me were the devilish eggs, fried chicken and the expresso butterscotch sauce. The devilish eggs had a nice piece of smoked salmon with creamy insides. The fried chicken was juicy inside and all giant pieces.

The menu is kept short but several items stand out.We kept our meal simple. We started off with the broccoli cheddar slaw. The broccoli is intentionally half-cooked and it&#39;s drizzled with shreds of cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, vinegar, and seasoning. It was unique and tasted great, but I&#39;m a little hesitant to pay $4 for a few pieces of broccoli.With the main course, we each ordered the two-piece dark chicken in which one was traditional and the other was kickin. Each order was served with their homemade biscuits. I can probably write a paragraph on why the biscuits were the star of the night, but I will keep it short. The buttery-rich biscuits were served right out of the oven. They were delicately browned, with plenty of moist from the steam. Each biscuit had a very fine-grained crumb while staying flaky, fluffy, and tender. You can apply their homemade preserves and butter, but I think they were perfect as is.As for the fried chicken, if you can&#39;t handle much spice, traditional is for you. The kickin&#39; sauce can leave a slight burning sensation on your tongue. The sauces are distinctive but I was distracted by several things. The batter is seasoned but it was also extremely thick. That lead me to believe they fried the chicken on high heat in which the outer layer was well cooked but the meat on the inside was still pink. The dim lights in the restaurant can really be a hazard for such situations. So I would urge you to cut into the chicken before taking a bite. Nobody would want to consume raw chicken meat by accident. Also, each piece of chicken was dripping in oil. Somebody in the kitchen must have forgotten to drain the chicken on a rack because I felt like I was taking sips of cooked oil."

Not to mention that is was not crispy and again the gravy tasted like vinegar. My 11$ entree sandwich came on a teacup saucer and the ham was so burnt I could not eat it.

The guy that sat us was a super cool dude and our waitress was so helpful and around when needed without being annoying. The food however...kinda average. Both pieces of my chicken had blood in them and were far from crispy. The portions are alright but left a little hungry. The biscuits were TO DIE FOR. The marmalade with some honey...now I understand why Beyoncé made a stop here. We had the beignets for dessert which were okay but the sauce was great. I think I&#39;d come back and sit at the bar for drinks and the scene but wouldn&#39;t be back for food.Also they sell their hot sauce now which my other friend was waiting and waiting for (swaaaag).

Well, aside from the chicken I guess. Creamy, cheesy, and crunchy.Biscuits - the bf likes biscuits, so he asked a few questions about how many came with the meal, etc. I guess she translated that into &#34;they must want a extra side of biscuits&#34; cuz we ended up with 3 extra and of course, a charge for biscuits on the bill.

We strolled in for an early dinner on the weekend. Only a couple tables were taken. My bf and I ordered 1/2 bird kickin style, collard greens and mac and cheese. After waiting for about 15 minutes, I realized none of the other tables had food on their tables. I started to notice how antsy everyone was becoming. Everyone kept looking towards the kitchen to see if any food was being brought out. A little later I saw a platter of chicken brought out to a family who has been there longer than us and they had their food wrapped up immediately to go. Uh oh. The fryer in the kitchen must have been broken or something. Service was at a standstill. We finally got our food after waiting more than 30 minutes and the food looked delicious! I grabbed the chicken breast, cut into it and saw pink juices run out and pink meat with a little blood. :( My bf&#39;s chicken leg was fine, though. I immediately told our waitress who then took the whole platter of chicken away. The mac and cheese was pretty good, but the collard greens were a little too sour for me. We waited another 10-15 minutes for our chicken to be brought out again. And when I cut into the chicken breast, the meat was pink in the center, again! It wasn&#39;t as undercooked this time (no red blood), but I didn&#39;t have the heart to send it away again. I also didn&#39;t want to wait around any longer. I ate the cooked edges of the chicken breast and called it a day. No apologies for the extra long wait or for the undercooked chicken. I definitely won&#39;t be back."

We sat out on the patio on a nice evening. It took a bit to get served, but food came out pretty quick. We ordered a half chicken traditional with biscuits and mac and cheese. The chicken was a bit overfried and a bit salty for my taste, but my hubby loved and savored every bite. He used the hot sauce on the table to give a nice added kick. The buttery biscuits were delish. They just crumbled too easy. The mac and cheese with mostaccoli noodles was the perfect creamy cheesiness. We&#39;ll make another visit."

I love their zinger options - ginger, citrus and mint with your choice of spirit.  The radlersnakes and other cocktails received the thumbs up as well.  The food is also solid. The menu is much smaller and more tailored to typical southern food.  The fried chicken is tasty.  The seasoning is nice, it has a nice crisp and the chicken was moist.  The biscuits were awesome and so flaky.  I&#39;ve now been back for chicken and biscuits a few times.  We have tried the mac and cheese as a side item.  It is a solid mac and cheese, but could be a bit cheesier in my book. I&#39;ve tasted the deviled eggs with smoked salmon - good but not my typical repeat item.  The prices are very reasonable.Service has been okay. It is not as good as it was when it was a restaurant. Friendly service but slow at times.  They could probably use a few more hands on deck.Overall, it is a pretty good neighborhood spot."

Just okay for me.Fried chicken was flavorful, biscuits and jelly were very good (hello carbs!) and the shrimp was tragically overcooked with the veins still in.I tend to get overly excited when I try new places with big hype. This place didn&#39;t quite live up to the hype for me. But I&#39;ll have to try again once they have been open for a while.An update: I went back to Bucks to enjoy biscuits and a few drinks and had a great time. The summer atmosphere - sitting outside with a huge pitcher of gin lemonade while playing scrabble was perfect.

As a crazed Instagramer (stacypastry) if you must know lol, I tend to follow those that know all the great new hotspots here in Chi.  I just moved here last year.  I have been craving fried chicken and biscuits!Starting with the deviled eggs.  Cute presentation, not flavorful enough, and the salmon overpowers.  Kale salad.  Oh.  My.  Kale. God.  #spotoncomponents Crisp and crunchy fresh kale, delectable blue cheese crumbles, crisp tart apples, and candied pralines for my eyes rolling back crunch, and complete with biscuit croutons.  (As a chef, waste not want not).  Let&#39;s talk about the traditional style 2 piece white fried chicken that was juicy and dripping from my chin. Can I curse here?  HELLO!  Polished that off while just about to drink the apple butter from a straw it&#39;s that GOOD, accompanying the fluffy hot biscuits that remind me of grandma in the back with floured paws.  Washing it down with a complimenting &#34;Zingers&#34; ginger beer (most amazing crisp and refreshing) combined with bourbon and amaro.  Don&#39;t know what amaro is, but damn I felt like a Southern Fried Belle who had to unhook her corset after dinner.  Woo!"

The space still feels really hip and trendy, but the menu is definitely more casual with fried chicken / southern food options.I came with 5 friends, and we all started out with a variety of drinks. Their drink menu is fun, includes various punch bowls ($39 for 4+ cocktails), beers + a shot ($5), and regular cocktails ($8). I opted for the oldie but goodie, and later had their whiskey sour. Both spot on.We came hungry, so we ordered quite a bit of food. For starters, we had the mac n cheese, fried green tomatoes, kale salad, pimento cheese and shrimp n grits. My highlights were definitely the shrimp n grits and the mac n cheese. I will say that everyone at the table had different favorites, and all dishes were really strong. Portions on the appetizers are small-medium, so we ordered doubles on some of the items to make sure there was enough for the 6 of us.For entrees, we tried a variety of the biscuit sandwiches and the fried chicken pieces. I personally loved their fried chicken. Super crispy on the outside. Their OG Biscuit Sandwich was a slice of heaven. It came de-condtructed style with pimento cheese, so we attacked it knife and fork. As a side note, the biscuits did come out pretty late. However, they had obviously just come out of the oven and were amazingly soft and flaky. Dare I say best biscuit ever?I loved it here and will definitely be returning on a night when I&#39;m feeling indulgent. Awesome new concept!"

It was mad juicy, seasoned to perfection, and fried just right. It&#39;s also worth nothing that it wasn&#39;t dripping in grease, which is perfect. I&#39;d go as far as to say that the chicken was exceptional.The average: the macaroni, grits and the biscuits were average; that is, not bad but also not great.The bad: the collard greens. Omg just don&#39;t. We ordered the greens and both ended up sending them back for replacement dishes. The first thing you taste when you put them in your mouth is VINEGAR, and TOO MUCH of it. It was a vinegar overload. I&#39;ve never had Greens that were so vinegary in all of my life. Then, they put garlic cloves in there to make matters even worse. Yuck. I had them replaced with grits, which were average because they were far too runny. Also, $5 per side (everything&#39;s a la carte) was over the top for the kind of average sides that made their way to our table.I ordered a lemonade when I first say down. The lemonade came in a narrow and short glass. Probably no more that 5 or 6 ounces could fit into the glass. Within about 15 minutes it was nearly gone. No one came to refill it or offer other beverages to us until the check was requested. Whatev. I might return for the chicken, to-go."

Are you staying here or not?&#34; and walks away. In her defense, she probably gets asked that daily and I was on my phone trying to figure out whether or not I was at the right place. But I stayed anyway...and meh.First, let&#39;s start with the winners. If you&#39;re in the area, stop in for these:1) my drink was delicious. They obviously have a great bartender. My old fashioned was great. Yum.2) the biscuits are to die. They come with these delicious apple preserves. Omg. My friend actually stopped me mid-sentence so she could &#34;just enjoy this moment in silence.&#34; Imagine the warm gooey insides of an apple pie meets an oh so buttery biscuit. Are you drooling yet?3) the pimento cheese rocked. It&#39;s served with pickled vegetables and warm, buttery toast squares. The cheese is layered with this marmalade that&#39;s an extra dimension of flavor.4) the chicken. Yes, yes. I&#39;m still a vegetarian so these are entirely assumptions here. My friend devoured the chicken, so I took that as a good sign. But the clincher was when rando dude literally walked up to the table next to me and stole the left overs that someone had accidentally left in the to go container. All happened in seconds...and in a suit. Well played, sir. The chicken police would never suspect you.Misses:1) shrimp and grits. How heart breaking. Grits were lumpy and flavorless. And we got two shrimp and two empty heads. What? So weird. We left most of it untouched.2) the mac n cheese. Say what? I know, I know. The most heart breaking of foods to go wrong. But dear yelpers, pass on the Mac. Maybe just our batch was overcooked, but it was also pretty bland. I almost cried.3) And lastly, the fried green tomatoes. These had so much potential. Crispy, perfectly fried fresh tomatoes. But then... Dum dum dum ... They throw this awful cold black eyed peas mixture on top. Lordt! No.Skip skip skip.So if you&#39;re in the neighborhood and craving a good drink with some killer biscuits, great table service, and a cranky greeting at the door. This. Is. Your. Spot."

I do like the southern, lounge sort of feel they have going on. The lights strung across the ceiling is a nice touch.My friend and I ended up splitting a half bird with the &#34;kickin&#34; seasoning and an order of mac n cheese. The mac is $7 but it&#39;s easily enough for two people, if not 3. The half bird came with 3 thighs, one wing and one leg. It took a while to come out but it was worth it. Each piece was large and juicy, but thankfully not super greasy. I highly recommend the spicier version, it&#39;s not that hot to handle. Mac n cheese was very good with a nice crispy top. The biscuits were really good too, although I didn&#39;t care for their house apple butter.

You&#39;re charged $4 per drink. Have one &#34;refill&#34;, that&#39;s $8 for you non-alcohol drinks.

He tells them there are seats available at the bar.  He seats them and then comes to me. I tell him that I wanted to sit at the bar as well and that couple he just sat was after me.  He told me it should only be a few mins before there&#39;s a space available. At this point, I am very annoyed but stayed for about 5 mins to see if he would right his wrong and seat me at the bar quickly.  Once that 5 mins was up I decided to leave.I can&#39;t help but wonder if this happened because the hostess is just rude and bad at his job or because of my skin color?

Meh.  There&#39;s a slightly burned flavor to the chicken.  It&#39;s not overpowering but it&#39;s...noticeable.Growing up in NC, I love fried chicken.  There&#39;s nothing quite like it.

Last time I was there it seemed somehow understaffed (though it was not busy, just steady) and we waited almost 45 minutes for our food with zero acknowledgement that somehow a salad and two biscuit sandwiches were still not on their way. Some random guy walked past at one point and said, &#34;Still waitin&#39; on your food, huh?&#34;... that was it. We had to ask multiple times for water, and our waitress was MIA for most of the night. I had a hair in my sandwich, which is annoying but I&#39;m not about to throw a fit - but when I told one of the other waiters he said nothing and then walked away and waited for my waitress to show up, which was a little uncomfortable. She took it off the bill and was very polite about it, to her credit.Finally, we gave our card to the waitress and she disappeared with it. Five minutes later and I look around to try to find her... she&#39;s standing at the bar chatting with the bartender, clearly in no rush. It was only when I made eye contact with her that she ran the card and then brought the receipt over (sans card, which she had left at the register but was pretty rude about when we asked her to check for it). That&#39;s just... not okay. Both from a service standpoint and just the basic etiquette of not standing around holding my credit card.Anyway, great biscuits but not worth the wildly frustrating service and wait times. Hoping that they find their groove at some point and make dining there a more pleasant experience, but for now it&#39;s not something I want to inflict on myself or my friends again."

First off, you walk in and the place is warm and inviting: lights strewn across the ceiling, pineapple print wallpaper, and a sign that says, &#34;get rich or drunk trying.&#34; One guy stopped by to take our drink order and brought us water. When we asked for menu recommendations, he gave us some...and then more....and pretty much read us the entire menu. A little awkward, but pretty sure he wasn&#39;t our waiter, since another gal came by and asked for our drink order again and then took our food order. I didn&#39;t mind. Got the 2 piece fried chicken, potatoes, and split the beignets with my friends. All of it was amazing! Beignets came with an espresso butter that was definitely strong, but still great. Chicken was PERFECT-juicy, tender, cooked just right. Honestly could&#39;ve probably eaten a half bird by myself it was that good! Biscuits were also flaky, came with WONDERFUL apple spread and whipped butter. Everything was cooked perfectly. Definitely planning on going back to try the rest of the menu!"

It was pretty empty but of course that expected on a Sunday night at 11. Our hostess was really friendly and gave us recommendation on what was most popular there. We started out with the deviled eggs with smoked salmon and it was by far the best deviled eggs I&#39;ve had ever. I didn&#39;t know how i would like the salmon on top but it actually added nice flavor and texture to it. We then ordered the half chicken (serves 2)  to split and a side of mac and cheeses. It came with 2 biscuits that had the option of honey butter and apple butter. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and went well with their, what i presumed to be, homemade hot sauce. I will  be back to try the rest of the items on the menus because everything was great! The only flaw I found was in the mac and cheese. It  was good but not great and seemed like it may have been missing something."

The chicken pieces were a bit small for the price and the flavor was just ok. The O.G. Sandwich and Mac and cheese were ok also.

The smoked apple and the grapefruit were a great touch!Then, i had the egg/cheese biscuit sandwich. It was very good. Maybe a little dry (could have used some of the tomato jam that came on other sandwiches)My friend had their play on the BLT which was also served on a biscuit. She LOVED it.

Received a half-assed, sarcastic apology from the manager as we told him that the bartenders should be making drinks rather than doing taking shots with each other, as we witnessed while we waited for drinks.The experience was not delegated to our table, we witnessed tables next to us wait equally as long. Yeah, I get having two bartenders for multiple large tables could be time-consuming, but if you&#39;re doing shots, you could also be making drinks (Not to mention, half our table ordered beer. Does it take 35 minutes to pour a beer, and placate some of the guests at the table? Hell, you could have even offered us the shots your bartenders were taking while we waited).What&#39;s really awesome is that after getting up to leave, we went to a much, much busier Bangers and Lace across the street, and had a drink in my hand within 5 minutes of being seated.

The first time was the first week it was opened, after there was a wait at Smoke Daddy and we figured we&#39;d check out another option. I&#39;m so glad we did!Buck&#39;s chicken is moist and incredibly flavorful (we all got the kickin&#39; flavor, but the table next door told us that they preferred the overall flavor of the traditional), and prices are reasonable. The portion sizes are also pretty large. I got a 2 piece and my friend got a half a chicken. When they first brought mine out, I was pretty convinced they had given me the wrong order. I got a full breast, broken in 2 pieces and fried, and a large, meaty wing. The 2 piece is nice because it gives you the option of white or dark meat. All chicken orders come with their moist, dense biscuits with butter and preserves (which I&#39;d highly suggest). Another roommate with us got the O.G. sandwich, which she liked so much she got it again when we returned last week.Drinks were also unique and reasonably priced. I got a $5 Tecate and shot of tequila combo, and roommate got a $5 Rye and Miller High Life.The second time we visited, we all got the chicken and weren&#39;t going to drink since it was going to be a quick visit. When our waitress told us about their $5 40s of budweiser, we changed our minds. She also said since they were big, we needed to stay entertained, so she tossed us a pack of cards to play some games. With the relaxed vibe, it felt like we were sitting in a backyard playing games.Only cons were somewhat slow drink refills/service a couple times (hoping this is just growing pains) and the paper order forms. For food, Buck&#39;s requires you to fill out a single paper form per table that doesn&#39;t always translate well. We had to verbally explain what we&#39;d written each time we visited.Overall, very excited for this new, local spot and can&#39;t wait to get back there!"

The hostess was very nice and welcoming. She gave us the option to dine in or outside. We chose to sit inside. The dining area was comfortable. We got the fried green tomatoes which were pretty tasty. They were prepared differently from what I have had with the peas garnish on top. We ordered the chicken, collard greens and macaroni and cheese.  The chicken was juicy and crunchy. I was surprised at how the meat was cut because the breast looked like a thigh. My biscuit was a great size. The honey and jam made it taste good. The Mac was cheesy. It wasn&#39;t my favorite but it wasn&#39;t terrible. I would come here again but maybe try one of the sandwiches."

I never had a chance to get over to Carriage House, but I always heard good things so I was excited for a Southern style version. The decor is nice: modern open and industrial meets your grandma&#39;s house&#39;s wallpaper. The menu is short and to the point. My first gripe though, is that we had a group of 10, all paying different checks, but we had to fill out 1 piece of paper for the table, which gets confusing since everyone is filling it out at the same time and you can&#39;t decide how many to get of one thing. Also, the waitress was taking orders separate from the sheet so, it was all up in the air. My friend got the deviled eggs but he ate them so fast so I couldn&#39;t try, but obviously that means good things. The mac and cheese is excellent. We got a bucket for the table and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The biscuits have an excellent flavor but they are super heavy, so believe me when I say you will leave uncomfortably full. I also tried the kale salad which was excellent. Great meal, good drinks, good atmosphere, ok staff."

Finally we had to flag someone down, who then explained that Buck&#39;s is the same staff, kitchen, and management - only the decor and menu have changed. She also explained the new menu; It is a questionnaire-like menu where you physically check-off which items you&#39;d like to order and turn it in to the waitress which we did, each selecting two different biscuit &#34;sandwiches&#34;. She also took our drink orders and left.After waiting a little while for the drinks a different waitress brought the correct drink for my date and the wrong beer for me. She apologized and took the beer back but never returned with the correct beer. My boyfriend finally had to get up and go to the bar, where the waitress was just hanging out &amp; leaning on the bar, and remind her I was still without beverage. Finally, I then received my beer.No joke, the exact same happened when they brought out the food. They plopped down his entree and said mine would be right out. As his meal had a runny egg I insisted he start eating. He was more than halfway done with his food before the waitress even came to check on us. She asked how everything tasted. It was laughable as she didn&#39;t even notice that there was no plate sitting in front of me. We let her know I still had not received my food, which she quickly rectified but there was no apology, in fact she seemed confused as though she didn&#39;t even place my order with the kitchen.The cherry on top came after we (once again) flagged down our server and paid... as we were leaving the hostess didn&#39;t say a word to us as we left; No &#34;Thanks for coming&#34;, No &#34;Come back again soon&#34;, No &#34;Have a nice night&#34; - nothing - just silence. We just walked out and looked at each other in disbelief.On a more positive note, the food was pretty decent - though super small serving sizes. The décor was super cute - the beer is served in a mason jar and plates are antique-looking... very casual/farm/chic.Although we are local I am fairly certain we won&#39;t be going back - there are too many options in the area with far better service and equally good if not better food."

Bucks is delicious but service doesn&#39;t make it worth it. Arrived at Bucks and immediately could see they were both understaffed and very overwhelmed. Got seated in 15 minutes and took another 15 minutes for our waiter to stop by the table to make an introduction and take our drink order. We offered our lunch order out of fear he wouldn&#39;t come back for a while after he brought our drinks. He looked very agitated like he had somewhere else to be but we soon realized it was shift change because we never saw him again. Our food arrived about 45+ minutes later which seemed like a really long wait or maybe because we were just starving by then...Our food was fresh out of the fryer + biscuits are finger licking good. We also had an order of the fried green tomatoes which were good on their own but they were served with some sort of beans on top which seemed to be undercooked. We had to ask the girl running food for water because again, our waiter was MIA. Our table was sharing but we were never provided plates so I had to go over to the bussing station to grab plates. As a former career waitress and bartender, this is a big no-no for any guest to do. It wasn&#39;t until we were 3/4 of the way through the meal that a girl came to the table to ask how everything was and if she could take plates away, never making it known there was a shift change and she was our new waitress so I can only assume. We had to ask her for another round of drinks and more water as she was trying to walk away because she wasn&#39;t going to offer. We asked for our check after second round was delivered out of fear she would disappear for a while. I&#39;ve been here several times before and seems you get much quicker service at the bar. I want to love this place but the service is REALLY disappointing."

My mom and I ordered the kale salad, a half a chicken and a side of mac n cheese to split. The kale salad was fresh and perfectly dressed. The chicken was very moist which is a plus! But it didn&#39;t seem like there was much meat on it. The biscuits were good--especially with honey on them! And the Mac n cheese was so-so. Honestly, Kraft Mac n cheese would have been tastier to me. But that&#39;s not really discounting the restaurants Mac n cheese because Kraft is legendary. Anyway, the food was filling and fun!

Two Beautiful African American Divas, my friend and I was in the mood for a lil southern cuisine. I found this place on yelp and it sounded good. The waitess was nice explaining the good choices on the menu as we sat outside on their patio. She ordered fried chicken, fried green tomatoes and two homemade biscuits. I ordered the shrimp and grits, with two homemade biscuits. She said the chicken was good and so was the fried geen tomatoes. My grits were chalky, the (TWO)shrimps were ok and the biscuits were extremely sweet and dry. As my friend and i sat and talked while we were still eating. the bus boy came over to our table, started to reach over her to grab a plate with a few scraps still left on it as i blocked his arm and asked what he was doing. He didn&#39;t ask was we done or nothing. Ten min.later, the waitress comes to the table, did the same thing only my friend still had a piece and a half left of her chicken and was eating it, as the waitress grabbed her plate, if looks could kill we both shouted what are u doing, and she jokingly said to my friend, &#34; youre better at eating chicken than I am,  I would have been done by now&#34;  and chuckeIed. I WAS FLOORED!!! Totally Speechless. I told my friend &#34; Lets get the hell outta here before I snap!!&#34; To put the icing on the cake, we got a block away from the place, had to pull over i was sick as a dog and threw up a few times before we got home.

I don&#39;t usually Yelp, but I think Buck&#39;s deserves a shout out and huge thank you for the amazing service.We ordered the meal deal and an extra side of Mac and some sodas. All in all with tax and tip, Grubhub collected $70. When our delivery arrived, it was a tiny bag with one side of Mac and cheese. One little side. And the delivery guy was like &#34;you ordered more didn&#39;t you?&#34; YES!!!Well guess what, GrubHubs policy if one of their drivers messes up the order, that you have to get a refund and re order!!!! A driver can&#39;t go back and get the right order no matter what!! WHAT A HORRIBLE WASTE OF FOOD, and how completely frustrating it must be for restaurants. Long story short, Grubhub sucks, Bucks was awesome and had an employee deliver the food directly to us with some extras thrown in. It was above and beyond. It was out of their control, but yet they still rectified GrubHubs horrible customer service. It made a Buck&#39;s regular out of us. Thanks again.Ps. The food was DELICIOUS!!! Some of the best mac and chicken in the city!!"

Both were super moist and the chicken was unbelievably tasty and crunchy and spiced just right. We also ordered the radlersnakes with tequila and ancho. I couldn&#39;t taste the ancho, but tasty nonetheless. I am giving buck&#39;s 4 stars because the service could have been much better. There was only one server for the whole restaurant.

Including an appetizer which was just cheese and bread which took probably less than five minutes to make. We got the OG chicken sandwich and the chicken fried steak. The chicken itself was pretty good, the biscuits are amazing! But it didn&#39;t work well together, it was hard to eat and just didn&#39;t blow my mind. The chicken fried steak was pretty tough and just okay as well. Service wasn&#39;t anything special, didn&#39;t feel like the server cared at all."

The food was so yummy! We had biscuits, fried chicken, and macaroni and cheese. Everything was good although the wait time for the food was a good 20 minutes. The night went downhill when there was a bird that flew into the restaurant and was stuck inside. We let a waitress and &#34;busboy&#34; know about the bird and the &#34;busboy&#34; said &#34;it&#39;s just a bird, it&#39;ll be fine&#34;. I&#39;m sorry but if you have a bird inside a restaurant and you don&#39;t try to remove it, it&#39;s totally unsanitary. Not to mention this poor bird kept flying into the window to try to get out. After the bird was inside for over 45 minutes I asked if I could speak to the manager... come to find out the busboy was the manager who was completely rude to us. He told us &#34;the only bird I can help you with is your fried chicken&#34;. Although the food was good, because of the rude manager I don&#39;t think we will be going back for awhile. I thought the point of the manager was to make the customers feel welcome and to represent the restaurant in a polite and positive manner but unfortunately this manager was not that."

Fortunately, the wait didn&#39;t feel bad at all because it was the perfect amount of time to browse through all of their furniture and get some interior design inspiration. By the time we had finished browsing all 5 stories, it was our turn to be seated.Next time, I would most definitely bring a larger group of friends so we can all sit in the middle section of the cafe where they have the beautiful fountain and chandelier. Their tables for 2 are on the periphery so you don&#39;t get to enjoy the view as much.The two of us shared a salmon platter and a burrata platter, and we ended our meals with lattes and warm chocolate chip cookies. It was the best kind of girls date you could have! We both raved about the food (the best salmon on toast I&#39;ve ever had!) and the beauty of the entire house.

I checked in around noon on Sunday and our wait was about an hour.We ordered the Bellinis, the RH scramble, bacon, and charred carrots - I enjoyed it all but was underwhelmed by the yogurt based sauce that accompanied the carrots.Honestly, I would recommend coming in a group larger than two so you can snag seating in the main area. Our table for two was located outside near the bar area - the seating was nice but definitely didn&#39;t offer the same dazzling effect.We toured the other floors afterwards to satisfy our home decor needs and then headed out.

I had this cafe bookmarked as a new spot in Chicago that is perfect for a group of 3-4 to sit comfortably and catch up on their beautifully decorated greenhouse-styled patio. Although I didn&#39;t try any of their entrees, my group decided to come for coffee and the ambiance.WAITThey do not take reservations here, so when I arrived on a Sunday afternoon, they claimed the wait would be at least 45 minutes, but they would text me when a table became available. If you are not there when they call you, they will offer your table to someone else. We went for a walk and decided to return after 45 min. We were sitting in their waiting lounge, within reach of the hostess stand, to ensure that we would know when a spot opened. After waiting over an hour, I decided to ask the hostess how much longer we would have to wait. She checks her seating chart, looks behind her, sees that the patio is about half full, and says that we could get seated now. I would be diligent in checking with the host regarding your wait time! Don&#39;t make the same mistake that I did!We tried their cortado, chai latte, and charcuterie plate. The cortado was super rich and almost chocolatey, which is the perfect way to have my cortado! The charcuterie plate had deliciously fatty prosciutto that was balanced in texture and flavor, paired with a baguette, dijon mustard, grapes, and cheese. More than the food though, I loved the vibe of this cafe! It&#39;s glamorous, chic, and decorated beautifully. I definitely recommend coming by in a group of 4-6 for brunch or just for some nice coffee if you have the time!"

The design of the eating area had me feeling like I was in the dining room of a friend with old money but mad cool though. We all had the avocado toast and oooh it was sooo good. I was like how though, like how? I had a mimosa which was only aight but my homies drank peach bellini&#39;s which according to them were very good.

Some girlfriends planned a lunch here one weekend though and I was surprised to find this beautiful casual restaurant inside a Restoration Hardware. Even while waiting for your table, they have adorable couches &amp; chairs in a million places so you can hang comfortably while waiting. They also have a separate bar towards the back both with alcoholic &amp; non-alcoholic drinks. My BFF and I took advantage of that as we got there a bit earlier than the other ladies. Champs morning!We were seated at a lovely booth in the corner which very comfortably sat the 5 of us. It&#39;s so light &amp; airy inside the café with the fountain in the center being such an eye draw for us. Our server was not overly friendly however service was polite and prompt, nothing to complain about at all.They don&#39;t have a huge beer selection but a Trumer Pils was just $5 for a pint so pricing wasn&#39;t too terrible. I had my eye on the Truffle Grilled Cheese since checking out the menu so it had to be had. $16 got me one of the best grilled cheeses in the city filled with truffle goodness and cheddar cheese on sourdough bread.

Looking to transport yourself to one of Chicago&#39;s finest options for lunch/dinner and inspiration for your home? 3 Arts Club Cafe (I&#39;m calling it 3ACC) and Restoration Hardware (RH) has got to be at the top of your list.Located in Gold Coast, there is free valet parking, and you have five floors to explore while you wait to be called when your table is ready. 3ACC is located inside of RH on the first floor. It&#39;s in an atrium with a fountain in the middle and allows a wonderful amount of light to shine through.Each table and accompanied seating varies depending on where you&#39;re seated, and offers up a faux outdoor experience without the Chicago outdoor weather preventing you from enjoying a nice glass of wine, charcuterie, or even a great burger.Staff and service is attentive, consistent, and readily accessible. My group of five had a great table with seating that must have had 10 pillows! No exaggeration there.I ordered the fresh squeezed pear juice and RH burger (medium rare of course.) If you&#39;re looking for an Au Cheval quality burger, you might as well go to the folks that did it themselves! I tried some of my friends&#39; orders such as the artisanal prosciutto, which came with a warm baguette, mustard spread, grapes, and cheese. I wish my friend ordered some wine, because that would have paired beautifully with this board.If it isn&#39;t already, 3ACC will be at the top of many Chicago foodie lists and places to experience. You can lose yourself in this beautiful and chic environment that offers some of the best of what Chicago has to offer. It&#39;ll be interesting to see what it&#39;s like when winter comes around. Hats off to Brendan Sodikoff and his restaurant group for another hit. Green Street Smoked Meats, Au Cheval, Donut Vault, etc. I love &#39;em all!"

A cup of foam and pungent spiced tea.Smoked Salmon. Four pieces of smoked salmon with capers, red onions, cream cheese, cucumber and radishes for your own customization. *thumbs up*Bacon Club.

They don&#39;t take reservation so my party of four arrived around 11 AM on a Saturday. We waited almost two hours for a table. One upside was that once you put your name down, they link you to this app that tells you how many more parties are in front of you and then they would alert your phone when you are next to be seated. That way, you can wonder around the area and not have to be stuck at the location. However, the cafe is located in this beautifully designed building that makes everything very homey. The Restoration Hardware sells furniture and home decors of all sorts so you can kill time browsing their furnitures or sit on the rooftop.This is probably a one time, try it and never come back place for me."

I love the concept! A restaurant inside a Restoration Hardware. The restaurant is beautiful and set in a garden courtyard. The interior feels as if you&#39;re dining in a Woody Allen movie scene. It&#39;s absolutely gorgeous.My boyfriend, friends, and I wanted to make sure to get there near opening hours. We arrived at 10:10am and there was already a line for the restaurant. The wait was bearable once the staff was feeding their waiting patrons miniature scones... Free scones? Yes! No complaints about the wait here. :) Also we were able to walk around RH once we got our name on the list. When your table was ready, the hostess  would notify you via text.The brunch menu is fairly small and very classic American brunch. It seemed like every guest enjoyed their plate. Of course, as curious foodies we tried each other plates and gave each other our thoughts. My three favorites:1. Smoked Salmon board was an impressive spread. The smokiness from the salmon was very subtle and the toast was also just as tasty as the fish.2. RH burger is also delicious and has a tangy sauce.3. Peach Bellini is a must to start before the meal. It&#39;s probably one of the best peach Bellini I&#39;ve had. The peach purée was very refreshing.Of course after the meal, my group checked out the RH showrooms. We wanted walk off the meal and you have five floors to walk off a bellini at least. My favorite floor is the rooftop. The view is amazing and would be perfect for a rooftop bar (hint hint, rh).Overall, the experience was wonderful and a little pricey but worth the small wait for the time we went. I&#39;m not sure if I would make it a weekly brunch ritual but it sure was a special treat! Also a pre-warning... The seating is not very comfortable... I feel the couches are trying to devour me. Regardless, I recommend checking it out even if you stop by to get a coffee inside."

The burger, inspired by Au Cheval, Burrata and Beets are my favorite.Be warned that this is a popular brunch spot that doesn&#39;t open until 10am on Saturday and 11am on Sunday. A line outside the building starts forming about 45 minutes before they open, and if you aren&#39;t there at least 15 minutes before opening you likely won&#39;t make the first seating (which can result in huge waits/timing uncertainty). The line increases exponentially leading up to opening as large groups join up with representatives that were sent ahead to hold a spot in line.Evening hours are also a bit unintuitive given the ambiance (inside a former mansion-residence-converted-school-and-artist-space) due to dense residential area. Note parking is tough but valet exists.They don&#39;t take reservations and the waits can be pretty epic, but the inside RH furniture store (and accessible if not overpriced alcohol/coffee/pastry bar) is a decent way to kill time.Once you&#39;re in the service can be hit-or-miss, and the seating is a mix of normal tables and couches with coffee tables (the type of table and location within the restaurant can have a significant impact on your dining experience), but worth a try if you&#39;re willing/able to wait."

It doesn&#39;t matter if you get here right at opening, you&#39;ll still wait. While waiting you can pick up coffee/drink or a snack at their to go counter and enjoy it on their rooftop patios. Or just browse the 5 floors of furniture.As I said, once you&#39;re seated, it&#39;s a very pretty scene. And I think this is more impressive than the menu. The menu is very small, but what&#39;s on there is very good for the most part. So far I&#39;ve had the grilled cheese and the burger. I&#39;d choose the grilled cheese any day. Now I would never order a grilled cheese at a restaurant (especially not one that&#39;s $17) but it&#39;s made with truffle oil and it&#39;s so good!Overall, if you&#39;re about ambiance, come here.

Absolutely five floors of beauty and class. Before perusing the store, I highly suggest that you get on the list to dine first because they do not take reservations and they usually have a long wait, especially on the weekends. We went on a Saturday morning around 11:00 and the wait was 1:15 minutes. No big, since we wanted to take our time checking out the store. We were actually in the middle of the 4th floor when I received the text that our table was ready. It had only been 1 hour.We had the truffled grilled cheese and eggs with avocado and texas toast. The food was delish and the grilled cheese was the best that I have ever had! The glassed enclosed atrium is absolutely beautiful and so worth dining here."

One of the staff members gladly took our photo for us and he&#39;s certainly a pro at it by now, as he caught the perfect angle and lighting.It&#39;s great that this is just a quick walk from the Clark &amp; Division red line stop. I came here with a gal-pal Thursday around 1:30. We were told the wait was 10-15 minutes, which was accurate. It was nice that they take your phone number and will give you a holler when your table is ready, so you don&#39;t have to linger around, worrying that you missed being called. As others mentioned, it is nice to roam around scoping out the furniture. Also, the big white couches are super comfy, so it is nice just to chill there as well. Unfortunately, we were not seated in the beautiful center courtyard but instead, we were seated all the way in the back. While not as vibrant in that area, it was still nice, as the chandeliers all around are stunning.We actually had two waitresses, as our first went on break. Both were really great...very helpful, personable, and quick.I got the Ommegang Witte beer which I enjoyed and was appropriately priced. My friend enjoyed her fresh cold-pressed pear juice. I opted for the burrata, as my friend got the arugula salad and we split a side of bacon. I&#39;m glad I followed other Yelpers in the advice on getting the bacon. To note, I&#39;m actually not a big bacon fan, but this was nice. You get four pieces of thick cut glazed strips that weren&#39;t too salty for once. This does cost $7 though. However, it is quite satisfying. The burrata itself was yummy. Very fresh and creamy. It was also perfectly dressed in the right amount of evoo and cracked black pepper. The tomatoes were fine. While I enjoyed the taste of the accompanied garlic bread, I would have liked it to be more fresh. It was a little hard to eat, as it wasn&#39;t soft but wasn&#39;t hard enough to be like a crostini. The arugula salad seemed to be a tad boring.Overall, I actually thought the food was better than expected. They could have more interesting options and sure it&#39;s certainly a bit overpriced, but what they do, they do well. Simple and solid. At least for a nice place like this, while not the most desirable, many of the items come with hefty slices of bread, so you can be left quite filled, instead of just having a few bites of food as your entrée at other fancy places.Definitely would love to come back, but definitely not in prime time, especially since this is a great place to unwind and lose track of time."

Upon driving up to the place they offer free valet so the convenience of just coming in to park and go in was really nice. The interior upon walking in felt like it was a hotel setting. Which i guess kinda make sense since the whole thing was like a museum of interior design. 4 floors that goes to the rooftop of design of different room/ living area space(which are on sale by the way).But i mainly came to check out the restaurant/ cafe on the first floor. We got a table right away even though the reviews said it was packed, but i&#39;m sure you probably have to request the middle area where the tree and nice scenery is that will probably take some time. But overall everything was really nice in the cafe area. I mainly got wine  and talked with my girlfriend so that was nice.The other floors had some nice art and furniture where we walked around and talk about that as well. I do recommend on a nice day if you feel like just having a glass of wine and relaxing that this place would be a nice location. Considering they have a nice breezy upstairs patio where u can bring wine to and just relax,"

It&#39;s usually a wait to grab one of these tables, but they also offer community seating at the dozens of couches throughout the cafe. My wife and I went on a Sunday late afternoon and were seated on a spacious couch with no wait.Everything my wife and I ordered, we enjoyed. The fresh pear juice is great and not too ginger-y. The truffle grilled cheese is excellent and the fries it comes with are perfectly crisp. Wow. We ended our meal with the chocolate chip cookies and a glass of whole milk. The cookies come in threes and are perfectly warm.3 Arts Club Cafe is a hidden gem in Chicago!"

The ceilings are high and the entire space is filled with tons and tons of natural light. Every corner of this place is gorgeous, not to mention the upper floors are all part of Restoration Hardware, so you can enjoy all the beautifully decorated rooms as you walk off your brunch.The food here is not special and it&#39;s also on the pricey side, but it tastes good. During my first visit, my friend and I shared the smoked salmon board and fries with garlic aioli. The salmon board came with toast and a ton of other toppings, making it a very filling meal, but it wasn&#39;t anything too out of the ordinary. Surprisingly, the fries were amazing - I think the garlic aioli really hit the spot. I came here again recently and had the RH scramble, which is super simple but actually a decent deal. For $9, you get two huge slices of buttery Texas toast, strawberry jam, scrambled eggs with creme fraiche, and half an avocado - super filling!Coffee here is good (they brew Metropolis) and service has been wonderful during both of my visits. Considering how beautiful the interior is, I will most likely be adding this to my list of spots to show friends who are visiting Chicago."

The building used to be a dormitory for struggling female artists and the store and restaurant kept up the cool artsy vibe of that history. The enclosed courtyard where the restaurant sits is breathtaking, with the fountain, chandeliers, and surrounding trees. The sofas and tables are beautifully decorated and comfortable.I had trouble choosing my meal, but I was pleased to discover you could substitute your side of fries or salad with any of the salads or vegetable plates for an additional $2.50. I therefore got the fish, which was a rainbow trout simply prepared with lemon and olive oil, herbs, and some radish slices on top. As my side I opted for the beets, which come with kale and chevre in a sesame vinaigrette. I thought this would be a boring, but healthy meal, but it was anything but boring. The fish was wonderfully prepared and flavorful, and the skin was especially crisp and delicious. My beets and kale were tasty as well and I easily cleaned my plate. For dessert, we got the cookies, which were salted chocolate chip and vanilla ice cream. It was a perfect end to a delightful meal. I highly recommend this place."

I had heard about their long waits and was very afraid I&#39;d never make it back to work, but fortunately my dining companions got there before the lunch rush (on a Wed afternoon) and were seated immediately. In fact, by the time I arrived oh so fashionably late they were already serving us food!It can be a bit annoying to eat out due to my latest allergy elimination diet, but there were no issues being soy/dairy/wheat free here. I had the arugula salad (sans cheese) and the dairy/wheat free version of the RH scramble.

Whether you are a Chicago local, visiting town, or need a destination for a special event, I&#39;d urge you to come, taste and see.  This splendid cafe is nestled inside of a gorgeous upscale furniture store called Restoration Hardware (RH).You step inside and -- breathe -- pure splendor.  A combination of high walls, brick siding, a sunny courtyard, extended couches, candle lighting, an indoor fountain.  These elements mesh together and you might have to blink a few times, to orient your mind to take an an incredible view.  Designing (and dining) at its finest.You will see long, wooden tables, suspended chandeliers, people breaking bread, sipping wine, and a white/slate gray theme to their furniture.  Here&#39;s the thing: the first floor houses the cafe, courtyard and wine bar, and floors 2-5 are showrooms of their furniture. Grab a glass of vino. Go forth and explore all the floors.  Go to the outdoor patio on the roof.Shout out to Nancy C, my good friend and fellow Yelper who brought me here first.  I later came back with a party of 6 as a &#34;send off&#34; for another good friend and fellow Yelper Jen B, before a big move out of town.  These people are special to me, and 3 Arts Club Cafe is a place to commune.  Any occasion, however ordinary, becomes a memory when you&#39;ve dined here.  RH &amp; 3ACC have won me over and your occasions will wind up being extraordinary.Their staff are courteous.  They don&#39;t take reservations for 3 arts club cafe, but check-in with the hosts and they&#39;ll take your cellphone number down so you can saunter around looking at coffee-brown vintage maps, and perhaps plan your future home.  I felt like I was in an Anthropology amped up a few notches in sophistication. It was Room &amp; Board meets refinement meets member pricingrestorationhardware.com/…I said to my friend as we were perusing the levels of furniture on display -- can you imagine if RH did bridal? The expertise involved in planning a home rivaled the expertise people pay for to plan an event for a single day.  Maybe this is what design is all about - the details in &#34;la vie quotidienne&#34; which makes one feel timeless.  Their subtle details that catch you by surprise. If I can ever have a home one day as elegant as an RH showroom, well, a girl can dream.And if I still have your attention at this point, I fell in love the design of a room on the children&#39;s floor, which had a French poem hand-painted across one of the walls.  It was by Charles d&#39;Orleans about winter changing into spring, the english tranlsation can be found here:frenchtoday.com/french-p…This sparked magic, and still does.Re: the food, I&#39;ve had the &#34;delice de bourgogne cheese&#34; and the &#34;artisanal prosciutto.&#34;  I really liked both items found &#34;on a board&#34; section, and the friends that I came with also ordered various items including the RH burger, the slow-roasted beets.  Part restaurant, part cafe, part furniture showroom and holistically divine, do yourself a favor and come check it out."

We brought our 7 month old baby with us and she slept through the entire hour and a half brunch.We ate a lot of things from the menu and all of it was fantastic. We had the grilled cheese as an appetizer because we all wanted it AND something else. Thankfully, it was just as good as everyone says. I would definitely order it again. I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s so much better than any other grilled cheese but I promise you, it is.We also got the cheeseburger, the smoked salmon platter, the carrots, and the cookies. Everything was delicious down to the dipping sauce for the fries (garlic aioli). The carrots were incredible and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had quite that flavor combination before. They were wilted and charred so the texture was new and with all the yogurt and pesto they were delightfully creamy. The smoked salmon platter also came with a bit of a twist as it was served with texas toast rather than the traditional bagel or crusty flat bread. The softness of the toast was the perfect compliment to the fish and fixins.A lot of people have talked about the long wait or the lack of reservations but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve seen anyone mention the fact that 3 Arts Club Cafe uses the Nowait app. This allows you to &#34;get in line&#34; remotely so you don&#39;t have to hang around the store for a long period beforehand if you don&#39;t want to. When we went we did wait for the two hours beforehand but for us it was fine. We had donuts and croissants with our wine and beers and sat on a ten thousand dollar couch enjoying them all. It was quite lovely.3 Arts Club Cafe is a must for any serious city bruncher. Do it for the food, the atmosphere, and the Snapchat story!"

Crunch.  Music happening in my mouth.  Very colorful.  Pecans are tasty and has the right touch of cider vinaigrette!  There is a wee bit of anise that I taste.Charred carrots with yogurt, dates, pistachio pesto.  Served chilled.  Lots of smokey flavor.  Cooked perfect to an al dente.  The yogurt gives great balance.  Pistachios are ground.  Dates are good, fresh and not too sweet.  They are plump and have a slight chew.  Few mint sprigs.  Even the lettuce is charred.The grilled cheese is temperature hot, buttered on both sides, not greasy.  The cheese is melty, and the flavor is a little more sharp than mild.  Love the truffle buttered taste.  Great sourdough.  Is it worth $14?  Maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m giving it a star less.  Possibly adding another type of cheese would give this an all star umph.The house made chocolate chip cookies are oh YUMMMMM.  Sea salted on the outside, and crispy outside with melty chocolate inside.  I am getting the warm fuzzies.  All I need is my teddy bear and my cozy socks.  Not sure how the crowd underneath the chandeliers would appreciate me all curled up like that.  If it&#39;s cold outside, this is a great escape to get away and feel like you&#39;re in a beautiful park setting."

Time went by pretty quick.Once we got our table, the waitress was very kind. The food came out fairly quick. The view is just breathtaking. The food was delicious but not worth the money.

It&#39;s a beautiful spot, and a great place to take friends from out of town for a daytime drink and some light fare.There is often a wait, but you can wander the beautiful Restoration Hardware showrooms and lounge on the comfy furniture, so it&#39;s not too much of an ask. They take your number and text you when the table is ready, which is nice. There is a rooftop patio you can enjoy while waiting, as well. You can usually get in with groups 6 or smaller, but I wouldn&#39;t suggest going with many more than that due to the table setup.The food is a bit pricey, but that&#39;s to be expected here and not an issue. There are a couple sandwich options and shared plates. The fries are INCREDIBLE, some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. The burrata is also to die for - I&#39;d suggest the burrata over the cheese plate, for sure.Only complaint on this visit was the spotty service. Our waiter was very friendly when around, but we didn&#39;t see much of him. When he dropped the check, it took about 20 minutes for him to come back by and get our cards, which was a bit frustrating. The vibe is definitely conducive to hanging out and lounging for a while, so I appreciate not feeling rushed to clear your table for the next guy, but we were trying to pay so the extended wait was a little off.Overall, a great spot to visit! I&#39;d say bring your out-of-town guests here, as it really shows off the beauty of the neighborhood and is a gorgeous spot to visit. One unique perk - because the dining area is completely enclosed, this actually makes for an exceptional winter spot! It&#39;s super bright and cheery even in the winter because of the glass ceiling, and the indoor landscaping makes it feel like a nice day even when it&#39;s a awful Chicago winter day!"

I haven&#39;t been here in the evening so the wait times may be different then.Yes the food might be on the pricier side for some, but it&#39;s awesome food. I never felt like I was overpaying. I have had the grilled cheese, salmon board, and the fried with garlic aioli. All are awesome. Pretty big servings, so come with a big appetite or ready to share with others!I&#39;ve seen pictures of the burrata and prosciutto board.

This a super upscale classy to dine. Although they don&#39;t take reservations, the hostess is great about getting people seated.  The main dining area is centered around the giant fountain.  If you are open to dining on a sofa, you will be seated faster. If you do find yourself on the wait list, fear not.  You are free to walk around and relax on one of the many couches.  There is also a small cafe area where you can pick up a coffee to relax while you wait.I was expecting the menu to be crazy expensive but it was pretty fair. The only thing on the menu that was slightly above my pay scale were the wines/champagnes but other wise you could grab a beer at a reasonable price.  Regardless, this a great place for a date. Very unique dinning experience that you have to check out."

I&#39;ve only ever had drinks here, so I don&#39;t have a lot of feedback. The inside is absolutely enchanting. The have a small menu of mostly cafe- like items (sandwiches and salads I think they also have a burger). The drink list is also small. I&#39;ve done both tea and a peach Bellini and have loved both. I would recommend this place for meeting a friend or a group of women doing a small get together. It&#39;s definitely a place to come if you enjoy the ambiance of a restaurant. The fountain in the middle is beautiful and the seating around the cafe is so unique. I&#39;d love to try brunch here.I gave four stars instead of five because I brought my husband here and he decided that we should do dinner somewhere else. We did have drinks here but he said he menu didn&#39;t really match the ambiance.

I also ordered the super salad? and I forget the ingredients but I recall that they were fresh and tasty. I disliked having to cut each piece of lettuce but I guess that&#39;s the style these days. I didn&#39;t like the low table seating but I appreciated the decor and thought the venue was lovely. I probably wouldn&#39;t return but I can understand why people would like this spot.

It&#39;s literally located in Restoration Hardware in a patio on the first floor, and everything from the tables and chairs to the dishware are on point. It actually feels like you&#39;re dining in one of their floor displays.Although the menu is somehwat small, there are some really good options to choose from. I started off with the Pear Cold Pressed juice (in an attempt to be healthy), and it was actually really tasty and not too &#34;green&#34; tasting. Then we got an order of the burrata for the table which was the best. Probably some of the best burrata I&#39;ve ever had and I almost wanted to order a second round. Then a friend and I split the grilled cheese which was once again absolutely amazing, and the RH Burger which was just as good if not better. I&#39;ve been told this burger is essentially the same as the one they serve at Au Cheval (which our waitress more or less confirmed), which I was really excited about since I didn&#39;t have time to go during my trip.Overall, I&#39;d highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great place to brunch any day of the week. If there are long waits it&#39;s actually somewhat enjoyable since you&#39;re able to walk around and browse the store until your table is ready. I will definitely be back here when I come back to Chicago!"

We ordered ours with a side of bacon.. The bacon with the dates was the perfect combo.For main plates it was the RH burger and truffle grilled cheese. Both were great but I thought the cheese on the burger was a little too milky, would&#39;ve preferred a cheddar or another option. The grilled cheese was great but a small dipping side of tomato bisque would&#39;ve made it even better.Overall this is one of the best places in the neighborhood for good food and ambiance.

My question was brushed off and the hostess promptly dismissed and kept ignoring me.

Now, it&#39;s a super posh furniture store, selling $25,000 couches that people try out while sipping champagne. Let&#39;s be honest: that&#39;s icky.Even still, despite my better judgement, I really liked this place. My wife, my 3-month old, and I went on a Saturday, knowing from reviews that it&#39;d be packed. It was a madhouse! We got there at 1:00, put our name in, and committed to the 2 hour wait, which is apparently a constant on the weekend.The good news is this: it takes nearly 2 hours to go through the whole 5-level store. This place is like a European country house meets art gallery meets Restoration Hardware; it&#39;s definitely unlike and RH I&#39;ve ever seen. Truth be told, I&#39;ve never though that looking at obscenely overpriced furniture could be so entertaining.My advice: put your name down, grab a drink from &#34;the pantry,&#34; and start on the rooftop terrace--floor 5. It&#39;s beautiful! And, if the day is nice, a great spot to sit and enjoy your drink.Work your way down, taking your time to Instagram plenty of photos of you in your make-believe living room, and wait anxiously for the text, letting you know that your table is ready.For parents: in the kids section of the third floor, they have a little closet area with a changing table. Totally private and convenient!We got seated 30 minutes early. And they made sure to seat us at a table big enough to accommodate our stroller. They didn&#39;t even scoff at our baby; that&#39;s pretty impressive for a place this posh.True--the place was packed full of the worst kind of yuppies, but we tried to ignore them. Instead, we focused on the unbelievably beautiful courtyard space. It, alone, is reason to try 3 Arts. We&#39;ll be taking family there when they visit for the holidays. It&#39;s just that impressive.Service was top notch. We got a smattering of brunch-type plates, and they were delicious. They have very simple bistro-type food, but everything was prepared perfectly. The scrambled eggs in the RH scramble, served alongside a perfectly ripe avocado, were the best I&#39;ve had. The proscuitto board was beautiful, and the burrata with roasted tomatoes was delicious. We ended the meal with a pot of tea and a donut from Doughnut Vault.To top it all off, the have FREE valet. Yeah, you heard me, people. FREE.So, to sum it up: Be prepared to wait. Plan on spending at least 3 hours. Don&#39;t ask about the history of the building. Drink champagne and be blissfully ignorant."

We got a glass of wine at the bar in RH and proceeded to walk around the store, and the gorgeous rooftop until our reservations were called. The decor is amazing and the food is even better. We ordered Délice De Bourgogne Cheese, Gem Lettuce Salad, and the Rh Burger. I would get all three again. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chi town!"

The designer who came up with the concept for the cafe inside the store deserves an Oscar. Originality is alive! The space is gorgeous and so is the service. The building highlights the restoration hardware principles in a honest manner. Craftsmanship is impeccable. Thanks to reviews like this the wait to get a seat will keep going up. The food is what really brought everything together. The Buratta was memorable and fresh.It&#39;s and experience of five senses.

When we found out it was over an hour wait, we were on our way to a different restaurant. BUT then I got tricked when a gent came passing out these delicious donuts... and my where they delicious! With some of my hunger appeased and happy that the food would be good... we stayed. We ended up waiting two hours! I got the burger and I did not like it... not terrible, but just okay. It was actually incredibly salty. I actually think I prefer burgers from McDonald&#39;s and I don&#39;t even like fast food like that. I would definitely not wait more than 30 minutes for food here. From the hostesses to the waiters... they could be nicer and less snobby too."

In addition, the food was more than what I expected, yet simple! My sister got the burger with a side of fries and I got the truffled grilled cheese with the side of a salad. I would definitely recommend both!I would recommend you get there earlier in the time because it does get crowded! On the plus side, if you do wait, you can explore the furniture!"

With the fountain in the middle and varies types of seating around, it feels like you are dining in an outdoor park but it&#39;s indoors. It is uniquely located inside Restoration Hardware, a furniture store. You can grab a drink from the café inside and browse the building while you wait for your table.The menu isn&#39;t expansive which is fine because they do well with what they do offer. I hear the RH burger is similar to Au Cheval but better ingredients (?). We opted to order a side of thick bacon to go with the burger, which was a great decision. The cheese on the cheese board was deliciously indulgent and buttery. The fries had just the right crisp, and the salad wasn&#39;t boring. I do want to try the fish next time.Service, though a bit slow was knowledgeable and friendly. The food and drinks are reasonably priced and it won&#39;t break the bank.This is a great way to escape the Chicago cold and distress over a leisurely meal. It almost feels like you are in a different country."

It&#39;s a great winter spot since everything is indoors but this cafe makes you feel like your outdoors on a summer day with all the trees and decorations.The furniture is super comfy so try to get on some of the couches. The place has a great ambiance and seems like a perfect date for coffee or just lunch/dinner. You may have to wait if you can&#39;t make reservations.My friends for a grilled cheese and another dish. Grilled cheese was bomb apparently. I would&#39;ve gotten the burger if they had cheddar cheese on it instead of American... Who does that?!? Only fast food places put American cheese on burgers!!!Anyways definitely check out this place since you&#39;ll be mesmerized by the decor. They have a lot of wine options if you like that. Seems like a lot of middle aged women come here, which isn&#39;t a bad thing, just seems like it&#39;s in a great location."

While waiting though you can walk around the different floors and check out the really expensive furniture you talk about buying one day but honestly you&#39;ll be fine with your Ikea Malm set.The rooftop is probably the coolest floor, so I recommend checking that out and just waiting outside up there until they text you when your table is ready.As for food, the only thing I&#39;ve ever had here is the burger, it&#39;s the same chef from Au Cheval so you know its bomb. The menu is fairly small, I think between the burger and the eggs and avocado + toast, thats like 95% of what people order there."

You come for the ambiance. If you come here for the food, you&#39;ll be disappointed since the menu is pretty limited and overpriced. I ordered carrots for $14 that I could easily make. It was good - a little too oily and overcooked. My friend paid like $20+ for grilled chicken breast. The menu is ... simply put ... pretty basic. But that&#39;s kind of the palate that draws patrons in - unoffensively American.But the environment is stunning and one of the best in Chicago.

I attended several private events here before it fell into decay and closed. That was when the current restaurant was a courtyard open to the sun and fresh air. And when its galleries served as a venue for young artists wanting to display their artwork. In fact, a good friend held one of her first exhibitions there.But enough reminiscing. This review is supposed to be about the restaurant. To sum it up, I really wanted to like it more than I did. Because Gary Friedman and Restoration Hardware deserve a huge payback for rescuing this building.The main reason to come here is to experience the elegant surroundings and carefully crafted ambience. It appears that no expense was spared in the restoration. The awesome crystal chandeliers, twinkling lights, magnificent center fountain, abundant foliage and flowers, comfy high-end furnishings, etc. are all perfect. So perfect that I felt like I was sitting in the middle of a movie set.It&#39;s unfortunate that the food isn&#39;t up to the same high standards. The menu is small and, for the most part, unoriginal. Almost nothing that isn&#39;t similar to Bar Siena, Boarding House and a dozen other trendy restaurants.We came for a late lunch on a Monday, to avoid the &#34;take-a number&#34; experience that always leaves me with a bad taste, no matter how good the food. We were seated immediately. I ordered the grass-fed cheeseburger with fries. If you&#39;re going to charge $15 for a cheeseburger at lunch, it should be something special. This one was okay, cooked perfectly, but had nothing to set it apart. My friend ordered the grilled chicken (out of the chicken), then the fish (out of the fish)... so she settled on the burger, too. We each had coffee, and it was excellent. Usually split a dessert, but nothing sounded interesting.The service was very good considering we were at the far end of the restaurant, and our server had a great distance to cover to get to our table. Our water glasses were filled several times and our coffee cups, too. After lunch, we spent about an hour in RH, and my friend and I bought a few accessories for our condos.Even though the food was disappointing, I&#39;ll probably be back because I love the ambience and the accessories at RH. And perhaps they&#39;ll add a few inspired desserts to the menu.Almost forgot to mention that the valet is free!"

We immediately got seated right by the gorgeous fountain--oh the perks of coming here on a weekday. The space is gorgeous, and the food was fantastic. Between the two of us we split the omelette, bacon, and yogurt parfait. When I list it all out like that, it sounds kinda plain, I realize. But it was so. freakin. good. It might appear simple, but all the food was made exceptionally well. The service was fantastic as well.Afterwards we walked around the actual store, pretending we could actually afford the furniture. It was almost as gorgeous as the cafe itself.

Obviously it&#39;s the coolest interior decorating ever. What do you expect at Restoration Hardware? :) I am obsessed with the grilled cheese. I never order grilled cheese anywhere but it was highly recommended to me by a friend so I tried it. Absolutely phenomenal. This restaurant is very suitable for adults. Long wait? So what! Walk around the store upstairs until your table is ready. The wait is worth it. Take my word.

The entire place is laid out with beaitful modern and vintage looks. Easy on the eyes to see all the rooms set up for magazine world. We had 1 1/2 hour wait for our table with was worth it because as soon as we sat down and ordered we loved everything we had. I ordered a chai latte, it was spicy and delicious I love the milky and chai flavor of the latte. My husband ordered the RH burger medium rare with a side salad. The burger of off the chain delicious. It was juicy and flavorful. I got the grilled chicken breast with fries and mayo sauce. It was the best chicken breast I&#39;ve ever had in my life it has this garlic confit sauce going on with the chicken breast it makes it fancy and amazing.  My friend ordered a  beautiful prosciutto platter it was fabulous. I felt this place is a serious brunch place with elegant atmosphere. You feel like you&#39;re dining at someplace special and a getaway from Chicago hustle and bustle. It&#39;s a great place to take friends who come into town to have brunch or a nice date for lunch.

Like all trendy places expect a wait. I got there at 10:50am and there was already a line outside for the 11:00am opening. Once inside it&#39;s breathtakingly beautiful! It&#39;s such a picturesque spot. Once you get over the beautiful scenery though the place is pretty much average. The service leaves much to be desired. We were told we couldn&#39;t sit at the two seater table by the fountain cause it was communal seating? I don&#39;t understand how two chairs and a table equal communal seating. Also it took them over 20 minutes to bring my friend her coffee. We had to ask 3 separate times on an update on when she would be receiving it.Have to say the food was pretty much average too. I don&#39;t think you can really screw up a grilled cheese sandwich. It was okay, but I&#39;ve definitely had better. The grilled cheese came with truffle fries and they were a little too crispy for my liking. I will try this place out again, but I&#39;ll definitely order something different. Make sure you go here when your patient and not particularly starving."

We didn&#39;t make a reservation so when we heard that our wait would be anywhere from 60-90 minutes, we were about to leave, but we decided to stick through because it&#39;s somewhere I really wanted to try out! And I am so glad we decided to stick with it because the wait only ended up being 45 minutes, but that time went by so quickly because we were exploring the whole place from room to room and all the way to the patio! Everything was so nice to see...it&#39;s like your interior design goals for your house!The dining area is even more beautiful if that&#39;s possible! It has a huge chandelier in the middle and a fountain right under! It also has a glass ceiling so you can see the sky! The place is made to look like you are dining outside in Italy or France! The food was pretty good! Their bruschetta platter was so good and balanced so well with the different flavors! I also got their grilled cheese, which was fantastic! One of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had! And last but not least, we ordered the banana split sundae which was splendid as well!

You can also walk around the show room and take the elevator up to other floors to look at the furniture while you&#39;re waiting. The top floor had a nice outdoor garden that was closed when I went because of the weather. You can browse the showrooms with ease because you get a text message when your table is ready.I got the grilled cheese and root vegetables and really enjoyed them.

Fabulous place on the atmosphere alone! So gorgeous! Spent hours in there, just enjoying everything about it it- luckily because my wait time for the cafe was 1.5 hours!!Walking in this place makes for a very cozy environment. Beautiful furnishings, upstairs rooftop garden! Awesome.So by the time we get pages for our table, we get taken all the way to the outside do the courtyard... We were a little upset, may want to ask about that when taking names. We told them we would wait longer for the courtyard, which was NOT received well. Then we get a beautiful table by the fountain, so perfect. Even though the host just threw the menus down and did not even say enjoy or wait for us to sit- more training in HOSPITALITY needed!Our server approached and does not even say hi but rather &#34;you aren&#39;t ready to order are you&#34; WHAT?I don&#39;t know if anyone smiled the entire time, anyway the food was AWESOME!We ordered the GEM salad, burrata tomato with garlic toast and the board of meat and cheese. Thankfully between the fabulous food and ambience- it was very enjoyable but the service sucked! Rude and disappointing. The only reason I can&#39;t give 4 stars is the service."

There was plenty of parking which was surprising. I was told it would be an hour wait, which I didn&#39;t mind because the cafe was located in a furniture store, so we browsed 3 out of 5 levels before we were called to our table. It ended up being a 40 minute wait.This is a nice place to grab a quick bite and enjoy the ambience and to feel &#34;fancy.&#34; I wish I could say I enjoyed the food as much as I enjoyed the beautiful chandeliers, fountain, and furniture. My friend and I shared a smoked salmon board, which was accompanied by Texas toast, pickled onions, dill, cucumbers, and cream cheese. For $20, it was pricy since it only came with 4 pieces of toast and 4 pieces of salmon. I do appreciate the Texas toast which was  buttery and soft and the salmon was delicious along with the ingredients that complemented the salmon. This was the highlight of my meal and I highly recommend this dish despite the price. For the main course, I ordered the RH Burger (grass fed beef with American cheese, diced onions, and pickles) and it was basic for a $15 burger. I ordered a medium done burger but it tasted so dry and well done. I wish it had ketchup to cover the dryness of the burger. I couldn&#39;t even eat the whole burger. I did enjoy the fries that came with the burger and liked dipping the fries in the dijonnaise sauce. My friend ordered the burrata which she enjoyed. For dessert, we wanted to order the famous housemade chocolate chip cookies but they had run out, so the server was nice enough to suggest other desserts such as sorbet and ice cream. I ended up ordering the mango sorbet, which was sweet and tart but nothing special. My friend ordered the basil ice cream, which had a nice creaminess to it but strong basil flavor that shortly kicked in, which I didn&#39;t like.If you want to enjoy being fancy, enjoying the gorgeous ambience, and going out for brunch with your girls, I do recommend going here for the experience. However, if you&#39;re looking for a 5 star food with a 5 star location, this is not the place for you."

The flavors were enough to send you in to food coma before you knew it and the service was the icing on the cake with friendly smiles all around.I couldn&#39;t get over how much I loved the experience and the food here. If they make a branch out on the west coast, I have a feeling I&#39;ll be quite the regular there....just sayin!"

We ordered french toast, veggie scrambler, bacon, chicken sausage, breakfast potatoes, fruit salad and Inspiration Kitchens provided fresh fruit juices for our mimosa bar (BYOB was a plus for catering).All of the food was delicious, the space was perfect for our group, and they even brought us a bunch of boxes so that we could take the extra food home with us. We had great service with everything we needed throughout the party.Very affordable catering experience for a good cause. Thank you to the whole team for making the bridal shower a success!"

Inspiration Kitchens is characterized by affordable, delicious food and a great social mission.We split &#34;The Basket&#34; as a starter. I loved the variety of breads and jam and butter.

Their menu changes often enough that mentions of specifics will not be useful for long but I am most recently stuck on the Pimento Grilled Cheese (with apple - pecan chutney &amp; baby arugula on a 7 grain bread) and Crispy Goat Cheese Salad. The Pickled Beets are pretty unbelievable as well. Actually there is not a loser on their menu. It&#39;s all good.I have also used them for three catering events and their servicing of the event was more talked about than the events themselves.

They are a non profit organization that provides education and work for people who have had a rough time on this earth, many dealing with homelessness. Their ingredients are local and their menu is constantly changing!We came at noon so brunch/lunch time. I ordered the Nashville Chicken Sandwich and Sweet Potato Pancakes to share with my other half (girlfriend). The Nashville chicken was a buttermilk boneless fried chicken patty with pickles and to sauce. It was very good but a little too spicy for my taste. The sweet potato pancakes were very fluffy and the syrup/marmalade was delicious as well.While waiting for our food another server came by and asked if we wanted to try sausage eggs Benedict. She was holding the plate and we asked if it was free (we are from Miami so no one is every nice to us), when she said absolutely we agreed. The chef in the back was learning to make this dish so they allowed us to be the judge! He did a great job, the dish was very good although, we didn&#39;t finish it because we were not that hungry.This place is incredibly affordable, $8 for my sandwich and $8 for the pancakes. Our server was Daniella, she did a good job taking care of us. If you care about people, food and the Chicago community, Inspiration Kitchens is a greta place to visit!

According to one of the staff members, last night was the first time they had the prixe fixe meal--3 courses for $25. Before coming, I had browsed the menu , so I was slightly put off by the prixe fixe menu. However, they had thoughtful and delicious vegetarian options. For the first course, I had a spiced arugula salad. The cherries were a bit tart but not sweet, so it was well balanced. For the second course, I had the mushroom and farro risotto, which is actually made out of oats, I believe. The tofu was a tad sweet, but the flavors were excellent. The pecans and mushroom really added a hearty element. For my last course, I had the peach cobbler pound cake--also no complaints here.My dining companion had the crispy oysters, pepper vinegar short rib, and crunch cake. He said the short rib was better than similar dishes at more expensive restaurants.I would like to return either to this location or the one in Uptown for the regular menu.Inspiration Kitchens is a real hit. The mission behind the restaurant is awesome, the quality and quantity of the food is outstanding, and the staff are very nice people. Your heart and your belly will be full."

The waitress had a serious attitude problem and I could not figure out whether her face was permanantly affixed in a deranged scowl, or if she just hated life and everyone in it. She was by far the most rude, disrespectful, inattentive service worker we could have encountered.She could not describe the menu items when asked, she could not remember what we ordered, she never offered drinks of any kind, and once we got water she never offerred to refill it for us.Our order came out incorrect, and our bill was also wrong.

I&#39;m teetering between a 2 and 3 star rating now.After walking in we were absentmindedly asked to wait while they cleared some tables. They were not rude but they definitely did not have the demeanor I would expect from a full service restaurant. After being seated we were warned that they were fairly busy so the food may take a while. Which we were ok with.The problem with that is we waited at least 15+ minutes just for a drink order (we were ready to order food too but the waitress scurried away before we could). Another 10 minutes and we had our food order in. About this time a host asked us if we would move tables so they could fit a bigger group in at our table and the one next to it. Again not a big deal and we did so without problem.Then we waited about 20 more minutes for our food. And as usual the food was GREAT. Some of the best food I&#39;ve tasted in Chicago. Except the tea my boyfriend ordered never showed up, nor did his toast. And we had to walk up to a host to get more water. After bringing us our food we were never checked on by the waitress... we had to walk up to the host stand where she was with everyone else working to ask for the toast. She talked to the kitchen and apologized, but the toast never actually came.Then we had to flag her down for the bill and wait another 5-10 minutes for that. And then we had to walk back up to the host stand to pay as she never came back for my card.So in short - The food was amazing. The service was beyond unacceptable. They were busy, but had empty tables and more than a few servers... who all appeared to be standing around at the register instead of checking on tables. We never got some of our food/drink, even after asking about it missing. And what should have been a 45 minute-ish dining experience at MOST turned into 70+ minutes.I&#39;ll give this place another chance before writing them off completely, but only because of the food. Next time I&#39;ll go we&#39;ll see if I&#39;ll ever recommend it to a friend again."

I split the chicken and waffles and seasonal root vegetables with fried egg and onion gravy. Both were tasty. The flavors and texture of the chicken and waffles made for a delicious combo. The sweet options (rotating selections of pancakes and french toast) also sounded tasty. The service was great - friendly, helpful and attentive to coffee refills. The space is really lovely with lots of light and a pleasant atmosphere and plenty of room. I highly recommend a visit, this place is a gem!"

In terms of the type and quality of food, Inspiration Kitchens offers a unique good: a generous portion of fantastic food at a great price (~$10-12 a plate) served by people who genuinely seem to love their jobs: our server was genuinely friendly and unpretentious, admitting to his secret love for World of Warcraft while taking the orders. The dining area is uncrowded, with lots of natural light and a high ceiling.The food was... well, we drank sauce from its dipping vessel after the dippees were vanquished. Shortly afterwards, the shrimp came out sitting on a delicious, buttery duvet of grits as did the braised beef so tender you could cut it with a fork. I wish I could say that we demolished them, but as I savored each cushion-y bite, doused liberally with sauce americain, the duvet appeared to regenerate itself - miraculous indeed. In the end, I applauded myself for having eaten so well that I had no room remaining for dessert.Come heathen and patronize.

Our waitress was friendly and attentive.The menu&#39;s got something for everyone and it was hard to choose what to eat. i had the Biscuits and Gravy (cheddar biscuits, scrambled eggs, chorizo gravy) and my boyfriend ordered the Texas Toast scramble (scrambled eggs, sausage, sweet potatoes and cheese on top of Texas Toast) and a side of bacon.Food came quickly. And was delicious. I&#39;ve knocked off one star due to the plating of the biscuits and gravy. The gravy and eggs were layered through the biscuit, resulting in a soggy, albeit yummy, biscuit.Love the bright space. Plenty of seating. And parking in a small lot out front was convenient. The place was filling up as we were leaving. And the clientele was diverse and surprising considering the neighborhood. Lots of young families, neighborhood folk and hipster couples.On the recommendation of other Yelpers, I got the quinoa burger to go.

To say this is a hidden gem is an understatement. Words can not describe how Impressed we were . From the moment we pulled up the property has an outdoor garden that they pick fresh produce from to use in their dishes. The decor and ambience is super bright and welcoming. From the bright blue walls to the personalized wood. White linen napkins and a bottle of fresh cold water in glass bottles.  We were welcomed by the  Sweetest woman ever. Se was so natural and so happy that I wanted to her to sit and join us! She was super motherly  and She said I had to get the basil lemonade and the crab cake Benedict. &#34; holy smokes lady did I just hear you right.&#34;  Basil lovers be warned you will fall in love with this concoction .

When my monster sized crab cake Benedict arrived I was speechless... How is this only $10 . My mom ordered the 2 egg special ( she&#39;s pretty simple.) For dessert we shared the French toast with blueberries and marscapone!! Wow, the batter was even better. When our bill came. It was less than $30 how is that possible I have no idea. So I saved the best for last. This restaurant is not just a place to eat it&#39;s an organization that trains people that are or near homelessness . Most of the money goes to support people in need and gives them a job they may not have had a chance at.  Their families also get a free meal at the restaurant.

And let me tell you why.I had been wanting to come to one of Inspiration Corporation&#39;s restaurants since I found out about them sometime two years ago. I was finally able to come to the one in Garfield Park this Saturday for lunch through a school program. Not only should the mission and vision of Inspiration Kitchens be commended, the food was delectable as well.I had some of the watermelon salad. I haven&#39;t had salad yet with watermelon in it as I had always been a little weary of the sweet fruit in my salad even though I knew it was becoming a popular salad ingredient more recently. But I was blown away at how all of the flavors in the salad came together. The watermelon went so well with the cucumbers, lime dressing, feta cheese, and the greens! I was so happy I got a heaping portion. I then had the fried green tomatoes with buttermilk sauce and it was okay but the thing that really got me was the fried chicken slider with a spicy slaw and a little bit of buttermilk dressing. This sandwich was SO good I was wishing I could rewind time and eat it again. And again. And again. I also brought home all of the left over sliders (5) so I could eat it. Again. And again. And again. And again. AND AGAIN.The space was also so cool. We ate in a separate room away from the main dining area so we could meet and talk but the room had a dry erase wall which we didn&#39;t use but would have been useful for a lunch meeting. The gardens outside allow them to grow a lot of their own produce which they also sell to the public which is AWESOME because the area is classified as a food desert. Moreover, the service was so great and everyone was so friendly and took care of all of our needs including extra water and to-go boxes before we could even think to ask.I had such a fantastic experience and would recommend this place to all my friends. It IS a little far to come for lunch from the loop but if your work is having a lunch event, they do have catering! (;"

I don&#39;t know why they bother giving the reservation time if it&#39;s basically impossible to accommodate. They were out of some pieces to the fish dish, and it was a set menu with only two options.... The asparagus salad was supposed to come with shaved fennel and the woman next to me had a nice serving, I had two tiny slivers of fennel. My fish was so over done it was inedible and since they were out of the risotto it was supposed to be served with it was just a very very very dry piece of fish on a plate next to salad. The beef short rib my husband got was delicious. The chowder was not tasty, and the dessert cake was very dry. My husband never complains and even he was disappointed... It was very obvious they were not prepared to serve us at 8:45..... So then don&#39;t offer the reservation slot, and you knew we were coming so don&#39;t run out of everything!We were really looking forward to a tasty meal with a great mission statement but this was a total bust. I do think we&#39;ll give it another try on a normal day but very sad about last night."

We absolutely loved the decor of the cafe it was very modern and fresh. And this is where the positive things stop.We came in around lunch time and we&#39;re seated very quickly. For appetizers we wanted to order frog legs and gumbo. My friend asked the waiter what frog legs tasted like to which he responded &#34;frog legs.&#34; Ok. So we order the two appetizers anyway. They took about  30 minutes to come out. The frog legs we&#39;re burnt and the gumbo broth had a clear , chicken stock consistency and was extremely bland.For our meal we ordered the meatloaf and pan seared chicken sandwich. After about an hour of waiting our waiter comes up to us and ask us did we want any dessert. We explained to him that we hadn&#39;t received our meal. He appeared shocked and looked toward the Kitchen window and saw that our food had been sitting there the whole time.The food. The meatloaf was extremely sweet and had a vary airy texture to it almost as if it had filler in it.the chicken sandwich was covered in a very sweet sauce as well and smushed between very thick and hard bread.Because he wasn&#39;t being attentive to us the waiter did apologize and offered us a free dessert which was delicious. We choose the small apple pies with molasses ice cream.All in all, horrible service, food was horrible. I also don&#39;t understand how a business that says they serve southern cuisine can&#39;t get gumbo right. Go figure."

Service? So responsive, great recommendations, incredibly friendly.  The food?  Fresh, local, tasty, and *so* interesting!  Ambiance? Charming, bright, with big windows for a great view of the park and an open kitchen.  Entrees were around $7-$8 each.  And don&#39;t get me started on the place&#39;s mission.  Even if they did nothing else, I&#39;d consider them a charity, but they run food-service job-training programs for people in poverty to get them jobs.  And in place of gratuity, they ask you to donate to their charity org, which helps provide meals for working families.  They&#39;re also all about being green.I went with my boyfriend and another couple we know (we all promised to Yelp about it, so hi Mike and Karen!).  We were doing a little Saturday outing to the Garfield Park Conservatory and I&#39;d seen on GPC&#39;s website that they recommend this place for brunch.  Anyway.Mike and I got this kicky gingery cider that was a big hit.  We all started off with the sweet-potato soup, which came with a cumin crema.  Such a light, interesting combo of flavors.  Then the entrees: Mike got a seafood salad (calamari, maybe?).  Karen and I split a stuffed French toast with orange syrup -- oh my god, that orange syrup -- and a butternut-squash omelet, WHAT?  Awesome.  My boyfriend got the catfish po&#39; boy, which he totally loved.  Then for dessert we shared a sweet-potato bread pudding with peach compote and whipped cream.  We ranted together about how great it was -- not too sweet, but really flavorful and substantial.  Everything was so perfectly balanced.Cannot wait to go back."

Inspiration Kitchens has their own parking lot, and safety shouldn&#39;t be a concern. The proximity of the restaurant to the people they are helping only makes the good work they are doing that much more palpable.I ordered the pork tenderloin with molasses glaze, served with collard greens and a baked sweet potato. At $12, this was the most expensive item on the menu, and I would have happily paid twice that based on the food quality. The pork was cooked with just a tinge of pink; the molasses glaze was yummy, filled with small strips of apple. The collards were delicious with an acidic bite, a flavor I&#39;ve never quite tasted before in collard greens. And the sweet potato was baked, seasoned, and sectioned perfectly. The portions were great.I cannot stress enough how good (fruity and sweet) the bruschetta was! Order it for your appetizer, and you wont be disappointed."

The food was delicious and went over well with the crowd.  Monique and her wait staff provided excellent service and were wonderful to work with throughout the event.I highly recommend the private room if you&#39;d like to host a small party or a meeting. It&#39;s ideal for 10-20 people.  While the room itself isn&#39;t anything too fancy, it has character and you&#39;re able to bring in your own decorations, flowers, etc. There is no room rental fee, just a minimum charge for the bill.  The food is very reasonably priced.Inspiration Kitchens has a great mission.

I made reservations which were helpful, as the place was steadily filling up. The restaurant has all the style elements that I desire in my home... exposed brick, rustic wooden tables, hardwood floors and large statement artwork! My only complaint was that the high tops were quite uncomfortable so I would request a different table.The menu is full of many small plate options that are meant to share with the table. For 4 of us, we ordered 5 dishes and were full. Each person at our table had a different favorite dish, which goes to show just how good everything is!- Duck Confit Bao Buns were some of my personal favorites. I love the texture of bao buns and the duck was flavorful!- Crispy Brussels Sprouts was also one of my surprisingly favorite dishes which is a HUGE portion... it is more of a large salad/coleslaw than your typical Brussels sprout dish.- Havarti Mac &amp; Cheese was actually the most disappointing. I&#39;ve had much better Mac &amp; cheese- Togarashi Spiced Chicken Lollipops. Splendid! Crispy with an excellent dipping sauce- Sliders special were also phenomenal! I&#39;m never lured by sliders but these really were a treat and I&#39;m hoping they make it onto the full time menu!Drinks were also creative and delicious.

I came with one of my girlfriends on a Thursday night and had a pretty good time here because it was a perfect summer night in Chicago and we got to sit outside and sip on some of their rose which was pretty good. The up of this place is that our server was really nice, on top of it the whole evening and offered us some pretty good service. The atmosphere is a little trendy without being pretentious, and the place isn&#39;t too big so make sure to have reservations if you want a good table during dinner rush.Now onto the food. We got the duck buns for an appetizer and I really liked those but my friend thought they were a little bit on the salty side. We got those chicken lollipops because they sounded good on the description and I did not like them at all. They were very salty and spicy but not in a good way. They needed some sweetness to counter act the spicy which they didn&#39;t have. For our entrees we got the bbq pork empanadas and the ropa vieja which was presented in a very unique way. I loved the bbq pork empanadas so they get a star on that and I also thought the ropa vieja dish was okay and unique.I think this place is a little heavy on the salt though for the majority of the dishes which isn&#39;t my favorite thing but overall, we are glad we tried it, just not dying to go back. Definitely was nice to come in the summertime as I would have felt a little cramped up in the winter time since the place isn&#39;t too big. Mad Social, I&#39;m not mad I tried you."

The weekend Brunch is as good if not better then dinner.When I was a child my parents took me to Stefani&#39;s for the most fantastic Italian food. I still remember getting greeted by the owner Phil. When I brought the family in for brunch we were greeted by Phil&#39;s daughter Gina and there was Phil having brunch. My Sicilian life has all been centered around food and it&#39;s incredible to pass this tradition on to my daughter.I&#39;m typically in charge of cooking breakfast at home on the weekends, so I welcomed a morning off and with food this fantastic I may take every weekend off.I loved that they didn&#39;t have the typical brunch cocktails. They took it up a notch. I started with a Morning Glory craft cocktail which had the perfect amount of sweetness. My wife went spicy and ordered a cocktail with the roasted tomatillos. It was like getting a green Bloody Mary. My little one started out the day with a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. How could this morning not start out well!I must also throw a shout out to Chef Mariela B. I meet a lot of chefs and she is a perfectionist. This perfection shows in the food she serves. The layers of flavor along with the depth is simply incredible. If you haven&#39;t tried her food then you are missing out. I don&#39;t think she knows how to make a bad dish. She is a genius in the kitchen and I&#39;m honored to enjoy her food.For brunch I went with the short rib Benedict. I love Eggs Benedict but this dish takes breakfast to a whole new level. It&#39;s braised Korean style short ribs on toasted pretzel buns, Brussels sprouts kimchi &amp; togarashi hollandaise or as I like to simply call it...WOW! I&#39;m a Benedict Snob and these are MAD delicious. I think it took me 45 minutes to eat because I wanted to savor every single bite. I also got a side order of their housemade sausage patties. These were some of the best breakfast patties I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;m still dreaming about them. There&#39;s an element of spicy in the meat along with a hint of maple syrup for sweetness. Is it wrong I wanted to order a second plate? I literally had to fight my family away from the dish because both my ladies wanted in.My little one went with the pancakes. I must first say that the plate looked like art. I&#39;ve never seen pancakes look that good. I grew up on iHop and they could only dream about making something like this. My little one said that they were the best pancakes she ever had and I would have to agree. The Carmel sauce with the fresh hot syrup was a perfect combo of sweetness. The perfectly fried butter edges added great texture with each bite. It was more cake than pan and it tasted crazy good. No need for donuts. Thanks Chef I have to go back to my drawing board for pancakes in my house when I&#39;m cooking.My wife went with the steak and eggs. She ordered her meat medium rare and the kitchen cooked it perfectly. I love it when the chefs just get it. Great job. The egg was cooked perfectly too. No crispy burnt edges just clean goodness which means the egg wasn&#39;t rushed like a 24 hour diner. It also came with a side of breakfast potatoes that was a sacotash. I make a mean breakfast potatoes and I found the addition of corn refreshing.As we sat there letting our amazing breakfast settle we sampled a fresh Mexican soda that Chef Mariela had created. My wife asked to have it as a cocktail with Tito&#39;s added in. This drink was so refreshing &amp; tasted like something you would get at a fancy spa. It was the perfect end to a great meal. I decided to try a bourbon drink called bacon &amp; eggs. It was served in a long stem martini glass and it was so good. I kept tasting coffee but there was no coffee in there. I would highly recommend this for breakfast any day.I must talk about the interior. It is just beautiful. The designer did a fantastic job. I love the giant wall frame containing many smaller mirrors. It is so unique. Even the existing fire door has been painted to look cool. One of the best things here for the social savy person are the power outlets with both A/C &amp; USB connections.Other noteworthy items from the dinner menu I&#39;ve eaten. Get the flash fried Brussels sprout salad. If Mom made me Brussels sprouts this way 30 years ago I would have loved them. The chicken and waffles come with a churro waffle. It is the best carnival waffle you will ever have. I seriously just want the waffle because it&#39;s that good. The burger here is fantastic too. Everyone has a burger. I&#39;m glad that the MAD burger is delicious and unique. The charcuterie is great too. Check out the beautiful expensive red hand slicer from Italy. There is nothing like fresh sliced meat.So as you can see I am MAD for brunch and I should be. This place is the hot spot in the West Loop and I don&#39;t see them cooling down any time soon. It&#39;s going to be a hot summer with plenty of MAD food hitting the tables here."

I love chicken and waffles, so when I saw it on the menu, I knew I had to try it. What I like about this chicken and waffle is that the chicken breast was perfectly breaded and seasoned: nice and crispy on the outside, and warm and juicy on the inside. I particularly loved the homemade MAD hot sauce that came on the side. Oh and pork belly comes with this too! I could have smothered the whole thing in that and then bathed in it. The waffle is no ordinary waffle. It&#39;s a churro waffle! The churro and waffle had a baby and came up with the most delicious, delectable piece of sweet goodness. If you like the sweet and salty flavors, definitely try this dish!Husband got the steak and eggs: skirt steak (we got it medium, just how we like it!), 2 eggs (it comes sunny side up, but we asked for scrambled for our little one), with your choice of bacon, sausage or fruit. We got the bacon, of course! The steak was cooked well (not too chewy or overcooked) and it was a great complement to our chicken and waffles that we shared.Tip: Mon-Sat from 4-6pm, they have half off selected bottles of wine &amp; charcuterie boards. Score!"

All of the dishes were delicious, but also the portions were huge. The monte cristo was deep fried, which I am not used to, but the inside was so soft and had an amazing jelly on it. It also came with maple syrup, which is yum! The shakshuka was a perfect balance of spices, tomato and egg goodness, not much heat which I am happy with.... and I am married to an Israeli so I&#39;ve had my fare share of Shakshuka. The Benedict was a perfect alteration to the traditional benedict, with the very tender fall part meat. The potatoes that came with each dish were actually great, and I am the last person to comment on potatoes. They had a hint of heat, but the tenderness inside and crunchiness on outside made them perfect.Drink: Blood orange mimosa, green juice and orange juice. All were as desired, fresh, refreshing, delicious.Service: Attentive, fast, helpful.Facilities: cute decor, nothing over the top. Clean.A+ Brunch."

And it even has a name: a Monte Cristo. Who knew? This thing will feed me for daaaaays!MAD Social is a MAD experiment in combination French and classic Southern fried foods (hilarious and fun to see as a Southerner in the North), which, as it turns out, is a match made in heaven. Combining the large portions, frying, and vegetables of the South with the smooth taste combinations, perfect cooking, and presentation of French food turns out amazing just about every time. Although that description hardly covers the whole menu, because there are dishes in there from all over the world, from Japan and Korea to Canada and Greece.Cool brunch spot, in a cool up-and-coming neighborhood West of Downtown Chicago. Excellent spot of Sunday Brunch :)The Bloody Marys are basic, but fit the bill, and got my wife&#39;s stamp of approval. The Mimosas are crisp and smooth, someone is using the good champagne! Oh, and great coffee too, with frequent fresh pots and refills at the table.Be warned that the portion sizes, even for Brunch specials only, vary wildly from one to another. My wife&#39;s fish was appetizer-tiny, my cousin&#39;s omelette was generous and reasonably sized, and my Monte Cristo was a boat. Huge. I can&#39;t event convey how enormous that thing was (Is! Do you think I&#39;ve eaten all of it even now?)All in all, great spot to check out and challenge your tastes!"

Just seems a bit contrived to me and Mad Social (Mad being short for Madison St.) just seemed not all that original or thoughtful of a name. All this nit picking of mine aside, I&#39;d heard good things and wanted to check them out. I really dug it after all.I came this past Sunday for brunch. Service was good, the atmosphere was stylish and inviting. You can tell they put a lot into the concept. We sat outside which was perfect for the weather. The menu is pretty fun too. Most everything on their brunch menu sounded great. My brother and I chose to split their Chicken and Churro Waffles and the Short Rib Benedict.Each dish was great in their own way. The waffles had a nice crispy-ness to them and the thick slab of pork belly on top was quite welcomed. The Benedicts had some good depth with layers of flavor. Their home fries were excellent and some of the best I&#39;ve had. Regardless of the different sizes, they were all cooked perfectly. I also got an espresso and my brother their regular coffee. Neither were spectacular, but we liked the tableware they were served in. I would definitely return and be mindful in the future to not judge a restaurant by their name...well, I&#39;ll try not to at least."

We sat outside near the street, which, okay, it was a perfect evening but it was somewhat annoying. Right over my left shoulder was a huge parked SVU, and some of the street noise (i.e. CTA bus) startled our conversation a few times. If you are going to sit outside, sit at a table closer to the restaurant.Now. On to the best part. The food. Or wine? Bottles are half-priced daily from 4 pm-6pm. Not sure if that is still the case so double check. My top favorites in order:1. Fried Chicken and Waffle2. Tuna Poke3. Mac and Cheese4. Brussels Sprout SaladService was great. Definitely worth trying for happy hour or dinner."

When my daughter suggested we take her there for her birthday, I have to admit I was not in complete agreement.When we arrived, there was seating available on the sidewalk. It was dusk and was starting to get a little cool. No matter, a few drinks took care of that.Small plates have never really sounded very exciting to me. But, they were really outstanding. Who would have thought that crispy Brussel sprouts would be so delicious? And, the Togarashi Chicken Spiced Lolly Pops? Wow. Sweet and spicy. Around the table, we shared Ropa Vieja, Steak Salad, Seafood Ceviche. Outstanding.The service was also great. (It helps to have your daughter, who works as a bartender, with you.) The server kept us entertained; talked with us; shared ideas of what to try and listened to our stories. Afterwards, we were trying to take selfies of our family, and the server offered to take a few pictures of us.When we were done, we sat around the table - talked, laughed and generally had a great time. This will be one of our regular spots for a while."

The space is pretty small and I haven&#39;t had an issue getting a table for brunch, but I can imagine they get packed on weekend nights. There are a few ways to order at Mad Social, but I highly recommend sharing a bunch of items. I did this the first time I visited and our waitress coursed all of the items out appropriately, which was pretty awesome.To start, the crispy brussel sprouts are an excellent choice. The Asian flavors are spot-on and it&#39;s a great dish to share. On the more decadent side, their mac &amp; cheese is delicious. Also a great item to share, I loved the inclusion of the mushrooms and corn. Not your average mac, but unique and incredibly flavorful. From the brunch side of the menu, we had their shakshouka, which is so light and refreshing. This is one of my favorite dishes in general, and I loved their take. Not as easy to share, but still recommend. Our finale was the short rib benedict. NOM. The short rib was cooked perfectly, super tender and falling apart. We all loved every single bite. On my second visit, I had the salmon gravlax. If you&#39;re a lox person, this is fantastic. So much flavor going on here.Overall, I will definitely be coming back to Mad Social for dinner. I knocked a star because service was super slow, we waited a really long time for our food at 10:30 AM. However, when you&#39;re chatting with 10 girls, that&#39;s not the biggest deal. Prices are typical for the area and very reasonable if you aren&#39;t drinking. Definitely stop by Mad Social and check it out."

Went here on a Monday and the place was still pretty busy! We sat outside and started with Night Vision and El Guapo cocktails. The El Guapo was like the most perfect jalapeno margarita. Hint of spiciness but nothing too over the top. I could&#39;ve easily drank 4 of these!For food the 2 of us shared the Havarti Mac &amp; Cheese, Chicken Lollipops, Pork Empanadas, and Flourless Chocolate Cake.- Havarti Mac &amp; Cheese: might have been the best I&#39;ve ever had. It almost tasted alfredo-y and the texture was perfectly balanced with crispy brussel sprouts and mushrooms. Not overly rich and completely delicious!- Chicken Lolliipops: pretty basic spicy chicken.. it was super juicy but nothing all that mind blowing. skip.- Pork Empanadas: I don&#39;t eat pork but omg this was delicious! Not super meaty tasting, which I liked. The crust was crispy and flaky. Mmm talking about it is making me crave it- Flourless Chocolate Cake: pretty big portion! we destroyed it. The sauces on the bottom are soooo yummy.Overall, super cute new place. Great ambiance and delicious food. Would def return!"

Seems like lots of others really enjoyed this place. So, maybe they were having an off night?Brunch also seems to be a hit.Went for a girls&#39; night last night, and we ordered  8-10 dishes, mostly based off of recommendations from the waitress. Service was great, and the atmosphere is fun and trendy.The food, though, is underwhelming. Very eclectic menu of small plates. Expect the regulars: shishito peppers, charcuterie, tartares, etc.Of everything we had, there wasn&#39;t a single dish that wowed us. Everything was just okay. A lot of things weren&#39;t appropriately sauced, either. The bao was way too mayonaise-y, the shishitos didn&#39;t have enough salt, the brussel sprout salad needed more dressing.Oysters were good and fresh and charcuterie was great, but those things were--obviously--not cooked.Sadly, I don&#39;t see this place sticking around. There&#39;s nothing that sets it apart from the gazillions of other trendy, small-plate eateries around Chicago--and there are certainly places that do this kind of fare much better."

After much deliberation my friend and I both ordered the Short Rib Benedict. This dish is the reason why Mad Social is getting 4 stars as it was flavorful and plentiful enough to satisfy the hungry beast inside me. I&#39;m a sucker for short rib and this was clutch. The meat was tender, juicy and cooked perfectly. The cook gets two thumbs up.Mad Social is a place I&#39;ll definitely be hitting up again for brunch and dinner because that menu looks delicious."

All pretty good, but the Mac n Cheese was amazing.  I had to get the chicken and waffles, for $20 its pretty big. I must say though it was not as good as it sounded. The chicken had a weird after taste, kinda sour, and could use some more seasoning.  I have a feeling they might have soaked the meat in buttermilk too long. Others at the table got the steak and eggs, and rib Benedict which was really good. But along with the Mac and cheese, the Pancakes were prb our favorite.

We tried a bunch of stuff so I&#39;ll review by item.Ambiance: 5 Stars! This place is the epitome of where you want to come enjoy a ladies night. I loved the plush booths and upscale decor.Service: 4 Stars. Our waitress was attentive and kept our drinks full. I had no complaints at all.Elote Fritters: 4 Stars. These were fabulous. I am a huge fan of any type of corn dish and I love elotes so I could not get enough of these tantalizing bites. I also loved that there was a ton of sauce to dip in and some extra corn on the plate!Crispy Brussels Sprouts: 2 Stars. Honestly, this was the worst dish of the night. It&#39;s much more of a salad than an appetizer and there were just not enough brussels sprouts for the dish to be called &#34;Crispy Brussels Sprouts&#34;. I think I would&#39;ve liked it more if it were marketed a little differently.Duck Confit Bao Buns: 5 Stars. I did not expect to like these as much as I did but they were absolutely delicious. The siracha aioli could not have been a better companion to the sauce on the duck and the bun was pure perfection.Pillows: 4 Stars. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever eaten such a hearty ravioli. Mad Social certainly does not mess around with the braised beef they stuff their ravioli with. My only qualm is that the dish could&#39;ve used some more of the fonduta.Beef Tartare: 4 Stars. All I can say about their beef tartare is that it was so freaking good. I was the one who picked this dish and the chimchurri is what sucked me in, something more places need to explore. The only thing keeping me from giving this fabulous dish 5 stars is that the portion size was simply too small for my liking.All in all, I had a great experience at Mad Social. Also worth mentioning their take on a Moscow Mule, the Rosemary&#39;s Baby is a must order if you are a mule fan!"

After getting a drink at Mad Social before Adele, I decided to return to Mad Social for their brunch menu. It was nice to see that some of the dinner items were also available for brunch.Everything we got for brunch was very good.  Korean style short rib benedict was very nice twist to boring benedict and the rib was very well marinated. Churro waffle with chicken breast milanese is brilliant idea whereby I can eat that churro waffle without the chicken. It is that good! The mad burger was a perfect concept - wagyu burger (is this real wagyu?) with pork belly, onion strings, brioche bun sounded good in paper however in execution, the food came a tad salty unfortunately. The best part of the dish was shockingly the pancake that my niece ordered. Buttermilk pancake with berries was topped with salted caramel whipped butter whereby the highlight was the salted caramel taste that blended well with the other components of the pancake.All-and-all, Mad Social has solid weekend brunch menu. There&#39;re many brunch options along with some items from dinner menu. Avoid the salty burger and stick with the pancake."

Started out with the lovely Madteani, strong but oh so tasty, and what girl can resist a floating flower in her drink? ;)We ordered the Brussels sprouts, chicken lollipops, chicken &amp; waffle and sopa vieja. The sprouts and lollipops were the standouts: there was a southeast-Asian undertone flavor in the sprouts that remind me of my childhood. The lollipops were super juicy and had a welcoming kick from the Piri Piri. I&#39;m a huge fan of chicken &amp; waffle but not this version...the waffle was too crispy and had no contrast in texture. The hot sauce it came with was divine though. Sopa vieja was ok but not super memorable. I liked the vibe but wish it were not as loud because it wAs challenging to have a conversation and you know girls like to chat!

We sat outside so we didn&#39;t get a good perspective of the vibe inside, but it seemed popping. We were greeted right away by a waitress that seemed super sweet. She seemed great until we interrupted her, and she had to start over....Sounded like a prewritten script she simply memorized. She made a few recommendations based on how many plates to order and which plates are best to pair. She also said she&#39;s going to make sure to space everything out accordingly so we will have he opportunity to try everything we ordered.  The first thing that came out was the Havarti Mac and cheese and the brussels sprout salad. The max&amp;cheese was amazing! The consistency was great and the havarti is the perfect accessory!!As much as I love love love Brussels sprouts, these were simply eh... they seemed over cooked and under seasoned. They didn&#39;t have any flavor to them. Next we received the Duck. It&#39;s difficult for me to judge because I personally don&#39;t eat it, but my friends said r was great.Then we wait.Our waitress comes out to check on us and asks if everything was going okay. We asked about the remainder of the food and request for it to come out as soon as it&#39;s ready. It&#39;s difficult to be able to try everything when you fill up on the items that are already brought out to you. I had a feeling she was waiting for us to cancel some dishes.Next comes the octopus and tuna sashimi. The octopus gets two thumbs up! Had a great texture and I loved the Greek preparation! Very flavorful. The Tuna on the other hand had no flavor. Last but not least was the Fried chicken and waffle. It is served with homemade hot sauce and maple syrup. PSA- there is a piece of pork belly on top of the chicken. We were never informed of what it was. Coming from someone that doesn&#39;t eat pork, I would have been very upset if I would have eaten it before confirming it was &#34;chicken&#34;. Besides for that,  oh and the hot sauce burning my entire mouth, this was probably the best dish we received! The waffle was clearly the highlight of the night.I&#39;m indifferent in coming back. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d go out if my way to go back in. If I&#39;m hanging out in the area, I may stop for some drinks and small plates, but not making a special trip."

Good concept but I did not like the chicken. I only ate a couple bites. The flavor of the chicken was bad. I can&#39;t describe it other than by itself it wasn&#39;t good and with the waffle it wasn&#39;t good.

The baos I LOVED and could not get enough of. They were this ethereal combination of tangy and crunchy pickles and savory duck wrapped in a fluffy warm and slightly sweet bao. I could not get enough. You get 3 of them, and I really needed to stop myself in order to save the third one for my boyfriend to try.The Mac and cheese was another story.First bite--amazing.Second bite--still amazing.Third bite--okay getting a little too creamy.Fourth bite--so creamy that I&#39;m nauseous.Now maybe you&#39;re one of those &#34;there&#39;s no such thing as too much butter and cheese&#34; people, but as a borderline lactose intolerant person, this was just too much. I was actually nauseous by the end of the meal because of how much cheese and cream I had eaten. Despite how creamy it was, I loved the bits of sprout and corn kernels I would get every so often in a bite. The corn especially helped to cut some of the cream and bring some lightness into an otherwise very heavy dish. If you like things extra creamy, this dish is for you. (How many times can I use the word &#34;cream/creamy&#34;?!)I would come back again. Would definitely order the duck baos, but would probably refrain from the Mac and cheese the second time around."

They did not skimp on the portions of any of the made to share dishes like some places do, and we ordered about 6 things and all left feeling satisfied and full. The Mac and Cheese was to die for and the Chicken and Churro waffles are an absolute must. Also delicious were the Brussels Sprouts, the &#34;Pillows&#34; (ravioli) and literally every single other thing we ordered. You can&#39;t go wrong here- highly recommend!"

They have a creative menu that includes cocktails so if you are finicky eater, I suggest you stay away from this place. I ordered the Korean braised short ribs and it was exactly what others&#39; commented on -   soft poach eggs (yassss), flawless presentation, mouth-watering pork, and an ideal size for anyone who is slightly hungry or is arriving on an empty stomach. Their chunky hash browns remind you of your favorite hash browns, usually the ones you get from your local greasy diner. Once you eat one, you can already feel your brain releasing those stressful endorphins and making you happy (or maybe it was a couple of &#34;el guapos&#34; that made the hash browns taste 10 times better). Anyway, what I do know is that not only did I clean my plate but also stole a couple of hash browns from my pledgemom. My tip of advice: Create a couple pitchers for your most popular drinks. We ordered one, two many &#34;El Guapos&#34;, (best margarita I&#39;ve tasted so far, comparable to Mercadito&#39;s Paloma Diabla) and cocktails here can quickly add up.I can&#39;t wait to try the churro and chicken pancakes.

With so many reviews for this place I thought it would be crowded, but we were seated immediately. Cool decor, indoor/outdoor seating options and whoever was controlling the tunes needs a raise. I ordered the seafood ceviche and the Rosemary&#39;s Baby cocktail and the bestie, chicken and waffle. If you love Moscow mules like I do, order this! The ceviche was fresh and tasty, but needed some spice. I actually used the homemade hot sauce that comes with the chicken and waffle to add a kick. The churro waffle was delicious and although the chicken had a tanginess (lemon or buttermilk prep maybe)that&#39;s not traditional, it was perfectly crispy. There are better options in the area and the food wasn&#39;t special enough flavor or concept wise to place it on my revisit list."

Loved every minute of my experience at Mad Social last week. So my west loop club decided to check out one of the newer spots in our beloved hood. Made a rezzy on open table...and the rest was history...The vibe is uber cool. Loved that the waitstaff was rocking uniformed denim. Denim is pretty hard to pull off unless your Uncle Jessie, but this just worked. These waiters worked the denim. So kudos to them.Drinks: amazing. Yummy takes on the classics. I had a Mad-hatten. Just delicious. I only needed one as it was pretty strong. My boo went with his usual old fashioned and it was anything but usual. So friggin good.The menu is all small plates so get sharing. So many plates to choose from. Pro tip: Pasta. Pasta. Pasta. The havarti Mac n cheese was pure heaven. The pasta pillows were even better (as if I thought that was possible). OMG what else, duck bao buns, calamari, aranchini, chix lollipops. All of it was bomb but I would suggest mixing fried items with not so fried items...we overdid it a bit on the deep fryer. Oh well. We made the most of it and turned it into deep fried paradise.I need to go back...and weekly to try everything they have to offer. And oh yah, for more Mac n cheese and pillows every time. Unreal!!"

I&#39;ve been anticipating my dining experience here ever since it opened a few months back and I was left very underwhelmed after finally getting the chance to have lunch here this past weekend.First, the ambience and decor of the place is great. Very quaint and chic. Second, service was also great. Our server, Lauren, was very personable and fun, and did a great job tending to our table, and the hostess, Gina, was also a sweetheart.From there on out, I feel as though the experience was a bit lackluster, and just simply not worth the hefty price tag. My friend and I opted to split a few things including the oysters, the beet salad and the &#34;pillows&#34; aka ravioli.Let&#39;s start with the oysters. $16 for 6 oysters on the half shell. 6 oysters that had barely any meat to them. Not that I really like super meaty oysters, but these literally almost had no meat whatsoever. Disappointing.On to the beet salad. I am a huge fan of beet salads... But not this one. Big chunks of beet with arugula and some other stuff. I could make this at home, and I am not exaggerating at all. It was very simple and nothing about it screamed culinary ingenuity in any way, shape or form.Finally, we split the &#34;pillows&#34; - beef ravioli. 4 or 5 big raviolis (can&#39;t remember precisely) in a meat sauce. What I am about to say is not at all meant to be over dramatic, but truthfully... They tasted like Chef Boyardee. Upon eating one I was immediately transported to childhood and opening up that can and popping those little raviolis in the microwave. I am not kidding.Anyways. I probably will never be back. Food was less than desirable, drinks are expensive, and no matter how cute the place is or how good the service is, there&#39;s just too many other options that way outshine this place in the area.Sorry MadSocial, ya just seemed to miss the mark for me."

I made reservations for two so we didn&#39;t have to wait. A friendly host seated us fast. I read reviews on yelp and ordered accordingly. We got the crispy brussel sprouts along with a regular mimosa and a blood orange mimosa. SO fresh and crisp. As entrèes we got the Short rib benedict and the Salmon gravlax. AMAZING! So beautifully presented and full of flavour. These guys take a lot of trouble to present their dishes with finesse and I really appreciate that. I wish I got to try a lot more from their menu and hopefully will return soon.Just an additional note: Don&#39;t forget to ask for a glass of water if you want one. It&#39;s written in fine print at the bottom of their menu that they believe in conserving water, so unless you ask they won&#39;t serve."

We ordered brussel sprouts, chicken lollipops, duck bao, arancini, oysters, and seafood ribbons. We expected the piri piri chicken lollipops to be special, but it turned out to taste just like buffalo wings, but just in drumsticks. It tasted fine, but just a little bit of a let down.

The best part about Mad Social is the selection because I know the next time I eat here, I&#39;ll probably order a different spread....lots of great options!The brussels sprout salad will definitely be a staple though!

Great menu, nice staff, and great atmosphere. This place is a small plates type of restaurant, and my friend and I ordered the oysters, tuna crudo, steak tartare, havarti mac and cheese.Oysters- The day we went they had east coast oysters (when I asked, our waitress said they&#39;re from Delaware?). Pretty good, but not great to my taste, whereas my friend really enjoyed it (and she usually doesn&#39;t like oyster so that was surprising).Tuna crudo- I absolutely love their tuna crudo. The creamy avocado pieces, the caramelized grapefruit that was not too sweet, but not too citrusy, added to the already-good tuna that did not have the sharp tuna smell. The pepper and cilantro also really played their part by adding a pop of flavor and aroma. I also believe that they used some black salt? all of these blended really well and created a perfect bliss in my mouth.Steak tartare- I usually don&#39;t enjoy steak tartare, but this one was an exception. I think they used some sort of pepper oil, which was really good; I usually can&#39;t stand spicy flavor, but this was a really pleasant kind of spiciness! The steak tartare also didn&#39;t have the distinct smell that usually keeps me away from getting it, and the dijonnaise sauce was absolutely delicious.Havarti mac and cheese- When I first read this on the menu, it didn&#39;t sound too enticing. I&#39;m really into mac and cheese and I usually like it the old fashioned way without any twist. This one was different. Sooooo creamy and buttery, and the sweet corn really added to the flavor while the brussels sprouts added some texture to the dish.I usually have one absolute favorite dish that I tell people that they HAVE to get, but MAD Social was different; I&#39;d just tell people to get all of these+try new things. I would never be afraid to try something new here, this place has officially earned my trust! Be careful though, the bill can go up really quickly, especially if you get drinks to go with the food, which I would recommend anyways :D"

Drinks where great - we both got something similar to a Moscow mule involving rosemary (very refreshing). We split the havarti mac and cheese and the burger. THE MAC AND CHEESE OMG YES!

Place was packed, not much room around the bar to just &#34;hang around and have a drink&#34;. Cocktails were delicious and refreshing. Ordered a couple plates to share - Crispy Brussel Sprouts: almost more of a salad style presentation but incredibly delicious nonetheless - Elote Fritters: if you are a fan of corn then I highly suggest these. Little deep fried corn patties with cheese, chili and sun dried aioli, very delicious - Chicken and Waffles: presentation was great, taste was exactly what you would expect. The chicken was fresh, topped with some ham and you get your own potion looking bottle of home made hot sauce to use - Pillows: basically braised beef stuffed raviolis in meat sauce. Nothing special about this one and wouldn&#39;t get it next time - Duck Confit Bao Buns: little duck tacos wrapped in Bao Buns with veggies and tasty sriracha aioli sauce. This was probably the most delicious thing and I highly recommend getting these, you won&#39;t regret it - Togarashi Spiced Chicken Lollipops: a fancy way of saying chicken drum sticks with blue cheese on the side, didn&#39;t care much for these at all.Overall great service, delicious drinks (strong martinis and tasty Moscow Mules) and up delicious appetizers.

The service was super good, friendly and helpful. The food, however, was pretty mehh. I heard great things about the mac and cheese but thought it was not super flavorful and just nothing too great. The brussels sprout salad which was apparently the most ordered item on the menu was pathetic. There were a few brussels sprouts leaves mixed into a bunch of carrots and other shredded veggies with some sweet chili sauce which was fine. There couldn&#39;t have been more than 2 total brussels sprouts in the whole thing as the individual leaves were picked off and thrown in. Very disappointing. The ropa vieja was super small and, again, just ok. The tuna crudo was also decent. Ended up spending a pretty good amount on the dinner, which I&#39;m fine with for a great meal---but this was not a very good meal. Disapponting."

We had a half dozen dishes which all are staggered and meant to be shared and that we did.We shared one amazing dish after another.From the peppers to Chinese salad, strip steak, oysters, chicken lollipops and we couldn&#39;t pick a favorite.The drinks were also amazing.But as hard as this was to accomplish the service was as good if not better than the food and the drinks.This is a must go, enjoy......"

Brussels sprouts- it didn&#39;t have as much Brussels sprouts- mostly wontons and red cabbage but still very tasty esp with the sauce.3. Skirt steak- oh the flavor! The juiciness and perfectly cooked!  The succotash was really good too!At this point I&#39;m full!4. Chicken and waffles (and the best Proj belly ever!) - this was our sweet and spicy dessert that was phenomenal!! Def order this!!Overall I want to come back to try everything on the menu!! Too much good food to try in just one sitting.   #madsocial #chicagoeats

The wine list is extensive, varied and fantastic...red, white, rose and sparkling alike, with excellent glassware to match (an authentic wine drinker can relate to that sinking feeling of ordering a great glass of wine and having it delivered in a disappointing clunky thick rimmed glass...but not here!!). Their cocktail list is simple and straight-forward, but original and tasty (thanks to a &#34;special tasting&#34; from a superb bar staff). They infuse their own liquors, freeze their own flavored ice cubes, and if you can&#39;t find what you are looking for from the &#34;pre-approved&#34; list, then I am sure their extensive offerings of other liquor options and highly experienced staff will have something for your liking or creative mixology concoction.My tastebuds were delighted by the exceptionally wonderful Grilled Octopus, which was not only amazing in flavor, but also tender and not salty. Sometimes restaraunts miss the mark by making their Octopus way too salty, and we are all left underwhelmed with empty water glasses. The Chef is not only talented, but also accommodating. THANK YOU, let&#39;s say it again THANK YOU for a talented Chef with NOT Such a Ego, that she is able to understand the various dining experience requests of her patrons, and be willing to accommodate and adapt to help make these requests happen; as she kindly made me a kale side salad since the menu did not offer one (at a reasonable price to boot)!The decor, vibe and music is comfortable, unique (without being overly done or tacky) and relaxed (Chucks or Oxfords  approved :-).....think Wicker Park meets Professional Smart Swagger. The staff is knowledgable and enjoyable for conversation over your next cocktail or life choice! I will certainly be frequenting this place again, and look forward to trying their newly introduced brunch menu."

I had always been curious about this place as that every time I would drive by it was seemingly packed. On this particular Sunday We decided to check out the inside and the menu. I was convinced that it would be expensive because it is gorgeous inside. To both of our surprise, the menu was reasonably priced and the food that was already sitting on other tables looked absolutely delicious! We definitely enjoyed their Sunday brunch! We had the chefs choice of the omelette. It was a very classy, laid-back, and comfortable time! And service was great. The perfect setting for a Sunday afternoon, after church.

Exposed brick, subway tiles in the bathroom... You&#39;re trendy, we get it, that&#39;s fine. But why the T.V.&#39;s? Especially if they are just going to play infomercials. I kind of understand if some important sports ball game is on but otherwise can we just turn them off? :) The music was horrible Aerosmith, etc... Please, no.Moving on... It was a little disappointing that we still didn&#39;t have glasses of water by the time our server was taking our order (despite the fact that we specifically asked). Fortunately, she quickly got them and we had good service after that. The coffee was good, and the mugs it came in were cute and a good size. I got an omelet with breakfast potatoes and sourdough bread. Everything was very good but I think $11 or $12 would have been a fairer price than $14. Also, I was just looking at the online menu, and it says you can get 2 eggs prepared any way with potatoes and toast for $9, but I think it was more like $11 on the in person menu... Either way, again, that seems pretty expensive.In short, Mad Social is fine, but I probably won&#39;t go out of my way to go back. There are just so many other places in the city that have food of a similar quality for better prices (and that play better music)."

The staff was very nice and honestly impressed with their service. They recommend you get 1.5-2 plates per person and share the rest. My friend and I each got 2 plates- Mac and cheese: this was easily my favorite one. Completely worth it. It has a bit of crunch to is and take your regular Mac and cheese to the next level. Worth the change in texture-chicken lollipops: these are basically wings. The bone sticks out at the end to make it look like a lollipop, which is cute I guess. They were OK, at best. Served with blue cheese and carrots. 4 wings/order. I feel like you could get that quality of wing anywhere really-Pontine: Egg on the top was delicious. Very good- steak tartare: good portion of actually steak, you only get three chips for the order but honestly the steak is so good you are gonna want to eat it straight up than anything else.Overall, pretty great. It was about $30 for each of us but we stuffed at the end.  Great place to share meals with a a close friend"

The space is a bit small, but the reclaimed wood decor and style inside is really different and cool, while also providing a somewhat homey and intimate feel.The menu definitely emphasizes shared plates and the kitchen did not miss the mark. For two, we ordered a number of courses including the arancini, the piri piri chicken lollipops, the duck confit bao tacos, the ropa vieja, and the &#39;ribbons&#39; - all of the courses were easily shared and all of them hit the mark; though the piri piri chicken and the duck confit bao tacos were probably the highlights.

We got the Crispy Brussels Sprouts appetizer that everyone raves about on Yelp, and while it was good, it&#39;s served basically as crumbs, making it very hard to eat. Super weird. The Mac and Cheese app was decent and the Shishito Peppers were just okay. The entree selections were better: my friend and I split the skirt steak and the ropa vieja, which were both fantastic. We tried two desserts, the lemon tart thing (boring) and the fried carrot cake (outstanding). Ambiance here is just okay. It&#39;s super loud, which is fine because it&#39;s a trendy sports bar atmosphere so loud is expected. However, our group was seated at this super oddly shaped booth that made it impossible for everyone to converse.

All the additional (main) ingredients were so finely shredded down and bland- ew. This dish tasted nothing like it potentially could. Which sucks bc I love brussel sprouts with my whole heart.The Mad Soup though, the dish I most anticipated, was as if someone took all the leftovers in their fridge and dumped it in a bowl. The flavor profile of this dish is: McCormicks taco seasoning packet w/ crushed hardshell taco topped w/ a thin layer of blend-resistant chihuahua cheese. I feel so strongly convinced that is what the soup was made of that I am going to make it at home and compare the two. (I bet mine will be better)Finally, our drinks we ordered were on special for $4, but they tried to charge us full price. We had to request a price adjustment. The manager came over to sincerely apologize but really he should have asked why 4 appetizer items were only half consumed by a hungry group of 4...We paid about $70 for all of this garbage. If I wanted to pay that much for food in the West Loop there are many other places I would go, like Old Fifth across the street or much cheaper better food &amp; good beer at Beer Bistro.West Loopers, this is not the spot you are looking for."

We returned our poutine as it was just fries with an egg and got the arancini in place of it and didn&#39;t like that either. The chicken and waffles were delish..churro-type waffle.

St.I do have to admit the surroundings are a bit sketchy, even though I don&#39;t anticipate immediate danger during the daytime.  The cozy joint is absolutely nice to get coffee and light lunch fare at reasonable prices.I saw many regulars take advantage of the free wifi and bright sunlight to get work done.  I had the &#34;Ham Master Jay&#34; sandwich made-to-order by the friendly young lady at the register.  It was executed impeccably and tasted delicious.Together the large, 20oz. latte and the sandwich cost less than $10 after tax.  After visiting various coffee shops in the city, Kusanya is one of the most inexpensive places I know.If you happen to be the area or need to grab a quick bite nearby, Kusanya is an excellent choice.  The nearest El station is the CTA 63rd./Halsted Green Line.  For CTA buses, #8 (Halsted) and #67 (67th./69th./71st.) are in close proximity."

I looked around and everything was clean and neat.  Billy Goat has a small area in the back that looks like you could reserve for a game party (had a huge TV).  A few other patrons were also eating burgers before 9am.This location is around the corner from the Virgin and the Monaco hotels and if I stayed there again I would definitely eat at Billy Goat again."

The French fries outshined the burger and my draft beer tasted flat. Sadly disappointed in my &#34;post RNRCHI&#34; lunch today. The young lady at the register took our order and money without even a smile and was so soft spoken we could hardly hear or understand her. I guess I should have just gone to Shake Shack like I originally wanted to."

It&#39;s far enough that it doesn&#39;t get packed with the show crowd, but still close enough to be there in a jiffy. And  I so appreciate that they stay open late, until 1am on a weekday!I&#39;ve never been a fan of their burgers - the bread is too hard &amp; chewy. But the Italian beef was delicious, bread dipped in juice and all. Plus, you can&#39;t beat the full bar."

You can see the cook make them to order on the grill.  I also saw them make someone a gorgeous Denver omelet, which I will try in the future.  Today they had chili for 2.95.  I ordered some to take home. It was thick, well seasoned and a generous portion and they had also tossed in 3 packets of saltine crackers. I hope they have chili again. It seemed like it was a special today.Also, unlike the SNL skit, and the original Billy Goat on lower Michigan, they have fries. Haven&#39;t tried them yet. The chips are Vitner&#39;s, which I consider a plus.If you do get a hamborger or a cheeseborger, they do have condiments, they are off to the side by the cash register and you add them yourself."

Their are many locations in Chicago of the Billy Goat Tavern, but the original (I believe from what locals say) is located on Michigan Ave lower level. We stopped by to take pictures of the place and it was really cool! Anyway, I got a cheezborger and the food is okay. So far, the burgers in Chicago have not been as great as I expected them to be, but everything else is pretty darn good. The burger is plain and simple, but I guess that is the beauty of this tavern/grill...simplicity! My California friends and I were shocked at how low the prices were for food! We shared fries, which I thought were good. I gave this place 4 stars for the service, low prices, and the atmosphere. A lot of locals come here and you get a welcoming feeling from the locals, as well as, the workers. Tons of TVs on the wall to watch sports and what not.

Wow. I ordered a double cheeseburger and a hot-dog.  Bread was stale for both. Cheeseburger was gristly, and not even lukewarm.  Hot-dog? You know that lone hot dog that you forget was in the refrigerator? And you decide to nuke it, not realizing that it&#39;s lost all of its flavor due to years of unsealed refrigeration?

Thus far the sushiritto craze has been fairly underwhelming to me to be honest; while the prospect of a large sushi roll is interesting in theory, I have never really had one that I&#39;ve enjoyed all too much because often they are skimpy on the fresh fish or overwhelm with too many other ingredients. Enter En Hakkore 2.0. Got the Fire, the Crunch, and an order of Kimchi Waffle fries(because kimchi fries are almost always a weakness whenever they&#39;re available). The Crunch came with shrimp tempura, eel, cream cheese, sweet potato, flakes, cucumber, avocado, and a few sauces and other veggies. The Fire similarly had sweet potato, flakes, lettuce, avocado, and cucumber, but also spicy tuna, jalapeno, and red pepper in lieu of shrimp tempura and eel. First note: these sushirittos are pretty sizeable. They&#39;re $10 a pop, but they are just as thick as a chipotle burrito but probably an inch or too longer. We ate half of them and were already adequately satisfied for dinner, but they were so good that we couldn&#39;t help but finish the rest. Second note: Wow the fish is actually really fresh and the portions are actually decent. The Fire burrito had fresh, large cuts of tuna in every bite; combined with the avocado, sweet potato, jalapenos, and sauces you get a blend of flavors that is refreshing, vibrant, and ultimately satisfying. Had a few bites of the crunch burrito as well, and while I didn&#39;t like it as much as the Fire(the cream cheese in their was a bit strange), The shrimp tempura was crunchy and the other ingredients were just as fresh. Unfortunately didn&#39;t get a bite of any eel when I tried it.On a final note; the kimchi fries were alright, but I&#39;ve had better kimchi fries at some other places. They didn&#39;t really do all too much to transform the fries(seems like they just threw some kimchi on waffle fries), which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, but I&#39;ve just had better combinations in the past. Points for using waffle fries though, they at least were crispy throughout and were a good vessel at lifting up toppings."

After much research and looking through photos, I decided this was the place I wanted to try the burrito at. I ordered the soft shell crab sushi burrito, it was a pricey amount I had to pay. And honestly, I wanted my money back after I had my first bite. I was unfortunately so disappointed.First off, don&#39;t put large pieces of asparagus in the burrito. It was literally the stem of an asparagus, cut in half. It was hard to chew and had no taste. I was not impressed by the sushiritos this establishment makes. It was also hard to communicate to anyone working there that I needed a to go box. They all kept re-directing me to other workers. I am definitely not going back."

For just $12 you get a good size burrito that is like a giant sushi roll and is stuffed full of good fish. I got the ceviche and it was fresh and flavorful. I also split the poke salad. And the sauce made my eyes light up on my first bite. Again there was such a healthy quantity of tuna I really feel it&#39;s a good value. The ambiance feels like I am at more fancy restaurant then I am. So the whole experience was just as good as I hoped it would be when I saw that sushi burritos were a thing.

They have certainly set the benchmark. Now we can actually say Chi-town does have sushi burritos. It was getting a little sad our city was slow to introduce this movement. This goes in line with the current poke craze in this city...It wasn&#39;t busy on Wed night. The burritos are big enough that you can split it with someone. You can order 2 and swap your half with a friend to try another burrito. These are essentially souped up, uncut big maki rolls. The Fire was quite spicy but with refreshing fresh veggies and tuna (the rice could have been less dry though). The beef bulgogi skillet special with rice and egg was pretty  good - a different take to a dolsot bibimbop that comes in a hot stone bowl. I wished they had more veggies. it was tough to eat with the chopsticks as the rice wasn&#39;t as sticky so we eventually had to ask for forks.

Just packed full of ingredients (bulgogi, rice &amp; seaweed of course, but also egg, imitation crabmeat, tofu, spinach, carrots, pickled radish) and flavor - way better than I expected. We paid $11 a pop for them. They were so big, both us ladies in the group could only finish half.We tried to order butter corn which was an old favorite of ours at a K-Bar (rip waba) but sadly they were out when we ordered.

That being said, I&#39;m going to try to not let that influence my rating of this restaurant.For my visit I got the fire &#34;burrito&#34; which consists of spicy raw tuna, some lettuce, some cucumber, avocado, rice, and the seaweed wrap. I appreciate how the burrito came wrapped in paper. It really helped to keep the burrito together since seaweed wrap can actually be pretty weak sometimes. The ingredients were all really fresh. There was no gaminess from the fish. The avocado was a nice color and creamy. The lettuce had a good crunch to it along with the cucumbers, and the rice wasn&#39;t too hard or too soft. The only thing is that I wish the burrito had more flavor to it because it really felt like I was eating a sort of salad. I&#39;ve been to Korean fusion places where the rice had been mixed with a sauce or the lettuce was seasoned with various dressings. But here the rice is completely plain and I didn&#39;t notice any flavor from the vegetables as well. So then it all depends on the avocado and spicy tuna to be the star of the burrito, but since the spicy tuna is wrapped with so many different vegetables, the flavor of the raw fish that you would typically enjoy, say at like a sushi restaurant, gets covered up. Thankfully, the establishment provides bottles of gochujang, or spicy pepper paste that&#39;s really popular in Korean dishes. I had to use a lot of this to enjoy the sushi burrito.Perhaps next time I&#39;ll try a more different burrito. They spicy tuna burrito isn&#39;t too different from a really popular Korean dish so I think that affects my thoughts. I&#39;m glad to say that the location is clean, nicely decorated, and inviting for families. I came during Saturday lunch and it wasn&#39;t too packed or loud."

Conceptually, I don&#39;t think sushi burritos are my every day go to, but En Hakkore 2.0 does them very well. I guess for me, I missed the combination of my wasabi and soy sauce, so the zing wasn&#39;t there for me in the same way as it would be if I had gone to a neighborhood sushi joint (I know, Americanized sushi).I had the Fire, which had the perfect level of spice. The tuna was also superb quality and super velvety in texture. I decided to order the burrito as is, although I&#39;m not a sweet potato fan. Warning, the sweet potatoes are a front and center ingredient in case you don&#39;t like those. The additional jalapeños and lettuce were super fresh and the jalapeños weren&#39;t too spicy!My husband had the Bibimbop burrito. I thought the meat was excellently flavored. The missing for him was the spice. Insider&#39;s tip: they have hot sauce in one of those taqueria squirt bottles, but we didn&#39;t know about this until after we finished! You have to ask for it...I wish they&#39;d give it to you when you order!Service and ambiance was also great. I loved the waiter/cashier. A few posts down someone gave the restaurant a one star due to staff?!? Well, I had the same guy, and he was jovial, talkative, and super attentive. Loosen up and you&#39;ll have fun here.The one thing that really left a bad taste in my mouth was the kimchi. We ordered the kimchi fries, and they were awesome waffle fries! But the kimchi was oddly sweet...I couldn&#39;t eat it. It didn&#39;t have that fermented flavor that it&#39;s supposed to have. It tasted like cabbage mixed in sugar water.

What a way to ruin a perfectly good piece of fish.Thankfully, the menu includes a Ceviche sushi burrito that does not have any of these horrid ingredients. The Ceviche sushi burrito&#39;s ingredients represent what I like best about sushi: light, delicate raw fish, fresh raw vegetables and savory umami flavors. The white tuna, or escolar tasted very fresh and the pickle radish added extra zest. In reality, the sushi burrito is really just a giant handroll that the restaurant wraps up like a burrito.And like a burrito that gets out of the wrapper, this sushi burrito gets very messy quite quickly. That might be the only drawback because nori can be difficult to pull apart with chopsticks. After a few hearty bites, I found myself fishing through layers of nori, rice, veggies and fish with my chopsticks. Of course, I still managed to eat most of it.This is a great place to fill a yankering for sushi in a budget-friendly and economical way. At $12, the Ceviche sushi burrito makes a nicely satisfying lunch. I&#39;ll definitely be back for more and have my sights set on their Tuna Poke Salad for next time."

Offerings include sushiritos as basic as shrimp tempura to the more refined white tuna ceviche. They even have a bibimbop-rito for the pure inner carnivore - when you are in that &#34;ain&#39;t nobody got time for fish&#34; type of mood.::Fire sushirito::My favorite one they got. The eel is sweet and the spicy tuna holds enough heat to balance.  The plumguac is a little awkward in flavor, but luckily it does not overpower the composition.  The rice ratio is at a satisfying point that you don&#39;t have a over-carb-scowl of regret when you are chewing.  The nori is a little weak, so it may be wise to peel back the wrap as you eat.  The other vegetables in the Rito have that classic en hakkore freshness. The experience has a refreshing familiarity, like hearing an old joke that is still hilarious in a sequel movie that only people who watched the original would understand.::Wings::Not the best, but there is a ton of potential.  (The wings remind me of every Future song I hear... great beat... then mumbling... whyyy. Just enunciate bruh!)The wings easily clear the hurdle of crispiness.  Such a great crunch that reminds me of that satisfying feeling when you pop bubble wrap.However, where the wings struggle is the overall flavor profile.  Everything is like 2 notes too much of sweetness.  The honey bbq tastes almost like candy.  The spicy gochujang is not spicy enough.  I know that gochujang is naturally sweet, but that should be even more reason to insert a more salty component either in the batter or sauce.::Kimchi Fries::Again with the sweetness. Not sure why the cooked kimchi mixture is sweet. Confusing. Like a cross-dressing cat.They are on to something with the waffle fries though.  It works with the kimchi since you can scoop it up with little edible fried spoons with holes.Overall, a good spot that should be a staple in wicker.  And with a few upgrades to the flavor profile, it could compete as a pillar."

I ordered the Crunch and my wife ordered the Fire Sushi Burrito. The Crunch had shrimp tempura and eel mixed with eel sauce and spicy mayo, so it was towards the sweet side. I also tried the Fire, which had spicy tuna jalapeño, and red peppers, so this was the exact opposite of the crunch. This was super spicy, which is really good as well. I think eating half the Crunch and half the Fire really mixes things up and it was perfect for me. Definitely try the Honey Garlic Butter wings as it was simply amazing.

I walked out the happiest kid. The portion size for the wings was definitely favorable and though the wait for them to come out seemed to take forever (bf finished half his ceviche sushiritto in that time. I stole a bite. It was delicious and definitely debunked my preconceived notion of all sushirittos having an awful rice to other stuff ratio), everything was okay after I took that first bite. The spicy sauce has sort of a slow, subtle burn which you can extinguish with your choice of cucumber or lemon water from the self service station.I thought it was odd at first that they would open a second location so close to the original, but the menu items are different enough that it makes sense. So I guess the moral is to go to both locations and eat all the things. Yum!"

The end got a little loose, but wasn&#39;t too difficult to eat. The burritos are not traditional maki rolls, they have other ingredients and veggies that make them unique and not as heavy. Waffle fries seemed fried, battered and fried again. They were very crisp and well seasoned. They were simply dressed, but had good flavor overall.

While the concept of a sushi burrito is inherently abhorrent, En Hakkore managed to craft a good meal with quality ingredients and moderate flexibility to customize. My friend and I ordered and split Crunch, Fire, and the Kimchi Fries. They did allow us to take out the cream cheese in the Crunch sushiritto, which was made our days a whole lot better. (Because let&#39;s face it: cream cheese in sushi is a god awful combination). At that point, eating the Crunch was akin to eating a Dragon roll, and I was fine with that. The Fire allowed for some slow burning heat and was a good balance of sweet and spicy. The kimchi fries were a definite staple. I appreciated the way that the plum sour cream and kimchi pleasantly moderated each other&#39;s flavors to accompany the waffle fries underneath.It was a good meal even though I am not huge on the idea of heavy sauces with fresh fish. I probably will not be back soon, but it was definitely worth the try. Keep in mind that this En Hakkore is definitely not the same as its sister restaurant."

Now these were first extremely flavorful and secondly but maybe most importantly, it was like a tempura batter. Them suckers were crispy and just damn delicious!!!!Definitely going back! And definitely worth the first time."

For $12, these are a steal and a decent amount of food. $12 is essentially the price point of a large sushi roll, and this is like eating the equivalent of 4 hand rolls. Oh yah, the Fire Burrito is awesome. I&#39;ve also had the spicy wings, which may just be my favorite wings non-buffalo wings in the area. You basically can&#39;t go wrong with En Hakkore 1 or 2."

The kimchi wasn&#39;t crunchy or that spicy, which I get that it&#39;s warmed up so that may happen. But yeah, just not enough flavor on them or as good as other kimchi fries I&#39;ve had.

My companion had the Carne Asada dinner.My meal was really good-especially loved the Upton&#39;s Chorizo and potatoes mix stuffed in the Burrito and a really lovely side salad with fresh mango.Interestingly enough, the standout for me was the Mexican seasoned quinoa. So flavorful. I was sad at first because I love rice (it&#39;s not vegan there), but I could have eaten a bowl full of that replacement quinoa alone...The cuisine was not heavy and they load things with so many veggies, spices and a nice variety of salsas.

I just think he doesn&#39;t leave his neighborhood very much. He said he liked it because it was &#34;authentic.&#34; I can&#39;t really say if that is true or not, but you know everyone is entitled to their opinion.Overall the food was fine, guac never a bad choice. We also order the Al Pastor tacos which were fine, to be fair I think Big Stars and Antique Tacos are better, (might be a little bias as I live in wicker and proximity plays a big part in my love for things). As well as we order the chicken, the Asado en Salsa Molcajete. It was very spicy. The waiter said it wasn&#39;t but it was, I am also a baby when it comes to spice FYI.Once again horrid service. Idk if the waiter was trying to be polite because we were engaged in a conversation but I mean I was practically falling asleep at the end waiting for him to give us our check.I don&#39;t venture to lakeview very often. I thought the food here was fine, I cant really compare it to other Mexican restaurants in the area.  The waiter appeared to be serving other people faster so maybe you will be lucky if you check this place out.

Well...The glass that came out with my beer was dirty (so I stuck to the bottle), the plate they brought out for my dinner was filthy (not just a spot missed, but full on not clean). The second plate they brought out was still not clean and at that point I just kinda shook my head like...um..please don&#39;t bring another plate.  So I used my rice and beans plate and just dealt...... Maybe I should have just said F it and left right then, but I don&#39;t usually have it in me to do something like that... so we stuck it out... and I did enjoy the veggies (and told myself, they are on hot sizzling skillet, you&#39;ll be ok).. until I found a red pepper still with a sticker on it..1 star for lack of hygienie.  Shocked no one else seems to be talking about this on Yelp.

Dim lit environment, mexican music in the background and lots of margarita pitchers to go around. There was 5 of us that night and the service was great!I had the carnitas with mango and plantains. A different take on carnitas but the flavor was good. Other meals included enchiladas and carne asada.The staff was very patient and like another yelper commented, they also let us linger around while we talked our little hearts out.We all agreed that we&#39;d go back and drink margaritas on the patio."

To start, La Nueva Margarita pitcher is great to share. Just simply go lime. We waited at the bar because it was pretty busy but were promptly seated. Service was very attentive. So much to choose from--! They change part of their menu monthly, and I had a chicken dish over sopes (these thicker tortillas--or masa boats) and it had beans, rice and queso fresco. It also came with a side of salad. This was huge! My friend got the pollo mole poblano (not spicy) and it tasted delicious! She seemed to enjoy it. If you check in, you get a free dessert so we shared a mango flan. Ohhhh I love flan so this was such a nice way to end the meal! I would definitely get the flan again. I want to try their burritos ..they seem to give you mini versions of burritos (cute lol). But yes, if you go there, grab a pitcher and enjoy the chips and salsa to start!"

The restaurant is bigger than it looks from outside and has front patio seating for the warmer months. Free chips and salsa on the table of which the salsa was really good!We did a few margarita pitchers to split amongst the group. It was just okay. Definitely had better margaritas in Chicago. They also gave really small glasses which didn&#39;t help. The pitchers were also pretty expensive. El Nuevo in general was pretty expensive for a Mexican restaurant in the area.I ordered the enchiladas with mole verde. The mole was really good! Added a lot of great flavor without over powering the other ingredients. Wasn&#39;t too spicy either. Good sized dish that came with rice and beans. Several people at the table ordered fajitas which looked quite good too.Service was very friendly all night but a tad on the slow side. They did gave our friend a free piece of cake for his birthday which was really tasty! El Nuevo is a nice Mexican option in East Lakeview. Overall, a 4 star experience."

I put a lot of faith in you and got totally led astray with this recommendation.  Such a letdown.* Pitchers of margaritas were $4 off however they were awful. Extremely sweet; no tequila taste. Took two sips and sent the entire pitcher back and got Tecate.* Guacamole was beyond under seasoned. Nice avocado flavor but seriously lacked salt* Tacos were average at best. Greasy steak and dry chicken.Left feeling very underwhelmed. Does Chicago not do Mexican well? Are you only good at pizza and hotdogs??

The food was tasty, sitting at the table earns you complimentary salsa and chips (as any decent Mexican restaurant should). The steak and beef tacos are cooked with potatoes and onions which is more home style, but delicious all the same. The food is on the expensive side but the service and atmosphere make it worth it."

And the food was delicious as always.I&#39;ll write a more thorough review once I&#39;ve tried more of their dishes. For now, I can tell you that their steak tacos on soft corn tortillas are perfection. Also, the rice and beans on the side are delicious, unlike the bland filler food I&#39;m used to getting with such dishes. If you don&#39;t mind splurging a little bit, you won&#39;t be disappointed.Quick Tip: Try to get a table further back from the door on cold blustery days.

We were seated at a little table in a corner, wedged behind another table (so the only way to access us was by crawling over our neighbors). The speakers were right by our table so it was extremely loud and hard to talk. Our servers took forever to take our order, bring our food, and then our check, and our waters were rarely refilled. Everyone was very polite, but I expect a basic level of attentiveness at a restaurant that wasn&#39;t met.Overall, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d come back.

The vegetarian food used substitutes like plaintains, yams, etc. which made the dishes a bit too sweet for me and the flavors did not blend very well. The gaucamole was alright - not very impressive though, it could have used more seasoning. Food seemed like it was pre-made, not made-to-order, which you could taste in the food (didn&#39;t taste freshly made). Tres leches cake was delicious. The place itself was packed, and a bit tight on space. Would probably not go back again."

Yes, it was a feast for the eyes as well as the belly.  The sweetness of the carrots balanced nicely with the mellow spice of the tomatillo sauce.On another note, our server was friendly and professional and the service was excellent.  The space is small so I&#39;d advise making reservations.  If you&#39;re looking for a fresh and delicious take on traditional Mexican food -  I totally recommend El Nuevo."

I only ordered guacamole and a margarita.Their house margarita was a classic: tasteful, but silently potent. I have been classified as a &#34;lightweight,&#34; so I left 2/3 of the the drink behind only because I needed to remain coherent for my dinner date with my husband.  I would describe the guacamole as fresh and tastefully traditional.   My colleagues gave their entrees high marks, especially the chicken fajitas. They finished off their frozen strawberry margaritas and remained vertical without difficulty.The ambience is very casual with traditional decor you find in Mexican restaurants. It has a neighborhood feel, and if I was back here in Lakeview, like I was in my 20&#39;s, I would likely frequent this local.So if you are in the mood for Mexican before hitting the movies down the block on Clark, this is then place to go!"

They had raved about it being the &#34;best Mexican in the area&#34; so my expectations were set fairly high.The management and staff accommodated our large group very well- I felt that the service was exceptionally good. Orders were taken and filled quickly as well as accurately. Meals were prepared and served quickly especially considering that we visited in prime time on a Saturday night.It was nice that the menu has clear descriptions of each dish for those who may be unfamiliar with Mexican cuisine. The complete descriptions encouraged some members of our party to try something new rather than their old standbys. There are a couple of interesting sounding vegetarian/vegan choices on the menu that I nearly ordered. There is also an option for gluten free quinoa instead of rice for those who prefer it.I felt most of what we were served to be average/typical at best; having said that, the chile ancho sauce that my shrimp was served in tasted spectacular and I felt was a major cut above on the flavor scale. This sauce had the perfect balance of heat and sweet for my taste buds. I only wish I had ordered extra rice to be able to soak it all up.So, although El Nuevo may indeed be the best Mexican in Chicago&#39;s Lakeview- I feel that it is hardly the &#34;Best Mexican&#34; in N. Illinois and S. Wisconsin. For most people it will be a fine if somewhat spendy choice.Side observation- obviously not the management&#39;s responsibility, but during our meal, several couples came in, studied the menu for 10 or more minutes and left without being seated. I found this to be curious behavior to say the least.My rating: Service 4 stars, selection 3 stars, presentation 3 stars, food quality 3.5 stars, prices 2 stars.Worth a try if you are in the area."

El Nuevo Mexicano was no different! I went tonight for a friends birthday, we had a party of 8 people and a few were late. The staff was nice and did not rush us on ordering, just kept refilling our drinks and our chips and salsa, which were amazing! Margaritas were so so.Finally we ordered and of course I changed my order at the last minute to chicken tacos on corn tortillas. Pretty plain but I&#39;m not too adventurous with Mexican food. That is my only upset, that the menu is not laid out for easy reading and browsing. It is all in Spanish and not very organized so I did not see everything thus changing my order at the last minute to the same as what my friend got.The food did not take very long and came out looking beautiful! Besides the presentation it as delicious! Double layered tortillas and fresh chicken breast that was so tender it was starting to shred itself, not that cubed stuff you often get. Big pieces of lettuce and red cabbage, my favorite! Also came with a small side of rice and refried beans! The perfect portions of everything!Lastly my friend got a free piece of tres leches cake because it was her birthday and the staff sang to her with maracas and even put a sombrero on her!Great time with great friends at a great spot!"

They were fried the perfect amount of time leaving them still a bit soft and not overly crispy. It was also stuffed with al pastor, so I did not feel like I was getting skimped on the protein.

Since I still needed to eat and it was on the way to our destination, I chose Torta Haus.On my first visit to Torta Haus, I opted for the shrimp and fish tacos. They are served grilled or fried; I went with grilled. If you dine in, you also get a side of chips and salsa (mild, medium or hot) for free. We ate the chips and salsa as we waited for my tacos; the medium salsa is ok, I didn&#39;t love it and its thin consistency. My tacos were hearty and delicious looking. Each one made with two tortillas, a must, so you don&#39;t end up wearing your meal, they were dressed in cabbage, pico, a spicy crema and accompanied by lime wedges. The fish and shrimp were well seasoned; I was hooked from the first bite. I let manfriend have a bite and he was impressed.Apparently, he was so impressed with Torta Haus from that one bite of taco that he suggested we return the next night for dinner. Hhe went with three tacos - al pastor, carnitas, and steak; I went with the red soyrizo torta. Having never had chorizo way back in my meat-eating days, they were kind enough to give me a taste before I ordered. Manfriend said it tasted pretty similar to the real thing. This time we opted for the hot salsa while we waited for our food. The hot salsa doesn&#39;t hit you in the face, it has a slow burn and a nice, chunky consistency.Al pastor is the manfriend&#39;s go to taco, which you wouldn&#39;t know from the obscene sounds he made as he enjoyed his carnitas taco. According to him, the carnitas were amazing. He enjoyed the al pastor, but found the steak a little bland when compared to the other two. I liked, but didn&#39;t love my torta. The bread was good, the veggies fresh, but what didn&#39;t come across in my sample was the saltiness of the soyrizo. Apparently, real chorizo is salty as well, so it&#39;s possible it&#39;s just not my thing.I liked Fogo 2 Go and was bummed to see it close, any hint of sadness has washed away now that Torta Haus has opened in its place. The ambiance alone wouldn&#39;t bring us back here, but the staff is friendly and the food is pretty fantastic.PS It&#39;s BYOB"

I&#39;m just going to start with the most surprising part for me- this place is pretty small! It kinda has a hole-in-the-wall vibe, only about 6 tables and some counter space. Also no bathroom, weird. It&#39;s definitely an &#34;eat fast&#34; place, not a date night or group dinner place.The food was great though!Salsa- 4.5*, we got both the medium and hot varieties. Medium is red and pretty spicy up front, while the hot is a green variety with some really smokey, charred flavor and the spiciness hits you in the back of your throatQueso- 10*, is 10 stars a thing? If so Torta Haus get it! This stuff is amazing- not too thin, not lumpy with a slight spice. Soooo good!Steak Quesadillas- 2.5*, great steak! But way too little cheese. It was ok, just nothing standoutChick Arbol Torta Special- 3.5*, so this sandwich was on special on Saturday so I had to try it. The ingredients = perfection. However, it probably would have been better as a bowl. With the black beans, diced chicken and Arbol crema the bread just turned to mush and totally fell apart.I definitely want to come back and try some other items- asada fries anyone?! I think the ingredients are great quality and the flavor is totally there, we just might not have ordered the right entree items for ourselves."

This is when the first appearance of a child under the age of 13 was behind the counter with no gloves handling credit cards and delivering chips and salsa to the tables.The food came out fairly quickly. The food was pretty good and the guacamole was realllly fresh. We had great service.As we were finishing there were some things that were unsettling. Another child was behind the counter/in the kitchen area but no helping customers, he was helping himself to food. Then I watched the food runner eat and use his phone behind the counter and then immediately deliver food to tables.I asked if there was a restroom and was led to a makeshift employee bathroom THROUGH the kitchen. I could have easily touched the food.Torta haus needs to reevaluate some things if they want to stay in business. It really stinks too because the food is great. (Hence the 3 and not just 1 star)"

Don&#39;t let the name confuse you. It&#39;s not purely a Mexican and German fusion. It&#39;s got some cuban and American influence too. I went with a couple friends and I tried the German torta and they tried the Cubano and some carnitas tacos. Everything was on point. It&#39;s a small location. Nothing special in the decor, but the staff is very nice and the food comes out fast. It&#39;s set up so you can see your food prepared which I always enjoy. The price to portion ratio is definitely in the customer&#39;s favor. The salsas given to all customers have a very nice flavor too and the chips are authentic. It&#39;s BYOB and near the brown line so it&#39;s convenient. All in all, great choice when looking to eat outside the box."

It was late and rainy and the place was pretty empty but we were warmly welcomed.There&#39;s not a lot of seating here and you order at the counter - think of it like your local sandwich shop - but we were immediately served chips and salsa once we were seated. The chips and salsa were amazing. I really loved the salsa.For my meal, I ordered the Al Pastor. It was delicious, melt in your mouth. One moment I had a sandwich, the next I didn&#39;t. I practically inhaled it. I forgot what my friends ordered but each of us greatly enjoyed our food. While we were eating, we joked around with the staff and had an overall great time!I definitely plan on coming back."

Torta Haüs is a fast-food style restaurant and certainly isn&#39;t meant to be a date night spot.  Having said that, it&#39;s perfect after a long day at work or a casual evening out with friends.Tip: When they say &#34;hot&#34; they mean it!  Medium salsa is the way to go!"

Free parking across the street, otherwise paybox on the street of the place. Either way, spots are available, but this is also very close to the Diversey brown line stop!We were warmly greeted upon entrance (and exit). The staff is genuinely very friendly. The place is very casual but do not let that fool you into thinking this is just your &#39;run of the mill late night ultra greasy burrito joint to help sober you up&#39; place, which is why prices while definitely reasonable are a bit more than your average Mexican joint. I would have liked to see the menu displayed on the wall but most of the time, I find myself squinting anyway, so looking at the personal menus was no big deal.I got the al pastor torta and boo got the Cuban. While we waited a mere 5-7 minutes-ish for our food, we were served complimentary chips &amp; salsa. We opted for the medium salsa. Mild and spicy are also available. This was great. The medium was a perfect medium indeed with just enough kick. The tortas were very yummy and of standard torta size which were very satisfactory. They even bake their bread daily, which is a super plus. Ingredients tasted fresh. Nothing was too salty or greasy, which is a common offense that I come across at more casual establishments. Their food is def authentic but also great that they offer some other concoctions. They are even veggie friendly with not just basic veggies, but soyrizo too! Btw, I enjoyed the Cuban here much more than the one at the popular Cafecito.Definitely coming back and trying the noted German specialty torta and the Haüs donuts for lunch, dinner, or late night. Will likely upgrade to 5 stars then!P.S. BYOB and free wifi!"

The torta had layers and layers of meat (schnitzel, sausage) with sauerkraut, brussel sprouts, and thousand island dressing. It was so filling and delicious. My friend ordered the mango salad but it only looked like a bed of leaves with some mangos and slices of avocado. If I were coming here, I&#39;d stop thinking about calorie count and just indulge.The service was on-point and very nice. I really respect the guys who work here because they work quickly and treat their customers well. Only downside is that the prices are a bit high. For the torta, I paid nearly $12."

That&#39;s how nice these guys are. The owner is absolutely huge on customer service, and if you leave here without noticing it, then you weren&#39;t paying attention.Fortunately, the high level of hospitality is matched by some equally awesome grub. They do delicious sandwiches, wraps, soups, and salads all with flair from south of the border. A few menu highlights are the German Torta stocked with wienerschnitzel and sauerkraut, carne asada fries, and some to-die-for tortilla soup. I don&#39;t think you can really go wrong regardless of what you order though.On my visit I noticed about 90 percent of the customers were repeat offenders and it&#39;s not cause this place is BYOB.

It came to over $20.The torta was above average. Standard size if not on the small side. It had onions on it which is uncommon in my experience. Clearly super fresh,and tasty.One of the better tortas I&#39;ve ever had, but also the most expensive.Queso dip was good. It was a watery consistency comparably, but tasty. Not a large amount  for 7 bucks. Chips were elite though.Coke was 2.50 for a 16 Oz fountain.I should have gone with the German torta per other reviews, I was just craving skirt steak.Guy up front was really nice, you can see the food preparation area from the damned sidewalk and they prepare everything to order. It&#39;s the real deal.

Oops!  The problem as I see it is the kitchen area is way TOO big for the size of the restaurant.  It&#39;s uncomfortable.  It feels cramped.  Looks like they didn&#39;t do too much pre-planning.Second, it&#39;s uncomfortably warm in there, when I was there it felt like it was in the 90&#39;s.  I don&#39;t know if they had the heat on, or if it came from the kitchen, but it felt like an inferno.  I noticed everyone who came in immediately took off their jackets.  The temperature that day (outside) was in the 50&#39;s, couldn&#39;t understand why the manager didn&#39;t do something about it??  I was going to tell him, but he did a disappearing act for a while, like they all do when there aren&#39;t any customers. If you ask me he seemed kind of out of it...like not all there??  No pun intended.Lastly, all they play on their oversized TV is sports and it&#39;s loud.  Did you really need to put in a TV. Honestly, I&#39;d rather eat in peace and quiet, it&#39;s not a sports bar.  Put on some music.For the amount of food you get and the price they charge, the uncomfortable seating arrangement and the inside temperature, the disappearing manager, it doesn&#39;t justify a second visit.  I&#39;ll stick with Asadero on Montrose, where they get it, no frills, reasonable prices, small kitchen area, generous steak tacos, great customer service and plenty of seating!  Maybe that&#39;s why they&#39;re ALWAYS busy!!!So a no go for so so!"

The service is out of this world and they make you feel so welcome and cared for. Love it! The only thing that could be improved is the ventilation, because my coat kind of smelled like cooking oil when I left. Still, I&#39;d go back because the experience overall was awesome. Thank you guys for this!"

And the fries were submerged in this bland, watery, cheese sauce."

Experience with Mexican food is first nature to me and I have to say the flavors developed in their dishes are UNIQUE and truly still AUTHENTIC Mexican rooted. They have everything you need for a complete meal from the Starters to Dessert, Aguas Frescas (Homemade Flavored Waters) are ABSOLUTELY REFRESHING. Also they have plenty of VEGETARIAN options with the same QUALITY AND TASTE, perfect example is the Guac Bar they have with the FRESH CUSTOM combinations. If in the area or even if you&#39;re not this place is a MUST try because you&#39;ll be completely SATISFIED and will become a repeat customer."

From their service to their food, everything was excellent. It&#39;s not often that you order a meal to go and they bring you complimentary chips &amp; salsa AND churros (which were amazing by the way). They gave us our tortas in a sturdy to go box that was necessary for the massive sandwich I was about to devour. I had the German Torta and all I can say is WOW! I highly recommend. The friendliest service and excellent food."

The prices were great but that was about it. I asked the guy how big the tacos were and he said pretty big so I only ordered 2 when I usually get 3. Well they ended up not being enough but at that point I didn&#39;t want to order one more because they didn&#39;t have very much flavor. The onion on them out weighed the cilantro. Plus there were no rice and beans just onions and cilantro. The chips were good and the mild salsa was decent. It had an ok environment but I won&#39;t be going back again.

I was seriously considering the &#34;German Torta&#34; however my recent decision to cut carbs held me back (and also my trainer who was with me at the time), so I opted for 1 steak, 2 carnitas tacos and rice with beans. Let&#39;s just say it was love at first bite, and second, and third. The tacos had amazing flavor and the tortillas were lightly crispy and were prepared to perfection! The rice and beans were great and almost, I say almost better than my grandmothers. I tried a new drink which I was a bit standoffish with at first, but after a free sample I was sold! This &#34;Pepino Water&#34; tasted as if it were raining from the heavens above. Light yet full of flavor and refreshing!I have to say, this place has an absolutely amazing way of keeping mexican cuisine authentic and putting a twist on it as well!"

I guess I can see what all the hype is about because there&#39;s nothing like it in the neighborhood. We ordered the steak, carnitas, baja fish, al pastor tacos and the steak fries. Everything tasted good but it&#39;s too hot and crowded for this little taco place to accommodate in house dining. Even though it is BYOB, it&#39;s not the kind of place to sit back and enjoy your food and drinks or take a date. It&#39;s more a take out joint.Frankly, you can get the same quality and great tasting tacos in any Chicago Mexican neighborhood at a lower price point but I guess it&#39;s not &#34;trendy&#34;.I would go back only if I was in the area and craving tacos or steak fries (nobody in Pilsen is serving this) but I would take them TO GO."

The owners and staff are committed to great service and put their hearts and souls into the entire experience.Also, I&#39;m never going to Qdoba again! The bowl was fresh, made-to-order and included fresh pico and guac.

Had some pozole and tacos. Wow! The pozole rojo actually tastes great. It almost tastes like my mom&#39;s! (Don&#39;t anyone tell her I said that). They bring out all the toppings that are supposed to go on it and don&#39;t even try to short you in options. I got a beef taco, al pastor, and carnitas... They were served how tacos are supposed to be served.... With onions and cilantro. They have mild and spicy (hot) sauce options and of course I go hot, the flavor is definitely there for the hot sauce. You get  complementary chips if you dine in. The staff was very friendly and courteous unlike other places with their snobby/stuck up attitude. Lastly, this was a first for me, they  have cucumber water drink and it was the bomb to say the least. This is definitely an establishment you should check out, I know I will again very soon!!"

You know it&#39;s a great sign when you walk in and see fresh veggies being chopped with chicken being grilled with each order. They even made the salad dressing to order!These guys do all the classics right and they have some really tasty fusion items on the menu. I&#39;ve had their Chicken Torta and their Mango Salad and enjoyed both A LOT. Props to Rob and his team. Definitely will be coming to this place regularly. Worth a visit for sure.

The garbage can was overflowing, and behind the counter there were chips and crumbs all over the floor. Last but not least the front door was left open and flies kept flying into my face. I see potential and maybe the experience was great for others, but not for me. A cleaner restaurant and a better quality steak would make all the difference in the world because that jerk chicken taco was that good.

The food was BOMB. We ordered the Queso Dip appetizer and were going to order salsa too, but surprisingly chips &amp; salsa are complimentary for dine-in customers (surprising bc it&#39;s such a small, casual spot). The salsa was sooooo flavorful and fresh! The queso dip was unlike any I&#39;ve ever had. Not too salty, perfect mix of flavors, stayed hot/warm our entire meal and the cheese they use is insanely good. I split the Cuban Torta with one other person -- such a good call. It is huge! Especially if you&#39;re starting with chips &amp; salsa plus another appetizer. Felt like I was back in Miami... so tasty! The toasted bread, the pickles, mustard, meat.. everything was delicious and they nailed the ratio of ingredients. BONUS: It&#39;s BYOB!"

The bratwurst and Brussels sprouts atop the Schnitzel and kraut might initially appear to be as extraneous as the umlaut on the &#39;u&#39; un Haüs, but one bite convinces you that this is a winning combination. And the stray umlaut is as charming as the exuberant staff in this cozy counter-service restaurant. The more traditional Mexican fare - tacos, soups, bowls - are also tasty. But do yourself a favor and try the German Torta.....which should be renamed the German Törta, because it&#39;s kinda fun to sprinkle the umlauts around liberally!"

Who would&#39;ve though German meets Mexican would taste so good but it was a great combo! One thing to keep in mind when you go is that it takes a little longer to get your good but that&#39;s because it&#39;s all made to order! Fresh! Fresh! Fresh! Can&#39;t beat that! Service also is wonderful. Such a friendly staff. Definitely try this place out! Nothing but fresh flavor!

They fresh bake all of their torta bread, and it was really noticeable that the bread was homemade in the best way. We started with the chips and queso. It&#39;s more of a thinner queso/cheese dip, but it&#39;s delicious. It was spicy and had flavor, wasn&#39;t too bad. They also gave us free salsa to go with the chips and queso - which was great!We got the carnitas torta and the steak torta. Both were great. All the food is made to order and the toppings were generous. The tortas were huge, and with the chips and queso, it was enough food to end up taking home half the sandwich.The people next to us had the jalapeno poppers, which looked amazing. They use some unique ingredients (like shaved brussels sprouts) that threw me off on the menu, but looked great in person. Going to have to try these next time!The service was excellent all around. You could tell the owners&#39; friends and family are helping out (even one of their kids was around, asking us if we needed anything!). Overall, it was a really welcoming place where the owners talked to you and checked on you. Excellent customer service.Great addition to the neighborhood, and it&#39;s a BYOB!"

They really hit the spot at 10pm on a Saturday. I ordered the chicken torta, and my boyfriend ordered the beef. Both were full of flavor, well-cooked, and satisfying. My only concern is that the tables were dirty when we sat down, but that was solved by a quick-thinking employee. The food is kind of pricey too. Two tortas cost me about $20. I was kind of surprised. Overall, I would go here again."

I never tried the restaurant before the renovations, and it&#39;s very warming and inviting. Glad they opened it up more to view from the outside.We had the grilled calamari with balsamic vinaigrette drizzled. For the cost, it was worth it.I had the bucatini pasta. It had great flavor and spice. I felt the amount given could have been a little more. The spiciness of the Calabrian chilis gave it a kick that was unexpected but delicious!!My friend had the chicken parmigiana. The size of the plate was amazing. It was 2 pieces of tender and flavorful breaded chicken. I think I will get that and have it for 2 meals."

This place has been a neighborhood institution in Bridgeport for many years. The food is still the same amazing, down home, Italian comfort cuisine, but now with a modern updated twist.Walking in, you are greeted by a chic bar with red leather chairs and a white marble counter top. The bartender was pouring glasses of champagne under a new modern industrial looking chandelier. The walls have been redone and exposed brick lines the restaurant, with black and white pictures. A window lining the kitchen has been added, so guests can see the chef cooking their food.We were seated immediately and a White Sox game had just finished. There were a couple families seated around us, but also fans coming after the game to grab a quick drink. Wine and drink prices were extremely reasonable. I ordered a glass of red wine for $6. They have updated their cocktail and wine selection to offer a very nice selection of red, white, and sparkling wines. My father ordered a martini which was made perfectly, and served full to the brim.I ordered the caprese insalata, fiance and father both ordered the chicken parmigiana, and my mother ordered the housemade gnocchi. We had fried calamari and the salsiccia e rapini pizette antipasti.The pizette was amazing. Caramelized earthy onions paired with spicy italian sausage and peppers and melted cheese. The calamari was fried to perfection, served with lemon wedges.My caprese insalata was the best caprese salad I&#39;ve ever had in my life. Creamy, thick slices of fresh mozzarella with thick slices of tomatoes, and two types of balsamic dressing drizzled over with freshly chopped basil. I loved the mix of the tangy darker balsamic dressing with the creamier balsamic vinaigrette. Original and delicious.Mother&#39;s gnocchi was soft, pillowy, and had a great marinara sauce. Fiance&#39;s chicken parm was huge! Garlicky, breaded chicken cutlets over the same amazing marinara sauce.We will definitely be coming back to Franco&#39;s. With free valet parking, this is worth the trip to Bridgeport if you don&#39;t live on the Southside. Definitely recommended as well for food and drinks before or after a Sox game. It&#39;s walking distance to the Cell, and for $10, wouldn&#39;t you rather get a full delicious entree instead of one steamed hot dog and a beer?"

It was quite warm in the restaurant itself, despite the warmth, Very good service, food was good. I would consider it to be  a Traditional Italian Restaurant with a modern twist. The marinara sauce was very good, but one thing that set them aside from other Italian restaurants was the light and crisp fried calamari. I enjoyed the fried calamari much more than the grilled calamari! Very nice ambiance, After remodeling and the new chef, I really enjoyed my experience at Franco&#39;s recommended for a nice sit down restaurant in Bridgeport!"

Princeton, the Armour Square neighborhood.  This place is very close to the CTA Sox-35th. Red Line station (exit from the 33rd. street) and the U.S. Cellular Stadium.  Hubby and I walked to our destination from the CTA station for approximately ten (10) minutes through the quiet, low-key neighborhood streets.We came in with an about-to-expire Groupon ($16 for $30 worth of food, beverages, or alcohol).  Although the interiors were slightly outdated, nothing seemed unsanitary or tacky.  It certainly didn&#39;t scream &#34;chic&#34; and &#34;modern,&#34; but honestly I could care less because I wanted to put my focus on food critiquing.The chef was able to accommodate my vegetarian hubby with penne pasta with spicy pesto cream sauce without the presence of prosciutto.  The pasta was done al dente.  It was flavored nicely and portioned appropriately.  He was pleasantly surprised by the taste.Of course, Rosa J., the seafood junkie, chose the shrimp Diablo with spicy tomato sauce.  &#34;Diablo&#34; isn&#39;t an Italian word, but that didn&#39;t bother me at all because that spicy tomato sauce was actually delicious!  That spicy level was quite comfortable for my palate.Somehow we saved room for their homemade tiramisu.  I didn&#39;t think they used &#34;rum&#34; like a traditional Italian way of making tiramisu.  However, their tiramisu was light and fluffy.  I&#39;m normally not a &#34;after-meal&#34; dessert gal, yet I recommended this version of tiramisu because it didn&#39;t leave any &#34;cloying&#34; feeling in my mouth.There was an out-of-town couple dining in.  The young man expressed his curiosity on the Goose Island beer (yay 312 babe).  For some reason, the waitress wasn&#39;t able to describe how it tasted like.  Come on, sweetie!  If you&#39;re selling alcohol in the house, you gotta be able to respond to any inquiry about the alcoholic products available in the restaurant at least.Anyways, coming down south side can be a trek for me, especially traveling all the way from the northwest side of Chicago.  Even though Franco&#39;s may not have professionally-dressed servers, live band music, and fancy silverware, I still believe it is a solid establishment for the neighborhood residents."

Peering into the window below the neon sign of a fork and spaghetti, that should be immediately apparent to you. If you want a lively atmosphere and an attractive young waiter to recommend you wine and let you swoosh it around and smell it, then don&#39;t go to Franco&#39;s. It&#39;s that simple.Think of it this way: Rather than being an Italian themed American-style restaurant, Franco&#39;s feels much closer to a restaurant in Italy. It&#39;s is a small, slightly cramped, cafe style, family owned Italian restaurant with space heaters by the windows and a customer base of older Italian families as regulars.It seems like their goal is consistently making good food, and they hit it out of the ballpark almost every single time. My testament to Franco&#39;s is that it is, by quite a wide margin, the best Italian food I&#39;ve ever had. That is also often the consensus with friends who have dined there with me.If you want delicious Italian food, this is your place. It&#39;s not cheap, luxurious, or an &#34;experience&#34;, and there&#39;s no reason to expect it to be."

It always looked dead inside. Rarely see much people. But I bought the groupon to give it a try. We ordered the grilled calamari and it was bad. It&#39;s was completely burnt. I couldn&#39;t believe they would even have the nerve to put it on a plate to serve. But beside the bad app. The two pastas we ordered was good. Good enough that we will come back but only for the pasta.

It is a cute little restaurant, but they really should have had more than one waitress. We sat for at least 10 minutes before our bread was brought out.The food was average Italian fare, but it is a small menu and a little pricey. I was also annoyed that they have a $3 entree split fee, even though it didn&#39;t affect me.The restaurant is full of elderly people from the neighborhood, and since the waitress spent a long time at each of their tables answering questions and chatting the service became incredibly slow. There were bus boys coming out of the back (right near where we were seated) with their plastic black dish holders every 10 minutes which absolutely ruined the ambiance.Not a terrible experience, but I will not be going back any time soon."

I was a newbie back in the summer of 2009 when the BF and I were at a game at US Cellular. Before heading back to our hotel downtown, we wanted to grab some local grub, so we entrusted Yelp...and we were not let down!We worked up quite the appetite walking the streets of the Bridgeport neighborhood to find the place (and then fortunately were able to walk off our filling meal while on our way back to the train).I&#39;m not sure what I was expecting, but Franco&#39;s was not what I expected...but in a good way. It was a quaint little hole-in-the-wall place that felt like we were stepping into someone&#39;s home more than we were into a restaurant. It has a cute vintage bistro type of ambiance, and I dig that because it wasn&#39;t trying to be some pretentious Italian novelty. If I lived in Chicago, I think Franco&#39;s would be my destination of choice for a gathering of friends or a book club discussion (I know...totally random). So on to the food...It was VERY good. The BF and I decided to split the Rigatoni Arrabiatta with a side of Italian Sausage for a spicier kick. It is somewhat familiar dish for us, so I feel that I can gauge the flavor well in comparison to others we&#39;ve tried elsewhere. Everything tasted almost homemade, but yet better--Even the bread was above par. The portions were the perfect size for us to share, and I felt the price was extremely reasonable--only about $15 for the main dish plus the side order.The service was great too--there was only one server covering the whole room, and she kept busy, however, we were never left waiting for anything, even though we were tucked away in a quiet little corner (it was kinda romantic). This place is a little off the beaten path, but I would definitely dine here again before or after a Sox game, as it&#39;s a nice departure from the typical experience downtown."

Loop, and all three had about an hours wait!  We were all really hungry and didn&#39;t want to wait, so after the third place, decided to head towards home and eat at a neighborhood restaurant.  I&#39;m glad we did because we all had an authentic Italian meal that seemed to hit the spot. We stopped at Franco&#39;s because it&#39;s affiliated restaurant, Franconello&#39;s, which was in the Beverly area, was where  my husband and I had our first date almost 20 years ago.  Sigh...Anyway, my son had the salmon special, served on mashed potatoes and a side of spinach.  I, of course, ate the spinach, but he really enjoyed the fish and potatoes.  My daughter had a child&#39;s size portion of pasta with marina and meatballs.  She&#39;s picky but ate enough of it, so I know she liked it.  I had the fettucini Alfredo, which was not on the menu, but they made it for me anyway, and it was delicious.  I forgot what my husband had and I never got to taste it because he ate it so fast.  We also had the bruschetta and the calamari, and the bread was warm and delicious with their oil and cheese.   We will definitely be back again.  Unfortunately, Bridgeport is not as popular and booming as our neighbors, The South Loop, Pilsen, Univ. Village, etc. (thanks to our wonderful Alderman), but fortunately we can still go into a great restaurant and be seated and served almost immediately so close to home on a Friday night."

Our kids shared one kids pasta and a side of meatballs($8 + $6.50 = $14.50 for a 4 yr olds dinner. And that didn&#39;t include drink or dessert which brought it up to $22.00! Again, they are 4!!!), we shared the bad fried calamari app and an equally bad Seafood dinner pasta, mediocre bottle of wine (not much to choose from) and blah tiramisu.

There is a small bar upfront and about 10 tables in the entire place. It was slow on the night we were there. Just us and another table but that was okay by me as the service was good (thank you Mandy) and the food even better.Bridgeport is full of family run businesses and Franco&#39;s is no exception. The owner was there and greeted us warmly when we walked in. We had a cocktail (nice and strong, I might add) while waiting for our food while the owner asked us if we lived close by (hmm . . .I kept wondering if she just had never seen us before, or if there was something I was doing that made her think I wasn&#39;t from the neighborhood . . .)There were several specials of the day and since you can&#39;t go wrong with a special we ordered the Eggplant Parmesan and the rigatoni with sausage. Both were delicious but the rigatoni won in my book. We also shared a caprese salad that was interesting as it had horseradish in the sauce versus the more traditional balsamic vinaigrette.At this point we were stuffed and weren&#39;t going to have dessert- when the owner came over with the biggest piece of tiramasu I have ever seen and two forks! She said it was their specialty and made at their Beverly location. Well- what&#39;s a girl to do? Yep. You betcha. I managed to find the room. Probably the best tiramasu I have had- rich and creamy!Loved the cute trattoria like atmosphere, loved the friendliness of the people who worked there and loved the food. It is a little pricier than other places in Bridgeport, though. Dinner for 2 with drinks was about $82 before tip, although in all fairness- $22 of it was in drinks.Bridgeport has lots of these little gems hidden away. I think I&#39;m on a personal mission to find them all!"

I&#39;d seen it whilst walking down 31st street several times, but the presence it held on the street always intimidated me a bit. Finally, I looked up the restaurant on yelp, read a few reviews, and decided to jump in and give the place a shot.I got into the restaurant at about 1:20pm on an empty stomach. The restaurant was empty, and I was given the option to sit anywhere I&#39;d like. I picked the fourth table down on the eastern wall, which gave me a nice view out the window whilst also giving me a chance to admire the scenery of the restaurant. I really enjoy the style of this place. Fine array of liquor options against the wall behind the bar, a few nice paintings can be found throughout the restaurant. Like I said, nice place.I ordered the gnocchi, and I don&#39;t really have a lot to say about it. It was good, it didn&#39;t take a terribly long time to make, everything was just fine. It came with bread, the bread was warm and good. Yeah, I&#39;m not much of a foodie.After eating, I got a rum &amp; coke. That was also good. I&#39;m always bothered by the amount of ice bartenders put in these things, and I feel self conscious about drinking out of that tiny cocktail straw because my head is so big and i never feel masculine doing that, especially with a mixed drink.But, yeah. Franco&#39;s is just great. Go there, man, or woman, whatever you are. And if you&#39;re one of those others, send me a private message here on yelp, I&#39;d be happy to accompany you to Franco&#39;s since the south side can be a bit intimidating for some people, and I love all of the alternative lifestylers."

I&#39;ve never been to the restaurant to try the Italian Ice, but it was not very good at the Taste of Chicago. They only offered two flavors: lemon and watermelon. All the workers fingers were colored with red dye. I&#39;m assuming its from making the watermelon Italian Ice because it was bright red. Artificial coloring is not what I expected. I think Mario&#39;s Italian ice is better because its made out of real watermelon, not syrup. I opted for the lemon Italian ice. It was not soft at all. It was more like a snowcone, extremely hard eating it was eating chunks of ice.  I&#39;m really disappointed because this was featured on Best of Chicago. Its really not very good."

I started to wonder if this place was the Willy Wonka Factory of the restaurant world, because I never once saw anyone go in , nor anyone come out. They did have an open sign on though so surely someone has to be going in and out of the place right?Well Aaron S. and I ended up here last night after hitting the just opened Rocky&#39;s for a beer. It&#39;s small and unassuming, and almost feels like you are walking into someones home. The waitress was on the phone so she said to sit anywhere and she would be with us in a moment. We instantly noticed how warm it was inside and contemplated for a second the option of sitting outside just because it was so nice and cool out, I think next time if the weather is as nice again we just may. Even with the risk of bugs and smelling traffic fumes. (which are the two things that always prevent me from eating outside)The waitress came to our table and apologized for the wait while she was on the phone, which was cool, but it&#39;s not like Aaron and I were in a rush or anything. She gave us menus and offered to read us the specials, and they all sounded good, which made the decision of picking dinner a little harder! In the end I went with the &#34;Steak Al Fomo&#34; and choose the &#34;Shrimp Diablo&#34; in hopes that it would be close to the priest stranglers we had at Rosebud.Nice hot bread, olive oil, and parm cheese were brought out. That bread really was fantastic, It was so good in fact that Aaron S. and I did get a second helping of it. The food did take awhile, so I would not recommend eating here if you are in a rush, it wasn&#39;t an absurd wait or anything though.The friendly waitress did ask us if we were enjoying our food a few times, and pointed out that the steak I ordered was her favorite. It was excellent. It had a perfect char on the outside, perfectly cooked portobella mushrooms on the top, and a small touch of provolone cheese. It was unique and quite tasty. They also cooked it to my specification, which was medium. It also was perfectly seasoned, and tender, with just a very very slight chewiness. Yum! The potatoes that came along with it were great as well, and were really good for soaking up the steak pan juices that were on my plate.2/3&#39;s through our meal the staff asked if they could open the door, which was awesome because we were sitting in the breeze. Actually I wish they had done it sooner, because I know Aaron was uncomfortable and I was getting there (neither of us tolerate heat well at all).At the end of the meal I was very relieved that they did not take away the remainder of the second helping of bread, because I used a piece or two to soak up some of that wonderful steak juice that was left on my plate, that is the only way to end such a meal in my book!It was a nice choice for our date night.(I made sure to give Aaron lots of kisses when we left too)"

As you can see from the Yelp photo, the restaurant is about the size of a typical Bridgeport apartment; I like that.Be sure to ask for the specials. That evening, I had some sort of Penne Sausage dish that was excellent. I believe my girlfriend had the eggplant parmesan, which was great too.For dessert, we tried the Gelato and were pleased to find that it was good too.I&#39;ll definitely be back.

I called ahead of time to confirm their time of closing. When we walked in all tables were empty minus the table where the woman who is the owner was sitting chatting with a customer, as we were going to our table I recognized the owner and said hello , she didn&#39;t respond with a warm welcome. We ate , and in the middle of eating the waitress came to our table and said were closing, I said but I called and confirmed the time, she said the owner said to close now , I said but we are eating, she said I&#39;m just telling you what I was told I asked for more time and was denied! She returns to the table and mixes my calamari with my daughters pasta in the same box. Next a man starts mopping under our table and using harsh chemicals and I asked him to please wait for me to leave and he said take a hint!  I told the waitress that I never got my glass of wine. As the smell of the chemicals are making us nauseous,  she returns and slams a glass of wine on the table and says here&#39;s your wine now leave!  I said, this is the rudest treatment.  She cussed me out , became angry and said pay and get out!  I asked to see the manager &amp; she said no! Even the male workers were being very nasty. I shouldn&#39;t have even left her a tip but on a $49 tab I gave her $4. As we were getting out of that place the six foot two woman turns to me and says hey,  I was a good waitress, &amp; you think that&#39;s what I&#39;m worth is $4 , I said after that treatment I should have not tipped you. She chases me to the door and proceeds to tell me that she will beat my ass and cram the receipt down my throat. I turned  and walked to the register, and requested that she give me a different receipt for tearing up the original one. And I am taking my $4 tip off of the tab, she yelled at me that the manager said I was nothing but a broke ass bitch when I walked in.  I was in shock,  this was not a lady in any way she called me the worst curse words , my daughter said let&#39;s go, she had my credit card and cursed at me and said I will run this for a higher tip , I demanded my card and was told by her that she would turn my 4 into an 8 and make it an $80 tip. I said that&#39;s illegal and she came at me like she was going to attack me , my daughter got scared and ran out the door as this waitress said to my daughter,  I feel sorry for you having to live with a stupid c_n_t like this for a mother. Then the four Hispanic men stood there as I was leaving and called me unkind words as well. I called the restaurant and left 3 msgs and asked for the management to return my call and I was told by a different person that she text the manager 3xs and she refused to return my call. Worst restaurant experience ever. I must admit that Bridgeport has not been a welcoming area to me as I discovered it many years ago, but I have to say that this was just plain crude and classless. Later that night I was given the same speech from a friend of mine,  she said,  that&#39;s terrible, but like I have told you before , if you&#39;re not from bport or related things can be rough around here ,and she&#39;s more than right. But absolutely unacceptable!"

As we pulled up the place was empty so we thought perhaps they were closed, however they were not.It was strange being the only diners in the restaurant but the service was friendly and attentive.

We started off with fried calamari. I only recently started eating this and will only do so if a friend really wants it, however I have to say this was among the best I have had (Kuma&#39;s gets best). It was crispy on the outside and didn&#39;t leave you with that greasy feeling. Well done!For my entrée I had the gnocchi which had a lovely tomato sauce and ricotta cheese. It was excellent and so fresh. My friend had a shrimp pasta dish that was a special and it was also very good.4 stars for service and food. Next time we will go a little earlier though so we aren&#39;t the only ones there! And this time we will leave room for the homemade tiramisu!"

If we ever get a night to go out and splurge a little cash.. This is the place for us!! The Seafood specials are always outstanding.. and Its only a block away from me.. so who can beat that??  If I could critique one thing.. it would be more appetizer selections and maybe a few more other than pasta dishes.This place is a GOD SEND!!!

We had driven by this unassuming facade many times before &amp; after Sox games and never realized what a marvelous Italian restaurant we had yet to experience.We were treated to lunch here before an afternoon Sox game recently. What a delightful experience from the bruschetta through the creamy, delicious tiramisu that ended the meal.Wait to hear the specials before deciding on your order as they all sounded amazing! I had the tilapia with cherry toms, spinach and avocado which was wonderfully fresh and flavorful, swimming in a tasty sauce. Husband had the risotto with shrimp which was a creamy, flavorful rendition. The bread was crusty and hot and served with cheese and olive oil. Can&#39;t wait to go back and see what specials they have next time! Service was excellent throughout the meal. They do have outdoor seating but it was not appealing to me on a hot, humid day. Would be great after a Sox game sometime."

It also always looked dark &amp; closed, which is not what it looks like inside at all. It is a small tidy place with warm colors, and super friendly staff. We were treated well, asked no less than a dozen times on how we were doing. We ordered their calamari, pork chops, gnocchi and bow tie pasta in vodka sauce. Their food is fantastic with great sauces, the gnocchi is homemade and pillow, and the pork chop super juicy.

There are so many yummy choices on the menu it&#39;s hard to pick just one. Our solution? We started with the calimari, which was excellent! Then we each order a dish and share it, family style. The owner is very accomodating, giving us extra plates so our entrees can be passed around the table. And don&#39;t leave without trying the tiramisu, the cake is light and spongy and the cream topping is fresh, a real treat.

(Might not be rigatoni...what&#39;s the long spiral spaghetti pasta?  That was it.)We both had a glass of wine and a cup of coffee and split one canolli for dessert.  The bill came to $88.00 bucks.  I didn&#39;t really feel like the place merited an $88 buck bill and here is why:Steak looked undercooked, bad soft rock best of the mid-90&#39;s on the radio, odd smell of bleach for a little while as busboy cleaned something behind counter, women who appeared to work there camped at a two-top with a palm treo that kept ringing LOUDLY, and very-very bland rigatoni.  It was as if they put canned chopped tomatoes on my pasta and it was watery.  The chicken also might have been from a bag of pre-cooked, pre-chopped type of thing.I had high hopes for Franco&#39;s as a friend raved about the Franco steak on the menu, but now I know we just need to take him out for steak at a couple other places so he&#39;ll have a broader steak perspective.Maybe Franco&#39;s was having an off night; but being Friday night I&#39;m not sure why that would be.  I did notice the small outdoor seating for summer and thought it would be nice to eat there on the street, but don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be back."

They always have great specials in addition to their already lenghty menu. I usually get some kind of fish dish or the white clam sauce linguine. I&#39;ve had a few of the other pastas and they&#39;re pretty good. I&#39;m not a big fan of the calamari they have but I do get the baked clams once in a while. They have a good tiramisu as well.

And please do not snooze on topping of your great dinner with some gourmet flan by Sweet Lady Flan. These flans are ALWAYS the perfect consistency and unique in flavor.Also worth mentioning, I always see the owners in there very involved and eager to ensure their patrons are satisfied and taken care of. This is exactly the kind of place I&#39;d recommend to all my friends and that I would come back to again and again.

I ordered a chicken empanada which was to die for and followed by the chicken entrée which was great.

For our entree we went with Uriel&#39;s recommendation which was the daily special. The entree was a 14oz steak with mashed yuca and a 5oz lobster tail. Since we had ordered two appetizers we shared the dinner and were STUFFED! Regardless of being stuffed we went ahead and ordered the hazelnut flan which did not disappoint.

The empanadas and yuca were great; the tamal, however, was very disappointing especially considering the &#34;$6 ea&#34; price. I also split the Ropa Vieja entrée. It was served lukewarm, but it was okay. I ate it :)For dessert we tried the coconut flan. I definitely recommend that. It was absolutely delicious.Now, personally, (and I may be biased here being Latino) for what it is, the majority of what is on the menu is overpriced. It&#39;s Chicago. Latin American food especially Cuban and Mexican are fairly consistent and inexpensive. Maybe it&#39;s the area here, but down Fullerton Ave. and other areas around the city, there are a number of Cuban and Latin American restaurants with similar food that are half the price especially for a Ropa Vieja entrée. For two people having the items listed (this is literally what we ate together) the bill was close to $70. We stuck with water by the way (don&#39;t like soda or sugary drinks).I&#39;m not being cheap either. Obviously we kept ordering things to try fully knowing the prices beforehand. Had I felt it was worth it, I wouldn&#39;t even be mentioning it. But honestly, I don&#39;t feel it was worth it for the price. Sorry. The food isn&#39;t terrible though. And that flan was delicious. But this new menu isn&#39;t for me. Some people might enjoy it very much and have a good time trying a variety of small dishes with friends. I guess it depends on the person and what they&#39;re looking for."

Everything and I mean EVERYTHING was absolutely delicious. The only downsides were that we wanted more, more, MORE!

There were insufficient beans as compared to the amount of rice available to mix the two.Our party ordered the seafood empanadas which were excellent.For dessert we ordered a flan flight that was excellent.  It came with three small flan we got to choose from a list of multiple flavors.This is a BYOB restaurant and the staff is helpful in bringing ice and glasses.  I would consider returning, but it a really smallspace and I&#39;m not a huge fan of waiting around for food."

Tip: put that shit on everything.Then for our mains, we shared the pork chops and the paella (a special). Whoa. What. Both were amazing. The pork was thick, juicy, and sauced perfectly atop a wonderful, smushy bed of yucca mash. The paella was very generously portioned, piled high with giant shrimp, scallops, clams, and prawns. They did not skimp on this dish. We stuffed ourselves and still had a ton to take home.To finish we asked Felipe to choose a flan for us - he brought us the hazelnut, which was a home run. BF is ambivalent about hazelnut usually, but he loved this dessert. There was a lot to love.This place is not cheap, but it&#39;s worth it for the hospitality, fun ambiance, stellar service, and top-notch eats."

The plantains had the perfect saltiness and the steak was quite flavorful. The Yuca Fries were addicting. We finished it within minutes. Their Cafe Con Leche was piping hot, but so good that I burnt my tongue b/c I couldn&#39;t stand waiting for it to cool down. Our waiter was very friendly, attentive, and greatly knowledgeable. Everything he mentioned about the specials and favorites on the menus sounded so good. He even helped us decide what to order.  He even reminded us that it was BYOB and mentioned there was a liquor store across the street in case we wanted to pick something up. It&#39;s a pretty small place and with the BYOB, we noticed a lot of tables staying quite a while just drinking after their meals, so I can see there being high wait times during peak times. Highly recommend and definitely come outside of peak times."

So tender!  Shrimps were tasty.  But the star of this dish is the mofongo.  I&#39;ve never had it before, but watched it being made on the Food Network enough times.  It was SO delicious.  The plantains had a nice texture with a bit of chew still - not like mashed potatoes - and the bits of chiccaron inside were TO DIE for.  Mix in the chimichurri sauce and I could&#39;ve just ordered this on it&#39;s own.My husband got the churrasco pork chop (forget the cuban name) and it was really, really juicy and tender, especially considering it was all white meat.  Very impressed!!We&#39;ll definitely be back.  Service was phenomenal and friendly.  The only thing that wasn&#39;t so great was that it took a while for our food to come out after we had our apps.  Our son was 75% done with his kids meal before our food came out - and the table next to us that arrived 15m later, all had their food.  Probably just a glitch, but hope that doesn&#39;t happen next time we go!"

It is filling and cooked to perfection.  The only thing I would pass on are the Yuca Fritas, they reminded me of french fries without any flavor.  We enjoyed the dipping sauce way more than the fries.

(unlike some other cuban places around town) and the yuca fries are so fresh every bite is to die for, my boyfriend had the ropa vieja which was super tasty, rice portions are a bit small for the amount of food we had, but eh! For dessert, we did the hazelnut flan.....................................................................(yes, i put all of those periods to visually show you the way i feel about the flan they serve)A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!I told Felipe it was nearly comparable to my mothers flan (which, is a HUGE compliment seeing how my mother makes the best flan in the world *ahem*)Texture is one of the biggest factors in Flan, the texture here was so on point. Didn&#39;t lack any flavor, didn&#39;t lack anything at all. Perfect!Authentic cuban food, in a super cute spot, the cuban paintings on the wall are so flashy, and the bathrooms are coded by gender, (obvi)Males: Abuello smoking a fat cigarFemales: Abuella smoking a fat cigar.Couldn&#39;t be more original, they do however, have Jibaritos on the menu for all my puerto rican folks who don&#39;t mind a good jibarito which did originate here in Chicago to  begin with.You should also know that the pictures up on the blue wall with the flat screen are all FOR SALE by one of the best servers in Chicago himself (Felipe)!Very happy Chicago finally got some authentic Cuban food, all we need is an authentic Cuban bakery y ya! the owner is super chill also.And don&#39;t forget to leave your feedback in the comments card they include in the checkbook for any recommendations, feedback, and more!VIVA CUBA!! ;)"

I grew up in South Florida, so I&#39;m used to having good Cuban food available, and Cuba 312 might be my new Chicago favorite! I would highly recommend this place based on the food alone.The main reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the service. As a relatively new place, I think they&#39;re suffering from some growing pains. I went for dinner on a Saturday night, and what started off as a 40 minute wait for 2 people (which to us was perfectly reasonable), turned into about a 75 minute wait, even though the hostess called me around the 20 minute mark and said a table on the patio would be opening up soon for us. I have no problem taking a stroll while waiting for a table, but if you&#39;re going to call me and make me rush back to the restaurant, I shouldn&#39;t be waiting outside for another 40 mins to be seated. We could&#39;ve kept walking around Roscoe or grabbed a drink in the mean time. We could also see that there were 2 open tables on the patio, but no one would seat us. There were 3 different waiters who walked by and asked if we were waiting, and we said &#34;yes&#34; each time, but no one did anything about it. After we were seated, it took awhile before our waitress came over too. There were couples who arrived after us and were done before us because everything came so much faster for them. I&#39;m hoping they smooth out their wait process and table management, because other than that, we&#39;d be interested in coming back!"

I attempted to eat the seafood but because it was drenched in the sauce and rice I wouldn&#39;t even finish that. I am a Latina and know the difference between &#34;spices&#34; and &#34;salt&#34;. It is a shame to have experienced this because the service was amazing.

It was well worth the wait.Everything we ate was perfect. We started out with the Croquetas for an appetizer. They were very delicious and we couldn&#39;t get enough of the sauce.Next we had our main dishes. I had the Churrasco Cubano (skirt steak) and my wife ordered the Chuletas Cubana (pork chop). Wow. Both were exquisite and we tried each other&#39;s dish. I really enjoyed the chimichurri sauce and my wife raved about the guava glaze on her pork chop. There was more than enough food and the sides matched up with the main dishes nicely.We ended the night with the Maria Felix (banana flan over chocolate cake) following the suggestion of our waiter. It was amazing. We can&#39;t wait for our next trip to Cuba 312. We didn&#39;t realize it was a BYOB, so we&#39;ll remember that next time."

Having visited Cuba, I can say I really liked the restaurant&#39;s atmosphere from the small yet roomy space to the Cuba posters on the wall, to the Latin music being played. But most of all, the food was superior from taste to presentation. I had the olive oil  pan-fried salmon which came with yucca mash and a medley of fresh vegetables. My friend, whose late husband was Cuban,  had the chicken breast with rice and beans and the vegetable medley. She was in awe as to how  authentic and qualitative the food was. We both loved it that this food was fresh  and tastefully seasoned.The restaurant provided me with a complimentary coconut birthday flan which was heavenly! Not to be forgotten is the wonderful service from the staff. Paulo took my phone call when I had questions to ask, and his responses were so helpful and personable in helping me make the decision that this is where I wanted to have my birthday dinner. Our waiter, Eddie, was equally as personable, patient in explaining the menu items, came to check if the food was to our liking, and. extending a warm welcome and farewell to us. It was a great weekday evening!Carleen"

The place is very laid back and we were surprised that pretty much every table was taken.  The staff was young but friendly and opened up our bottle of wine since it&#39;s a BYOB restaurant. First we tried the croquettes. They were like mozzarella sticks but filled with ham and cheese. I had the Cubano and my bf had the vieja ropa. The bread they used was really crispy but soft on the inside and I appreciated that they didn&#39;t over pile the sandwich with meat.  The ropa vieja beef was really flavorful and well seasoned, with a hint of spicy.  Both dishes came with white rice and black beans that had a garlic taste.  We finished out dinner with steaming hot espresso, it was REALLY delicious and sweet.  Overall, it was a positive experience. My only negative would be that the portions were a little smaller than what I would expect for the price."

The ceviche was a great way to start, light and refreshing. I had the Ropa Vieja and it was delicious (90 miles is still my favorite version) but this one is a close second. The black beans were good but missing something, I&#39;ll have to try them again and figure out what is. My friend had the surf and turf and it was good. My one disappointment was that I ordered a side of maduros and they were served to me pretty burnt. Come on chef how can you send out an entire order of burnt sweet plantains? For dessert we went all out and had the flan flight. It was delicious! Each flan was amazing and perfectly creamy. Overall, it was a good dinner and I will be back to try more of the menu at Cuba 312."

A lover of Cuban food we couldn&#39;t wait to try it. So today we strolled in. The shop is cute, and well decorated. We went at non-peak time (2pm) so it was not crowded. I am sure when it gets busy (and it does) it gets quite cozy. We followed the waiters recommendation on a seafood chowder and pressed Cuban sandwich&#39;s....1. Seafood Chowder served with bread: standard, a little bland.2. Lechon: a marinated pork sandwich served with waffle fries. Excellent sandwich. It could be  a tiny bit more juicy, but then again I declined the mayo. Waffle fries are are an odd side for a Cuban sandwich, a touch disappointed that it didn&#39;t come with plantains, or rice/beans. We did order beans as a side and did not get them. Come to find out we didn&#39;t need any sides, the sandwich was filling, and delicious, couldn&#39;t put it down.We will definitely come back to try more delicious foods. We will also come with beer as this is a BYOB!"

Wife had the Cubano and I had the standard steak.Reason for my 3 stars is they have posted open time of 12 signaling lunch. I was super stoked to go in and it was pretty empty. Got in at 1215 was told its brunch till 1230 but they had sandwiches on the brunch menu. Did not want any of them and explained I just wanted a lunch sandwich. Was told &#34;sorry you&#39;ll have to come back.&#34;I mean really? If you&#39;re the owner of this place you might want to give small liberties to your staff to make intelligent business decisions. You want a customer to come back in 15 minutes when you have more than half tables open and a full kitchen staff? Not to mention it&#39;s a sandwich....would it have killed them to take my order and bring it out in 15? I don&#39;t know how to say stupid in Cuban so I&#39;ll go with es stupido!

Damn was that good flan. Coconut flan! When I ordered the Cuban churrasco that&#39;s when I had a problem. It was really sweet really sweet he killed the entire stake for me. I tasted a whole bunch of teriyaki which to me in my opinion isn&#39;t very Cuban. Then I tried the Shipwreck which contain scallops and shrimp and the shrimp tasted very sweet as well makes me wonder &#34;does this guy know that you DON&#39;T HAVE to cook with teriyaki?&#34; The steak for my churrasco forgot to mention was perfectly cooked.  Medium rare they did a great job with that I&#39;m not going to lie but the difference between the steak and the shrimp was the texture. Same flavor on both plates. Sweet. I&#39;m going to try it again like I said everything was great other than the Teriyaki stuff which once again isn&#39;t very Cuban in my opinion.

It&#39;s Friday night and you&#39;re just gonna go out to a nice little bar with your friends, get some drinks and then head home for a good night&#39;s rest because it&#39;s been a long week. Harmless, right?But before you know it, your buddy from forever ago shows up and buys a round, and you&#39;re having the best time, and then another round, and another one, and this continues, and the next thing you know, you&#39;re waking up on your couch with string cheese wrappers scattered all over your lap.It happens to the best of us. That&#39;s when you crawl to The Bristol to revive yourself and become a functioning human again.Kudos to Chef Chris Pandel for creating this dish and aptly naming it Hangover Breakfast because this concoction is EXACTLY that. This dish is probably responsible for preventing many dysfunctional weekends. This dish is probably the reason grad students pass their classes. I mean, this dish should probably win the 2016 election honestly.So if you were an idiot last night and you&#39;re hungover and need to get your life back together (like I did), go eat this right now.It&#39;s rich, savory, lemongrassy, warm, and you can literally feel the moment that it goes through your veins and turns you from the Walking Dead back to being a mortal again.Not pictured: chop sticks and spoon. Also comes with a poached egg (obviously I got it without that).P.S. Best coffee in a restaurant I&#39;ve ever had. Also best Happy Hour deal in Chicago--but it is truly only ONE hour (M-F 5:30-6:30). 1/2 off small plates, beer, and wine. UNREAL.P.P.S. Lauren is a fantastic server.

Bread almost melts in your mouth.We got a Pork shoulder roast, salmon, half a chicken, and parpardelle.They were all very tasty.The portions are small, so no wonder she recommended more.I was with a bunch of girls who get full easily, so we were satisfied.We didn&#39;t know the restaurant would close at 9 on a Sunday.So they were practically shooing us out.No upsell on dessert.This was a pleasant experience but I wouldn&#39;t come back, only because there are so many other food spots to try."

The pastries were also delicious! Especially the berry tart.Unfortunately the main food and service was pretty subpar. Ordered the chiliquiles and was very disappointed. It was basically a bowl of chips with very little sauce and no egg mixed in. Also the latte I ordered as soon as I sat down didn&#39;t end up coming until all the food was out. I asked the waitress about it once and she seemed upset and short with me. Overall, I wouldn&#39;t come back here again in my next trip to Chicago."

I made reservations for a sunday morning and even though that was helpful it was not that crowded. I&#39;ve tried to walk in before and couldn&#39;t because I didn&#39;t have a reservation so this is a safe place to make sure you have reserved.The menu was rather limited and didn&#39;t have much that spoke to me.I went with the cinnamon roll to start, which was very very tasty. As for the meal, I had the chiliquiles but the ratio wasn&#39;t to my liking. It was too much tortilla compared to the egg and pork. Also, it was under-seasoned, which shouldn&#39;t be the case with any dish, especially chiliquiles.Wifey had the chicken n biscuits, which were OK.Overall, the bill was $38 including coffee, without tip.The Bristol gets great reviews but I wasn&#39;t blown away by it. I mean, the best dish shouldn&#39;t be the cinnamon rolls (which in fairness were delicious).The restaurant has such a good track record that I&#39;m not willing to write it off, but I would definitely need to have dinner there to make a final assessment.

They also have those large windows that open up to make it feel like you&#39;re outside, which they opened while we were there, it was nice. It was very roomy for a Saturday morning/afternoon. We made a reservation for 10am thinking it would be super busy (as is any Saturday or Sunday around brunch time), but it wasn&#39;t. And throughout our time there business was pretty steady and never got packed. The fact that it wasn&#39;t super packed or busy made it feel very roomy. With the amount of space, I&#39;d say it&#39;s a good brunch spot if you have kids and need high chairs.Food:HIGHLIGHTS:Cinnamon roll, doughnut, duck fat fries, pork chilaquiles, and the &#34;hangover.&#34;Main plates average $15 a plate and sides $6DETAILS:The cinnamon roll was amazing, words can&#39;t justify or describe how delicious it was. It&#39;s not like a Cinnabon roll (one of my favs!) with a ton of icing and overpowering cinnamon flavor. It&#39;s light with the perfect amount of icing and the texture was fluffy and basically melted in your mouth. The doughnut was a vanilla custard filled one with blueberries and lemon flavoring, covered in powdered sugar. It was similar to that of a paczki (the Polish doughnuts pronounced &#34;pon-chki&#34;). I didn&#39;t really taste the vanilla or lemon flavoring, but definitely the blueberries. It was yummy and I&#39;d recommend trying it especially if you love doughnuts like I do! Both the doughnut and cinnamon roll are good for sharing between 2-4 people.The duck fat fries, wow. These are honestly the best fries I have ever had. They tasted amazing and were super crispy. You get alot for your money, good for sharing for a group of 4. I ordered the pork chilaquiles and they were good. I was a little disappointed that there wasn&#39;t some more meat, but otherwise the meat was very tender and tasty. It was my first time having chilaquiles so I have no basis of comparison. But it&#39;s good for sharing or for one person, I finished all of it. My friends got the &#34;hangover&#34; ramen and they weren&#39;t wowed by it. They said the noodles were really good, but the broth was just ok. Lastly, since it was my birthday they served me their homemade nutter butters. I love peanut butter and cookies so needless to say I really enjoyed them. My friends don&#39;t like peanut butter, but liked the cookie. Even though I got it as a birthday surprise, I&#39;d order them again.I love that the brunch menu is on the smaller side compared to most so it doesn&#39;t make your decision too difficult. I would definitely come back to try some other things or for dinner.Service: Our server and service overall was great! She was very attentive and quick."

I also sampled the hangover breakfast, which had a nice flavor and a nice chewy texture to the noodles; however, the portion was a bit on the small side.Overall, I was a little underwhelmed--perhaps I had too high of expectations, but I found the food decent but not amazing enough to warrant the hype it gets."

On a gorgeous Sunday (unusually warm for the beginning of November by Chi-town standard), I thoroughly enjoyed the brunch at this place. I&#39;m by no means a brunch aficionado, but the execution of dishes was great.If you had had too much to drink the night before, you can&#39;t go wrong with hangover breakfast dish in the form of noodles and vegetables in pork broth. It is definitely not the ordinary dish, but beats many other ramen dishes I&#39;ve had before, with aromatic flavor that was very soothing without overpowering your palate. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had the Mexican traditional dish chilaquiles before, but the one with braised pork at The Bristol was simply amazing. Combined with fried egg, lime, cilantro and queso, I&#39;m ready to declare this dish the best brunch dish I&#39;ve had this year, with decadent flavor that somehow maintains nice balance without over-seasoning. I could seriously eat this dish for every brunch! Add in sides of crisply cooked bacons and duck fat fries, and your brunch has become suddenly wonderful. Cranberry coffee cake at the end capped a memorable brunch at the restaurant.The restaurant has a full bar with some creative brunch cocktails such as bourbon sour (I haven&#39;t tried just because I don&#39;t like its flavor, but I saw so many other tables ordering their Bloody Mary). Getting a reservation wasn&#39;t challenging, but it was nearly packed in the course of my meal, mostly with young, hip crowds looking to have a good time in the suburban neighborhood of Chicago (yes, the restaurant isn&#39;t located in downtown). If you&#39;re looking for a nice brunch option in Chi-town, The Bristol won&#39;t disappoint."

LOVED IT!!!Service was impeccable! Our server (didn&#39;t catch his name) was very knowledgeable of both food and drinks and knew exactly when to come check on us. He didn&#39;t interrupt us constantly and came two minutes after we&#39;ve finished our dishes.Food : where to begin. First, we started off with the mackerel dish and shrimp cake. The mackerel was cooked perfectly and seasoned so well. I am pretty good at pin pointing the spices in a dish, but the chef did a good job at keeping me guessing with this dish. The fish was delicate and paired well with the tangy fruits on the plate. The shrimp cakes were good. A flavor that is pretty new to my palette, a little bit of shrimp flavor and everything else that I cannot point my finger on . However, I can probably skip this dish the next time I come. Then we tried the lambs hearts and parts and the beef fried rice. The hearts and parts were served with a yummy jam and crostini with the hearts and parts in a &#34;spam&#34; like cut. IT WAS DELICIOUS! If you&#39;ve ever had Banh mi, it tasted like the pate that&#39;s used as spread. The beef and rice dish with kimchi?Was good. The beef was very tender and delicious with a bit of sweetness from the marinade. NOW, the part of the review I&#39;ve been waiting for is the BASQUE CAKE! The hype? Yes, it definitely deserved it. I am NOT a fan of sweets whatsoever, but this soft poundcake-ish of deliciousness paired with candied almonds and creme frache ice cream was seriously to die for. It is, no exaggeration needed, one of the best things I&#39;ve ever eaten. (P.S, I believe the waiter said one of the dishes we had was the chef&#39;s grandmother&#39;s recipe, amazing!)After hitting some of the tourist food spots, Chicago Dogs &amp; Deep Dish pizza, The Bristol&#39;s dishes should be the staple of this city!I seriously love this place. 10/5 stars."

The house was busy!  We started with the cinnamon roll and doughnuts and these were amazing. Cinnamon roll has a rich yet not overpowering flavor and the doughnuts were light and creamy.We shared the chilaquiles and chicken and biscuit.  The chilaquiles were hearty and meaty, with fresco and cilantro, a bit soggy but delicious nonetheless.  The chicken and biscuit was scrumptious, very flavorful and balanced.  Others had the Hangover Breakfast and Ham Benedict."

Every aspect of our wedding reception at the Bristol surpassed our expectations and perfectly fit our personality. We wanted an intimate, rustic, and beautiful wedding reception and that&#39;s what we got.

Great winter comfort food, could have used a bit more crisp in the crust.Bristol Fried Rice - really outstanding.  Nice tang from the sauce and bite from the kimchi.  We should have ordered two of these.Duck Fat Fries - &#39;nuff said.Sticky Toffee pudding - don&#39;t even debate it, just get this.  Warm, gooey, great flavor and shockingly light pudding.  I don&#39;t like caramel or toffee and I love this thing.Basque Cake - like super rich pound cake with outstanding accompaniments (marmalade, candied almonds, and crème fraiche ice cream (!!!!!)).  This is another outstanding dish.But enough about the food - let&#39;s talk about the cocktails.  Interesting menu with a good balance of new and old.  Plus, plenty of boozier drinks without fruit juice, which I always appreciate.  I got the Sicilian Smoked Manhattan, which would clearly be Tony Soprano&#39;s drink of choice should he ever dine here.  This is like my dream drink - Smoked Bourbon, Amaro, and Orange Bitters.  The smoked Bourbon is kind of like drinking a cigar along with your Bourbon.  Only this way there is no ash tray needed (and you don&#39;t taste like a cigar the next day).  I highly recommend this one.Service was outstanding.  Our server was very helpful and accommodating and the bus team was right on it. Plate cleared and set at exactly the right moment.  Shout out to this usually under appreciated team.My old house used to be just a few blocks from here, we may need to move back just to have this be our local place."

Although it seems like this place has some hit or miss tendencies, it seems we came on a &#34;hit&#34; night.I had the &#34;Painkiller&#34; cocktail which was rum based, with coconut milk and tropical juices. My wife had the Moscow mule; both cocktails were strong and flavorful. We started with the focaccia bread, served with a whipped honey ricotta spread. It was fine, nothing too special but tasty enough. Then we had the duck fat fries, served with a homemade ketchup and a garlic aoli. These were delicious, crispy on the outside and tender inside and the garlic aoli was delicious. Next, we had the raviolo, stuffed with a runny egg yolk and a cheese and herb filling, sitting in a sunny lemon butter sauce. Delicious! The textures and flavored of this dish were very rich and satisfying, and the slight acidity helped tamp down all that richness. Super tasty.Next we had the escolar with red quinoa. Although I could see describing this as &#34;bland&#34; I personally don&#39;t mind something simple. The fish was buttery and perfectly cooked, the quinoa lightly crunchy, and there were a few crispy onions that added a little punch of flavor. Very enjoyable, and I&#39;m not even a huge eater. We finished our savory endeavor with the kielbasa- yes, a splurge from our typical fish only eating style, but since they ethically source their pigs, we went for it. The cheddarwurst was salty, fatty and delicious, and was served in top of a pea purée. The one issue I had with this dish is the bacon in the pea purée, which I thought took the dish into a slightly too salty direction. It was still mighty tasty, but a touch too high on the salt.We had the basque cake for dessert, which I enjoyed immensely. A very rich cake with buttery flavor, served with honey, crushed almonds and orange marmalade. The crunchy parts on the top of the cake were my favorite!All in all we had a great meal and really enjoyed ourselves. The place was a little crowded and uncomfortable (hard metal chairs that bob precariously when one sits down) also, it was very loud because people are packed in there so tightly.4.5 on food, 3 on ambiance- since food carries more weight for me, I&#39;m giving it a 4."

The decor and ambience is awesome with a big open door to the outside and exposed brick.After waiting for a good 10 minutes before anyone even greeted us at out table, we were able to order our drinks. From then on, our our server was completely absent. We watched group after groups around us get their meals and then their bills before we even received our appetizer. We could hear the tables next to us also complaining about service. Empty drinks and empty waters were ignored, time after time, until they were pointed out by us...By the time our Chicken &#39;N A Biscuit and Braised Pork Chilaquiles arrived, they were cold, almost to the point of being inedible...

Some of the most tender and moist chicken that I&#39;ve ever had. I had always figured well-raised meat would taste excellent, but have never had the opportunity. My parents raise spoiled little chickens in the backyard (they feed them sashimi-grade fish) and their eggs are always some of the most amazing, creamy things ever - which has always made me wonder how the chickens themselves taste. So thank you Bristol for fulfilling my curiosity without having my parents disown me for eating one of their precious little ones.Waygu tartare - 5/5. Melt in your mouth. With toasted bread that was firm but not too hard.Raviolo - 4/5. The pasta is very thick and there&#39;s a lot of brown sugar butter on the outside. Inside had a slightly overdone egg yolk (looks like it hit the stage of gelatinizing and the egg yolk didn&#39;t really run). Very good dish but it was a bit too rich - and I wish the pasta was a little less chewy and firm, and that the egg yolk ran :(.Duck fat fries - 3/5. Really good fries but just tasted like... really good fries.Cocktails: If you like boozy negronis and manhattans, I highly recommend the Vieux Cruex. Extremely well-balanced and not as &#34;put hair on your chest&#34; as the the silician manhattan, which is more smokey. Can&#39;t remember what my husband had - a beer and some other cocktail, but I also can&#39;t remember how they tasted.Oh and service was awesome. The waitress was spot on with her recommendations (I like to ask people what they prefer, since they usually have tried everything on the menu). She checked in often."

The tables are a little close so hopefully your neighbors are not having any awkward break up conversations next to you!Service: Attentive. Our waiter was very knowledgeable. My cup was never empty... a plus! They were also very sensitive of the time since we had a movie to catch afterwards.Food: If you like typical Chicago American fare (think heavy foods, meat and carbs), then this is your place. Duck fat fries were very crisp, mackerel was a nice surprise, stroganoff pasta was delightful, and the Amish chicken was very moist but maybe the skin was a tad too salty for me. For dessert, we had the apple tartan which tasted like an apple tart... nothing special. Wish we could have tried the famous basque cake but we were short on time and we were told it takes about 8 minutes to come out.Overall: Very pleased with our dinner experience. I look forward to coming back for their brunch one day!"

We were promptly seated for our reservation, in the window up front. Our full party wasn&#39;t there, and The Bristol wasn&#39;t snooty about it (I hate that &#34;we only seat full parties, NYEAH!&#34; crap) at all.The food was pretty good, with the best being the massive cinnamon roll and donuts. The cinnamon rolls is what you&#39;d expect, ooey gooey stick and sweet. The donut itself was nice and doughy, not too heavy and not sweet itself. The sweetness was mostly in the frosting, which wasn&#39;t overly heavy.My entree, the pork chilaquiles, was tasty but a bit light on the pork. I could have used some more meaty goodness. I tried the French Toast and it was very good (I didn&#39;t order it myself because with the cinnamon roll and the donuts that was a lot of sweet!). My friend had the chicken &amp; biscuits which he characterized as tasting like fat...I did partake of a Bloody Mary (with the beer chaser for an extra buck). It was good and spicy, though it lacked the hearty garnish that I like in one of those drinks.Service was good, with regular coffee refills and everything came out in a timely fashion. All in all, the food could use a touch of improvement but this is a pretty good place. The brunch menu is fairly small, so check it out before you go to make sure you can find something to please everyone in your party."

Food quality ,,,,,,, super delish. salmon had slightly charred skin giving it great flavor, and perfectly cooked. Good food, great atmosphere, then why only two stars you ask!!!!Come on Bristol, the days of shee shee small portions ended decades ago. Four bites of salmon, a handful of green beans, a few slivers of potato; great for an appetizer, but not for dinner. Swear to the hunger gods, I went through the Portillo&#39;s drive  through on my way home for a greasy Italian beef and small fries which hit the spot. I mean, geez Bristol, potato and green beans are cheapo!!! if you skimp on the salmon at least fill me up with veggies. And, no bread either. No bread!!! Even the Golden Nugget gives me bread before dinner; you can too. Super disappointed because the food was great, and price not that bad, but for small portions, sorry won&#39;t be visiting again."

We walked in w/ a group of 3 around 6 pm on a Friday sans reservation and were fortunate enough to get seated right away. It wasn&#39;t too crowded when we got there, but about 45 minutes later every seat in the house was taken (always a good sign). My friends and I really enjoyed the lively yet casual ambiance, which added to our great dining experience.The service here is great. We told our waitress that it was our first time here, and she explained to us that the food here is best when shared. She did a good job of checking in on us throughout the night. Also, our waters were never more than half empty, as the servers were constantly refilling them - I drink a ton of water, so this was great!Cocktails were very good. We had the High Tea, Caribbean Beets, and Moscow Mule and thoroughly enjoyed them. They were mixed very well and very tasty.The food was awesome. We had:-Duck fat fries: these were amazing! I&#39;m going to quote my friend, who considers himself a french fry connoisseur, for the description of these fries, because I agree w/ him: &#34;these fries are perfectly crispy and have a great crunch when you bite into &#39;em.&#34; The ketchup and the aioli were great accompaniments.-Salmon rillette: nice creamy texture and great flavor throughout. They give you a lot, so be sure to pile it high on your muffin!-Roasted chicken: definitely recommend this dish. The chicken was flavorful, tender, moist, and crispy. Don&#39;t forget the spaetzle underneath the chicken, which pairs w/ the chicken incredibly well.-Prime strip steak: this was a solid dish. I thought the braised beef jam was pretty good and was more of a standout than the steak itself.The 3 of us agreed that The Bristol is a great restaurant, from the food to the service to the environment. I heard brunch here is pretty good too, so I&#39;ll definitely have to come back to check it out"

And as I say above, the urbane, warm atmosphere is an attraction.But as they say, you get only one chance to make a first impression, and the Bristol didn&#39;t make a very good one with the food and pacing.  I suspect you could have a MUCH better experience than we had here, but it wasn&#39;t a good night for the Bristol or us."

Sweet lady.Brunch menu today felt limited again. Hair in the food did not help the matter. My guest was a doctor and not easily phased by such a thing. So the fact that our server apologized (more than necessary) and took the item out of the bill (not expected at all) was very kind, hence the two stars...else i would have settle it for one star.The ambiance gone down too.  Not sexy on such a hot day to let fat ugly men with totally sleeveless shirts, going down their ugly hairy sweaty gross nipples in the restaurant....felt like i was at a rednecks-just-out-of-cubs-game stable.Coffee: was done so good.

Not enough meat and the sauce was too sweet.  We provided our feedback and it was taken off the bill, which was a very nice gesture and not expected).We also had a special that was like a twist on an ham and egg salad sandwich that deserves a permanent spot on the menu.Drinks - bubbles and wine - although the cocktails that the neighbouring table had looked amazing.Desert - nutterbutters (made in house).We will be coming back.  Love love love"

I highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time - the place was packed and one man who walked in asking for a table was told to come back in 2 hours.  We had to wait about 5 minutes for our table which was no problem.The feel of the restaurant is very Bucktown.  Exposed brick coupled with industrial decor.  Very cozy yet up to date.Now for the meal- oh my goodness! Multiple times throughout the meal we commented on how happy we were to stumble upon this place.Drinks:I started with a fresh squeezed orange juice, my sister ordered coffee that came in a french press and she said it was delicious, and our friend (another bridesmaid) ordered a cappuccino and a bloody mary (she may have had a bit too much to drink the night before - haha).  The cappuccino was beautiful (picture included) and I ended up enjoying one at the end of the meal - so smooth with the perfect amount of froth.  My sister ordered a bloody mary to go with her meal and a cute little beer back.  They mentioned the that bloody was very spicy - too spicy for my sister but our friend really enjoyed it.Food: To start the meal we ordered the pastry platter with a taste of 3 pastries.  Donuts, a cinnamon roll, and some sort of delicious apple tart thing. This was an amazing way to start the meal.  All 3 were superb but the apple deal is what really won me over.For our main courses, my sister and I ordered the chicken and biscuits with gravy.  It was really wonderful.  The entire dish was very comforting and the bread and butter pickles on the top gave it a really fresh interesting flavor.Our friend ordered the eggs benedict and ate the entire thing - she&#39;s a small girl so that says volumes as to how much she enjoyed it.Overall we loved this place - it was a wonderful spot to fuel up for a day of dress shopping =)"

I had some opentable dining credits and I wanted to use it on a restaurant that I have never been to which is how I ended up at the Bristol. We made reservations a few days in advance and arrived on time, we had to wait a little which was fine but there really is not much room to wait. After about a 10-15 minute wait ( I assume) the manager approached us letting us know we could grab a drink at the bar ( we did not notice the bar originally, and it would have been nice for the hostess to have mentioned that previously)We sat down at the bar and each ordered a Moscow mule, it was good ( I would rate it a 3.5/5). It tasted very homemade, strong and very potent ginger flavor). As our drinks arrived we were informed our table was ready.We sat down and were approached by our waitress, she asked us if we had been to the Bristol previously (we have not) and she explained the concept. She gave us a few minutes to decide what we wanted. We decided on the duck fat fries, shrimp cakes and the ravioli. The waitress insisted that that was not a lot of food and we should really order a 4th dish. We were very hesitant but ended up ordering the salmon.The Food items came out one by one since everything was intended to share. The duck fat fries with ketchup and aioli were amazing. Then the shrimp cakes came out I really liked the shrimp cakes part but I was not a fan of the grits. The shrimp cakes were very warm and filled with amazing flavor and the grits were cold and did not seem to pair well. Next came out the one ravioli, SO GOOD! we really enjoyed it, I personally would of liked the inside to be a little more melty but over all I really loved it.  By this point we were so full we should really have listed to our gut and not ordered more food. The salmon came out and was honestly the best salmon I have had in a long time, I did not like the pairings with the salmon (cauliflower and sauce) but the salmon, WOW! Unfortunately, we literally only took 1 bite of the salmon and were not able to eat anymore.I would love to come back and try some other plates and get dessert ( we did not have any room at all for desserts and we came in starving) . I will definitely return to  The Bristol."

We started with a few rounds of cocktails - trying each other&#39;s drinks, all were really good.The menu is tapas style - and definitely on the small side, especially for the prices. But everything we ordered was really really good. We ended up ordering one apple salad with watercress and a little parm, two orders of roasted baby beets, two orders of the beef brisket, two orders of fries, an order of the monkey bread, three orders of the head on prawns, and two orders of the raviolo.  One of the girls we were with actually knew the manager (they used to work together at Balena) so the kitchen ended up sending over two &#34;gifts&#34; - an order of the chicken and some additional pasta dish.. I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s called.My favorites were the apple salad (good portion and super refreshing), the baby beets (roasted to perfection with these happy little toasty bread things), the prawns (in some delicious buttery crack sauce), and surprisingly, the chicken (cooked absolutely perfectly, a solid portion over a bed of little sauted pasta/dough pieces to soak up the perfect chicken juices).I tried a looooot of different cocktails between what the group ordered, and my hands down favorite was the Poire and Elderflower - delicate, floral, very strong of the pear flavors, perfectly refreshing. I could have had many more of them.They sent us a plate of macarons as a birthday dessert as well, which was the perfect end to the meal.Overall a really good experience - although definitely on the pricier side for the amount of food you get - the meal ended up being just under $400 before tip (and that&#39;s with the comped chicken and second pasta dish).  But we had a decent amount of food and a bunch of great cocktails. Would definitely recommend this spot for a nice date night or a small group to share a bunch of plates.  Will be back!"

As many of the items were small plates we struggled a bit to decide on how to approach the menu but we opted for a couple of pasta dishes (both rich, flavorful and involved excellent use of butter), duck fat fries, blood sausage, simple salad, and dessert.Everything again, tasted terrific, and honestly, special. We treated ourselves a bit, as dinner for two + drinks/with tip was around $125, but it was worth it on all accounts.

However, after I awhile I stopped going because there wasn&#39;t enough of a rotation in the menu, and you can only eat the same thing so many times. Dinners are an adventure where you could be eating anything from rabbit kidney livers to beef tongue.  I don&#39;t do dinner that much, but I like that experience.However, after my latest trip I will not be coming back ever again.  I wrongly decided to come to Bristol for it&#39;s Mother&#39;s Day brunch where they were supposed to have a price fix menu. What they had instead was a complete rip off. They charged $29 per person to get the EXACT SAME entrees they have every Sunday that are normally $12-$15.  The &#34;price fixe&#34; was a free coffee and a small pastry for each person at the table.  Those two things couldn&#39;t have costed more than $3. So basically, they charged you $10-$15 more per person just because it was Mother&#39;s Day.  This was a straight rip off and scam.  I expressed my displeasure to the server and hostess, and all I got was a half assed attempt to tell me free free coffee or juice, and a free pastry is somehow a price fixe. I emailed the restaurant and got not response. After two weeks, I emailed again and I got an attempt to tell me they could charge more because it was Mother&#39;s Day, and since they brought the price down from $39 last year, it was a good deal.Shameful."

We were able to make a 7:30 reservation about 30 min before, which surprised me. I had been here for brunch before, but our waiter suggested that for dinner we should get a bunch of plates to share... So we did. Probably went a little overboard but it was America&#39;s birthday so who cares.Started with the duck fat fries--for me, it could&#39;ve been skipped, but they were good. Next was the country pate which was probably my favorite. Perfectly salty and served with fresh bread; I just wish they gave a bigger portion since we were sharing. The sweet fruity spread was maybe the best I&#39;ve had with pate before. We also got the burrata which I also could have skipped but it was good. There was literally ONE small piece of ravioli in that dish... Also could&#39;ve been skipped. Loved the roasted broccoli with tiny fried shallots. And the chicken was the perfect ending... So juicy. Wanted to try the walleye but we had a fish allergy in the group so maybe next time. The menu is very tiny and some of the dishes seem like confusing combinations but all around they were tasty. We finished with the lemon tart and a cobbler. Unfortunately you&#39;re gonna have to order a BUNCH of plates here unless you want to leave still hungry. But they are good plates nonetheless.Really enjoyed the atmosphere and large open window on a comfortable summer evening. Our server was kind and attentive as well. If I come back for dinner I&#39;ll definitely have to have a snack beforehand!"

I ordered two different starters from the separate &#34;gluten free&#34; menu and both were clearly contaminated and not gluten free when they arrived. First, the pork dish came with bread (it was a pate-like dish that would require a cracker or gluten free substitute, which was not available and therefore this is an awkward item to even have on the gluten free menu). The replacement dish was a kale salad which came out with croutons on it (an ingredient that should have been removed given the allergy and contaminated the entire dish)It seemed odd to include menu items on the gluten free menu, not take into account that the person actually has an allergy (which I stated to the female server), and then serve these items with gluten as an obvious ingredient. By the time I had an actual gluten-free entree, it was close to 45 minutes after ordering and the rest of my part had moved on to their main course plates.The funny thing is that I actually was giving this restaurant group a second chance after getting food poisoning from Formento&#39;s. I am now realizing it was likely not food poisoning and was more likely a supposed gluten-free plate which in fact contained gluten. These allergies should not be taken lightly. I was sick for two days after visiting Formento&#39;s and missed work. Others with stronger allergies could end up in the hospital.I hope the restaurant sees this and properly trains their staff so others in the future have a more enjoyable/stress-free dining experience."

The pastry threw me off a bit -- I was expecting a French style tart with very thin flaky crust.-- Roasted half chicken on top of dill spaetzle - the best dish of the evening. Solidly executed. Very juicy, and flavorful chicken meat complete with crispy skin. The spaetzle was fantastic with a nice creamy umami sauce. I couldn&#39;t get enough of this dish -- and apparently others feel the same way. It&#39;s the one consistent entree always on the menu. One fun thing about the dish is that it was topped with a crunchy salad. When we were there, that meant thin strips of green apple. But I took a bit and was surprised - I had to think for a minute because my eyes told me green apple, but my brains said it was something else. Turned out to be celery. A trick! I loved it! I enjoy being surprised and delighted by my food.-- Prime strip steak - this was pretty good. We ordered it medium rare, which is the chef&#39;s recommendation. The steak was good but I think it was cut at the wrong angle because it was slightly chewy. The sauce, though, a ramp sauce - I found to be delightful.-- And a bottle of pinot noir and a few orders of Scotch.Among the four of us, we were too full to order dessert! We ate every bite. My overall assessment is good execution. The food is tasty, on the salty side (but not too salty). The flavors are balanced but not complex. For a great meal, I recommend The Bristol. It&#39;s probably not innovative or highly creative, but it&#39;s good food in a great atmosphere. Beautiful restaurant and passionate staff who clearly love what they do. The Chef came out a couple times and he was so passionate about his work and talking with us.Bon appetit!"

My husband and I took my mom there last night who was visiting from out of town. Surprisingly, we were able to get reservations same day (which does not always happen!)We usually share the roasted chicken, sweet bread and several other things but this time we ventured out for the salmon which was cooked perfectly and so delicious. We also shared the duck fat fries (OMG amazing), beef cheek, (still not sure how I feel about that... a personal thing I guess, ha), shrimp cakes and kale salad. Everything was pretty great. If you want a good spot to have dinner or take an out of town guest, the food here is excellent!

I love the Bongo Room, but am rarely in the mood for that sort of a wait - so I really love places like this.I was able to make a reservation for 5 pretty last minute for a Saturday morning. Everything was great - service, food and drinks. Our server was very friendly and helpful for the 2 folks with more complicated needs (a vegan and a person with a lot of food allergies). A couple people had the egg strata, which was soooo good. Two of us also had the burger, which was awesome. The patty was juicy and delicious and the bun was perfect. The best part may have been the duck fat fries. Mmmmmm.We also enjoyed a range of cocktails - all were delicious.To manage expectations... The menu is heavier on savory than sweet, so if you want some sort of crazy stuffed french toast or something similar then you may want to head to more of a breakfast place.Atmosphere is nice and cozy, it&#39;s not quiet but it isn&#39;t one of those crazy bright loud breakfast/brunch joints.PS - This was my 2nd brunch visit and I&#39;ve also been there for dinner, all consistent and good as this visit."

I made an 11:30 reservation on a Sunday morning and surprisingly there wasn&#39;t a huge crowd waiting out the door, especially since the place wasn&#39;t big. Our table wasn&#39;t ready yet, so they told us to sit at the bar and grab some coffee while they prepare our table. We ordered a coffee and they gave us a whole French press pot full. In the downstairs area, there was basically just 3 rows of seating: a few places at the bar, 2 or 3 bigger tables for groups, and then a row of 2-4 person tables along the wall. It wasn&#39;t a huge space, but it had that busy, energetic vibe throughout. After a bit, our table was ready and they moved us to a table by the front window.Food: A lot of the items on the menu seemed to have a creative, unique twist on traditional breakfast foods. We ordered a few different items to get a small taste of each.Cinnamon roll - I was expecting it to have a pillowy, soft dough with a super thick and rich icing on top, but it turned out to be the opposite, and I kinda liked it more that way. The icing was very light and had a thin and liquidy consistency. It wasn&#39;t overly sweet either. The cinnamon roll was a little firm as you cut through it but still had a soft center.Chicken n Biscuit - It was a little on the small side, but the flavor was definitely there. There were three chunks of chicken, two wedges of biscuit, and a few slices of pickles on top. At first glance, it didn&#39;t even look like chicken since it wasn&#39;t like a typical piece of fried chicken. It honestly looked more like a piece of french toast. The chicken was surprisingly juicy inside though and still had a good crunch even though there was no skin. Also, the biscuit wasn&#39;t like a normal dense, buttery biscuit. It almost seemed like it was lightened up on purpose to complement the other parts of the dish, and wasn&#39;t meant to stand on its own. It had a hard outer layer but then the inside was light and flakey. My only complaint would be that there could&#39;ve been more gravy. I thought the gravy kind of took a backseat in terms of flavor, when it usually dominates in a traditional biscuits and gravy dish.Braised pork chilaquiles - This was probably the most average of the dishes we ordered. It seemed a little bland to me and felt like most of the dish was plain tortilla chips without too much meat or sauce. There was only one big chunk of pork, which was pretty tasty, and a fried egg on top, which is always a welcomed topping in my book. But other than that, we left most of it uneaten.Overall I enjoyed the brunch at The Bristol. I&#39;d say it&#39;s closer to 3.5 stars for me. It had a bustling atmosphere and most of the food we ordered was both tasty and unique."

Also ordered a latte which I thought would be served with the cool swirls in the foam, nope, just set down in front of me sloshing around.Went for a birthday brunch, so I will say that for 9 people the service was good - they didn&#39;t put the mandatory gratuity so we made sure to leave in excess of 20% since she deserved it.  The food, however,was a huge letdown."

I know the chilaquiles is a popular hit as well as the cinnamon roll - so that will be for next time! But I loved the big mug that my generous amount of cappuccino was served in.

I am generally surprised by the other reviews not giving more stars.I went on a Sunday night with my parents and boyfriend and we did not hold back. We ordered a lot and walked out extremely happy. The waiter instructed us to order everything at once and he would course it out - I would say things came out a little too quickly but not a huge complaint.We did order both the duck fat fries &amp; the rolls, but had them accompany other items vs. just come out on their own (recco of the waiter) and it was perfect.Started with the Apple salad - this was nice and light, great to share between four of us. I insisted on the prawns and I actually think they were my favorite thing that we ordered. They came with their heads on, so if that freaks you out, steer clear - but I devoured them, eyes on and all! ;)Raviolo: this seems to be like the new cupcake which turned into the new donut, into the new cronut, into the new ramen. I feel like I am seeing raviolo at more and more restaurants. And the Raviolo at the bristol is not to be missed! This is where we inserted the Parker house rolls to scoop up all the yummy brown butter that oozed out. YUM CITY! Now even though you will be busy dipping those rolls into that brown butter, make sure to try the sauce that the rolls came with, this is like straight up butter - and it&#39;s better than regular butter. And it&#39;s awesome too.Then we had the chicken - really juicy and great. And then the steak, where we also had the duck fat fries - also delicious. Everything was outstanding.

When I had leftovers to pack up, I was super excited to see he had thrown in some more aioli for later. I also ordered the Raviolo.

The beans were not particularly spicy and the sausage, while tasty, wasn&#39;t mind boggling in any way. Again, not worth the $12 they charged for it.One thing I should give them props for: The cocktail was really well prepared and they had the Revolution hibiscus beer on tap - that should probably be worth a 1/2 a star all on its own."

We were easily able to make a reservation for 4 at the beginning of the week. Upon arrival, we were seated immediately in their upstairs area which is really cozy. We immediately loved the ambiance. Our waitress came over to take drink orders. We all started with different cocktails and loved them all. The Bristol&#39;s cocktail menu is inventive and unique, don&#39;t skip on these when you visit! The eustis was my fave.To start, we went with the monkey bread and duck fat fries. The Bristol&#39;s menu is designed so that you basically cannot skip these items, and you shouldn&#39;t. They were both incredibly tasty and easy to share among four. From there, we picked many plates to share, so we could try as many items as possible. The black pepper brisket was a standout, as were the kielbasa stuffed mushrooms. Although we didn&#39;t really know what the cardoon graintee was, we were pleasantly surprised with the thoughtful flavors and sauces going on in there. Additionally, we ordered the pasta with rabbit that was rich and delicious. The only main we sampled was the half chicken. I almost never order chicken out, but convinced my dining companions that Yelp had told me this was a &#34;must order.&#34; It was really delicious. Super flavorful, there&#39;s a reason this item remains on their menu season after season.Of course four ladies were going to order dessert. After reading an article that Grant Achatz&#39;s favorite dessert was The Bristol&#39;s basque cake, we had to order it to see what the fuss was all about. We also went with a dessert that our waitress described as &#34;snickers on crack.&#34; And that&#39;s what it was. It tasted exactly like a Snickers...on crack. Which was a lot of awesomeness. Price point is high, but you&#39;re paying for quality, thoughtful dishes. All of the ingredients are from family farms and full of intricacies. Overall, a lovely dinner. I highly recommend going with friends and sharing some plates."

It was truly a wonderful foodie experience. The food was beautifully arranged and tasted as good as it looked. My favourite was dipping the monkey bread in the ravioli with browned butter. For dessert, both the basque cake and chocolate cremeux were heavenly and well worth the price. A visit to the Bristol wouldn&#39;t be complete without trying one of their unique cocktails. I especially enjoyed the Dark and Stormy. The Doff Your Hat was also delicious. Our server was friendly and really knowledgeable about the menu. Her descriptions made me want to order everything off the menu! It&#39;s a little pricey, but well worth it for the quality and original menu."

He likes to get the Basque Cake:epicurious.com/articlesg…I had some time to kill around 6:30 on a Thursday before meeting a friend at a nearby bar so I thought I&#39;d see what all the hype was about at The Bristol.The first thing they asked me was &#34;Do you have a reservation?&#34;I looked around the near-empty space and answered &#34;No.&#34;&#34;Then you can sit at the bar,&#34; they told me.Fine, I thought, I wanted to sit at the bar anyway.The next thing I noticed was that this was helluva boring bar. They had a TV that was turned off and the bar tender was taciturn. I don&#39;t know what he was doing but he didn&#39;t greet me and he took his sweet time (defined as several full minutes) before dutifully asking me if I wanted a drink.Per Mr. Achatz and Yelpers, I ordered the prawns, basque cake, and poire and elderflower cocktail. Although I&#39;ll readily admit that the textures of the food were a unique experience (mostly combinations of crunchy, crispy, soft, and gooey), I don&#39;t think I&#39;d get any of that again because the flavors were pedestrian.The prawns were essentially cooked whole in garlic butter. Everything tastes good in garlic butter. I can cook something in garlic butter and it&#39;ll taste good. That said, the heads and shells (the server encouraged me to eat them also) were nice and crunchy but sometimes chewy and hard to get through. I compared them to stale potato chips.The cake and cocktail were both overly saccharine. The cake was wonderfully crunchy on top and moist yet fluffy texture inside. It came with a scoop of ice cream that failed to take the edge off of the sweetness. A patron at the bar next to me told me that the cake used to be better when they had a different pastry chef. That other chef used to make a cream sauce instead of a syrupy cherry sauce. I agree - a cream sauce would have been better for toning down that crushing sugariness. The sweetness in the cocktail overpowered any other flavors that would have made it more interesting.By the time I left, the host, server, and bar tender were reserving spots at the bar and dutifully policing innocent patrons who didn&#39;t know. The space of The Bristol - shabby chic, loft, locovore complete with tables made of reclaimed wood, mason jars, brick walls, and light-bulbs with visible filaments - made me think that the employees might be warm, inviting, and friendly. They&#39;re none of that. I was keenly aware of it considering I came alone to sit at an initially empty bar in a mostly empty restaurant where it was just me and the bartender and some unsullied (Game of Thrones reference) employee.Speaking of that, all of the bus boys and the bartender&#39;s assistant were Hispanic guys who silently removed and replaced my silverware. They were dressed in black tops whereas the servers and bartender were all white and wore white shirts. I did not like how the servers and bartender spoke in regular tones and the bus boys and assistant only whispered questions for direction. It was a very weird dynamic and not one that I liked. Perhaps what I observed was unusual but I can&#39;t imagine how that style of interaction would spontaneously be enacted across multiple people for my viewing pleasure."

They both were happy to provide a small sample of wine before we committed to a beverage, which was much appreciated. The food: can&#39;t say enough great things about it! The reason I went back right away was due to the plentiful and fantastic cruelty-free (aka vegan) options. A good chef can do just as great a job with veggies as with meat.

First, I love that they take reservations. Our wait time was minimal, just enough to get a drink at the bar and chat for a little. The place was crowded and busy in a good way - we still had enough elbow room. The guests all seemed friendly and like they were having a good time.The food. We had spent lots of time (three days) drooling over pictures of what we might order. We couldn&#39;t decide on just two dishes so we got three to share (for two of us). The chicken and biscuits were absolutely outstanding. Perfect cure for my mild hangover (the Moscow mule helped too). The ham Benedict was good. I was really looking forward to the &#34;Hangover&#34; noodle bowl the most. It had a lot of ingredients and flavor but the broth was just too oily to enjoy. Perhaps it was just that batch, because I have read reviews ranting about it. The chicken and biscuits though... soooo good.Service was good. It was obvious they were busy but our server was friendly. Our empty glasses and dishes sat on the table until after we left... which would be obnoxious if I cared that much and we even sat around and had a couple cocktails at the end.I will definitely be back to explore more of the menu and cocktail list. Overall recommend."

First the good stuff.. The atmosphere is lovely. The weather was nice so the large window/doors were open. One friend had a coffee and she said it was delicious and robust. For an app we shared the cinnamon bun and it was moist, pillowy and gooey! Really good!  For mains we got the chicken and biscuits and chilaquiles. C&amp;B were so good! Chilaquiles not so much...If you&#39;re expecting the pieces of pork or pulled pork you&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s actually a piece of pork belly and apparently some pork is in the sauce. I&#39;ve got to add that the sauce was hardly there. The dish was just really disjointed and not flavorful at all. I would recommend they either change the menu to say &#34;pork belly&#34; instead of braised pork, or they should have servers explain this point. Speaking of the server, our server (I think his name was Ryan V) was awesome about taking the dish back to the kitchen and allowing us to order something else, without charge. I ended up ordering the apple salad with links on the side and my friend got the eggs Benedict and both dishes were great.So overall I had a good experience here and I would possibly return. But I wouldn&#39;t order the chilaquiles again!"

So glad we did that.The menu was my kind of menu. Between the chicken and biscuits, burger, and chilaquiles, I didn&#39;t know what to do. But I went with the chilaquiles and my wife went with chicken and biscuits. We also got the duck fat fries on the side. Everything was gone very quickly! So good. The chilaquiles only came with one piece of pork belly, so that was odd, but still delicious. Wasn&#39;t a fan of the salsa on the side, not a ton of flavor. The chicken and waffles were great, heavy, but yummy. I finished most of my wife&#39;s dish, no complaints here. And the fries were fries, perfect.Great price and great vibe.

Since they hired this new joker to run the kitchen, I&#39;ve been a little disappointed to say the least:For starters, no more monkey bread!!! Even if you told me that their inferior replacement bread used the exact same same recipe, I&#39;d still say it&#39;s garbage. The fun ramekins and dill butter really took the monkey bread to another level. The slanderous waiter even had the audacity to suggest that she thought the new rolls were better. Clearly, she has no soul.Another disappointment was the wagyu (I think? It may not still be on the menu). I wish I could up with a more colorful description than &#34;boring&#34;, but that&#39;s what it was. It didn&#39;t have much accompanying it to begin with, and didn&#39;t have that blast of flavor you would expect with such an expensive cut of meat.I really want to give them a two, but they were my favorite restaurant for the longest time. Additionally, they still have the always excellent half-chicken and basque cake (assuming they didn&#39;t muck those up).Oh, and one other thing: if you go to brunch, don&#39;t order any grapefruit. They can&#39;t be bothered to cut it, so you&#39;ll end up spraying everyone with juice and embarrassing yourself in the process."

These folks are on point, and you should totally eat here. I had a late brunch on a Saturday and want to make it a regular thing, cause damn. Just be sure to make a reservation! This is a small restaurant that is clearly in high demand.1.) The hosts are on their game and easily have one of the most thankless jobs, next to the bussers.2.) We were seated about 20 minutes after our reservation because the table we were meant to be seated at had paid but decided to have a leisurely chat despite the fact that it was a weekend brunch at max capacity.3.) But who cares? We got to spend more time at the bar enjoying the delicious beer selection and French press coffee!4.) They still have us a free cinnamon roll the size of my face. I ordered another one to take home. It&#39;s so flipping good.5.) Couldn&#39;t decide between the Chilequiles or the Hangover breakfast (a slam dunk of a Thai/Korean noodle dish with a broth so delicious I&#39;m convinced it can cure cancer), so I got both. Ha! The former was fabulous, and the only thing that kept the latter from being my favorite thing in life was the surprising lack of noodles compared to the amount of broth. But who cares? So flavorful and delicious. They even brought me a special container to take the rest of the broth home and I drank it all before I even made it back."

Aka, this place is great for sharing.They have an extensive wine list, which was in our favor. The entire menu is known for using every part of the animal, and it is super seasonal. Only 4-6 items are consistent and the rest are based on what is fresh!We tried the following:Monkey Bread - Simply delicious bread with a really creative dill butter. It was more saucy than butter, so we ate that up!Duck Fat Fries - We had to get this in tribute to Hot Dougs closing. Duck Fat Fries will never be the same! This was perfectly crunchy and you actually got that gamey flavor from the fries. There was some sort of cheese and cilantro on top, which made it even more delicious. This also came with an awesome and tangy homemade ketchup and garlic aioli.Head on Prawns - This was very interesting to say the least. They give it to you cut in half so it is easy to take out the meat and then the entire body/legs/head are edible if you need a little crunch. There were 6 of these, so it was definitely filling. There is also a sauce on the bottom, which we didn&#39;t notice until the last prawn so make sure to try it with the sauce. But all in all, this was very flavorful and I would try it again.Parisian Gnooci - This is really a fried gnocci, which I never had before. The flavors sort of resembled a samosa because of the green pea puree on the bottom and onions on top. I was looking forward to a traditional gnocci so I was a little let down, but this was a pretty good dish.Millers Farm Roasted Half Chicken - Usually people are like ehh never order the chicken because chicken is chicken! But this place has an amazing chicken! It is crispy and tender all at the same time. There is a delicious creamed corn/bean mixture underneath that is paired nicely with the chicken.Basque Cake - So this was funny, the cake was great but we do wish there were more berries around and in the cake. The ice cream tasted just like this Indian ice cream called Kulfi. We had to ask what kind of ice cream it was, and found out there is coconut and cardamom inside --- no wonder! =) Really filling and delicious, but I would ask for some extra cherry jam."

The cinnamon roll was my fave, but the apple cake and the donut-like treat were also quite tasty.I also enjoyed a spicy bloody Mary that came with cubes of cheese and pate as a garnish. Om nom nom.For my main entree, I went with the quiche and was definitely not disappointed. It was a rough call between the quiche and chilequiles, but when someone in our party ordered them, I went the route of the quiche...which came with a really amazing and refreshing side salad of lettuce, radishes and fennel. The quiche was perfectly cooked without being dried out and the ingredients were fresh. I was impressed.The chilequiles? Also AMAZING. Our group also ordered the eggs Benedict, the openface egg sandwich and the duck confit burger.

Great presentation and solid mixture of sunny side egg and marinated pork belly.(2) Pine nut guacamole and chips. Your standard guac and chips. This was the most underwhelming as the stock picture really built up my expectation for artisan grade chips.(3) Crispy fish tacos enclosed in a purple hibiscus tortilla and garnished with coconut cabbage slaw and toasted coconut crumbles. This was a winner. Love the mixture of crispy fish filet with the subtle hints of coconut juice. The carrots and cabbage added for a great balance of veggies.(4) Coffee braised beef tacos. The braised beef was less marinated in coffee than it was of other sauce. Was it me or is it a bit hard to taste the coffee? Otherwise every bite was a mouthful of beef. Very filling~Overall, the servers and manager at Takito Kitchen were very accommodating, and it was much appreciated when the waitress allowed us to pick two types of tacos rather than ordering four of the same thing.

Unfortunately, you aren&#39;t able to mix and match tacos unless it&#39;s Taco Tuesday, so you have to commit to one flavor and cross your fingers.  I tried the Crispy Fish; the fish was great, but the tacos had peppers which were too spicy for me.  The coconut custard slaw was surprisingly tasty.  Hubby had the Coffee Braised Beef, which was okay, but a little dry.  After ordering, we decided to add an order of the chips and 3 salsas, which arrived mid-meal.  The chips were good, but the salsa were just okay.Service was great!  The hostess and our server were friendly and accommodating toward our toddler.  We may have to come back for Taco Tuesday or Fried Chicken Wednesdays to try out the Fried Chicken taco."

I think the lamb and the crispy fish tacos are two standouts.The prices keep me from throwing down the fifth star.

(To be honest I was on my way to Antique Taco, but the weather got the best of me and my friend and we decided to pop into Takito instead).They have an outdoor patio that&#39;s super close to the patio of the restaurant next door. It&#39;s a little too close quarters for my liking so we decided to sit inside. As soon as we walked in we were promptly greeted and given a table.To start off we ordered a round of the Takito margaritas and Mexican cokes. The margaritas are on the smaller side, our server did mention that they have a larger size but the price seemed steep for a margarita. Sizing aside, they were beautifully presented with a salt garnish on one side of the cup and a lime slice, tasted great too!For our meal we went with an order of fish tacos and pork belly tacos. They were SO GOOD. The pork belly was cooked perfectly and served on a homemade sesame tortilla. The fish tacos were on a hibiscus tortilla (which might be the prettiest taco I&#39;ve ever seen) and were so bright and colorful, you can tell a lot of thought went into creating this menu.Takito does orders of 3 or 4 tacos. Pricing wise it works out to be about $4 a taco and after my meal an order of 3 worked out perfectly for me. As someone who works on Division, I&#39;m for sure going to be ordering lunch from Takito from now on!"

We were warmly greeted as soon as we walked into the restaurant to check in about our 5 PM reservation time on a Saturday. Everything was timely and prompt about our service.We each decided to order four tacos and we also enjoyed two flavors of agua fresca (hibiscus and cucumber). The cucumber was definitely my favorite: so refreshing and with real cucumber!We decided to order four tacos each (you can choose to order either three tacos for $12 or four tacos for $16). I got the lamb merguez tacos, which were flavorful and had generous portions of lamb. I also tried one of the brunkow cheese tacos that my girlfriend ordered and I have to say, WOW! Not bad for a vegetarian taco.The manager was very kind and chatted with us a bit about the restaurant and what they stand for before leaving. That was a really nice personal touch that I appreciated as a customer. We will definitely be recommending Takito Kitchen to people in the future. I&#39;m glad I decided to give Takito another chance."

Both times I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, but the service was a little slower than I usually prefer. Especially at lunch, it seemed like they needed another server working. Our server was very nice and doing a good job, but she could have used some back up!The bacon polenta is a must order- my gosh is it delicious. It has pieces of corn and crispy bacon inside and it&#39;s incredibly creamy. The tacos are all good- my favorites are the Barbacoa and Fish! The food definitely deserves 5 stars!"

I would call to make a recommendation- it&#39;s a smaller restaurant.TACOS: You can get 3 of the same tacos for 12, or 4 for 14. If you like variety- share. Listen to the special- they may have one. It&#39;s not as good as Big Star or Mercadito- but it&#39;s pretty good. It&#39;s not the highest quality of meat- but so tasty. Loved the fish tacos, but the beef barbacoa was my favorite.Guac/Salsa: Don&#39;t do. The guac is pureed but I like thick pieces of avocado and spice and the salsa&#39;s have no flavors. Just get a second cocktail instead.You may be full and have to pass dessert- I understand. A great casual and fun environment for a date. Service is not bad- the people are friendly but can be slow - esp. for drinks. It&#39;s also can get pricey. But if you&#39;re looking to fill your stomach up- this is the place for you!"

We were cross-country road tripping east and needed a spot to eat with the dog--Takito had a lovely outdoor streetside table situation and even though we were eating at an odd in-between hour, we were given attentive service (including gas heater!) as well as our dog (water bowl and empty plastic bowls for her own doggie food!).But the food--the food was amazing! Chicken and fish tacos both had appealing flavors and heat including coconut and crunchy-cool cabbage and hibiscus corn tortillas. Beautiful presentation.Even the Cowboy Coffee--lightly sweetened coffee with spices was so delicious I ordered two! The blackberry flan with a granola like crunch was a surprise finish.Friendly service and one of the best new-Mexican food experiences we&#39;ve had (and we live in Cali!)So happy to have found Takito!"

We got there around 1:30 and they were reasonably packed. About half way full. So we got seated rather quickly. The restaurant is long and narrow and kinda dark but towards the back it&#39;s more open and light. We sat in a booth and has a great view of the kitchen. Which I&#39;m a nerd and loved because I got to watch them cook up deliciousness!We both had margaritas. I had the regular one and my girl had the pineapple margarita. Both were fantastic!  They don&#39;t have a bartender so the waitstaff make your drinks. Which was fine because the drinks came out great! No complaints.Our server talked us into the specials. I got the sopas and my friend got the chicken chiliques  (sp?). I liked her meal better. Tastes like chicken nachos. Not to knock the pork belly sopas at all. I mean I basically licked the plate.I just wish I lived closer to this place. I&#39;d def be a regular. Yummy food, strong drinks, great service. Go check em out!"

They were slammed but my friend and I were able to snag some bar seats close to the door. I think you can make reservations so I would recommend that!Our waiter, Jhonatan, was fantastic. Very knowledgeable about the whole menu, checked in regularly without interrupting our conversation and funny too! I started with the Caliente margarita and my friend got the seasonal strawberry one. Awesome. Some of the best margs I&#39;ve had in Chicago. We also did the ghost pepper hibiscus salsa and chips. It&#39;s not overpowering so don&#39;t let the ghost pepper scare you.We decided to share the Amish chicken and beef barbacoa tacos. You can do 3 or 4 per order. Both of them were really good! Takito&#39;s tacos are definitely on par with Big Star, if not a little better in my opinion.Really impressed with this place! So glad we popped in for dinner and drinks!"

We ordered  a variety of salsas, roasted asparagus as a shared plate and 4 different kinds of tacos (including the Wednesday fried chicken special) and all of them were delicious!!

The patio is small with only 4-5 tables out there, but there is plenty of seating indoors.The kitchen is visible from most areas of the dining room, which is how I learned that they make their tortillas fresh from dough right before your eyes! And you can definitely taste that freshness in each bite!I tried the combo of three salsa, which were all tasty with my favorite being the delicious ghost pepper salsa. The name is misleading because it&#39;s not spicy but full of rich flavors! The Crab Ceviche was ok, although I was not a fan of the masa crackers it&#39;s served with. I much prefer the ceviche at Bar Takito, unfortunately. The Pork Belly Tacos were really delicious and definitely my favorite of the foods I tried while I was there.They also have some great margarita options with spicy, sweet or smokey varieties for whatever strikes your fancy! I prefer the ambiance and drink selection at Bar Takito, but this is also a great place to dine and have a drink!"

And with food, you better bring it imo.I&#39;ll just say there are few out there on par with Takito.  Without boring you with details, I assure you that Mario and his staff are as meticulous and thoughtful about how they treat their clientele as they are about the food and drink they serve.  And this extends all the way to the staff servers they choose to hire as well, as they are a reflection of those qualities and they exude them with a charm all their own.Oh, and the fried chicken Wednesday&#39;s are quite good, i mean really good! and good deal too.  And so is the Caliente Margarita. V Hot, a given etc.So I&#39;ll part with that, but not with Takito."

Ten minutes go by and I ask the server if mine are coming soon and he says yes right away..a minute later comes back to ask me which type of tacos I ordered. Another 15 minutes go by and they finally come out but have peanuts on them which is not stated on the menu and peanuts are disgusting so once again, I wait 15 minutes for these tacos.

My fiancé and I visited last night (a Wednesday) because it was his birthday and he loves tacos and margaritas and we had just spent all day moving into our new apartment so we were looking for a filling yet relatively inexpensive meal. We were the only ones seated inside for most of the evening but for the number of times our server just passed by without acknowledging us you would&#39;ve thought it was packed. That&#39;s not what earned Takito one star, though.We sat down and immediately began searching for margaritas. I settled on the pineapple serrano and my fiancé chose the caliente. We love mezcal and saw they had a few types on the menu, so we asked our server if we could substitute mezcal for tequila and she said sure. When we ordered, she asked if we would like &#34;big&#34; ones, which were listed as $20 on the menu. Thinking she might not be back by to bring us more drinks often, we said of course. She then left and brought the chips and salsa we ordered. The drinks arrived, were tasty (but by no means &#34;big&#34;), and then it took what seemed like forever to even place our food order--the chips and salsa were long gone before we even told her what tacos we wanted.Now. We got the lamb and beef tacos, and inhaled them. The food was good, and fairly priced, though I&#39;ve  had much better tacos in the area for much cheaper. But when the bill came, I just put money down since I was paying for my fiancés dinner for his birthday. Once the change came back, I went through the bill and noticed we were charged $28 apiece for the &#34;big&#34; margaritas in which we substituted mezcal for tequila instead of the $20 like the menu said. Okay, I thought, maybe the mezcal they offer is more expensive than the tequila. But no. They offer a mezcal mule for only $10 and their other mezcal on the menu is $11 so in no way, shape or form should substituting mezcal for tequila (even in a double) cost us a total of $16 more. Furthermore, in a day and age when they tell you at Chipotle that guacamole is 50 cents extra, you&#39;d think they&#39;d MAYBE mention that there would be an EIGHT DOLLAR UPCHARGE to substitute one kind of liquor for another.Anyway, we learned our lesson. Got hoodwinked. It was probably our fault for not making sure the drinks would be the same price, and it was our fault for coming here in the first place. Won&#39;t make that mistake again!"

The chicken tacos were probably the best ones I&#39;ve had in the city- so flavorful and perfect amount of spice. The service was great too and the food came out super fast!

When our tacos arrived at the table, we asked for more chips and water.  We had to flag someone down to ask again as we still hadn&#39;t received them.  The space is interesting as it&#39;s very long and narrow.  The tables are on one side, and the kitchen and &#34;bar&#34; are on the other.  To get to the back of the restaurant you walk by the messy, wet &#34;bar&#34; area.  It&#39;s more of just where they make the drinks.  Overall, everything was just okay.  Nothing wowed us.  I was actually a little disappointed because we were both looking forward to having tacos and our expectations were not met."

I loved that they serve the salsa with two different kinds of chips.I ordered the crispy fish tacos and my friend got the pork tacos. Both were so fresh and flavorful! We unfortunately didn&#39;t get to eat them at the restaurant as it took kinda long to come out so we got them to go as we were meeting other people for drinks.

They have such good drinks and their tacos are a step up from Big Star.On drinks- on Thursdays they have a tequila night, which is like an entree + two shots of tequila deal. It was about $20 for everything, which made the meal super super cheap. They also have the best margaritas ever. I love coming with a group so you can try a variety of margaritas. Their flavors are very vibrant but not sweetened to overcome the tequila. Most recently, I had the seasonal tamarind margarita. Super delicious.On tacos- entrees come with three or four tacos, which is great for mixing and matching entrees with friends. My favorites were the pork belly and crispy fish. The toppings make them more than your standard taco."

My friend had just finished her board exams, so she wanted a place that had good food and a nice environment - which is what Takito Kitchen has.Note: this place doesn&#39;t serve your traditional tacos - and it isn&#39;t trying to. They serve unique tacos w/ a twist, and it definitely works.The margaritas here are awesome! I think Takito Kitchen has successfully made me a margarita fan. All the margaritas were mixed very well and tasted great. We all got a different type of margarita and ended up trying/sharing one another&#39;s:-Seasonal margarita: this had tamarind and cilantro in it. Real good and not too tangy, which I was fearful it may be. It was a great drink that reminded me of so many Mexican candies that I used to always eat as a kid.-Cucumber margarita: my favorite margarita of the night. Super refreshing - I imagine this as the perfect drink on a hot summer day! I kept kicking myself for not ordering this for myself - luckily I was able to keep stealing sips of this from my friend without her noticing (unless she&#39;s reading this right now - sorry I&#39;m not sorry)-Caliente margarita: a nice spicy kick at the end of each sip. If that&#39;s what you like in your drinks, this one is for you-Takito Margarita: their signature margarita. This was good in and of itself, but I preferred the other &#34;flavored&#34; onesFor appetizers, we got the shrimp ceviche and we sampled all 3 of the salsas. The ceviche was fresh and light, and I was a fan of all the salsas. I kept sampling each one individually to find which one I liked the most, but I just couldn&#39;t. I was excited to try the masa chips/crackers that came w/ the salsa since everyone talks about em, and they were definitely interesting to say the least. Texture-wise, it sorta reminded me of a big salty graham cracker. I must say that they were quite addicting, as I kept nom&#39;ing on them throughout the night. The masa chips were a hit or a miss at our table - each person either liked them or didn&#39;t care for them - I was part of the former.We ordered 4 different kinds of tacos so that each person could try a different one. FYI, the tacos come as either 3 or 4 tacos. We ordered:-Maple Creek Pork Belly-Alaskan King Crab-Crispy Chicken-Chorizo Y PapasAll of the tacos were on point and delicious IMO, but for me, the pork belly was the runaway winner. IT WAS SO GOOD. The pork belly tasted wonderful, was smooth, and had a nice char on it. The other toppings complimented the pork belly perfectly (gimme avocado on anything, especially a nice piece of pork belly, and you have successfully captured my heart). Again, the other tacos were great as well but man, I&#39;m still dreaming about that Maple Creek Pork Belly.Service here was FANTASTIC. I don&#39;t think there was ever a point in the night where our waitress didn&#39;t have a smile. She was super helpful with the menu, always there when we needed her, and just exuded this awesome personality that made our night that much more fun and livelier.Everything about Takito Kitchen is amazing. Taco game strong. Ambiance on fleek. Service on point. This is why I will come back to Takito Kitchen, and this is why you should drop on by if you haven&#39;t already!"

Had the ghost pepper, its little on the spicy side but the crackers are so good. Had the pickled habaneros which my husband enjoyed. The lamb chorizo was so amazingly good, it is spicy so if you can&#39;t handle it try something else. Also had the beef barbacoa which was really good and a bit spicy. Tried the mexican chocolate ganache, a little too chocolatey for my taste and might have been too much with the food and drinks. For drinks we tried the takito margarita, which taste basically like a lime margarita; had the cucumber margarita and the tamarind margarita(it&#39;s their seasonal margarita). The drinks and good but just too pricey. The wait time for the tacos did take a while, but the manager approached us and apologized for it."

So we went to Takito one night :)Together we went with two friends who don&#39;t eat pork and one doesn&#39;t eat red meat either so that made things slightly complicated when they make you order 3/4 tacos per order. Everyone had some margaritas to get started. I had a regular one, others tried the rosemary one and actually really liked it. Our waitress was pretty friendly and was urging us to try it so we did and were not disappointed.Food:- Bacon Polenta - got the bacon on the side and this was yummy but to be honest was not that memorable.- Salsa/ Guac - Same here, tried the salsas and the guac&#39;s and these were delicious but nothing out of this world- The Tacos: I feel like we kind of missed out due to the crowd that we were with - we didn&#39;t have the pork tacos or anything with chorizo which I think is really what they are known for. We did do the Alaskan Crab Taco which was pretty different, I liked it but I don&#39;t think everyone &#34;loved&#34; it, Crispy Fish was great but not too special, very similar to what you can get at antique taco, Ribeye was the one red meat one that we got, it was good but I was pretty full by this point, the Cheese taco felt a little like queso fundito but already proportioned out - good but a bit bland without chorizoAlso, something weird but we had almost zero cell service in the back where we were sitting. This was a little annoying...! I will certainly go back (I actually have a groupon that expires soon) but I will probably bring my friends who are more adventurous eaters with me!"

But I REALLY hope we just had bad luck when it comes to service. We made reservations three weeks in advance. Came in on time and they forgot about us. When we reminded them of our reservation they thought we were walk ins and seated us shoulder to shoulder at a communal table. We asked to be moved and were denied. We explained that we had reservations and they promised to move us, then didn&#39;t, again. We ordered margaritas. I ordered a large. They gave me a small. The waitress apologized, promised I&#39;d get another large with my next margarita. They brought me a small margarita AGAIN! Waitress came over and apologized, saying the person who brought over the margarita was new and didn&#39;t know the tables yet and brought the small drinks to the wrong table. You started new people on CINCO DE MAYO at a MEXICAN RESTAURANT? It&#39;s really, really a shame because the food and the margaritas are good. And our poor waitress was trying to make up for the fact that every single person in that restaurant didn&#39;t know what the hell they were doing. She should get work elsewhere and Takito should up its service."

Numerous problems popped up while we were here. No employee at the door and no visible bar seating left me awkwardly standing around the host stand. Next to the host stand were papers and a laptop where it appeared a manager was doing payroll or something. After I waited around for a while, someone came up to me and I told them we had a reservation. He told me they didn&#39;t have a table ready yet, even though there were empty tables around the restaurant and we had a reservation. I can&#39;t be sure, but it seemed like the manager abandoned his post by the host stand where he was doing payroll to go bus tables. Sure, Sunday nights can be slow, but to be so short staffed was embarrassing.We finally went to sit at a high-top table where two silverware rolling stations were set up on dining tables nearby. It felt like we showed up at the restaurant when it was closed. Laptop for payroll by the front door, silverware stations by the dining area. It was highly unprofessional and made me as a customer feel like an afterthought to behind-the-scenes restaurant management. At the tables on either side of us, all drinks were empty and customers were looking around for a waiter. The waiter hurried over after a while to take care of the customers on either side of us. Because the tables are high-top, our face was level with the server&#39;s face- who had bad breath. When he made a mistake at another table, I could hear him swearing to himself as though he was whispering profanity in my ear, topped with some halitosis. It was disgusting.He told us about some menu highlight quickly- and I mean QUICKLY. He essentially rattled off his pre-recorded message about the menu at super speed and rushed us into ordering. The entire mess of a scene was such a turn-off that we decided to leave entirely. So we never even had a chance to taste the food we&#39;d heard about. We only saw a scheduling mess with poor management and unhygienic staff. Just hire enough people and don&#39;t phase early on weekend nights. It&#39;s so simple, but they messed it up and made a horrible impression. Very disappointing because we&#39;ve heard so many good things and live so close by.We were there Sunday, March 6th."

Not too sweet with a delicious cream.Salsas that came with the crackers (I thought the crackers were silly, they should have just done chips like everyone else) but the pistachio salsa in particular was very tasty)Complimentary Rose  was also excellentNow the bad:Temperature: We were seated 3 down from the front door. I was so cold that I had to eat dinner in my down coat. They could easily remedy this but putting a small heater by the entranceThe Food: This is not the place to go if you have a traditional mexican food craving...I would describe the tacos as &#39;hipster experimental&#39; and they were not good at all. Every single one of them had a fatal flaw. The tacos we had were the bork belly (WAYYYY too salty), Crab Cake Special (unflavorful and also a bit too salty...very one note and that one note was salt), Fried fish w/coconut custard (the flavors here did not marry, the fish itself was decent, but the coconut overpowered it so it tasted heavy). On all of the tacos, the tortillas were so dense they reminded me of pitas more than tortillas. We also had the shrimp &#34;shared plate&#34;, which was tiny and oddly flavored (not Mexican) and the chicken soup with mole, which was so heavy and greasy it made my palate feel violated.The Drinks: The Mescal Mule tastes like someone put a cigarette out in the drink (SOOO gross) and the tamarind drink was so overpowering it ruined the essence of the tamarind rather than celebrating it (Think giving someone who has never had an orange before being given one of those orange slice gummys as a representation of the fruit), I fear that I will have trick my boyfriend into trying it again.Bill: The table next to us was over charged on their bill and had to point it out to the server. The same thing happened to us. Looking at other reviews, it seems like this restaurants has a habit of overcharging customers for things they ordered and charging them for things that they did not order. In our case they brought over a complimentary chocolate dessert (which was gross) and then CHARGED US for it and a few other things. This is outrageous and quite frankly seems intentionally (since they&#39;ve clearly gotten the feedback that this is a problem via yelp reviews).I will certainly not be back (Big Star is too close anyway), but if you do, I strongly recommend that you ask for separate checks in a large group or look at your bill with a magnifying glass before paying."

The drinks were yummy- definitely get their special cocktails.Service- Everyone was kind and cheerful! But they were also slow. Food came to the table very slowly (some people were done eating when others just got their food) and getting the bill was such a long process.

The place was only half full. So, if you are looking for last minute dinner plans with no wait, this is a good option. They have a little outdoor seating section that works well for large groups since they are pretty much like picnic tables. Very low-key, casual atmosphere they&#39;ve got going on.I had the cucumber margarita, which was nice and refreshing and not overly sweetened. The elotes is really good, but the cost is pretty steep at $5 for one ear of corn. I would pass on the salsas. It was more like a puree. I would&#39;ve liked them more if it had more texture and was chunkier. We had the tomatillo pistachio and the tomato hibiscus ghost pepper, which wasn&#39;t even hot. The masa crackers had cute luchadore  mask imprints of on them, but I would have preferred something lighter and less dense to eat with the &#34;salsa.&#34; The barbacoa taco was my favorite and was the most flavorful. The crispy fish and the fried chicken taco were okay. And the alaskan king crab taco was very bland, skip that. I&#39;d like to add, these are the smallest tortillas I have ever seen.. ever. However, they do fit a lot of filling onto each tortilla. I was stuffed after 3 tacos."

We had a party last weekend and catered dinner for 28ppl from here. When the food showed up, they had sent the right number of tacos, but screwed up everything else - polenta, salad, salsa, squash, rice, chips - and sent food for 4 ppl, instead of 28 people.When we called, they acknowledged they forgot but would need a lot more time if we needed it still. With hungry guests waiting to be served dinner, we didn&#39;t have the luxury of a few more hours.Imagine the embarrassment of telling your guests at home for the birthday celebration that the food hasn&#39;t arrived. We had to scramble and find another Mexican restaurant, send some friends to pick up food from this other place, and somehow saved the day after much apologizing to guests. What a terrible fail.We took pictures of everything that had arrived and sent it to them. It&#39;s been nearly a week now, and they continue to say they made a mistake, and only sent 1 of the 6 items we ordered for 28 people, even confirmed we paid for 28 orders for all the items, but refuse to refund it. Really? After much push back, they offended us by saying they&#39;ll issue a credit for $75, after we&#39;ve spent $600 + $200 on this.I&#39;m not sure what else to do besides share this on yelp so others can be aware when dealing with this business. The owner has gone quiet since the first call where he admitted they got it wrong. The person in charge of catering is refusing a refund.It&#39;s sad, because the food here is great and I wrote a 5-star review a few months ago, and while mistakes happen and I understand that, the way they&#39;ve responded to this situation is dismal."

After trying to eat at Bar Takito last Friday night (no tables), my girlfriend and I decided to try their sister restaurant. We were able to get a table right away which was a nice surprise seeing as division street is usually banging on the weekends. Our waitress Erin was an absolute doll. We were asking her lots of questions and she was happy to answer all of them and walk us through the menu.Naturally we started with cockys: me, the regular marg, and my girl went with the seasonal marg which was citrus based + a hint of rosemary. Both were equally delicious and refreshing! For apps we ordered the tomato hibiscus ghost pepper salsa and the avocado pine nuts purée. I will say together they were yummy, but I don&#39;t think either of them could stand on their own. Esp the purée, not much flavor there (probably because we are guac fiends and this was the closest TK has to offer). Anyhoo on to our side dish: Three sister polenta. Oh dear god this was AMAZEBALLS. If you are dining at TK and passing on the polenta then you, my friend, are doing it all wrong. Such creamy, warm deliciousness, served up in a little bowl (see picture to TRY to do it justice). For our main dish we split an order of the crispy fish and the surf &amp; turf tacos. We enjoyed both orders very much. I will say the fish tacos had a mighty kick to them so beware if you fear the heat (then you best stay out da kitchen HAH). Also the tacos are S-M-A-L-L and definitely made to share.As previously stated it was a busy Friday night so our service was quite slow at times. Our server at one point delivered our apps to the wrong table. We didn&#39;t complain at all because we were enjoying each others company as well as our drinks...to our surprise, when the bill came, they comped us for the apps because we had to wait so long for them. How&#39;s that for customer service?! I would definitely return to Takito Kitchen and would be interested in trying their chicken and steak options. All in all, it&#39;s a great wicker park spot for yummy food and drinks:)"

Everyone was NICE but the service was SO SLOW. The food wasn&#39;t amazing either so I won&#39;t be back.I made a reservation on Open Table for 16 for 6:45 on a Wednesday and it was pretty empty when we arrived.They had our table ready and everyone was honestly so nice. The drinks were good.. I liked my seasonal margarita. We got the salsa trio and it came with these weird large cracker breads that totally don&#39;t make sense for the salsa. None of the salsas were that amazing and the huge cracker was weird. I think it&#39;s gluten free.We ordered a bunch of tacos and kind of did a switch to we could try a bunch. They are pretty small but I was pretty stuffed after 3. The lamb chorizo was ok but super tiny. The pork belly was delicious but pretty fatty so couldn&#39;t do more than one. The spicy fried chicken (Only Wednesday special!) was the best and biggest!They were really nice to take the birthday cake we brought for our friend, light the candles and cut the slices. The problem I had was when we got the bill. It was about a foot and a half long. Instead of grouping items to say 15 chicken tacos, 10 lamb tacos.. and so on, there was about 50 lines of 1 items. This made it IMPOSSIBLE to check the bill which I think they do on purpose. After everyone contributed what they ate plus tax and tip we were short! I just didn&#39;t like that they don&#39;t make the bill easier to read so we can verify it."

She made great drink recommendations and was willing to swap our drinks if we didn&#39;t like it.Whoever the guy was that was bringing out our plates was a f-ing dick. He would call out what was on the plate and we were telling him where to put it so we all had the dishes we ordered. He comes at us with something along the lines of  &#34;you better get used to sharing plates so just start eating. These dishes are meant to be shared.&#34; Uh, we&#39;d like to actually eat what we ordered. And why even tell us what&#39;s on the plates? Just set everything down if it doesn&#39;t matter. What if certain people are vegetarians or allergic to something? This dude pretty much seemed like he hated life.

I came here for brunch and tried the chicken mole sope. The mole was delicious and I loved the spices they used. It was also topped with two eggs sunny side up because, well, it&#39;s brunch! The sope was like a thicker version of a corn tortilla. Nice and crisp. My friend had the pork belly sope and OMG, it was amazing. I had a bite and my mind was blown. I must have been drooling just watching her eat so she offered me some more. It was tender, made with ghost peppers and had a nice kick to it. Definitely not too spicy so don&#39;t be afraid to get this.We had an awesome server who suggested the polenta. I&#39;m not a fan of grits or that grit-like texture but their polenta has converted me. Super creamy from the cheddar and you can&#39;t go wrong with smoked bacon sprinkled on top. The hibiscus agua fresca was really refreshing and not florally at all. Overall, I thought Takito offered really good modern mexican food and if your looking for something different than your typical brunch places, give this place a try."

The owner walked over to serve and greet us and explained that the tortillas were freshly made. The fish taco was savory and sweet with a silky coconut curry beneath the crispy fish. However, the Lamb Marquez, apparently a staple item of Takito, was exhilarating. Perfectly balanced with some Wisconsin cheese. I can&#39;t say enough. The Tamarindo cilantro margarita was excellent. A ghost pepper tomatillo salsa was nearly overshadowed by 2 staples of tostadas that were perfectly fried or baked for dipping. Service was just as well balanced as all of the meal. They knocked it out of the park. I&#39;ve eaten for this price point many times and been thoroughly disappointed, but not this time."

As expected, it was pretty busy. Hostess suggested we sit at the bar, they still served full menu, but it would be a wait for an actual table. We decided to sit at the bar.Service was great! Everyone was super nice and attentive. I had a mezcal mule cocktail, probably my favorite thing of the evening. We had the salsa trio to start and the hearts of palm salad. Salad was a little bit over dressed, but at least they had lots of pieces of hearts of palm--I appreciated that! The salsas were good too, unique flavors. Just a little bit on the runny side. Personally, I prefer my salsas a little bit chunky.We also had the fish tacos and the beef barbacoa tacos. Fish tacos I later found out were tilapia. Meh, I could do without tilapia. They were pretty big pieces of fish though and they were really crispy, which was nice! At least they weren&#39;t soggy or greasy. The beef barbacoa also left me wanting more. Flavors were good overall, but I feel like I&#39;ve just had better tacos elsewhere.I&#39;d probably come back and try some of their other menu items though. They had lamb tacos and daily specials that sounded pretty good!"

They excel at both craft tacos and their brunch menu. I&#39;ve tried the pork belly, steak, fried fish, and specialty short rib tacos - all are wonderful. We were even comped a vegetarian taco (cheese), which I actually enjoyed! I generally despise vegetarian food that isn&#39;t Indian... For brunch, I tried pork belly sope, which was the bomb.Place has great cocktails, as well. For brunch, try the bloody maria. The cucumber and pineapple margs are also great.Place is a bit pricy, but they consistently offer Gilt City vouchers which make it a lot more reasonable. Friendly staff and service, as well."

Walk in and you&#39;re greeted with an open bar topped with filament light bulbs, geometric chandeliers, and a lit up &#34;TK&#34; on the wall. We got there early for our reservation (two of the four people in our party) and were seated right away. Ordered the Cucumber Margarita, which was SO refreshingly delicious. Came with a huge slice of cucumber garnished inside the drink and a spread of spiced salt on half the rim. I lapped this up and would probably guzzle down a pitcher, if that was an option.For starters, we had the Shrimp Ceviche and Trio of Salsas. The Shrimp Ceviche was tasty. The shrimp was served whole, so it made it slightly difficult to apportion the shrimp to chip ratio appropriately. The Trio of Salsas included a tomatillo pistachio, tomato hibiscus ghost pepper (this one was my favorite), and a seasonal salsa. It came with your traditional chips (yum!) as well as a more doughy pita type cracker, which I wasn&#39;t a big fan of.The table thought it best to share tacos so we ordered the Alaskan King Crab, Maple Creek Pork Belly, Crispy Chicken, and Chorizo y Papas. The King Crab and Pork Belly are tied as my two favorites for different reasons. King Crab served on a taco was an unexpected form of presentation, but one that was most welcome! Similar to the ceviche, it tasted fresh and light, and also contained large chunks of crabmeat. Call me lazy, but any dish that serves King Crab without me having to crack open the shell, leaving your hands and nails stinking of what I lovingly call &#34;crabby hands,&#34; gets a gold star in my book. The pork belly was a smooth, melt in your mouth, smoky burst of flavor that was simply perfect. The Crispy Chicken and Chorizo y Papas were also delicious, but not nearly as memorable as the King Crab and Pork Belly. Loved the sauce on the Crispy Chicken. And the Chorizo y Papas was a little too heavy on the potatoes, and not so much on the chorizo, that it was difficult to fully appreciate those spiced sausage flavors.Only reason why it&#39;s not getting 5 stars is because the music was a little too loud. It was difficult to have a conversation across the table without feeling like you were shouting at your friends. So for that reason, if you&#39;re trying to get to know someone on a date, this may not be the best setting.However, the service was amazing and I wish I remembered the name of our server, but she was a sweet girl with fiery red hair. Super attentive, always had a smile on her face, and overall, had such an infectious aura of positivity. I&#39;ll definitely be back, if not for the King Crab and Pork Belly tacos, but also to try the Fried Chicken taco, which is only served on Wednesdays!"

This neighborhood has always a new place to discover. We have been around 4 times in Bigstar and we are in love with fish tacos, and Al Pastor, and Pork Belly.Well, with a new target in mind we decided to go to Takito. We couldn&#39;t be more satisfied! It is not that they are better than Bigstar, but the fusion style makes the tacos so exotic and tasty. We are quite understood when talking about tacos, and this place is now our first Taco&#39;s place in Chicago! We highly recommend it!It is perfect for friends, nice ambience, outstanding service! We had Crispy Fish and beef Barbacoa. Well, the first one is a mix of traditional mexican and Asian flavors, beautiful!

Their desire to understand why my experience was bad and how they could fix it is something that you won&#39;t see from a large restaurant group or chain.I quickly realized that this is a restaurant ran by local people who care about their customer, their vision, and their investment in a great dining experience.This restaurant is fighting a tough uphill battle, as a mexican food joint we have been preconditioned to expect lesser quality ingredients at cheap prices. Takito has gone to the other extreme of the spectrum and only serves locally sourced high-quality ingredients with little fanfare or promotion that most of their ingredients are supporting local farms. In addition to the source of its ingredients, it is a made from scratch kitchen (chips, tortillas, salsa etc.).When considering your typical mexican food fare, this place falls on the higher end of the price range but you also get what you pay for and can walk out of there not feeling like you just ate a bowling ball.This place is a modern mexican food joint placed in an upbeat atmosphere that is great for people who want high quality mexican food. I would definitely recommend this place before going out or to hang out w/ friend and socialize."

Well, I was already nearby for my kickboxing class, but still it was an effort!The three sisters polenta was a lot spicier than I was expecting... I really liked the coconut custard that was on the fish tacos, and the lamb chorizo tacos were better than I was expecting, since I normally don&#39;t go for chorizo. I would have totally ordered the caliente margarita but felt like I should save my calories.I actually ate dinner at their sister restaurant, Bar Takito on Friday night without knowing they were related (planned to eat at Takito Kitchen first), and one of the managers or employees saw me at both locations and comped us a cherry brandy rice pudding that was delicious! I kind of wanted to eat it all by myself. Overall great and attentive service.Would definitely recommend. Bit pricy at $4/taco, but the innovative combinations make it worth it to me."

Loved the ambiance and loved the open bar area and kitchen concept. We felt like we were at a friend&#39;s.Our server was equally as friendly and pleasant and made suggestions on the drinks and food menu and his suggestions were on point. They even gave us complimentary champagne to toast to Valentine&#39;s Day.We didn&#39;t know prior to coming in that they were owned by the same owner as Bar Takito in the West Loop, which we also love and is in our neighborhood. So now that we know, we&#39;ll definitely be going back to both and often! Not just because the tacos were amazing, ceviche was delicious, and the drinks were terrific, but primarily because of the service which you can&#39;t find everywhere. Loved our experience.

I only mention this because despite us not being big fans of the food, I always appreciate great service.) So we did try it out again. This time we skipped the brunch menu and got the fish tacos and the pistachio salsa. The salsa was still good, although it was better last time. The chips the salsa came in were thinner this time, which we really liked. The fish tacos were also good, but not GREAT. There was just something missing, but I don&#39;t know what. Maybe some more sauce or something. I don&#39;t know. We DID get our food at the same time though, so that problem was most likely a one time fluke when we were there before.

Their patio is small but quaint with several communal tables lit by glowing string lights. Even though the tables are communal they&#39;re not too overly invasive and I didn&#39;t mind sharing at all.We started out with their house margaritas which were reasonably priced and pretty good. They were nothing special but definitely strong enough and overall good.We wanted to have a long and relaxing meal so we opted to start with the salsa and escabache. I was a little skeptical of the masa and rice crackers in lieu of tortilla chips but they were delicious! I am a huge fan of their masa which they make in house each day and my friend loved the rice crackers (which are a great built in gluten free option). I also really appreciated our waiter brought over more masa and rice crackers without us even asking! The salsa and escabache were all really good, my favorite would have to be the tomatillo pistachio. I&#39;m generally a huge tomatillo fan but I loved how it was accented with the pistachio. It was also had a really great consistency.We were so full from the appetizers when it came time to order dinner we chose to split the grilled brunkow cheese tacos. They were awesome! The portion was just right and I loved the peanuty topping.The service was also pretty great at Takito. When we arrived the hostesses made sure we found a place we were comfortable with because of the bachelorette parties inside the restaurant. Additionally our waiter was a fixture at our table and never left us wanting for anything.The only thing I did not love about Takito was the layout of the restaurant inside, it&#39;s pretty long and narrow and I definitely preferred the outside to the inside.I&#39;d definitely recommend Takito if you&#39;re in the area."

The food/margaritas were 4 stars, the service was 2 stars. We had a group of 10 and the waiter did a pretty decent job checking on us throughout the dinner. Early on in the meal, however, the conversation somehow turned to my husband 5 years ago when he had facial hair, which no one believed. I gladly pulled out my phone to pull up a photo of him back in his bearded days and noticed I had no cell service, and neither did anyone else. My husband saw that they had wifi but that you needed a password. Realizing we&#39;re not in Europe I knew it was a long shot that they give this out, but my husband still asked the hostess, Katie, if she was able to give us the password. Katie, annoyed, proceeded to tell us how if they were to give out the wifi password to everyone then there wouldn&#39;t be sufficient service to operate the computers in the restaurant. I said &#34;I understand, it just seems that if the restaurant doesn&#39;t get cell service from any provider that you guys would have wifi.&#34; She sneered and in a patronizing voice said &#34;Sorryyyyy! Maybe you should talk with your friends!&#34; Uh, what!?Girl, you can hate people being on their phones as much as you want, but being in the customer service industry, you can&#39;t give people judgmental feedback about how they behave with their friends. I don&#39;t drop in to Longman &amp; Eagle when you and your friends are complaining about it being too hot and suggest that you guys take off your flannel shirts.All this aside the food was pretty good, the margaritas were awesome."

I had been hearing lots of great things about Takito so I made reservations via opentable for lunch.They have great lunch specials during the week. $12 gets you 3 tacos, smoked tomato rice &amp; escabeche salad. We started with the seasonal salsa that were served with housemade masa crackers. The crackers were good but I think the cracker to salsa ratio was a bit off bc the crackers were pretty massive and they gave a pretty small serving of salsa.If you&#39;re going to order anything, I would definitely suggest ordering one of their margaritas. They are AMAZE! loved the cucumber margarita!I really enjoyed the tacos too. I like how they have a &#34;modern&#34; take on their tacos and how they showcase seasonal ingredients in their dishes. The chicken tacos are great and I like how they top it off with pepitas. Would definitely recommend coming here for lunch! Will have to come for dinner sometime soon."

I am embarrassed, as a member of the food industry, when so many restaurants DON&#39;T house-make their prized menu items, but this place, without question, does. Sauces, pastas- everything.3) There are some off-the-wall things on the menu, but they exist because they are purely delicious, not for the sake of novelty, which is a painful trend right now.***Bravo, to the entire Publican staff!***Go there, branch out, prepare for a BUSTLING ambiance, and enjoy."

I like the atmosphere and the schtick but all in all, we weren&#39;t as impressed with the food as we expected. Side note - my friend had been there before and loved it however she wasn&#39;t a fan this time. Maybe they were just having an off night?The spicy sausage was excellent however the other four dishes we got were all very lack-luster (pickles, frites, shrimp ceviche, and apple salad). Maybe we just ordered poorly but for a $130 meal we both expected more."

If you ever even start to consider if you should go here, DO IT IMMEDIATELY. The seating is communal, which is such a fun concept. I loved it, and struck up a conversation with Daniel sitting next to me and got his opinion on the amazing ham section. It is loud, though, so if you don&#39;t like other people and if you hate talking loudly, you probably won&#39;t be comfortable here.Our table of 3 ordered a wide assortment of food: pork rinds, bread plate with pimiento cheese, fried sweet potatoes, suckling pig, and half a chicken. Oh! And the barbecued carrots. SO MUCH FOOD. The pork rinds are an absolute must. And the chicken is THE BEST CHICKEN I have ordered in a restaurant. Hands down. EVER. We ended the night with the sour cream pound cake.Please go. The experience and the food will definitely not disappoint!!"

Sat right near the bar. I really wish I could have sat closer to the kitchen, but all other seats were taken.Ordered a glass of cab to start the night off and the pig ear salad.Pig ear salad was super crunchy. I&#39;m talking LOUD, noisy crunch haha, you could probably hear me chewing through those things from a mile away. Very good on flavor I would have enjoyed less pig ear and more salad.For my entrée I got the sirloin steak and OMG it was the absolute best piece of beef I have ever eaten. So tender and perfectly seasoned. Even the onions and edamame it was paired with were amazing. I wanted to lick the plate, but resisted.This was the only place I had &#34;dessert&#34; which was actually a bread course served with hazelnuts, brie and jam. Very good but I should have skipped as I was already pretty full and left most of it there. Paired this with a Riesling.This was the cheapest of the three places I was set on dining at even with my glasses of wine.I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant and I&#39;d love another plate of sirloin right now, or whenever actually.Must try restaurant if you&#39;re in the Chicago area."

I&#39;ve been here many, many times for dinner, and it has yet to disappoint. However, Saturday brunch is a whole different story. Overall, my brunch experience here came out to be really slow and underwhelming.By the time our group got seated, we waited about 10 - 15 minutes before a server came to our table. After having taken our order, it took about 40 minutes before we got our starters! The waiter was unapologetic and nowhere to be seen even though it was really early for the start of the brunch service. Finally, the food was nothing special. I would expect a place like the Publican to go above and beyond but there was not one item that stood out as being really good. The mimosa was okay. The avocado toast was decent though could have used more avocado. The waffle was okay but had good honey butter on the side. The only thing that may have stood out is the bacon, if you&#39;ve never had thick cut bacon before; it had a nice texture and flavor.Overall, Publican brunch was disappointing. I don&#39;t know if it was because it was the Saturday, not Sunday, brunch service but there are so many better for brunch in Chicago. Publican dinner will always be a favorite but I&#39;d probably stay away from the Saturday brunch."

We were early for our PQM reservation so we came here for a drink first.You can choose a regular sit down table or a standing table, bar-like. We had about ten people and did a standing table since we weren&#39;t staying for dinner. Their drink menu is huge and spans two large pages. I got a cocktail with blackberry jam, lavender, mezcal, and another liqueur in it I believe, it was decent.It was a bit too noisy here for me otherwise it would be 5/5 stars."

I met a couple of adventurous-eating friends there for late night dinner.4 stars for atmosphere and service, 3 stars for food.I have to say overall, this place is slightly overpriced. The food was good but not like OMG FANTASTIC OUT OF THIS WORLD.We ordered the spicy pork rinds, the ham variety plate, chef&#39;s choice oysters, cajun sausage, and the cuttlefish ink pasta.Spicy pork rinds - &#34;A&#34; freaking plus. I would come back just for these. They have a slight kick to them along with a delicious white cheddar season. Crispy, light, fantastical.Chef&#39;s choice oysters - Great variety. Wish they could give some cocktail sauce and horseradish but I know, I know, it takes away from the flavor of the oyster, yada, yada, yada.Cajun sausage - Pretty legit. Not a huge fan of sausage myself, but my friend loves sausage, so she devoured most of the plate. I really enjoyed the creamed corn sauce they drizzled on top.Cuttlefish ink pasta - No go on this one. They offered to replace our dish because the pasta was SO SO SO SALTY. As in someone may or may not have spilled the entire contents of a salt container into making the pasta. They said it had something to do with the sauce reducing into the pasta throughout the night which may very well be true, but I feel like as far as quality control goes, it didn&#39;t make the cut. We didn&#39;t ask them to replace the dish since we were all so full and it was closing time. They did take the dish off the bill which I appreciated!Overall, I love the atmosphere of this place. It is great for family-style dining. I love to share and eat a variety of foods. Loved the decor and the lamps on the inside. Drink selection is also nice. Lots of different beers and a good number of cocktails to choose from. Great for large groups!"

Definitely admired the ambiance the whole time we were here. Funny story about the communal tables: Shawn C. and I ran here from our hotel because we wanted to get a morning workout in. Probably shouldn&#39;t have done that.. LOLAnyway, on to brunch. We shared the smoked arctic char scramble, bread pudding and a side of hash browns. Everything was good, but the bread pudding was TO. DIE. FOR. AMAZING! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! 10/10! Would order again! Get it, you must.My only gripe is that we had some of our leftovers packed up and they lost a sausage somehow.."

I loved reading the menu as it has a focus on fresh local vegetables and seafood... two of my favourite things plus an amazing dessert menu.  Clearly I was made to eat here!  Overall, the level of professional but warm service plus amazing dishes made it one of my places to eat.  The environment could be a bit quieter (it was LOUD) and the communal long table can strike up interesting conversation but also some side eye action from awkward interactions.  This is a small note compared to the amazing food coming out of the kitchen and the great service.As mentioned, the service is great... we had a phenomenal server.  Not only he managed a LARGE group that had 3 kids beside us, he took care of us as if we were his only table.  Never once did we see him ignore us. His interest in the dishes was infectious ... he shared what he loved and didnt love as much.  He was very honest on what were the hits in his opinion and together we built a great order that I loved.  Another great thing about the service is the staff cleared each dish and the empty plates never sat more than a few minutes.  Our water was always topped and our server knew exactly when to talk to us to see how the meal was going and when to order.  Overall... just great.We started with the bbq carrots (loved how they paired it with the pecans), tomato and burrata (my dining partner never had burrata before and he LOVED it.  The tomato had a vibrant flavour that paired well with the creaminess of the cheese), and hamachi crudo from Japan (this was good though it did seem a bit pricey for several small pieces but ... still very tasty).We had 2 fish dishes and wow... they were great.  We ordered the sea bass and skate wing. We were hesitant on the skate wing cause our server said it came boned in.  I&#39;m so glad we decided to go with it.  The sea bass was good but no where as excellent as the skate.  If you see skate on the menu... order it.  The meat comes off easily from the bones and whoever is doing the seafood in the kitchen... they are amazing.  Each fish was still tender and perfectly cooked and yet had a great sear on the skate.We ended the night with 2 desserts... blood orange sorbet and the deconstructed pavlova.  I love pavlova but their unique take had me scratching my head at first.  Still it was very good.  The blood orange sorbet though... oh that was very good.  Tangy, bright, and true to the fruit... it was just as good as the ones I&#39;ve had in Italy.Between the excellent skate, burrata and tomato dish, and blood orange... there was some definite highlights of the entire week.  With the incredible service, this made a clear winner for our week of dining."

My recommendation: go with a group of 2-6 people and take the waiter&#39;s suggestion of sharing 2 plates per person. Everything we had was amazing, especially the bone in pork chop, rillettes, apple salad and the SWEET POTATOES OMGGGGGGGG (I could have eaten the whole plate).

I had this place and Blackbird bookmarked (same owner) but decided to give Publican a try for my friends birthday. Everything was coming to place, right when the Lyft dropped us off to putting our name on the list and then finally getting seated. It was like that episode all over again.We came here around 7:45 and there was about an hour wait. They text you when your table is ready but I never got a text so around 9pm we showed up and voila, our table was ready for us. We were seated at the bar area, this place is pretty big but looked like it was hard to get a table since everything was full. I usually don&#39;t sit at the bar either but I was so excited to try this place that I didn&#39;t even care.Once seated, that&#39;s where we met our awesome waiter Will. This guys great!! He offered so many suggestions and was super attentive throughout our meal. We ordered the chefs selection oysters, the spicy pork rinds, the striped bass, dry aged New York steak, fried quail and the half charcuterie plate.What I love about Publican is that they change their menu daily. They also mention what farm their food is sourced from and they work with a set amount everyday. For instance, we ordered the dry aged steak but by the time we were seated, they only had a 21oz. Portion left. We also ordered two drinks, a Moscow mule and the &#34;legs that dance&#34; which has blackberry jam mixed in there, yum!Overall, the food was presented very well and it looked just as good as it tasted.Spicy pork rinds- perfectly crunchy and not too spicyOysters- Really freshCharcuterie- not bad, could&#39;ve done without a few of the meats but overall a good starterStriped bass- the sauce this fish was cooked in was to die for. Fish was super tender and it almost melted in your mouthFried quail- heavily breaded but very tender and the slaw they have on top is a must with the quail in every biteDry aged steak- Very tender but a salty for my likingOverall, I&#39;m glad I got to check this place off my list. Definitely want to try Blackbird the next time I&#39;m here but overall, all the staff are super friendly and the place had a very live atmosphere :)"

Luckily, we got a table right away! We were seated outside which was nice because it wasn&#39;t as loud as inside. We weren&#39;t that hungry so we only ordered 2 dishes: fried cauliflower and suckling pig. The fried cauliflower was surprisingly light; the batter didn&#39;t weigh it down at all. The suckling pig was a good portion to share. It was very tender and flavorful.  I recommend both dishes. Also, our server was very friendly and helpful. The Publican is a solid choice for a delicious dinner!"
the-publican-chicago,Mike M.,W2zno-nXaGa9Y2Au7L8wNA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,107,503,2uFEUIiMA9UFthdJqwI0CQ,4.0,2016-08-23,"I really hate to give a mixed review to such a highly regarded place, but I just wasn&#39;t wowed by the Publican when we went for Sunday brunch. Maybe I just have simple taste and don&#39;t appreciate the finer details of each dish because everything was just alright for me. My initial impression of the Publican was that it was basically a tribute to pork and beer, so I was expecting the dishes to be very hearty with heavy, meat dominated flavors.Food: One thing I love about going to a restaurant with a big group is that you can try a bite of a bunch of different things. So we pretty much ordered almost everything on the menu/Publican mimosa - I was a little hesitant because I thought the beer would be heavy and dominate the flavor, but this was actually pretty refreshing. You still got the boozy orange juice flavor, but not quite as sweet, which I actually liked more. The beer was very subtle, and actually complemented well with the fruity flavor.Pork rinds - I love pork rinds, and used to eat them all the time as kid since it&#39;s a popular Filipino snack. But something was just off about these. I liked the texture of the rinds, very light and airy and not dense/greasy at all. But that powder they dumped on top was a little weird. Some pieces were just covered in it and gave my mouth a dry, chalky feel. Not sure what was in it, but the flavor was way too tangy. I would&#39;ve probably liked it better if they didn&#39;t sprinkle anything on top.Waffle - Very light and airy...almost too much since it was to the point where it tasted like nothing. There wasn&#39;t any dominant flavor like vanilla in the waffle batter, and the honey butter was again too subtle in sweetness for me.French toast - I&#39;m more of a meat and potato guy, so I rarely order such fresh and fruity type breakfast items. Altogether though, I think the flavors worked well. Nice dense french toast as a base and then a very light creamy yogurt type sauce to bind everything together. It was topped with some nuts, peaches, and mint leaves. Overall a very refreshing bite.Pork shoulder - Probably my favorite dish of the meal. This is what I was picturing most of the items on the menu to be like. Just like any dish served with eggs, I smashed it all together to spread that yolk around for every bite. It was topped with some chimichurri sauce and crispy fried onions. Great dish.Frites - Basically normal fries with 2 fried eggs on top. I like fries, and I like eggs, but together it didn&#39;t create anything more than some plain fries sitting in a puddle of yolk. I feel like the fries needed any type of seasoning, and I needed something to bring it all together. There wasn&#39;t enough yolk to go around. Maybe some sort of dipping sauce like a garlic aioli would&#39;ve helped.Publican bacon - It&#39;s probably sacrilegious to not love this, but again I thought it was just aight. I swear I&#39;m no bacon snob, but I thought Au Cheval&#39;s side bacon was way better. It was basically thick cut bacon with a little syrup drizzled on top. Some parts were too lean where it had a jerky type texture. Overall, not the melt in your mouth type experience I wanted from succulent pork belly.Spoon bread - I wasn&#39;t exactly sure what this was. Was it a quiche? Was it some sort of savory cornbread? Either way, I thought it was surprisingly bland, especially since the menu said it contained bacon and parmesan cheese.Cajun sausage - By the time this came out, I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve already eaten 4 eggs haha. The sausage had a very subtle spice that tasted great. It also came with some grilled naan that was useful to soak up some of that egg yolk. Portion size was a little dainty though.Overall, none of the dishes were terrible, but none were memorable enough for me to rave about to other people either. The waiter made it sound like we over ordered, since we got 5 dishes for 5 people along with a bunch of sides. But I definitely left hungry since a lot of the dishes were actually small and only a few bites, just dressed up with a lot of filler garnishes. Maybe it&#39;s because I had high/different expectations coming in, but I was slightly disappointed with Publican&#39;s brunch."

We ended up ordering way too much!The sticky buns are a MUST for your side order. They remind me of a cinnamon bun but with the texture of a warm monkey bread. SO GOOD!The warm scones are also amazing, but I would skip this if you&#39;re not that hungry because it was very filling.The pork schnitzel was seriously one of the best I ever tried. There was the perfect amount of batter and perfectly fried - the pork was very tender and full of flavor. The fried egg and corn on top complemented it well.The crispy bread pudding was also soooo delicious! The sausage added a nice salty kick to the sweet bread pudding (made from French toast) and the peaches.I&#39;ll definitely be back the next time I&#39;m in Chicago!"

My mom and I ordered the fresh coffee, fresh orange juice, mimosa&#39;s(for her)and a smokey bloody mary(for me).  They ended up being fine choices, the coffee was exceptional (2 sugar lumps please) and the Bloody Mary ended up falling flat.We shared the waffle, avocado toast and maple bacon.  There are no words for the waffle other than outstanding.  The fresh apricot preserves were fantastic! The avocado toast was great with the egg poached perfectly.  The bacon was good but not great.  That was a little disappointing since everyone seems to rave about it, I&#39;ll give it a try again just to make sure it wasn&#39;t just an off day.  Service was great, our server was phenomenal and helped guide us through the menu and constantly checked on us and refilled glasses of both water and coffee.FYI a few tips before you go - the google maps directions do not bring you to the right address, it brings you over to the Publican Market across the street.  If you have never been here before that gets a little confusing since there is no signage on The Publican from any side other than on the front door. It&#39;s loud so you will have to pretty much shout at your partner sitting across from you. Also remember that while it&#39;s polite to say &#34;hi&#34; to your new table mates or stare at their food and ask them about it, it&#39;s not polite to actively provided feedback to their conversation."

My dinner at the publican was like drinking a dreamy cocktail or climbing a good hike - full of surprises yet so good that makes you tipsy! They just don&#39;t need any Michelin star to be sooooooo good.Publican as another successful venture of Paul Kahan, is a modern creative restaurant with solid options in seafood, pork and beers (recommend you to try their house-made beers while the cocktails are solid too). The space is big and open - high ceilings, big long communal tables inside and outdoor seating in the summer. Here are the highlights of our night:Mussels - SO FAT!! Never had mussels this big! The sauce was a killer too. It was rich, super creamy, and buttery with delightful white wine aroma. Four of us couldn&#39;t help but want more bread just to finish the sauce! The bread was delicious too - crusty outside and warm inside. I have to confess this is the best mussel dish I ever had. You just have to try!!Fried chicken - just the smell was driving me crazy... One bite - the crunchy sound and the burst of the flavor in my mouth made me forget about everything else... The meat inside is also flavorful and soft. Chewing them quickly released more flavors. The hot peppers and herbs also add nice kicks to the flavor!Clams with squid ink pasta - another solid dish! Clams are huge as well. Very well seasoned with herbs and spices. The squid ink pasta is thick and chewy. Very satisfying texture yet also absorbed a lot of flavors.Solid spot for food, drinks, and good vibes! Strongly recommended to anyone who&#39;s visiting Chicago in the summer (you can sit outside to enjoy the weather at the same time - can&#39;t be more perfect than this!). Just be aware of the lines - we waited ~1hr before getting seated on a Saturday afternoon."

This place is certainly worth it.  The restaurant does a great job at preparing dishes to serve 2 people. Perfect.We started out with the tuna sampler (we tried all 3: light, medium, and fatty). The best we have ever had, phenomenal and completely worth it. Incredible, and we are from Boston where seafood is at the finest. We also each tried 4 different selections of oysters which had our eyes rolling to the back of our heads, again we are from Boston.The apple salad was KILLER, KILLER!!!! Everything complemented each other so nicely; sweet, crunchy, soft, and crisp. The apples, burrata, mustard seed, shaved Brussels sprouts, and Parmesan are the best thing ever. EVER!We got the fried sweet potatoes which are out of this world and nothing you haven&#39;t tried in your life so you best be ordering.The pork chop was spectacular, I don&#39;t think I have said so many positive things about a meal. So much diversity that fits perfectly and creates the best flavors.Last but not least you will force yourself to make room for the waffle with ice cream, and if not you will walk away with regret because it is the icing on the cake. We got a waffle with rocky road ice cream and a waffle with toffee/pretzel ice cream because we didn&#39;t think we could share, and god damnit we were right. This dessert was my ideal dessert, size, flavor, abs sweetness.  There was nothing that wasn&#39;t perfect about this waffle.We also got the French press decaf coffee which has our eyes popping in disbelief on how smooth it was. Make sure to let it sit for 4 minutes.All in all this place is worth the wait, as an amid traveler this restaurant goes around surpassing expectations. #publicansquadonfleek"

You&#39;re bound to find a different experience here than at other places.PARKING: Street parking all around the block - free! May be difficult to find close by but you should be able to find street parking within a 1-2 block radius.MENU: Changes everyday! So even if you come by often, you&#39;ll probably be trying something different. This goes for their entrees. The sides and such stay the same (like the bacon - which is so thick its like ham).SEATING: We made reservations so we were seated immediately.  I can see how the line can be long for this place. We were seated at a booth which had barn-like door that enclosed you in the booth (that&#39;s different!). It was nice cause it was a little more private and we didn&#39;t notice much when people were walking by our table. The sun was a blazing when we sat down - fear not, just reach over and pull the lace curtains to cover the windows. There will be light but you won&#39;t get sunburned trying to enjoy your meal. There are also community tables and well as some standing tables too.The food was delicious! I wasn&#39;t all that stuffed, but it was just the right amount of food. We all ordered something different and enjoyed the meal! Hard to recommend entrees since the menu changes daily. Order whatever sounds good that day and come back next time to try something different!Our server was a-OK. We actually received the wrong menus (for the day before). He also looked hungover and kept touching this face/hair before setting other tables and touching plates, etc. That doesn&#39;t look sanitary??Bathrooms are located by the entrance. Communal sink with designated full bathroom stalls - large doors. Unique!Worth noting, they&#39;re opening up a restaurant at O&#39;Hare! This is great for those who have layovers and delays at the airport. What a great dining option! And a bar too!"

We wound up here, without reservation, and were immediately seated at 7:30 on a Tuesday. I found our experience here to be very hit or miss. The honeycrisp apple salad was phenomenal. I think if we&#39;d just ordered that, it would have been a five star review. Also fantastic was the white cheddar pimento cheese spread. The grilled sour cream pound cake was also quite good, although I found the creme fraiche ice cream didn&#39;t add anything and sort of took away from the rest of the dish. The fried quail was maybe two bites of meat, although the Texas-toast style bread and bed of corn were quite good (I probably would have been much more a fan of that dish if it had been called elotes and Texas toast!).On the more disappointing side, the spicy pork rinds were a let down. They were not particularly spicy and the spices did not seem to reach the rinds further down in the cup at all. They also tasted a bit stale, so they wound up mostly being crunchy flavorless calories. Also disappointing were the other bread sides - the butter tasted like when you&#39;d get at the grocery store, and the date and mint spread mostly just tasted like tomato sauce.I rounded up a star because our server was great. (I&#39;ve forgotten her name, a woman with short blond hair.) When a friend of mine expressed that she really wanted to try the summer sausage but wasn&#39;t hungry enough for the full fried chicken dinner that it came with, our waitress immediately offered to just bring us a side of sausage. It was springy and quite good, and I very much appreciated the gesture.I doubt I&#39;ll be back, but the price was moderately reasonable for the number of dishes we got to try (this worked out to about $30 a person including tax and tip) and no wait was great."

They make the menu up everyday so this review will probably be obsolete soon.Not knowing what to get, we trusted in our waiter Chad. He led us towards bbq carrots, hake fish, country rib and cauliflower. I would recommend the country rib and bbq carrots to anyone. The country rib is marinated in a chile lime sauce that words cant do justice to, this was our favorite dish.  The carrots have a bbq rub and then yogurt and dill, I didnt know carrots could taste like that.  The cauliflower has Parmesan cheese and is deep fried. The hake is an ordinary white fish but it was served in a really great sauce.  For desert we got the small cookie jar, which ended up being more than enough.We sat at a communal table and it was really difficult to hear anyone speak but the food and service were outstanding."

There is community seating centrally, with stand-up tables scattered around. The outer seating is booth seating enclosed by swinging doors. The menu is seasonal and interesting. We went for brunch, which filled up quickly after opening. The service is pretty speedy too. We had the porchetta sanwhich, which is this amazing pork topped with pimento cheese spread on a brioche bun, topped with a fried egg. It was sooooo good! The chimichurri quail was a hearty meal, served with a good helping of cornbread, baked beans, and a poached egg. The crab scramble was delicate and the flavor of the crab shine through despite the other ingredients. It was served with buttery crunchy bread. We had a side of hash browns which were golden and crunchy, and I think they were better than the Waffle House counterpart. The Bloody Mary was quite spicy, so do ask to hold the tobacco if you aren&#39;t a fan of spice- they make their own mix and it&#39;s good by itself. Our coffee cups and water glasses remained filled promptly. This place is worth a visit! They take reservations so be sure to make one!"

It was great that they set us up across the street at their storefront rather than inside the restaurant, it assured us that service would be on point.There was a cheese spread accompanied with bread and their spicy pork rinds on the table for us to enjoy while waiting for the entire party to show up. The delice de Bourgogne was my favorite cheese, the manchego was good too.- grilled octopus: nice slight char taste, and wasn&#39;t too chewy..great texture. Easily my favorite dish of the night- mussels: good flavor, but the mussels lacked a nice texture. It just crumbled once I put it in my mouth- pork belly: obviously! Very tender..a must for pork belly lovers like myself.- creme fraiche bread pudding: not overly sweet but a little heavy since it is a bread pudding. Would&#39;ve been great with vanilla ice cream!Overall, it was a lovely dinner meal. Good food, and good service. Thank you, Publican!"

I would recommend calling in to make a reservation to secure your spot since this place is quite popular especially during the weekends. One thing to keep in mind is that your experience here will involve communal dining. Basically everyone is seated together at a long table. If you have a party of two, you and your friend will be seated next to strangers on either side. This took me by surprise since I was not expecting to be sitting so close to other people that I could hear their conversations. The communal dining aspect made my experience a bit uncomfortable but looking back, it wasn&#39;t too terrible.My friend and I ordered the duck confit and avocado toast to share. The flavoring of the duck was decent. Perhaps it was a bit salty for my taste, but it was enjoyable. There was nothing too memorable about the dish, however. As for the avocado toast, it tasted as avocado toast should. Again, there was nothing too memorable but I did appreciate the hints of lime that peeked out through the creaminess of the avocado.I was a bit disappointed in my meal at The Publican, but perhaps my expectations were too high. Brunch was tasty and enjoyable, but it was nothing special that would cause me to come back in the future."

It was a prefect night so it worked out great!The food was delicious. For such a meat-centric place it was actually the avocado salad that really stood out for us.

I love this place! I could sit here all day eating everything on the menu! This place felt like home. The service was impeccable, cheese was amazing and meats were delicious!Indoor and outdoor seating is available which is key for the unexpected weather in Chicago.This restaurant is located in a mixed neighborhood...business district meets hip new restaurants that will leave you wanting more. I wish I had more time to visit a few other places nearby.As a foodie I can appreciate the chef that is constantly changing the menu and working with the seasons for ingredients. As a lazy a## I love looking thru pics on Yelp to find out what looks amazing so I can just order that!  However, sucks for me when I find out I can&#39;t order the Crab scramble with cream fraiche because it is no where to be found on the menu! Pure agony! Lol. Yes I&#39;m being dramatic but damn that looked so good!!My favorite meat and cheese board should always come with at least three different cheese options, some kind of spread or jams, pickled veggies, honey, soft bread and a ton of Prociutto! The cheese board was perfect as soon as I added the Prociutto! I wanted to sit there all day eating my cheese drinking Chandon splits for $5 bucks!! It was a perfect afternoon on the patio.The sausage plate was tasty too. They offered three different sausages chicken, spicy chorizo and blood sausage. It was served sautéed in a green mojo sauce, potatoes and cheese definitely worth tasting.Can&#39;t wait to see what&#39;s on the menu during my next visit to the Windy City!"

The experiences were so different, had I been more unfamiliar with the decor, I wouldn&#39;t even have known they were the same restaurant.The dinner: beautifully rich, dark, and loud. We had a party of 6 with a majority mid-career physicians so money was really no issue..that being said, we ordered nearly everything on the menu + about 7 bottles of a beautiful red wine. Everything was rich, and bold. The menu changes from time to time so I won&#39;t bore you with the irrelevant things we ordered, but I can assure you there were good, but so heavy and much of it consisted of bacon complements. I almost fell asleep at the table..but that could have been the wine. Due to our party size, we sat at a communal table, which I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of. We did have to shout at times just to communicate, but all in all, a fun night.Brunch: while dinner was rich, dark and loud, brunch was unexpectedly bright, slow and mellow. I had a smoked fish omelet, which was good but questionably worth the $18 I paid for it. Service was slow and seating was similar. Echoing other reviews of frustration, our reservation was at 1 and we weren&#39;t seated until 1:40. Kind of puts a damper in the brunch. It was okay but I won&#39;t be jumping for joy at coming back anytime soon."

The tables along the back wall are designed like pig pens with a wooden panel to enclose the table. Fun!The food was alright, but nothing memorable. We ordered the cuttlefish ink pasta with clams, the bouchot mussels, and the avocado salad. But thought everything was too salty and the portions were on the small side.Plus, it was too loud &amp; dark for me.

Having made this reservation weeks and weeks in advance, we were excited to finally try publican. My in laws flees in town and we were celebrating my MIL&#39;s birthday. After checking in for our 7:45 reservation (at 7:45) our hostess told us a table was being cleared off and they&#39;d come get us momentarily. We were happy to wait a few minutes and stepped aside to admire all of the James beard awards on the wall. After fifteen minutes i was a little concerned and after THIRTY minutes past our reservation with plenty parties having arrived after us being seated, we approached the hostess to inquire what was going on. She replied that &#34;I&#39;m going to be really honest with you, we&#39;re just running really late on our reservations so you&#39;ll just need to wait.&#34; .......ok. Now we were annoyed. After FORTY FIVE MINUTES we walked out and left. I have never been kept waiting that long for a reservation!!!! I was so disappointed, as I had talked it up to my in laws about how fabulous this place was supposed to be only to be stranded at 8:30 on a Friday night with no reservations.. yikes.

Tall backed chairs, standing room in the middle, back wall has closed door stable seating which I&#39;ve never seen before.Three of us ordered the smoked brisket on a biscuit, topped with a fried sunny side up egg. Flavors were popping but as with all brisket, there was too much fat for my taste. The others ordered chicken liver pâté, mushroom toast, sausage, and a combination of the following:Pecan sticky bun-- deliciousCinnamon streusel coffee cake was ok, big slice.Meyer lemon old fashioned doughnut was alright, donut hole on top.Pork belly bacon is worth mentioning, charred just a bit for smokey flavor.Frittes under fried eggs. Interesting.Unlimited coffee $3, everyone else opted for it.Water refills consistent, no drought in Chi town.No complaints on service, nice people they&#39;ve got there, if not a bit on the quieter side where they&#39;ll speak minimally to give you privacy.

The bread plate was pretty meh.  Cold bread with very ordinary hummus and butter for $11.  I wouldn&#39;t get it again.We sat at a &#34;pig pen&#34; for dinner which was pretty awkward service-wise.  Our server wasn&#39;t very friendly and some things fell off plates when they were brought to our table."

The chicken pate was also super delicious as it had pickled shallots hidden inside the pate as a surprise. Sadly, the porchetta was sold out during our visit; thus we had to opt for the mussels instead. The mussels had very generous servings and tasted above the standard boring mussels from other restaurants. Country rib was superb while in my opinion the dry aged sirloin felt like a salad dish with some small chunks of sirloins being sprinkled here and there as a decoration. Fulton mess is a perfect ending to the meal.The only minor issue I had about Publican is the deafening level of noise that may not allow for any conversations with your friends or dates.

Woah. I don&#39;t know what it was, but it was seriously the best coffee of my life. It was flavorful. Strong not too strong. Whatever it was, I couldn&#39;t get enough of the stuff. My sirloin was great, like better than most, but man that coffee.My one complaint was the service: our waiter was nice, but didn&#39;t come around much, and same with the guy who refilled water and coffee. I ran out of my delicious nectar of the gods coffee, and it took what I thought was too long to flag someone down. Even when I did, he forgot, and I had to get my waiter and ask him. What&#39;s the point of bottomless coffee if you can&#39;t even get refills?Not sure if publican meats has the same coffee.

But if you prefer to stand instead of sit, maybe you can ask for those?I came in for brunch and the place was popular. There were seats open, but I would call and reserve your spot just in case.I tried a few things here for brunch. Their Bloody Mary was good. It comes with pickles, onions, and other things. It&#39;s nice and spicy. It was one of my favorite Bloody Marys.Their Publican Mimosa was interesting too. I never thought combining Wheat Beer with Orange Juice would be tasty. But it was.For the entrees, I tried their Thai Fried Chicken. It comes with a Sunny Side up egg and thai sweet chili sauce. The skin was nice and crispy. The meat was juicy.

This gem was located about a mile from downtown, a short Uber ride away and what we found was absolutely magic.Upon entering we found ourselves in a very rustic type atmosphere, that was reminiscent almost of stables of yesteryear. There&#39;s a lot of exposed wood, some actual stable appearing booths on the left side of the restaurant, and some very fun bench seating that is accompanied by some counter height tables to stand out while you&#39;re waiting for your food to come. It&#39;s very conducive to conversation and is very laid back!The food we had here was absolutely unreal. The pork belly, disguised on the menu as bacon, was glazed in maple syrup it was absolutely incredible. The coffee was delicious and was accentuated by the oddly shaped sugar cubes which were just delightful. In life, it really is the little things. My wife had a barrel aged black tea that was absolutely out of this world. We&#39;re fans of all things barrel aged at this point, and this is the first time we actually come across a good barrel aged tea. Little bit different flavor, but served hot, it was absolutely perfect.The food here stood out among many of the places that we&#39;ve been to recently. My wife had the red wine poached eggs which was reminiscent of eggs benedict crossed with purple eggs. It was basically the most delicious Dr Seuss book ever! I had the spoon bread for the recommendation of our server and it was absolutely amazing. It was like cornbread and grits had a baby that contained all of their best features. Sort of reminiscent of a soft quiche, with the cheese and bacon dwelling within. It was absolutely fantastic! Pair that with the aforementioned bacon and delicious beverages, and you&#39;ve got the place we want to go to every weekend.If you live in Chicago, you&#39;re lucky to have this place close by. If you don&#39;t live in Chicago and ever visit there, you should probably make this one of your stops. The meat shop across the way is a great way to finish up the morning and get yourself some delicious animal for the ride home."

It has been 7 years since my husband and I visited the Publican and I think it&#39;s even better than it was when it first opened. I did not love sitting at the community table, but it ended up being okay. We had a ton of food - standouts were the pimento cheese, pork rinds and fried sweet potatoes. Everything is top notch, down to the soap at the bathroom sink."

We arrived early and stood around in the middle area enjoying our spicy pork rinds. It&#39;s been awhile since we were here so I don&#39;t remember specifically what else we had except the bacon which was so good and strong coffee.Service was attentive even with how busy it was. My only complaint was the communal table we sat at. The seats were so close together and I barely had any elbow space. It gets really loud in here and I definitely could not hear what my dining partner was saying.

Highlights included the Serrano  ham and the little gem salad. Portions for meats and charcuterie are offered in half-size or full portions, and the half-sized Serrano serving was enough to fill us both up.Plus, if you try something and can&#39;t get enough of it, pop over to Publican Quality Meats across the street to grab some for home!"

And yes... That was the start of great decisions that I made that day at the Publican. This place was packed at 11:30 am on Sunday so I would advice you to make a reservation. Their waiting area/bar is right in the middle of the restaurant which, being different, just didn&#39;t feel right. But I didn&#39;t have to wait too long as my reserved table/booth was ready. And yes, I love that the booths have doors! Waiters were attentive and efficient and knowledgable which really helped with picking a great brunch pick. I went with the chicken and dumplings which didn&#39;t seem a lot, but was surprisingly filling. It came in a shallow soup plate. Trust me- even though it might have looked ordinary, it has flavor and warmth to hit the spot on a very cold Sunday morning!I paired that dish with their Burton&#39;s maple syrup-braised Publican bacon, and that took that meal to a whole new level. I could try to describe the two chunks of pork belly coated with the maple syrup sweetness but I would fail to do justice to that side dish. I have taken pictures of it but honestly, it was so good, that I walked across to the Publican meat market just to get those chunks of pork belly so that I can try to cook them myself!All in all, it&#39;s a cozy place (for brunch at least) with great options and with great service! They do have valet parking, as well, if you don&#39;t want to deal with trying to find a spot."

There was a flavor (orange rind?) In there that I didn&#39;t like.Had the steak with cucumbers and polenta.  It was..good.  The steak was cooked to perfect temp and very well seasoned.  The polenta was luke warm at best and although yummy... all around was just lacking something.  I don&#39;t know..Hell, I&#39;m not a chef.  I don&#39;t know the chefs intention and like I said..it was...good.I just didn&#39;t leave saying..Oh F*CK YEAH!!

Mind you, the location that we ultimately sat in was unoccupied the entire time we had been waiting. Fine... You have this fancy vibe. I get it.

The only course that was large (our entree) was the chicken which is listed on the menu for $35. Every other course was normal size as if a diner had just ordered off the menu. I believe this place is known for pork... No pork dish of substance was served (I&#39;m sorry chicharones don&#39;t count).So we got a total of 11 courses which averages out to about $29 a course ($65 x 5 people = $325 / 11 course)I&#39;m sorry... But that&#39;s a total rip off. I&#39;m not poor, I make money, and I spend money. If you&#39;re going to charge me $29 for a plate of carrots, chicharones, eggplant, beet salad, or dessert. Something is off here. This doesn&#39;t seem to me like a chefs menu. It sound more like a business owner trying to capitalize.This all being said, the dining experience was nice and the food was tasty but not worth the price tag.I did not see the progression in our meal...

I had red wine poached eggs which were incredible. It came with a side of prosciutto which was yummy, but I wish it was integrated into the dish.

We ordered way too much food or possibly just a combination of too many heavy dishes as we were stuffed even before the last course came out. Here&#39;s a breakdown of what we ordered:- Frites and Fried Eggs: Okay dish, pretty much exactly as described.- Chicken Liver Mouse with Toast: This is the dish that destroyed our appetite for the rest of the meal...there was so much bread, probably 5 giant slices. I think we were expecting like small crostini slices. Value wise it was very good :P- Fried Cauliflower: This was my favorite dish of the night. I&#39;m a huge meat lover so I wasn&#39;t super excited about this one when we ordered it. But it was a pleasant surprise and oh so good. The batter is light and airy and the sauce added great flavor.- Scallops: Solid dish, but they need to do a better job of cleaning the scallops as it was a bit grainy.- Guinea Hen: The sauce was absolutely phenomenal for this dish (I think it was fava bean based) The guinea hen was cooked well and was served with some delicious, tender sausage.Service here was attentive and friendly. Bathrooms here are interesting, there&#39;s a vestibule that opens up to multiple dual gender stalls and in the middle there are communal sinks. Overall, I had a pretty good experience here, but I think we could&#39;ve done a better job ordering. So I would love to come back sometime and try some of their other dishes, particularly some more vegetable dishes since the cauliflower really surprised me."

I had a reservation for 4 people at 11 am and we were seated immediately upon arrival. The restaurant is one giant room with lots of communal tables and even some standing tables for drinks. We started with a round of orange juices and coffees. OJ was only $3 which was great; I don&#39;t know when it became acceptable to charge 5+ dollars for OJ like so many other places do.Anyway, collectively we ordered the brisket, the panchetta sandwich and the waffle. The waffle looked really light and fluffy and was probably the cheapest entree on the menu. The panchetta sandwich (my order) was great. I suggest putting the egg inside the sandwich and then just eating it with a fork and knife. Every bite had a great mix of egg, grilled bread and panchetta along with whatever sauce was on it. The dish even came with a nice little arugula (I think) side salad. Both my friends who got the brisket said it was also really good.Price point is a little high for brunch, but given the location, and the exceptional quality of the food, I left the Publican feeling very satisfied!"

Hands down one of the best places I&#39;ve ever eaten in Chicago.It&#39;s easy to make reservation here and the waitress are really helpful. I love the concept of communal dining tables and how everyone just shares their food.Uniquely decorated. Reminded me of LACMA.Definitely get their oysters! They have a great selection from both coasts (shoutout to sea cow)This is the order of four hungry Asian girls:Apple Salad (4.5/5):Hmm those ham and shreds of moist mozzarella in this salad just upped the game. I love how there&#39;s a wide range of texture in this salad: from the crispness of the apples to the softness of the cheese and ham.chicken liver pâté (5/5):--Slagel Family Farm, Fairbury, Illinois | strawberry jam &amp; ciabatta--$12The best chicken liver pâté I&#39;ve ever had. The idea of putting strawberry jam on top of it was absolutely brilliant. In addition to the smooth chicken liver you also get the pop of strawberry seeds and a sweet scent. The bread was also delicious, soft on the inside and the crust was not hard to bite into (unlike many other places that have breads impossible to chew)pork belly (4.5/5):Wow! I was not expecting pork belly to be a little crispy on the outside. This is a sweet take on pork belly but I loved it because it was not overwhelming greasy.country ribs (5/5):--Slagel Family Farm, Fairbury, Illinois | bosc pear, dandelion green, hazelnut &amp; spring onion vinaigrette--$28Also the best ribs I&#39;ve ever had. Juicy. Medium rare. Flavorful. There were lots of veggies on top of this dish. But whatever the meat itself was really good.farm chicken (the chicken, 5/5; the sausage it came with, 1/5):--Slagel Family Farm, Fairbury, Illinois | half chicken with summer sausage &amp; frites--$27BEST CHICKEN EVER. I&#39;ve never eaten a chicken that has such strong flavor (i&#39;m not talking about overly salty), but also you can taste the herbs within the chicken. It was also amazing how juicy this chicken is. It almost didn&#39;t taste like chicken anymore because the meat was so densely packed together.However, the sausage that it came with was horrible. The skin was impossible to cut through and it was really salty without anything add on to it.The fries was good though. Mushy inside but crispy out. Wish they had ketchup or something else that came with it.porchetta (4/5):--Slagel Family Farm, Fairbury, Illinois | rosemary, farro, baby turnip &amp; fava bean--$33Porchetta came at last but was also a little disappointing. The porchetta was a little on the dry side. It was juicy and savoring but nonetheless lacks the dimensions of flavors like the others had.waffle (5/5):--honey butter &amp; berry preserves--$10Their waffle is perfect to my standards. It&#39;s light. It&#39;s thin. It&#39;s crispy. Smothered with soft honey butter and some jam, it&#39;s heavenly in one bite. Please please please order this.apple crisp (3.5/5):--cinnamon toast ice cream {family-style}--$16Hm this is quite a disappointing dessert. I could not handle the amount of granola found on top of it. Also beware of the cinnamon toast ice cream. They *do* mean cinnamon toast as you&#39;ll find pieces of actually toasts with cinnamon inside of the scoop. The apple chunks were homey and cinnamon-y."

Also had the red wine poached eggs, which was a different combination of flavors I&#39;m not used to that just went together really well. Also, we had the fries, which were decent, the scone, which was actually really good, and the bacon, which was also really good.

Definitely my favorite of the meal.Olive oil cake: Light, fruity flavors with just a hint of sweetness from the what I believe was whipped ricotta.Duck confit: Probably the weakest of the three. Overall, it wasn&#39;t bad-- I loved the addition of a sixty minute egg. However, I felt like the ratio between the pinto beans and duck was a bit off--the sauciness of the beans overwhelmed the duck.My only qualm with my experience was the seating--the large, communal tables made for cramped seating, and sitting so closely to others made it difficult to hear conversation."

Get frilled squid someplace like Tac Quick if you want to taste what delicious grilled squid with a kick-ass sauce tastes like.The sausage, blah. The cheesey stuff that accompanied it was pretty tasty.The suckling pig, little bits of pig parts in a too-sweet broth. Not enough pig parts to even conjure up a suckling pig image. Just dreadful, if you&#39;ve ever actually had suckling pig.Farm chicken, not bad, but not good. Fries, a joke. If your fries can&#39;t even compete with a decent hot dog place, why even bother? Also, definitely not &#34;frites,&#34; at least in my view. And the summer sausage, we both tried it, then left the rest. Like a bad, tough hot dog? We had trouble cutting it with our knives. Again, why bother?I&#39;m happy to be the one-star review among the way higher, way more effervescent reviews."

We have ordered meat and cheese to go and this was good.  Not worth it for the expensive sit down dinner.
the-publican-chicago,John K.,kO30XR2WeF6bla6dK1ZZLw,"Philadelphia, PA",1,1,1,207,548,oA_43QtewQid2R4JBx1f7A,2.0,2015-09-22,"Check out the blog for more details!------After having visited Alinea the last time I was in Chicago, I knew I had to try one of Paul Kahan&#39;s restaurants this time around. Chef Kahan&#39;s a compatriot of vaunted Philly chef Marc Vetri, likely rooted from being in the 1999 James Beard Award Best New Chef class. Kahan has a veritable Chicago empire with the lauded Black Bird, Avec, Publican Quality Meats, and of course, the Publican, just to name a few. The fact that other well-established chefs are using PQM meats for their menu speaks volumes; clearly the Kahan family&#39;s dedication to quality butchery and charcuterie is on point.2014 George T. Stagg Antique Collection [$20]I was able to enjoy a nice pour of the 2014 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection - Stagg to be exact. FYI - the 2015 collection is already popping up across the nation! This was quite the treat - straight out of the barrel, uncut, and unfiltered. Neat was the way to go, with smooth toffee notes that lent way to an ineffable sweetness, though with an undeniable kick that hits you to the back of your throat from the spice and the barrel-proof strength. On the finish, there were nice notes of fruit, coffee, and raisin.Madai Snapper Crudo [$18]Tsukiji Market madai, habazi spice, apple, mintAnd with my first taste, I was sold. Snapper from Tsukiji? You can&#39;t fault the sourcing. Technique takes care of ensuring the snap and texture of the high-quality fish. But the true star for me? The crudo was incredibly seasoned. The salt really opened up the palate while also allowing you to taste the accents to the fish. The herbaceousness of the mint balanced the unoffending undertones of the Shabazzi oil, with the bright tartness of the apple really coming through on the forefront with a bit of acidity. I also appreciated how the Shabazzi coated the tongue - light and clean. Amazing.Porchetta [$33]Slagel Family Farm, roasted clams, corn, pea tendrilsThe Publican is often described as pork paradise. I can see why. In addition to providing hefty portions of both the wrapped loin and the gorgeously unctuous yet crisped pork belly exterior, the accompanying elements to the dish were clearly carefully thought out. The Korean in me heard the call of bosam. I mean pork and bivalves? Yes, please! The sweet clams also had an innate salinity that accented the notes of sweet corn and hits of salt from the pork. The broth was light when compared to the rest of the dish, but also worked to heighten the heft of the dish especially when the cream sauce melded in. The potatoes were slightly crisp on the outside, but lent way to perfectly roasted innards.The Publican - PorchettaBut in the end, it is all about that pork. The loin was moist and meaty. The belly portion? A contrast in crisp and gluttonous textures with everything I love about pork belly coming through. Admittedly, it might be a bit much for some and may be better shared. But for me, there was no sharing. From first bite to last, I knew I had a smile with each forkful. I am still talking about food, right?How could I possible top the last bite? With the last dregs of BTAC Stagg of course, real deal whiskey sediment included. Happiness.Butterscotch Pudding [$11]Vanilla cream, cashew brittle, oatmeal cookiesAnd for someone who doesn&#39;t have much of a sweet tooth, the extreme heft of the porchetta called for some sweetness to balance out the palate. So I went with their butterscotch pudding, which offered light vanilla, which was a nice countervailing element to the nice hits of sweet and salty cashew toffee brittle. The pudding itself was the pure essence of butterscotch, with some levity. The oatmeal cookies had great texture and were incredibly buttery. Milk was needed. But instead ...Kyle&#39;s &#34;After Pork&#34; Digestif [$9]For obvious reasons, I opted to try chief mixologist Kyle&#39;s &#34;after pork&#34; digestif. Benny was kind enough to comp the easily quaffable concoction, which featured Cynar, dark rum, Chartreuse, and mint. With the rum providing a sweet substantive foundation, the light bitterness from the artichoke and herbal liquers made for a refreshing end to the meal. Very nice.Not only does the Publican have a strong pork program (that obviously extends to the rest of their menu!), but they also make sure to have high quality drinks and beers on offer. How many places do you know that have BTAC and Van Winkle 12 Year Special Reserve on hand this late in the season? And while the food and drink at the Publican is top notch, it&#39;s the service will earn my reco as the spot to go to if you&#39;re in need of the former."

After hearing raving reviews from others, I&#39;d have to say I was disappointed with the meal overall.Chef&#39;s selection of 12 oysters for $36 -- There were 6 types, all imported from different places (including Canada!). Although it was cool to try the various types of oysters, none of them really wow-ed me. The house-made saltines are a very nice touch though and a great palate cleanser between the oysters.Delicata Squash -- I love my sugar, but this was cloyingly sweet. I felt like I was eating maple syrup, so I couldn&#39;t even finish my portion. Would not recommend even to my worst enemies.Duck Hearts -- The pairing with dill cream sauce was very interesting. I enjoyed the texture of the heart over the bread!Squid ink pasta -- We were disappointed with the portion size and the flavor. There were barely any noodles and didn&#39;t taste as good as squid ink I&#39;ve had at other places. You&#39;re better off going to Eataly and buying your own squid ink!Pork with grits, cheese, and nectarine -- This was the winner that redeemed the meal. The pork was so tender and paired perfectly with the nectarine. Loved every bite of it! If I had to redo the meal I would just order a pound of this for each of us.I think I&#39;ll return for brunch to give The Publican another shot, but overall, the meal was &#34;meh.&#34;"

Deep dish pizza, chalk full of sausage and broccoli. Maybe for lunch tomorrow. But this is a meat city. There is only one place on my mind. The Publican. This is a place with only 4 pictures on their wall. Four large five feet by five feet pictures of gourmet swines. Pigs. Meat.Of course I start with hot spices fried pig skin. Pork rinds. Light. Airy. Not greasy. And washed down by great local Chicago beers. But then where to go?  Pork belly? Ribs? One of their five fresh hams?  Oh no. The waitor says go with the tongue. Beef tongue. I did. Wow.I have eaten a lot of tongue in my life. It started with my mom&#39;s pressure cooked boiled tongue as a kid. Not a favorite memory.  I have moved on to flavorful lengua (Mexican spiced) tongue tacos.But this. Tonight was the best tongue ever. Cubed. Pressure cooked. Slow roasted in maple syrup. And seared fast. And then topped with fresh greens, sweet tomatoes and chimichirri. So amazing. Everyone needs to try this tongue. With fresh spring peas. And a Saison beer from local brewery Moody Tongue (ironic, eh?).Come here. Order the tongue. Or whatever the waiter named Antonio tells you to order."

This is a really cool restaurant located right in the Fulton Market District. There are long tables that you dine at with the other guests, making it easy to socialize with some new people and scope out all the dishes as they come out. The high-backed chairs and tables built into the walls gave it a very Frank Lloyd Wright vibe.The food was stellar. I ordered the Red Wine Poached Eggs, which is one of two permanent items on their brunch menu. It&#39;s a permanent staple here for a reason! The dish is served with prosciutto, which really brings it to the next level! My boyfriend ordered the Pork Shoulder dish, which had a remarkable sauce, a healthy portion of pork shoulder, a fried egg and delicious potatoes. The hash browns are great too -- so crispy, which is just the way I like hash browns.For drinks, I ordered the Smokin Maria, which is a spicy tequila/Bloody Mary drink. It was spicy and breakfast-y... Just what I look for in Sunday brunch drinks!Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great Sunday brunch, just be sure to make reservations in advance, as it fills up quickly"

We had a great experience! We had 9 o&#39;clock reservations on a Saturday night and ended up waiting an extra 10 or so minutes because the table was finishing up dessert. The patrons I watched coming in were a bit older and wore fur (fur hats, shawls, coats)... Did I not get the memo? We were seated in a booth that was enclosed by short barn doors. I was delighted by the doors because the Publican is definitely a crowded place and it prevented anyone from bumping into to me. We had planned in advance to get the Chef&#39;s selection ($65) because going here was a one time deal and might as well maximize it.That night&#39;s chef selection came withSpicy pork rinds $6: 5/5 stars. They are so freaking good and addicting. The pork rinds were light, crunchy and had some sort of powder on them (methinks cocaine) which made the already delicious snack even better.Beets (quark, flax seed, walnut &amp; tahini dressing) $13: 5/5 stars. easily my favorite dish of the night. The beets were incredibly fresh and the dressing on them elevated them to amazing omg I need more beets in my life status.Oysters $12?: 6/5 stars Hands down the best oysters I&#39;ve ever had. The mignonette was delightful and served to enhance the flavor.Fried sweet potatoes (spiced honey, hazelnut &amp; labneh) $12: 5/5 stars. Slather honey on any fried honey and baby I&#39;m in heaven. They weren&#39;t greasy and it tasted like curry potatoes but OMG were they good.Sirloin (muhammara, date, sumac &amp; feta) $21: 4.5/5 stars. My piece was an end piece which made it a little chewy but the second piece was tender and delicious. The pomegranates were a nice touch.Roasted squash (fromage blanc,cherry, marcona almond &amp; crispy sunchoke) $12: 3.5/5 stars. This wasn&#39;t very memorable nor was it my favorite. Felt like a filler dish and I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to order it again.Striped bass (buttermilk, leek &amp; shabazi spice) $28: 4.5/5 It was so good! I love pungent fish and boy was this right up my alley. The leeks were delicious as was the sauce. It&#39;s not for anyone who likes it mellow and light and flaky.Duck hearts (pepper jelly, boursin cheese, persimmon &amp; multigrain toast) $14: 4.75/5 stars. The toast was really hard to slice through but it had a nice toast when biting into it. Duck hearts are so good, where have you been all of my life.Porchetta (fig, treviso, pecorino &amp; hazelnut picada) $33: 4/5 stars. The pork was fatty and tender a top a really yummy au jus. I would definitely order this again but was it in no way shape or form adequate as a single entree. *note the entrees should have ended here by the server noticed my sad, hungry face.Bouchot mussels (publican lambic, bay,celery, butter &amp; garlic) $16: 3.75/5 stars. This was an additional dish provided since my squad and I were still hungry. The mussels were tender and not chewy. The broth was really nice and light; it was the perfect vehicle for the delicious bread provided on the side.Pumpkin cake (brown butter ice cream pomegranate &amp; pear) $12: 5/5 stars. My favorite desert of the night. The ice cream was to die for. The pumpkin cake was light and fluffy and the sauce they smeared on the plate increased the pumpkin flavor. Definitely order this if you want a new spin on the oh so basic pumpkin flavor.Ice cream bombe (chocolate, peanut butter, pretzel &amp; caramel) $12: 4.25/5 stars. It would be 5 stars if the peanut butter ice cream wasn&#39;t so salty. The peanut butter ice cream was covered in a hard chocolate shell with a caramel drizzle on the plate and chocolate covered pretzels sprinkled on top. The caramel was perfect and my favorite component of the dish.Service: 5/5 stars. The wait staff changed out our plates after every other dish and my water was never more than 3/4 empty. The server herself was having a rough night because the look of exhaustion was evident on her face but nonetheless she was great and accommodating.The dishes were great but really small (i.e. tapas size). Every tasting was promptly followed by a &#34;omg this is so good. &#34; I don&#39;t think you can go wrong ordering anything here but I would check with the server to see if the portion is adequate as a entree instead of a petite appetizer size. If you&#39;re hungry, go for the chicken and sausage with frites. I spied other tables ordering it and seemed like the only substantial sized dish. Overall I don&#39;t consider the chef&#39;s selection the best value and I would probably order a la carte in the future ($65 a person but the value came out to $47 pp). The meal was supposed to end at the porchetta but server picked up on our sad hungry faces and decided to throw in the mussels. Everything was great and I will definitely come back but probably not for the chef&#39;s selection."

The server was nice and did answer our questions.  However after taking our order for drinks and food, we waited.....and waited....and waited. After almost 20 minutes, no drinks came, but then to our surprise our food did......well some of it.We ordered 4 main dishes and 2 sides.  2 of the main dishes came out.  We were faced with a dilemma, eat in front of the others or wait and let our food get cold. We decided to eat....still no drinks.  Then we asked about the drinks, they finally showed up (dropped off by someone who was not our server).  Then one of the sides did....then another......then finally the other main dishes.  We ate the sides after having finished our main dishes.....we ordered them as a side, to eat with our meal....so that didn&#39;t happen.  It was a HOT day and I asked for a glass of ice for my coffee.....that came 15-20 minutes later after asking 2 more times.The waiter only came back one time the entire meal to check on us, and we were offered coffee refills at the end of our meal.The food was amazing, and I highly recommend the red wine poached eggs.

What genre is that?-So its barnyard seating? Why do people think that is cool?- so everyone in here is wearing auto mechanic shirts. Are they going to change my oil while Im here? Because if so this place would be great!-lighting is stupid, and i like globe lamps usually. Totally overdoing it and no logic to layout other than rows of lights not spread out well. Too tight.- wow, five of us and we ordered 7 things. Soooo starving still... I think ill go eat a hot dog now.-ordered 7 things, 4 of them were fried and 4 of them had mayonnaise in it, serious?! This place sucks.- so we sit in a &#34;booth&#34; and its like a barn stall with doors. I get it: it looks like a barn in here, great, so? Damn this place sucks.-so i order a beer that normally costs 6-7$... Good beer. Its $11 here, SERIOUSLY?! I dont get it theres other bars around here with reasonably priced beer.-location is the only things that makes this place work. I dare them to open 10 blocks west and watch it fail.

The theme of the eating is farm to table.  Each dish was so uniquely flavored and exquisitely prepare, it&#39;s fair to say the kitchen puts out a diverse Gourmet cuisine.So for example it would be possible to go and order a whole chicken with Frys for $35 and add some sides and have a very economical family meal but I guarantee you that that chicken those fries and those sites are exceptionally prepared food and unlike your usual home style dining establishment. Another example is the Spanish style ham one choice of three types of ham on the menu which came in the large portion into platters with bread and butter and was a feast in itself for 9 people.Particular standouts in my mind were the skate wing, the beef heart tartare, the duck, he avocado salad and the beet salad.The restaurant has heavy farmhouse- scaled  wooden tables, some of them very long, arranged under a grid of 84 old fashioned Globe fixtures.  It is homey and warm and yet Urbane.  We didn&#39;t notice that three of the four walls have Hogs featured in the art, until the end of the dinner, and as we had a kosher diner with us, both that and the fact that their freebie snack was pork chitlins provided some humor.  You could say that pork was available from beginning to end.  Yet this did not define the kichen, either.There were nine of us and we ordered main dishes and five vegetables and bread and it&#39;s fair to say that with the exception of the bread, because we eschewed the special spreads, every dish was completely stood on its own, with a unique flavor profile.  They have a price fixed Chef&#39;s selection dinner for $65 a person that I have no doubt would be worth it.  There was no dead weight at all in this meal --even the bread was so delicious I could have made a meal out of it.I&#39;m not going to describe what was in each dish because you can read the menu online and it still doesn&#39;t capture the delicacy and uniqueness of preparations.I will say however that the group as a whole was somewhat disappointed in the desert choces,  because we have a chocolate cake heavy or Patisserie favoring crowd and most of the desserts the night we were there featured berries. A true tort or a pie would be a solid addition to the dessert menu.Enough talk go and eat."

I was looking forward to coming back when I visited Chicago, and in fact made a reservation weeks in advance. Went on a Sunday morning, beat the rush actually, in fact probably didn&#39;t even need a reservation. Everyone is always nice, and we got seated quite promptly.Coffee is strong and is apparently a special blend from Intelligentsia. Publican, I give you that! You gotta have good, strong, flavorful coffee for the brunch crown. Am I right?We had the crab scramble, chicken fried steak, and side of bacon.Crab scramble - worthwhile. Eggs were fluffy and quite a bit of crab. Tasted fresh, light and not too heavy. The creme fraiche and pickled shallot added the extra kick to this already simple, yet tasty dish.Chicken fried steak - not worthwhile. When you think of chicken fried steak, you imagine going to a dive dinner and having this fried gloriness covered in savory gravy. You already have something in mind, and I didn&#39;t get this experience. The steak was tough, chewy and not tender. Gravy was sub-par and bland. This dish tries to upscale, but fails to deliver and the essentials. Missed the target on this one. When your paying more than $15 for chicken fried steak, you&#39;d hope for better.Bacon - always a pleaser. Crisp, maple syrup, not fatty.Publican has always had a foodie place in my heart for brunch, but after this experience (chicken fried steak), I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be on top of my list when I visit. Maybe I&#39;m being too harsh? Oh well."

The food is served &#39;family style&#39; and meant to be shared. We started with the charcuterie plate - a good selection of meats and we were big fans of the mustard it came with. The avocado salad came next and was very tasty as well.We then split the pork belly and farm chicken platter. I was in love with the frites the farm chicken came with (I suspect they were doused in truffle oil - yum!), and the garnishments for the pork belly complemented it very well.

I love The Publican.  Pretty late to the game on trying this place, but really can&#39;t wait to go back.  It&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve had a meal that I&#39;m still thinking about certain dishes!  Recently stopped in for a Friday night dinner.Service - Awesome.  Seated right away for our reservation.  Great waiter who asked if we&#39;d been there before, explained the menu, gave us some suggestions on how much to order etc. and all were spot on.  We also spent a pretty long time at dinner as we were catching up and offered to move from our table to have our after dinner drinks and he comped us our limoncello.Ambiance - Beautiful space.  A little unsure if I&#39;d like the big communal table style at first, but it was no issue at all.  The two of us were sitting across from each other and not so loud that you get distracted by conversations around you.  If you have to wait for a table, they have a number of standing tables where you can have drinks or little app&#39;s while you are waiting, which is a nice perk.  Also, smells amazing as soon as you walk in, smoked meat deliciousness.Food - Everything was soooo good.  Started with the chef&#39;s selection of oysters, super fresh. Also got the snapper ceviche, it was served more like what I typically consider a crudo, but was very delicious.  Had a tiny kumquat slice on the top that just made it so fresh.  Next was the taste of three hams, served with fresh bread and butter.  I would have never thought to order this, but my date was pushing for it so sure why not.  Oh my gosh, I am like still thinking about this ham.  It was so good.  I never knew I like ham so much.  Get it.  Finished up with a lamb dish, remember it being good, but not too many details...still thinking about that ham I guess.All in all a great experience and amazing meal!"

They definitely should have had more severs on a Saturday night so I&#39;m not sure if some called off or if that is how they are typically staffed.  The rest of the staff that was filling our water glasses and taking away empty dishes were  attentive but speedy to the point of being abrupt. All of a sudden an arm would reach out in front of me &amp; whisk an empty plate away from across the table adding a quick &#34;excuse me&#34; as an afterthought.The bathrooms are a unique layout with individual rooms to do your business and then a communal large round sink in the middle of the area with hand dryers on the walls (they also have 2 larger handicap rooms, 1 men&#39;s/1 women&#39;s, that have the sink &amp; hand dryer in them as well).  And the rum-scented hand soap they have is divine!"

Server gave us pretty good service, but she wasn&#39;t that friendly. The Manager was VERY welcoming though, always doing his rounds checking on all guests.My steak was really good, I enjoyed it. My guest said it was one of the best steaks she has had in a long time. I&#39;ve seen lots of reviews raving about the house salad, so I was excited to eat it, but VERY let down when I did. It was just not very exciting.We didn&#39;t get dessert, but saw a neighboring table order a &#34;slice&#34; of carrot cake. It was HUGE!! Enough to feed MANY people, if I returned I would need to save some room to try it (and bring a posse to help me eat it!!)."

Mostly based on excellent service. The food was good, but I honestly can&#39;t say if I would come back. The portions are huge, which is great if you are into leftovers, not so much when you&#39;re traveling. The meat they offer is good quality, even if I&#39;m not totally down with the corn fed aspect of it. I eat (red) meat so infrequently I always try to do grass fed. It&#39;s simply just so much better. I wasn&#39;t overwhelmed by anything here food wise, but the wine list is great.This seems to be a great place for business, although it gets really loud and it&#39;s hard to hear people just across the table from you. We were running a few minutes late and they agree to hold our reservation when I called so that is appreciated. If you come, be hungry, very hungry and plan to leave stuffed."

This is not that place, the bread was stale and their aren&#39;t many appetizers. That being said my husband had the filet which was overdone and nothing special. The blue cheese potatoes saved the night, really creamy and decadent.We were in Chicago for the marathon so it was very busy but the service was ok but took forever."

The ribs were just ok as was the Calamari appetizer.On to the greatness of Gibson&#39;s...The &#34;Loaded Wedge Salad&#34; was awesome and indeed loaded with bacon and tomatoes.The Scallops (6) were plumb and juicy and well seasoned with what seemed like thick garlic chips. The buttery sauce they were swimming in was perfect to drag half a scallop through before every bite.The 24oz Porterhouse was very flavorful. They season it very thoroughly, so if you don&#39;t like things on the salty side be sure and let them know. Also, I asked for it medium rare on the rare side and it seemed like it was more on the medium side. Still a very good steak, but just clarify your temperature.For sides we got fries, which was a HUGE plate that several can share. Also, the Brussel Sprouts were pretty good and were also loaded with actual bacon slices like the Wedge salad.Good stuff."

As the fourth person said &#34;You have to go to Gib....&#34; I made a decision. I didn&#39;t even let them finish before my mind was made up. And that decision paid off.I&#39;ll start with...this place is pricey. All steak houses are. And while you often hear steak-snobs say &#34;I can cook a steak at home just the way I like it for a fraction of the price&#34;, I know with full certainty that I can&#39;t. So I dropped $200 for two people. Not including the drinks I got before hand.They start you off with bread. As good as it is...and it&#39;s really good...try and pace yourself if you plan to get an insane amount of food like I did....or get ready to waddle back to wherever you came from.With my entree I had the choice of a salad or soup. I went with soup - as it was a cream of mushroom. It. was. amazing. I don&#39;t usually drink soup - as my homeland hovers around 90 degrees 10 months out of the year - so this was a nice change of pace. Creamy, mushroomy (huh?) and delicious.I went with the Chicago cut which is a Ribeye. I was stuffed half way through, but pushed myself like a runner in a marathon and I am glad to say that I made it across the finish line. I finished the whole thing. It was massive. I&#39;m proud of myself. The steak was perfectly cooked and had a nice crust on the outside of it. Delicious.We ordered the twice baked potato as a side. This monster of a side is a backed potato...that&#39;s been hollowed out....made into masked potato and then neatly stuffed back into the potato skin....with a sheet of cheese on top. This is like my dream bed. I&#39;d love to be that mashed potato, all comfy and tucked into bed. I have no idea what spices/magic they add to the mashed up taters, but they were amazing.We also got a 1/2 order of broccoli. Originally we ordered the full serving, but the waiter looked at us like we were crazy. He then convinced us that a 1/2 portion would be a good idea. Thank goodness he did because the half serving was bigger than ANY veggie serving I&#39;ve ever seen at a restaurant. Get the 1/2 of whatever else you get - because you WILL get the full potato.Cocktails were good. I had a mule, and it was refreshing and well done. They had an extensive wine list as well.We skipped dessert, but basically they cut a cake in half and bring that to you. It&#39;s like a Flintstones serving size of cake. I wish I had room for it.The service....man the service. If you are paying top dollar you are going to expect impeccable service, and the folks at Gibson&#39;s deliver. Super nice, accommodating, explained everything, came through with their fancy scraper to take all the crumbs/spills off the table...it was an overall amazing experience."

I would definitely describe it as a more casual ambiance when compared to a Capital Grille or Mastros. But either way still a solid spot and you definitely get that old school Chicago vibes the moment you step foot in.The two things I took away from here my last visit... steaks are cooked to perfection &amp; sides are enormous. The 26oz porterhouse that my lady and I shared was cooked to a perfect medium. Salt and seasoning served on the side and you can add more as desired. The sides as our waiter mentioned were shareable, and he was not kidding. The salad we started out with was split into two bowls and neither one of us came close to finishing our bowl of salad. The side of brussel sprouts with maple bourbon butter and bacon was equally as generous and delicious. Did I mention they started us off with their lobster bisque on the house? Noms! Maybe this should be a five star review, but for now Capital Grille &amp; Mastros still tie as my favorites for steak. As I mentioned before, the portions are generous so come hungry!&#39;Til next time, cheers!"

Yes Please!We ventured into Gibsons first thing when we got the Chicago for lunch because it was located so conveniently across the street from where we were staying (The Thompson Hotel). First things first, drinks. After we sat at the bar, I ordered a Prosecco split and he ordered a beer. The Irish bartender was on point. He made small talk with us and made sure we were well taken care of.I ended up ordering the Turkey Reuben and it was massive, piled high with turkey! The toasted rye bread with the tang of the sauerkraut mixed with the sweet and creamy 1000 Island.. it was perfect. My guy ordered the crab cakes and it was literally nothing but chunks of crab, which is how it should always be done. We started making small talk with the others at the bar. Everyone was so welcoming and eager to give us suggestions on where to eat and what to see.I will say that it was pricey for lunch, but I know this restaurant has history here and by the way we were treated, money wasn&#39;t so much of an issue by the time we got our check."

My husband graduated from Chicago Booth, we had lots of family in town and made a reservation here for the Saturday of graduation months in advance. We arrived 15 minutes ahead of time per their request, and immediately knew the hostess was overwhelmed beyond comprehension. She said they were running about 20 minutes behind. Ok - no big deal.After 45 minutes past our reservation, I go up to ask for an update she said &#34;I don&#39;t have one for you, you just have to wait until you are called&#34;. I beg your pardon?! I made a reservation, you need to honor it.  After we waited an hour and a half, we made reservations else where. Once we told the hostess we were leaving, she called the manager immediately who offered to comp our meal if we stayed. We were still not seated for another 30 minutes and we were sat by the kitchen, so loud! This is the 2nd time I have been here and cannot believe the manners or how badly the whole situation was for us.

High quality, big pieces. Great with the cocktail sauce and horseradish.Had the 14oz filet with the cheese on top. I would probably skip the cheese next time. It&#39;s good as it is...no additional toppings needed.And they go all out on the dessert here. They make it with pride. Had the sundae and the whipped cream was at least 4&#34; tall.

And I do know a guy who is a Vegan who does eat fish sometimes and the last time we were here together we had this giant salad that I could barely finish.The desserts are big enough to feed a small army.

Sadly I&#39;ve been to way too many great steakhouses in Chicago to give this place more than 3 stars.The scene is classy as are most places on Rush so no faults there. Valet is offered because street parking is going to be near impossible to find.The filet 10z medium well was cooked properly I&#39;ll give it that but it does not leave an impression that will stay with you taste buds. It&#39;s good not great (that&#39;s being generous ). It does come with a side of butter seasoning to give it an extra kick but I&#39;m in the variety that feels a good steak needs no extra additions or seasoning. The mash potatoes (recommended by a reviewer) was ok..nothing special and again will not leave a lasting impression. The side of brown gravy is a must to add some flavor to it and it&#39;s a good preparation to bring in some taste(has a bit of alcohol flavor to it which I always welcome ). Even with that though it&#39;s not worth ordering and I&#39;d choose something else if there&#39;s a next time.Overall, the service and ambiance is upscale and classy . The food falls  short compared to the other steakhouses offered by Chicago. You&#39;re in a great location to make it a nice night out but I&#39;d probably go somewhere else for dinner. Cheers"

I can safely put the Chicago Cut on the top of my list for bone-in ribeyes. Gibsons is a classic steakhouse serving black Angus beef raised from farms in the Midwest. This is it for steak lovers.We arrived five minutes early for our 7 pm reservation and we&#39;re seated immediately. If you&#39;re expecting a secluded, quiet dinner with that someone special, you&#39;ll be disappointed. Tables are in close proximity and you&#39;ll probably be engaged in conversation and feel like you&#39;re sharing your meal with your neighbors. The restaurant will also be loud especially if it&#39;s on a night like we went. On the night of our meal, there was excitement and a buzz in the restaurant as the Cubs made the final out to clinch the NL division series against the rival Cardinals right as we were ordering our meal.We started off with Jameson neat for me, a glass of Moscato for my wife, and a half dozen oysters on the half shell. For entrees, the Chicago Cut, the half order of the spit-roasted chicken, and sautéed spinach with mushrooms as our side. For dessert, the colossal macadamia turtle pie.As for the steak, 22 ounces of succulent, marbled, melt in your mouth black Angus beef. For those of you that are into beef grades, the corn fed and dry aged beef for 40 days has its own USDA Prime Certification that is specific for Gibsons restaurant group only i.e. you&#39;re probably not gonna find this kind of beef, that is this good, outside of Gibsons. I savored every bite of my medium rare steak that was seasoned perfectly and needed no other enhancement. Honestly, I could have eaten another 22 ounces.The rest of the food was superb but make sure you have plenty of appetite left if you&#39;re going to order the turtle pie, because it is ridiculous huge and not something you can take home with you.Service was impeccable from our team. They were completely professional and knew the menu like the back of their hands. Pricing is as expected, but $54 for the Chicago Cut is more than fair. Quite a memorable experience that still has my mouth watering weeks after our meal."

Every experience I have had here has been top notch to say the least. It truly is my favorite restaurant in the world (And I&#39;m not exaggerating). Seen in &#34;The League&#34; and well known to celebrities both of this day and the past, it is an iconic place. I dined at Gibson&#39;s with my family and boyfriend for a Friday dinner recently. Friday&#39;s are my favorite at Gibson&#39;s because it&#39;s lobster bisque day.. I highly recommend going on Friday so you can try the best bisque in Chicago. It&#39;s light for the richness of bisque but creamy, with a perfect flavor and notes of Sherry.We had made a reservation nearly 3 months in advance for a 7:30PM dinner on Black Friday. I would advise making a reservation a bit in advance if you are planning on going to Gibson&#39;s. Once you arrive (as you have a reservation), you are seated promptly and welcomed into the luxurious dining room. The staff is very friendly and not stuck up like you get at some steakhouses. We had a booth on Friday, which was comfortable for 6 of us.We started out with drinks and appetizers-- we decided on some oysters, which were tasty. Then we had our lobster bisque.. YUM! I ordered a filet mignon with char-crust and, as a table, we had a twice baked potato, mushrooms, and asparagus. My steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and only one steak at the table had to be sent back to the kitchen, as it was an odd cut.We ended our evening with chocolate cake and coffee. Gibson&#39;s chocolate mousse cake is to die for-- one slice is size equivalent to half of a small grocery store cake. It is luscious and full of flavor.I forget the server&#39;s name who we had that weekend but he was knowledgeable, friendly, and on top of his game. The ambiance of the restaurant is that of your classic steakhouse-- deep mahogany, burgundy booths, and incandescent lighting that accentuates your experience. It isn&#39;t cheap (especially if you order a steak), but it&#39;s well worth the money if you want a wonderful meal."

Cut is their Rib-Eye and it was large enough to share.  We loved it.  Cooked to perfection. It came with a choice of sides (hard to pick from, I wanted one of each!) We started with a bowl of gumbo, which was better than I&#39;ve had in a long time, better even than some in New Orleans.  You could make a meal of the gumbo!  We also had a Shrimp and Avocado Salad that could be a meal for one person not looking for too hardy of a meal.Good choice for non-carnivores.  Everything in it was fresh and crispy cold.So, there&#39;s a general rule... &#34;never order ribs in a place that&#39;s not a rib place!&#34;Well, this place is the EXCEPTION to the rule.  The ribs are NOT pre-boiled.. they have the actual slow roasted smokey BBQ flavor, firmness on the bone, and moisture to make for them tender and juicy.I could not end without telling you this.  As we ate, we could see the massive desserts passing on their way to other tables.  They were so big that I made up my mind early not to leave bloated due to sweets.  I was outvoted, and we settled on the Banana Cream Pie.I promise you here, you will never have a better, authentic BCP.  Not too sweet, Fresh bananas,flakey crust, and the filling is unmistakably made right there, in house.  Plus we got half to take home.  YUM!The service was as attentive and professional as you would expect in a steakhouse dining experience.  Top Notch."

We had an 8 pm reservation and arrived promptly on time. When we checked in, the hostess stated she didn&#39;t see our name. I explained we had booked through OpenTable and they apologized and even when I didn&#39;t see it in my phone any longer they sat us immediately and apologized! Wow! It wasn&#39;t even their fault.Our server was fantastic and apologized every time he got called away to sing their birthday celebration song. Some people may find that annoying that they get taken away mid sentence but it adds to the atmosphere. It&#39;s so lively and bustling.The menu has a great variety and the only reason I gave 4 stars was I asked for my steak medium-rare and it came out Medium. However, I didn&#39;t complain or mention it so I am sure they would have made it right. However I do feel at $50 for a piece of meat it should come out right the first time. We had just flown in from LA and were so hungry. The salads and sides were good too. The dessert...we didn&#39;t try it but my mouth was watering every time one of those giant pieces of perfection walked by. We were so full and the desserts could have easily fed a small village. Great wine selection and not overpriced. I saw a couple wines that are around $200 a bottle in LA for around $125 there.Overall, a must when in town. We&#39;ll be back."

They all were very good sized and tasted very fresh. Loved all three. For my entrée I got the prime rib and it was an excellent choice. One of the best I&#39;ve ever had. The desserts are big enough to feed a small army. The two pieces of cake were more than enough for 11 people. Overall it was a great experience and the prices were not outrageous.

Lobster cocktail was tasteless and chewy and came in an artichoke swimming in Oily vinaigrette. My husband ordered the steak tartare and it looked like it was made last week.

The food is great as you expect from one of the original Chicago steakhouses, but what really blew me away was the wait staff! We reserved a booth for 6 earlier in the day and when we arrived were seated immediately by their friendly wait staff. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable of all the cuts of meat, sizes, and recommended dishes to us based on what we liked. He even advised one of the couples in our party to share a larger cut and get extra sides if needed as it would save us money at the end of the night! Extremely friendly, 5 star service all around.As for more on the food, I ordered a smaller cut, medium, and it came out perfectly cooked, warm, well-flavored,and still slightly pink on the inside. Couldn&#39;t have photoshopped it any better! We ordered the monstrous 2lb (!!) lobster tail as well, and when they say 2lbs they mean 2lbs of lobster meat, not including the shell! I was amazed by how large it was but was even more amazed at how good it tasted! Usually with larger lobster tails the meat will either be not all the way cooked or it will have a rubber-y texture on the outside due to prolonged cook time. Somehow the chefs at Gibson&#39;s were able to perfectly and evenly cook all parts of this lobster tail and kept it tasting and textured amazingly!You can often find celebrities ranging from A-list Hollywood stars to world class athletes frequenting here as well (dinner that night for me included appearances from Derrick Rose and his group) so you know the food&#39;s good!"

The prices are high, but any quality restaurant should be, and we expected this.  I am always willing to pay for excellent service and wonderful food.  The prices are reflective of the service you will receive at Gibson&#39;s and totally worth every penny.Stephani Smiles for Gibson&#39;s Bar and Steakhouse ;)#bestlobsterbisqueever"

I had been looking forward to this meal for months, so I knew I wasn&#39;t going to hold back. Upon arrival greeted by the valet, servers on the patio, hostess, etc. You could feel the warmth from the very beginning. They were fully booked that night, but it never felt overwhelming in there. My boyfriend and I arrived early to grab a cocktail prior to our 8:30pm reservation.  I highly recommend sipping on an Old Fashioned and listening to the pianist in the bar area prior to dining. We were escorted to what I felt was the best seat in the house, but it appeared as if you couldn&#39;t have a bad seat with how the restaurant is laid out. Since our reservation was like maybe 2 minutes pass (literally 8:32pm) Scott (1 of three very visual managers) had an appetizer on the way for my main squeeze and I. The Avocado Crab Meat appetizer set the perfect tone for the meal. I had been anticipating a huge steak, so it was nice to have a seafood dish prior. It was a really nice touch with Scott&#39;s style of management, fully engaged and elevating the experience as a consumer. Our server, Michael (I believe, so mad I can&#39;t say it with 100% certainty) was professional, charming, and set us up for success. For the table the Chicago Cut, Porterhouse, sautéed spinach, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes were ordered...and made sure to hold a strawberry shortcake for dessert. The charred outside of the steak with the perfect medium-rare temp on the inside was to die for. Splitting sides was the way to go. Huge portions. The shortcake could serve 8, but we ate for 6. So flipping good. What a seasonal treat. Other than my mama&#39;s Thanksgiving dinner, the best meal I&#39;ve ever had. I can honestly say I&#39;ll think about the Chicago Cut and strawberry shortcake everyday for the rest of my days. There&#39;s no question I&#39;ll be back."

The event was flawless. Many of our guests remarked that the event was exceptional -- the food, drinks, service, and space were top-notch.But what really bears mentioning is Gibson&#39;s event planner Kasia who for over a year promptly answered dozens of e-mails and calls with requests big and small. I can&#39;t emphasize enough the value of having someone like Kasia managing the catering of your event. In planning your wedding you&#39;ll have to trust many vendors -- your photographer, videographer, etc., but if you go with Gibson&#39;s you&#39;ll be able to relax and enjoy your reception, knowing your guests will enjoy top quality food and service.

I think the ambiance can really add to one&#39;s dining experience and sadly Gibson&#39;s didn&#39;t cut it for me. Where is the diversity among the patrons? The customers all looked the same. While I understand Gibsons is a fixture in Gold Coast, I was absolutely shocked by the lack of diversity, including the wait staff. One might ask, is it Gibsons fault for the kind of clientele they attract? Maybe...maybe not, but if you&#39;re looking to take your out of town work colleagues to this place, like I did, I actually felt embarassed because the restaurant didn&#39;t portray a healthy representation of Chicagoans, but perhaps it did.I devoured the Chilean sea bass. It was delicious. And if you decide to go I think the sea bass is a great alternative to steak, which by the way, they parade around raw steaks on a tray to each table and point out various steak cuts including the Chicago cut.Did I say it is crowded in the place? I mean it was filled to the brim, as they say. Every table was taken, which means everyone, including the wait staff would bump into your chair as they passed. It got pretty annoying after a while so we ate and left.Noise level was extremely high so we had to shout to talk. As a result other customers were shouting too so you had to overhear conversations that weren&#39;t too interesting. Did I also say we were there on a Thursday night?"

Gibsons is a high quality, consistently perfect restaurant that has held its own with all the other steakhouses that have popped up along the years. Shrimp cocktail and a medium lobster to share for appetizers- def recommend both. For dinner: I shared the bone-in filet with my husband- amazing. Dad had the prime rib which was also delicious and mom had the whitefish which she raved about. There were 4 others in our group and everyone had something different that they loved. Server threw in a free (huge) side of veggies. For dessert my dad requested the banana cream pie (something I&#39;ve never had there) and I gotta say it was to die for. TONS of fresh bananas loaded with real whipped cream.Thanks Gibsons for a great 40th anniversary in honor of my two favorite people!"

I&#39;m not complaining, though, since I&#39;m a steak and potatoes kinda guy. After Yelping for awhile, I finally found a few steakhouses that were actually open for lunch (why aren&#39;t more steakhouses open for lunch?!). I decided to go w/ Gibsons, and we all were glad that we did.I&#39;m going to get straight to the point  - the steak here is phenomenal. For meat, we got:-W.R&#39;s Chicago Cut: the restaurant&#39;s most popular steak, a 22 oz heavenly cut of ribeye. My cousin&#39;s husband and I both got this medium-rare. The steak was flavorful and had a GREAT char to it. I ate the steak alone, and it was awesome. I ate it w/ their house seasoning, and it was awesome. I ate it w/ some horseradish, and it was awesome. This steak is awesome. Get it.-Gibsons Open-Faced Steak Sandwich: my cousin got this, which was topped w/ the ribeye, grilled tomato, baby arugula, and horseradish cream. It was basically the steak we got, but chopped up onto a sandwich. Perfect for those who still want to try the W.R&#39;s Chicago Cut, but want something light.We paired our steak w/ a nice bottle of Dona Paula Malbec from Argentina. For sides, we got the Double Baked Potato and Creamed Spinach, which were solid. And, for dessert, we got the famed Macadamia Turtle Pie - a heavenly, monster-sized (our server said it was enough to feed a family of 4-6! See pictures for more) slice of ice cream cake w/ a graham cracker crust (I think?), chocolate and caramel sauce, and tons of macadamia nuts. Already stuffed from our lunch, we questioned whether or not we should order this, but after hearing what it consisted of, we said screw it and ordered it...and then demolished it. I was so stuffed (but happy!) from my meal that I didn&#39;t end up eating again until lunch the next day =xThe service here is great, too. The servers are so jolly and friendly that it feels as if you&#39;re a regular here. Gibsons is definitely a great steakhouse!"

Have visited several times now while in Chicago. Absolutely love the filet sliders - they melt in your mouth. Seated on the patio this time which was nice, not as lovely as they made it sound though, have had better outdoor experiences overall. Service was okay at best. Usually, the staff is very attentive and friendly. The staff this time was noticeably less, especially when asking questions or for suggestions about the menu. Somewhat disappointing as I was bringing someone to Gibson&#39;s for the first time and I had raved how good it was. Will make me think twice about visiting again next time or trying some place new."

We ordered the salmon and their most popular steak which I forget the name of.The salmon was literally a piece of grilled salmon drowning in melted butter....The steak was supposed to be medium-well but turned out to be more like extra well-done since it was all black on the outside...Over $100 later..we left with stomach aches and disappointment. We were looking to have a nice dinner out and that is not what happened.One thing I will say, the young man serving us was a very good server and very attentive. We did not complain, but did say that the food was not more than OK in the end...we were just so hungry and it was so busy that we did not want to wait another hour for our food to come out a second time.Anyway, won&#39;t be coming here again unfortunatley."

The food and drinks are great (I specifically highly recommend the meatloaf - delicious and only $15!) Also worth noting is the bread they bring to the table when you sit down includes amazing raisin bread - some of the best pre meal bread I&#39;ve had.Overall, everything is on point here.

This was a great recommendation from him!Gibson&#39;s had their walls plastered with pictures of celebrities who have dined their over the years. It had an old fashioned, yet touristy feel to it at the same time. Sort of weird.Onto the food! We ordered the rib eye and filet mignon along with a side of brussel sprouts.When in Chicago...do as Chicagoans do and order the Chicago cut! We ordered both meats to be medium rare, and both were charred perfectly and very flavorful. I ate these with the house seasoning, but the horseradish sauce wasn&#39;t bad either!For dessert, we got the macadamia nut ice cream torte. This was ginormous. I repeat-ginormous!! This was good, but in a knock you in the face with food coma kinda way.

Making it worse for that couple- at the end of the night they handed us our check and wrapped leftovers over the table.  I was mortified by the peopleI ordered a fish dish- which was great (But more of a reflection of Hugo&#39;s)but given the hype around this place (and their USDA designation) my husband&#39;s filet was underwhelming.  It was incredibly tender and had a nice seer, but was served under cooked and had little flavor.   I&#39;m assuming they wanted the flavor to come from the sauce it was served with- but a good steak shouldn&#39;t need a heavy sauce.I live a block away from this place, but am certain I wont return.  I used to love Hugo&#39;s but seeing how dirty the glasses and flatware was, I&#39;m not even certain if i&#39;ll go back there!"

Even other guests around us where chiming in on his suggestions with rave reviews and their own suggestions! Upon closing the tab to leave for our table, he handed me a martini on the house. A peach, something or other? IT was heaven. HEAVEN. And Im not a martini drinker, by any means. So I walked to my table with my half full glass of wine, and this martini (which the hostess giggled about). It was pretty lush of me, huh? ;)Upon being seated a busboy came to our table, removed the extra place settings, set our table up for two and was on his way. Our waiter made our entire night! We didn&#39;t catch his name, but we thought he looked like a Ron, so we called him Ron. He talked fantasy football with my boyfriend, but I didn&#39;t care, I ordered another heaven drink, and we all were happy!Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the cuts of steak, and what he was offering us off the menu. He was generous with his personality. He made us laugh the entire meal. WE LOVE YOU RON!It was suggested to us to split portions, as they are huge. So that is what we did! A 22oz steak, a double baked potato- and we were both stuffed to the gills. It was so tender, juicy, perfectly cooked, and well spiced! OY OY OY.We then ordered dessert to go, but they didn&#39;t have what we wanted, so here comes RON, with a peach ice cream sundae on the house. This man stole my heart! Give &#39;em a raise!Everyone had smiles on their faces, and you could tell it was genuine. The staff worked together as a team, and they really seemed to love what they were doing!

Head to Gibson&#39;s!I came here with family for my brother in law&#39;s birthday last month. We had a reservation for 6 people on a Saturday at 5 pm (only available time unless we wanted to eat at like 11!). The venue itself is super cool. Celeb autographed images line the walls and the vibe just makes you feel like a true Chicagoan. We were sat upstairs at a round table. The bar up there looked like something you&#39;d see in a Speakeasy complete with a live piano man serenading the room with his music. Love it!We started with drinks as we browsed the menu. I was feeling super fancy so I opted for a cosmo martini and it was delicious. The service was great. Our waiter was super friendly and prompt. The head chef (or butcher?) came to our table with an IMPRESSIVE display of meats. He explained the size and details of each piece and offered up spice suggestions.This (oddly enough) was one of my first experiences at a Steakhouse, so I was a little hesitant on what to order. Everything seemed so manly and filling, but I felt like I&#39;d be a big loser not to order steak, plus it seemed like it would be a waste of an experience.SO...I ordered the 10 oz. filet with cajun rub. It was very good! I highly suggest the cajun spices. Although that was the smallest size filet you could order, I honestly could barely finish it. It was very filling. Plus, I started with a cup of there gumbo soup (which was just okay) and bread. We also ordered asparagus and mashed potatoes for the table which were both super delicious - highly recommend.

The bar is always crowded. Amazing cocktails served by professional bartenders. However, three of us came here for dinner too. I was skeptical we&#39;d ever get seated but we were right around our reservation time. They call your name in the bar over a loudspeaker so you can enjoy your cocktail while waiting.I ordered like there was no tomorrow coming. I ordered the filet medium based on the waiter&#39;s description (I always get medium rare). It turned out to be the best steak made to order. I had it with blue cheese on top. Yuuummmm. For dessert we split an ice cream cake thing with nuts-- wow. They even kept it in the freezer while we finished up and paid the bill.Service fantastic. Place is very lively."

If anything, you can always go next door to Hugo&#39;s and sit in the bar area as its first come first serve and you can order off the dinner menu still. The two restaurants share a kitchen so you&#39;ll be able to order almost the same things.The servers are phenomenal here and make the dining experience more enjoyable. Once you&#39;re seated, they bring out the raw seafood/meat to show you.For someone who doesn&#39;t enjoy eating too much red meat unless it&#39;s well done (I know it&#39;s crazy), their marinated skirt steak is delicious!If you&#39;re still hungry after your main entree, their desserts are huge!

Our waiter did not even greet us, just slapped our menus down on the table. Another guy came over with a plate of raw meat and lobster and gave us a careless and rehearsed rundown of what was on the plate- as if we don&#39;t know what lobster looks like. The prime rib we ordered was disgustingly mushy, and tasted like it was sitting around in the kitchen for a while before it was brought out. We ordered a side of mushrooms, which was also flavorless. We were sitting at a booth near the kitchen, and a server slammed a pitcher of water down on a counter behind me, sloshing the water all over me and my seat. He didn&#39;t apologize because he didn&#39;t even notice.No one here even pretends like they give a shit. I would understand if the service was lacking because it was busy, but this was place was nearly empty as it was a snowy Monday night. I was extremely disappointed because I was treating my boyfriend to his birthday dinner. The only thing that made the night better was the Macadamia Turtle Pie, which is a huge slice of ice cream cake with chocolate, caramel, and nuts. That&#39;s why I gave this place one star because otherwise it would get ZERO."

The place the aging partners would take us to give an albeit weak &#34;thank you&#34; for hub&#39;s 90 hr work weeks.While I can&#39;t name my favorite steak in Chicago, Gibson&#39;s is a place I enjoy frequenting a few times a year. It&#39;s lively and loud and feels like a party every night of the week. It&#39;s not pretentious. The service is never lacking. The food good and the desserts comically large.I do wish they offered a smaller steak. The 10 oz filet is the smallest and I can&#39;t eat more than 5 oz. Yes, I can have the rest wrapped up, but I don&#39;t care for leftover meat. I&#39;ve probably eaten a filet 10 times here and it has always been cooked Medium. --the way I requested.The Roasted Cauliflower Gruyère is always a given. I&#39;ve yet to find a single vegetable that doesn&#39;t taste better roasted nor a vegetable that doesn&#39;t taste better with gruyère.Their Brussels Sprouts with bacon and bourbon are not your grandma&#39;s greens. ;)A Double Baked Potato because what is a steak without a potato? I just tell myself that the other (healthier?) vegetables make up for the enormously high caloric cheesy potato splurge. ;)The real reason I come here though.... It&#39;s certainly not to relive the terrible memories of my &#34;widow life&#34; in biglaw, nor to read all of the autographs on their wall, nor the need for a gigantic steak. I come solely for the Macadamia Turtle Pie. Some days I wake up and just know that it&#39;s been too long since I&#39;ve eaten that thick cinnamon graham crust with the mountain of ice cream, whole macadamia nuts and chocolate ganache. Never mind the fact that I&#39;m stuffed up to my ears with steak and buttery vegetables. There&#39;s always room for ice cream; after all, it just melts around all of the other food in your stomach. ;)Now to hit that treadmill. *gulp*"

When we got there the place was still packed. We were able to get some space at the bar and grab a drink before dinner. The bartender was super friendly, and the drinks were made perfectly. There was a piano player in the corner which really added to the whole bar experience.As soon as we were seated, our waiter was there filling our waters and telling us about the specials for the night.I ordered the Chicago Cut, which is their bone in ribeye. Definitely one of the top 3 steaks I have ever had. The char is amazing, and it was cooked to a perfect medium rare.For sides, we went with the blue cheese scalloped potatoes and brussel sprouts. The sprouts were good, but the potatoes were overrun with blue cheese, which can be very overpowering. i feel like a little less would have made them a lot better. I would suggest going with the twice baked potatoes in the future, as they look incredible.Because we were there for our anniversary, our waiter brought us a coconut cream pie free of charge! It was possibly one of the largest slices of pie I have ever seen, and you could tell it was made in-house.The ambiance is exactly what you want from a Chicago steakhouse. Close tables, bustling vibe, and pictures of celebrities on the wall.

Instead of offering to fix the problem and call open table, she asked me what I wanted her to do. Isn&#39;t it the manager &#39;s job to figure out how to fix a problem and not ask the patron how to fix it? When I said call open table, she said it would take a long time to fix the problem. Since I did not make the mistake, the time it takes for Gibsons to fix their mistake is really not important.The bottom line- bad customer service!"

For $3+, you get what I call the Chicago KING/QUEEN of Street Tacos.They produce, pound, and bake their own tortilla here, and watching them make it is also a spectacle. The selection of meats, veggies, and sauces here outweigh other taco stands in the same area. They are GENEROUS with the queso, so I do recommend ordering a quesadilla over the taco just to get this.

Today since it was early and kind of cold the line was only about 10 people. So the menu is not your traditional Mexican menu, but it still has many of the traditional Mexican dishes. So I ordered two tacos. I ordered one steak taco with peppers and I ordered one Al Pastor taco. Both tacos with a bottle of water was 8 bucks. So both tacos were amazing. They were also huge. The tortillas were being made right in front of me that was impressive. I really love fresh tortillas. The tacos were so big I would consider ordering an extra tortilla and make two out of each one.anyway the flavor was on point and I would definitely go back."

I knew I wanted to have some Rubi&#39;s but not sure if I wanted to try something else.I call my friend and ask him if there was something else in here that I should try,He told me: Did you eat at Rubi&#39;s yet?? no, I answered.He goes on. are you in line? again me nope.And he pushes, what are you doing, go get in line at Rubi&#39;s, eat there and then you decide if you want to eat anywhere else.Ok then, we went straight to Rubi&#39;s and ordered 4 quesadillas to share with my friend. Pastor, flor de calabaza, asada con queso and chicharron.Pastor was really good, good flavor. But the flor de calabaza was amazing, so flavorful and tangy. Asada and chicharron were very good as well.And of course they come on a freshly made tortilla with good quality cheese.They also give you grilled onions and jalapeño peppers, extra points for that. The salsas they have available are pretty good, the peanut one is extremely hot so be careful.Customer service is fast and helpful, and if yes the lines can get long, it is worth the wait.I really enjoyed eating there, we were able to find seats and enjoy the food. Talked to a couple of customers and everybody there seemed to be in a good mood.I guess good food comes with that side effectRubi&#39;s a must if in the market"

For those that have frequent Sundays at the Maxwell Street market know exactly what I mean. Today was my first visit at Rubi&#39;s. I follow their instagram page and that pretty much sealed the deal for me to make a visit.Walking into the market via Desplaines and Polk I was trying to figure out where Rubi&#39;s food tent was. Then I hear the loud &#34;YES...YES...YES&#34;, which served like a bat signal navigation. So I jumped in line and waited my turn. I ordered 3 Steak (asada) tacos, 1 Al Pastor (pork), 1 gatorade and 1 water bottle for my dine in under their tent area. But I knew I wanted more for later so I had them also wrap up to go 1 Steak taco, 1 pork taco and 1 taco with mole sauce.All the tortillas are handmade right in front of you. The family working and making the food are the most kind hearted group ever. Each of my tacos were custom made with this not that and it was no problem. I sat down ate my food and was very pleased with my experience.The steak tacos are seasoned and fresh. I added rajas which added just the right amount of spicy kick. The pork tacos are from the spit similar to how gyros are cooked and served.I definitely brought my appetite cause I smashed 3 big tacos in less than 10 minutes. All in all I loved the energy at Rubi&#39;s and look forward to more Sunday Fundays at the Maxwell Street market."

The al pastor is my favorite, but I also love the mole, carne/nopales.  The biggest tragedy is that the tacos are really big so I can only usually pack in 3.  Everything is fresh and made right there on the griddle, including the tortillas, which totally makes the tacos outstanding and authentic.  The homemade hot sauce on the tables might make steam come out of your ears and your lips may burn for hours, but it also has amazing flavor and I usually put a dab on everything.Rubi&#39;s is delicious and authentic and is truly the first real sign of spring for me.  As soon as it warms up enough, I wake from hibernation, migrate to the Maxwell St Market, and gorge myself.   Be prepared to stand in a long line, no matter the weather.  That&#39;s OK because the chatter between the patrons in line and the banter from behind the griddle are pretty funny.ándale!  Time to go to Rubi&#39;s!"

It wasn&#39;t the best quesadilla that I&#39;ve ever had or the cheapest but watching them work behind the booth was almost as enjoyable as eating the actual meal.Standing in line to try the famous Rubi&#39;s at the Maxwell Street Market, I was mesmerized by the hard work that they were putting in. From pinching off the dough to rolling it, pressing it, frying it and waiting for it to puff before flipping it, this was a precise process. After it was ready, they added a large helping of meat, veggies and warmed cheese turning the taco into a quesadilla. It was a well run operation from the cashier to the guy grilling the meat in the back.This is probably as authentic as you can get if you want a great taco or quesadilla. No wonder the lines are down the street and no one seems to mind. The tortillas are much larger than what one would typically get from a Mexican stand and they&#39;re much better as well. The crunch of the tortilla with the softness of the melted cheese slice and the tender meat made for a a great al pastor quesadilla."

They asked what I wanted, they started making it right away, and rang me up in no time, and my food was ready quite fast.  So no it was not the staff at all, they are highly efficient, friendly, and have their bearings about them.  The slow line was caused by dumb ass people that did not know what they wanted, how rude to not know what you want and hold up a line when you have all the time in the world to figure it out and the menu is posted right there for everyone to see!Anyway, they have their raw corn meal for making tortillas on the spot right there.  The woman will grab a hunk then press it and make it into the shape it is supposed to be, then she hands it to the man doing the griddle, he then will shave the Al Pastor off of the spit that you can see rotating then voila!  There is your Al Pastor taco!  I only mentioned Al Pastor because that is what they are known for and all you really should be ordering.  I recommend getting the Quesadilla with cheese then getting Al Pastor stuffed into it.  The cheese is really good that it being Chihuahua cheese.  They take a big hunk of it and put it in the fresh tortilla then get it on that griddle, such oooey goooey delicious cheese!  The Al Pastor is amazing and made perfect, with the perfect balance of the pine apple, this is the best you can get in Chicago.They open at 10.  If you do not want to deal with a line come at 10 or anywhere during the 10 am hour.  At 1130-12 the line starts to pick up.  Then after 12 it is harsh until 1.  This Sunday was terrible during the noon hour with the line, mainly because it was not moving due to moronic customers.People please decide exactly what you want when you approach the stand.  Because you have tons of time to figure it out and it is downright rude the hang out and ask 5,000 questions and be disorganized up in the front.  Try to think about the many hungrey people patiently waiting behind you, do not be selfish."

The best remains the best. As usual, I had two steak tacos and one taco al pastor. As always, the steak was juicy and well-seasoned. The pastor was very flavorful and seasoned. What sets these tacos apart as number one apart from other taco restaurants is how the meat is prepared and served. The meats are well-seasoned, not overpowering or not bland. The meats are chopped coarsely for bigger chunks, locking the juices within the meat as well as preserving the natural chewiness and resiliency you find in each bite of well-grilled meat. Tacos from other restaurants lack this because the meats are chopped finely. I rarely add any salsa onto these tacos because I like them as they are. Their corn tortillas are pressed and prepped right in front of you. The grilled onions served on the side were sweet and crunchy - a nice palate cleanser for the next flavorful taco. I am still amazed at the freshness and taste of their tacos.As always, there was a line and it was cold outside; but, it was still well worth it since I waited so long for Rubi&#39;s to reopen. Luckily, there were 4-5 people before me - not much of a wait. However, there were more people lining up after I got my food. Despite it being cold outside, these freshly made tacos, straight off from the grill, warms me up. I still have difficulty choosing how many steak tacos and tacos al pastor I want. Maybe I should get four tacos rather than three to make it even. Nothing beats Rubi&#39;s!"

No joke. I live a block away and I walk here every Sunday morning when I&#39;m free just to get my fix. There&#39;s no comparison to their freshly made tortillas that they make right in front of you. The texture and slight chewiness is just right. It&#39;s better to go earlier in the morning to beat the line. If you come 9am or earlier, you won&#39;t have to wait. Any time after 10am, you&#39;ll most likely have to wait at least 20-30 min. If you are starving, grab an elote or tamale from the other vendors as you wait in line (which are conveniently right next to and across from Rubi&#39;s). Go for the quesadilla, it has all the same contents as the taco but with melted cheese. My favorite is the huitlacoche quesadilla and the asada quesadilla with everything on it (lettuce, tomato, onion, cilantro). The bf is fond of the al pastor quesadilla. About 1.5 tacos is enough for me. The bf is about to explode after eating two. They are pretty large. Their homemade hot sauces are great, too. I&#39;m a fan of the salsa verde, however, the spiciness varies week to week so be careful of how much you pour on. So get your tacos and pop a squat on the street curb and enjoy!"

I prefer the salsa verde.  Worst part is it&#39;s only open on Sunday&#39;s, and since it&#39;s outside in the market, the winter months can be difficult.  I sure wish they had a location that was open all week!  Needless to say, i&#39;m addicted to Rubi&#39;s.. you can get awesome Taco&#39;s all over the city, but nothing compares to Rubi&#39;s..

People steal your shit in Chicago and especially in Humboldt Park. I am forever and ever grateful at this man&#39;s kindness and will forever support their local business."

We are right down the street. NO MORE.My boyfriend is extremely lactose-intolerant. I specified no cheese on our order via grubhub and his sandwich came with cheese. When I called, a man picked up and at first told me that a meatball sub didn&#39;t come with cheese. He then proceeded to ask two other cooks if they had put cheese on my order and they all said no. He told me I was lying. WHAT?? I even said he could take this sandwich back when they delivered the correct one. He told me that he didn&#39;t have time to remake my order, he had other orders and that I was again, lying. He said &#34;get a refund&#34; and when I asked if he was going to refund it for me he said &#34;You do it via grubhub. Call them. I can&#39;t help you.&#34;Needless to say I was super pissed &amp; had every right to be. After I let him know this, he sent me off with a &#34;f%^k you too.&#34; Awesome.Update: Just realized that the entire order was wrong. Where I ordered ravioli I now have a chicken sandwich (I think, looks very disgusting). I would call back and let them know but he&#39;ll probably say I was lying again."

It&#39;s an outrageous price for a large pizza but the reviews for this spot were good so I decided to give it a shot. When it gets here for a full hour ( this place is just blocks from me), the delivery driver says its $34. At this point I decided to just pay for it and try it out. Can you believe a $6 dollar delivery fee for just a few blocks.The pizza gets here and it&#39;s the worst I&#39;ve tried in my whole life. I&#39;m not exaggerating. The cheese is stale and the pepperoni was thick and gave the pizza a weird taste. The cheese was the most awful part aside from the crust. The whole pizza was thin and you really had to gnaw on it to get a bite out. Did I forget to mention they forgot to put the bacon I ordered with the pizza.I do not recommend, ever."

They offer delivery, but only up to kedzie, I&#39;m fine with it. Any ways, onto the food part.. that why you&#39;re reading this right?So first and foremost this place is perfect for the show Diners Drive ins and Dives. The reason for this is that it&#39;s actually situated in the back of a convenience store. Oddly enough this didn&#39;t deter me from trying out the pizza. It&#39;s only been two occasions in which I&#39;ve ordered and I have not been disappointed at all. The gentleman at the front is very friendly in person and on the phone ne makes you feel like you&#39;re part of the family just by his introduction and how he speaks to you which is rare in a business where food service is more about speed then qualityAs for the pizzas, I have only ordered one kind and it&#39;s because they cater to this particular type of pizza. I can tell you is all that this combination is genuinely delicious so my tip to you would be to try their pizza with Italian beef french fries and gardinaire. Sorry if I misspelled that last one.Next stop is their Arancini... enjoy!"

Sad and disappointed after all the good ratings on here.Here&#39;s an update to my review since I&#39;ve received a couple rude messages from the owner: the point of a review is to share your customer experience. It&#39;s not to just give compliments. I leave MANY positive reviews because I&#39;m having great experiences in Chicago. This was not one of them. If you&#39;re a business owner unprepared to hear what people really think, you should probably just stop checking Yelp.

When I finally confirmed on Yelp that it was here, I dropped by for some quick takeout. It&#39;s definitely smalltime. They only had one type of thin crust and one type of thick crust available for slice sale, not sure if that&#39;s always the case, but when I asked if there were any other varieties coming soon the guy behind the counter looked at me like like I had three heads, so I&#39;m thinking the limited choice is the norm. I got a thin crust sausage slice with a soda for $5. The slice was basically a quarter or fifth of a pizza, the equivalent of two of what I consider normal slice size, and more than I could eat in one sitting. This reminded me a lot of a mid-range New York slice, at least when looking at it from above, although the crust wasn&#39;t crispy enough, it was still sort of doughy and not as good as standard New York fare.Overall, if you order a pie or are okay with limited selection, it&#39;s not a bad option, and was a decent slice. I&#39;m glad I checked it out, and I expect I&#39;ll stop back in. It seemed like there was plenty of easy parking nearby. There&#39;s no seating. One could go to Humboldt or Wicker Park."

I came here around 7PM after a long flight from California and ordered the deep dish 12&#34; Chicago pizza (sausage, pepperoni, and cheese). There was no line and our total came out to be $22.44. The WestTown deep dish pizza caught my eye afterwards (sausage, bell peppers, mushrooms) and I regret not ordering that but the Chicago pizza was still phenomenal! The crust was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, the cheese was plentiful and just pouring out the pizza, and the contents were the best part - fresh and flavorful. Although the tomato sauce was a little bland and out of place compared to the rest of the rich ingredients. A slice of this deep dish pizza was enough to make me full, they really don&#39;t skimp on any of the ingredients. With the pizza itself I would have given the place 4 stars but the owner was so nice and courteous, he deserved 5 stars. He was accommodating to our order and very friendly.

The crust here isn&#39;t hand tossed, it&#39;s not blistered much, and it&#39;s not very crisp. It is clearly pre-manufactured (you can see the evidence of that on the crust itself). The cheese, sauce, and toppings are fine but not particularly flavorful. When I was there, they only offered pepperoni and sausage by the slice. I don&#39;t know if they have cheese slices as well from time to time, but it seems like a shame not to have that as an option.But hey, a pretty large slice plus a soda for $5, tax included, isn&#39;t a bad deal for a quick lunch or dinner. There&#39;s not a lot of room for eating in, but you can do it if you need to -- just a counter with some stools.I&#39;ll go back and try the deep dish. Perhaps that&#39;ll alter my opinion. But the thin crust is not even worth your attention if you actually want something resembling real NYC pizza."

Eight blocks in any direction, this is by far the best pizza by-the-slice place. I&#39;d take this place&#39;s deep dish over the Chicago staples (Giordanos, Lou&#39;s, Pizanos, whatever) any day. Plus, none of those places sell by the slice, and here you can get huge, deep dish slices are 5$ with soda after tax. I&#39;m going to go ahead and recommend the spinach and garlic. Usually when you get garlic on a pizzas it&#39;s cooked or roasted, but here there&#39;s a real strong flavor of raw garlic, which is way better.I haven&#39;t had thin crust, but I&#39;d assume it rocks. I haven&#39;t had the thin crust, so I&#39;m not sure how it measures up, but everything I&#39;ve had on the menu rocks, so, my assumption is it&#39;s great. Pasta with marinara is great. So&#39;s the arabiata .Also, the owner&#39;s super friendly, the kinda guy to remember you when you come in. It&#39;s always great to come here. You won&#39;t regret it."

And the sauce itself was goodThe being-picky:- The mozzarella was pretty thick and when taken home was not the best, very tough tasting- Chicken tenders -- I get it, they don&#39;t specialize in tenders, but they&#39;re pre-bought pre-made tenders.Overall, I liked it.  Not re-inventing the wheel, which I don&#39;t think they are intending to do.  Solid pizza choice if you&#39;re in the neighborhood.  The daily $5 pizza/soda special sounds like a great deal."

At one place, you have a crazy cheap slice that comes at the expense of it being stiff bread with more grease than toppings, while at another, you have to deal with limp slices that look emaciated and sad.West Town Pizza Shop just opened last month and already we&#39;ve been by several times to grab a pie and a couple of sides of garlic fries. My lady loves the place because the friendly owner and the food, itself, reminds her of the spots she used to frequent in her home state of New Jersey (say what you will about Jersey, but where she lived, only 20 minutes from Port Authority, she had no shortage of great pizzerias). West Town dabbles on both sides of the &#39;za world, specializing in both thin crust and Chicago stuffed, a very neutral position that&#39;s likely to serve them well.Being right up the street from us is one huge perk, but even if we were farther away, delivery would be our go to option, because trust me, this place trumps the other places in the neighborhood.This&#39;ll definitely be a recurring spot when dinner time rolls around!"

It&#39;s all really solid but the sandwiches are really where this place shines outside of the pizza. The ciabatta bread is freaking perfect (I make bread and lived in Europe for years, so I&#39;m a bit picky about bread) and the topping to bread ratio also is just right.What makes all of this so cool is that the owner is a nice guy who loves to chat and cares about his food a lot. We&#39;ve had chats about dough and making the perfect crust and I love that I&#39;m getting food from someone who actually cares.

Nice guy checks the delivery tracker- no problem. Pie is on its way.Food arrives in no time- literally still within the hour as originally promised, even after the mixup. Delivery guy is incredibly friendly and apologetic.On to the food- poppers are above average but not outstanding. That&#39;s cool though, they hit the spot. The chèvre pizza, though, with red sauce &amp; chèvre &amp; mozz &amp; fresh basil presented in a sweet chiffonade, is fabulous. I&#39;ve always had a difficult time finding solid thin crust in the neighborhood and while this wasn&#39;t the cracker crust I was truly craving (this is a bit thicker than cottage style and chewy), it was great. Nice balance of ingredients and the goat cheese really hit the spot.Two items isn&#39;t a worthy assessment of a full menu, but the awesome customer service and delicious tasting of their offering totally warrants a full five stars.

It doesn&#39;t sound like anythiing special but it&#39;s really delicious feta with walnuts, some fresh basil, cucumber and tomato. The bread they serve it on is super crusty and fresh and they use high quality olive oil. The servings are huge and I could have easily made two meals of it if I hadn&#39;t been famished. The salads are also very good. I&#39;m excited to try the other vegetarian menu items. Being vegetarian it is exciting to have numerous options to choose from. This place is delicious and the quality of the ingredients is high- give it a go!"

I tried both the thick and thin and have to say by far the best was a spinach and bacon deep dish.

For those of us who live west of Western off of North Avenue, know that we don&#39;t have many options for good food. The place serves whole Pizzas and by the slice. And the slices are huge. But don&#39;t think because the slices are big the quality is not there. The place has been only open for a couple of months and I&#39;ve been there 4 times already. Besides Pizza, they offer, sandwiches, salads, cheesy garlic bread, calamari and cheesecake. The owner/cook has put a lot of thought and energy into the food and it shows. The restaurant is located inside the Habibi Grocery store right off of North Avenue. Supposedly the owner has plans to expand the place and add outdoor seating. I hope that is the case because the only draw back to West Town is that it doesn&#39;t have much seating. But that&#39;s minor critique. West Town Pizza serves dine in food and take out prices."

I took them up on their offer and I have to say my second experience at GreenRiver was MUCH better.The food was fabulous. We started with the oysters which were amazing.  I&#39;m not even an oyster fan, but these were so fresh and delicious that I couldn&#39;t help but eat them. We also had the salt cod fritters which were also good (although the salad on top didn&#39;t add much). After that we had the cod which was cooked to the perfect temperature and had a lobster sauce underneath that was to die for. Next we had the sea urchin pasta and the wagyu, both of which were great!  The food still came out somewhat slowly, but thankfully this time around everything was at the right temperature.Also, don&#39;t miss the drinks here. GreenRiver does fancy cocktails well. Both times I visited I had stellar drinks that my server picked out for me. And speaking of our server, he was was great!  Very attentive and was good about recommending various items for us.I&#39;ll definitely be back for both food and drinks!"

Nothing specialOcean trout - mediocreI went back a week ago with a girlfriend strictly for their cocktails and was amazed again. Bartender was very professional and courteous.Warning: hidden location. Like everyone mentioned, odd place to have a rooftop since it&#39;s inside the NU hospital.

It&#39;s more fun to sit at the bar. The bartenders are like mad scientists, very meticulous in preparing your cocktail concoctions (they may quiz you before to see what you like). There are certain types of drinks that only come in designated particular glasses. They have over 25 bitters, none of which are labeled but the bartenders just know them by where they are placed in the row and by color and viscosity.The menu book feels like you are reading a horoscope as it separates cocktails by spirit, and off the wall names for the libations. all the drinks were tasty including the one that had garam masala in it.

The inside is still hip and clean and has a neat vibe. The small plates and apps were the highlight of the meal, the cheese plate and duck were both fantastic. Cocktails were also great, and there are a ton of them to choose from.The bad: The food, overall, was disappointing. $28 for &#34;suckling pig&#34; that was overcooked and tough, too fatty, and unfulfilling. The desserts were good but again underwhelming. For the prices, I expect better. The service was extremely slow and not attentive, even though they were friendly.

We put in drink orders, then the waitress came back about 10 minutes later to tell me they were out of the drink I wanted.  I ultimately got the square shooter, which was a very complex drink, though not a lot for the price (especially compared to the size of the other drinks at our table).Our table split the cheese plate and duck confit for appetizers, and both were very good.  I had the saffron spaghetti for my entree, which was amazing, and my favorite food of the night.  For dessert we split the cherry jubilee and the plum among the table.  Both were good, but not as great as expected.  The popcorn on the cherry jubilee was a good flavor, though it got soggy from the panna cotta.We were seated inside, as it had rained earlier in the day, though we did get to go out on the patio after dinner for a bit, and I can see why this place gets rave reviews for the views.  It was extremely loud inside, however.Overall, the food was delicious, although dessert was a bit of a letdown.  They&#39;re known for their cocktails and that showed as well.  It was quite pricey, though, and I just couldn&#39;t get past the slow service: extremely long waits between courses and minimal check-in from our waitress.  I might go back for drinks and apps to experience patio, but even that would be a pricey outing."

They are all in New York City except for GreenRiver. Take Union Square Hospitality Group restauranteur Danny Meyer and the folks that created New York&#39;s award winning bar Dead Rabbit (one of my top favorite bars in the country) and you have an amazing combination with a great foot into Chicago&#39;s restaurant scene. As you are directed and seated with the cocktail menu, you cannot help yourself and be amazed by the level of details of each drink that tells the story of Chicago. Beyond the cocktail menu, try to stump the bartenders with rare pre-prohibition cocktail. They know them all. Now lead by the award winning mixologist Julia Momose, expect even more in the coming months with the opening of the Annex Bar. The food. Danny Meyer knows how to pick a team to create an amazing menu that feels like they were creations from Michelin Star awarded Gramercy Tavern in New York City. From the Trout Rillette, Whitefish Tartine, and Foie Gras Terrine to start. To the Saffron Spagetti and Slagel Family Farm Beef Steak (which can be shared). You cannot go wrong with these choices. Let&#39;s not forget where this restaurant is located. The heart of Streeterville with a view. There is a line of outdoor seating with a view of Lake Michigan. GreenRiver is a great hidden restaurant that will not fail you. It is a great date spot as well as for small groups.

That being said, if you absolutely hate cucumber I would avoid ordering this dish as the &#34;sauce&#34; was significantly cucumber-infused. The toast combined with the trout paste was good, but perhaps not worth the price.For entrees, the ocean trout was decent as well. What really threw me off was the saffron spaghetti--I ordered it once I saw that it featured uni (or sea urchin). However, I&#39;m sad to say the spaghetti tasted undercooked and rubbery. It definitely wasn&#39;t just me and my usual picky self--my partner said he could&#39;ve cooked better pasta with plain ol&#39; Prego sauce and meatballs (although to be fair that&#39;s perhaps up for debate).Again, I would come back here--but maybe just for drinks and dessert."

Thinly sliced purple potatoes, a half a hard boiled egg, shaved radish, quartered kalamatas, and the perfect amount of dressing over fresh rocket were exactly what the doctor ordered. Also had a side of French fries (hot and crispy) and oh wow! The cocktail! It was a &#34;Noble&#34; something off the brunch menu; a stirred sherry, cynar, and vermouth cocktail on the rocks.

I&#39;m going to warn you and show you the menu.&#34;  And it&#39;s true it is more limited than their lunch and dinner menu, but it seemed like a weird way to invite people to eat there.  I assume others may have had a similar experience because when we said we still wanted to go inside, we were one of the only tables.  So we sat outside on their deck with our own private, wonderful view of the city.After that hiccup, it was great.  We were all in agreement that our favorite dish was the cheddar biscuits with sausage gravy and fried chicken.  The gravy was rich, creamy and hearty and the cheddar biscuit was light and with a cheddar zing.For drinks, each drink has a story behind it, which is super fun for table conversation.  The cocktails are separated with different &#34;personality types&#34; (the &#34;smooth operators&#34;, those who &#34;thrive on the spice of life&#34;, etc.), which are also fun to see who chooses what.  I tried the Hellcat (a vodka-based cocktail with chocolate, grapefruit, apricot, and lemon) and the MacSwiney (with cognac, creme de noyaux, vanillla, kirsch, and ... mascarpone cheese?!).  Both were unique and delicious!  They also have highballs &amp; a full list of spirits if cocktails aren&#39;t your thing.Definitely a fun place with great views to go hang out with friends for a fancier night out!"

The drinks were great and the food yummy, as in previous trips. The noise level was also much better/lower, but I wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to where we were sitting - by the open kitchen - or because it wasn&#39;t so crowded.I didn&#39;t give it 5 stars because of the expense. For 2 of us it was still over $175... a bit steep for happy hour dinner and drinks. I would come back but probably just for their fabulous whiskey drinks and one app."

I celebrated my one year anniversary with boyfriend here and it was such a special night. The food was delicious, the place looked beautiful, and very friendly staffs! One of the waiters asked if we would like something to drink to celebrate to which we replied we dont drink alcohol. A while later he came back and surprised us with 2 small glasses of complementary none alcoholic beverages from the bar. That was a very nice gesture of the waiter. I couldn&#39;t ask for a better evening to celebrate that special day! No complaint whatsoever!"

Yes, Green River is in the 18th floor of Northwestern Hospital but don&#39;t let that ruin your impression of this hidden gem.They have a very eclectic drink menu and use a lot of different exotic spirits including rye vodka, wheat whisky and Japanese whiskies. They make their own syrups and bitters and have rows of bottles at the bar. They also carry various liqueurs  including rose and one that tastes like curry and they certainly use them in their cocktails.I forget names but I tried 2 drinks, Eddie something and another with Hibiki, a blended Japanese whisky. Both were pretty good but I enjoyed the one with Hibiki. Drinks are a tad bit pricy so be prepared to spend a few $$ for the view and ambience. I plan to be back on a nicer day and sit in their outdoor patio."

I wanted to see what it was all about given the collaboration between the two guys who started the Dead Rabbit in NYC (which is basically on the top of the list for world&#39;s best bar) and Danny Meyer&#39;s Union Square Hospitality Group. My friend had high recommendations for the cocktails at the Dead Rabbit so I knew I had to try GreenRiver.I&#39;m by no means a cocktail aficionado, pretty far from it actually, but I really liked my drink - Haley&#39;s Comet. It had a great pineapple flavor to it even though the drink has passion fruit and lemon with no pineapple in sight. Pretty interesting how that tasted but for someone who always needs a splash of fruit in drinks to balance out the alcohol, this was a good option.My friend and I happened to arrive between service hours so they only had 4 options for food bites. We opted for the pork terrine which I enjoyed once I actually tasted it. It was a perfect spread to go on top of the crostini and had just the right amount of salt. I really wanted more of the salad though as I would&#39;ve liked to top off my crostinis with more greens. They were, however, very nice at giving us more of the hot, toasty crostinis at no additional charge after we had finished off the original 6 pieces but still had terrine left over.I will say that the homemade salted caramel that comes with your check at the end of the meal was a huge highlight. It&#39;s so amazingly soft with perfect flavor, doesn&#39;t stick to your teeth and completely melts in your mouth! It&#39;s everything that I dream of in a salted caramel.Overall, anyone who enjoys cocktails will be a fan of GreenRiver. I was honestly more impressed by the pork terrine and our great service from the staff and would gladly return for the food."

The cocktail list was very very long. I really didn&#39;t like the first one but the second try I hit a home run with a spiced cocktail that had an egg in it.The duck was awesome but the halibut entree was very dry.No one came to help us after we were sat for 27 minutes. Lots of people walked by, making no eye contact nor responding to my requests for help. Eventually I had to get up and walk over to a guy who was polishing wine glasses and tell him we had not been helped and that I was upset about it. After he came everything was fine.I asked for a table outside when I made the reservations about a week in advance and said in the notes that it was an important birthday dinner. They sat us inside infront of a bus cart of empty dirty plates and glasses. There were several open seats elsewhere and outside.They really need to read the comments in their Opentable requests. I asked to move but they said no.Two stars because there is a view and the duck was good. Otherwise not planning to return."

It&#39;s located in the outpatient building so the lobby was pretty quiet when I walked in at 6pm and I was worried the place would be dead. Not so. There were a good amount of people there which made it lively but not loud.I wanted a particular kind of drink and the bartender seemed really interested in helping me find what I was looking for.  The cocktails aren&#39;t cheap but they&#39;re delicious. The views from the balcony are amazing so definitely go outside if the weather cooperates. The views are reason enough to go to this bar, but the great drinks always help!If you park in the garage at 259 E Erie they&#39;ll validate it for you. Be careful, there are many garages around the hospital."

The service was excellent, and the food was nicely crafted with much thought put into the ingredients, preparation, and presentation.  The cocktail menu is more expressive than i have ever seen.  Extremely original and masterful. I would say the two cocktails I chose were only average in flavor and strength. The portions were fairly small. On the expensive end, but definitely justifiable."

I&#39;m giving GreenRiver 4.5 stars and here&#39;s why.Location/Decor - while the restaurant may be located inside one of Northwestern Memorial Hospital many building in my hood, I never once felt like I was in a hospital building while dining. The layout of the restaurant was nice and allowed for an easy flow of traffic, provided a great view to those lucky enough to get a table by the window and gave those sitting at the tables with the long booth opposite the windows space between the tables so you won&#39;t feel like the other patrons can hear every word you say.Service - our server Brett was attentive, friendly and gave us excellent recommendations on drinks and food. Definitely try and sit in his section of you can.Drinks - were refreshing with interesting mixtures of ingredients. I recommend trying the Hellcat.Food - was magically delicious. I enjoyed all, but one of the dishes we had. I think I&#39;ll be dreaming about the Pork Belly for the next couple of days!* French Fries - how can you not love fries?! 4 stars* Whitefish Tartine - utterly divine to the tastebuds. 5 stars* Hamachi Crudo - a beautiful dish, but just didn&#39;t hit the mark for me. 2.5 stars* Pork Belly - OMG so good, so flavorful, soooo worth ordering again the next time I done here. 5 stars* Ocean Trout - my date had this and he really enjoyed it. When it came out the presentation was so pretty it made it hard to cut into, but he&#39;s so glad he did because it was amazing. 4.5 stars* Potato Gnocchi - we decided to be greedy and split the gnocchi and I&#39;m so glad we did. It was fluffy deliciousness with a mix of mushroom, black truffle and Parmesan that was a perfect combination. 4.5 starsDessert - while we were pleasantly stuffed we made sure we saved room for desert.* Root Beer Panna Cotta - I&#39;m usually on the fence when it comes to Panna Cotta, but the Root Beer flavor and the Parsnip Ice Cream had me tastebuds skipping on that fence in pure delight. 4 stars*Chocolate Ganache Tart - must try this dessert, you won&#39;t be sorry (if you are well I apologize). That&#39;s all that needs to be said. 5 stars"

I made a special reservation here for an engagement celebration dinner a few months ago, and it couldn&#39;t been more perfect and romantic. My lady works in a hospital, so I was very excited about this venue.As other reviewers have noted, it&#39;s not the easiest place to find since it&#39;s within the hospital, but that&#39;s part of the beauty and surprise of it. It must be what people who grew up in the 20&#39;s felt like entering a speakeasy... those bland hospital walls morph into an incredibly intimate and sexy ambiance when those elevator doors open.I emailed the GM Will Sears in advance of my visit, hoping he could make some special arrangements for me, and both Will and the rest of the staff took amazing care of us. They let us out onto their beautiful deck with our photographer for a photo shoot (their suggestion!), sat us at a beautiful private table facing the Chicago skyline (their tables actually face the glass, very cool), and the food was really creative, delicious and beautifully presented.The management and staff here are on point, among the best I&#39;ve ever experienced. They are caring, thoughtful, and have mastered the art of hosting. I wouldn&#39;t even think twice about booking a major event here.GreenRiver, thank you so much for making our evening so special and memorable."

Serious thought was put into every detail.  Danny Meyer and his team here in Chicago does not disappoint.  I don&#39;t normally engage in alcoholic consumption on a weekday, but the never ending list of hand crafted cocktails (which they are known for) made me curious!  I opted for the Comiskey park - calvados, Marie framboise, picon, amaro nonino, almond, allspice, and creole bitters.  Slightly smokey and sweet and bitter all at the same time.  Warm feeling in my bones, beautifully crafted ice sphere.Gnocchi lightly carmelized outside, mushrooms with great buttery flavor and tang, creamy slightly nutty green sauce.Dessert, moist and fluffy chiboust cake, lemon notes in the sorbet, sugared cranberries with the right amount of tart, shredded phyllo nest, grapefruit pulp bits.  This elegant plated beauty captivated my eyes and my palate. A+ to the pastry chef and the newly hired pastry cook (as I&#39;m told) from Acadia!"

Well, color me pleasantly surprised.So far, I&#39;ve only gone for lunch, but I&#39;m already making plans to return for dinner sooner rather than later.It&#39;s on the 18th floor of the Lavin Pavilion of NMH, but as soon as you step off the elevator, you&#39;ll forget you&#39;re in a building that&#39;s actually a hospital. It&#39;s so chic and inviting that I wanted to stay all afternoon.I started with a delicious gin-based cocktail named Haley&#39;s Comet. So crisp and refreshing. It was citrusy, and effervescent, with lemon, kaffir lime, bitters, and cava.For lunch, I had the express soup and sandwich combo, which rotates often (not sure if it&#39;s daily or weekly). Initially, I had had my heart set on the parisian gnocchi, until our server gushed about the onion soup with parmesan crisp, served with a grilled cheese sandwich of Comte, cheddar, and garlic aioli on miche. Then all bets were off.It was the kind of lunch that hits every craving I have: warm, melty cheese, rich, savory broth, toasted bread, and a zippy aioli.I also tried a bite of my companion&#39;s burger, which was also first-rate. Very similar to Au Cheval. I did find the cheddar dust on the frites kind of overpowering, but I liked that they tried to do something fun.I skipped dessert in favor of another cocktail, but you can bet your booty I&#39;ll be trying one of those on my next visit.The space is beautiful. The staff is polite, from the minute you reserve your table until you leave. And the food? Well, it&#39;s pretty terrific too.I liked everything about this place."

I came here with a few work friends and enjoyed a small lunch of cherry jubilee (popcorn pan Acosta, pistachio cake, and bourbon icecream), Lyonnaise (duck confit, poached egg, fine herbs), and Farro (scallion, burrito and almonds). First of all, the atmosphere is quite breathtaking, as we sat on the 18th floor and had a beautiful view of the city. The star of the show was definitely the dessert, with a perfect blend of all of the ingredients in the most indulgent and guilt-ridden way possible. The duck confit was unfortunately incredibly dry and made the entire dish less than desirable, despite the perfectly poached eggy goodness. The Farro was decent and I think the burrito and the almonds really added a nice crunch for the whole meal. Overall, the service, ambiance and food made this place a decent visit, and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t have to pay for the meal since it looks like the three of us spent nearly $120 without any alcoholic beverages or appetizers.Food 3 starsPrice 2-3 starsAmbiance: 4 starsService: 3 stars"

I mean, who expects a stellar restaurant with a fantastic cocktail menu on top of a hospital? It&#39;s completely strange, but it totally works.Located on the 18th floor of one of the Northwestern Hospital buildings, Green River serves delectable fare with a great view of the city. Now you can have your doctor&#39;s appointment in the same building and then go up to the 18th floor and have a fabulous drink to neutralize the experience or celebrate the fact that that wart-like thing on your inner thigh is just a skin tag, not herpes. #winningThe thought of writing about the cocktails makes me excited and jump up and down the sofa like Tom Cruise on the Oprah show. I will not delve in to details - mainly because I don&#39;t remember all the ingredients that went in to the cocktails I had - but I will say this is probably the most elaborate/ complex cocktail menu I have seen in Chicago lately. Granted, I don&#39;t get out much (I am held hostage by work in East Africa), but this cocktail menu is just out of this world fabulous. The drinks are arranged by grain, making it easy to pick what you like. Werk it!All the food is spectacular, but one dish deserves a special mention. The foie gras!! As if foie itself is not fatty enough, GreenRiver serves a slab of sautéed foie on bread pudding. Why yes, I will take my foie with a side of Lipitor. It is probably the most delicious thing you have eaten lately. Good thing, this restaurant is in a hospital. You may go downstairs and get a prescription for Lipitor after dinner. Or if you are anything like me, you will order a second serving. Go big or go home, right?Of all the places I ate in Chicago during my recent trip, I will remember GreenRiver fondly. In fact, it was so good that we returned twice during our 6 day stay in Chicago. It is perfect for date night, business dinners (we took my boss one night), and catching up with friends. Don&#39;t let the strange hospital location deter you from visiting GreenRiver. Get there asap...and while you are there, get that physical done at Northwestern Hospital. When was the last time you checked your balls or breasts? Do it!"

They do not have heaters outside so if it&#39;s springtime bring a jacket.Note:  The cocktail menu is different for the Terrace than inside the restaurant but you can order off the inside menu at request.Cocktails - fresh, well balanced and tasty, my friend orders one with carrot juice that was absolutely deliciousSnapper Crudo - delicious, the citrus zest makes it, I wish they used watermelon radishes instead though for a prettier dishHalibut - with asparagus, spring garlic and fumet blanc - really goodRhubarb Crisp with vanilla ice cream - yummy but needs more ice creamThe service was the only downside.

Really craving a 3.5 star on this one, but I&#39;ll round up to 4 since the place is new and service can improve.We showed up on a Thursday about 8:45 for dinner, but didn&#39;t make a reservation as we checked opentable a bit before and they seemed to have plenty of times left and we didn&#39;t want to be in a schedule. The hostess seemed to be pretty surprised we didn&#39;t have a booking and said she needed to walk to floor in order to tell us how long the wait would be. We said we would go elsewhere if it would be awhile and she couldn&#39;t even say if it would be more like 15 mins or an hour. We ended up grabbing a drink at the bar and was 15 min wait so no biggie, just weird.Started with cocktails and the bartender was really good at explaining the menu and just offering a suggestion if you tell him what you like. The drink menu is a little confusing as it&#39;s split up by wheat, barley, juniper etc, but I&#39;m not on top of what alcohols are derived from so nice to get some help. The bar is also really big so would be a great place to just come for a cocktail.   I had the Haley&#39;s Comet - really good passion fruit and sparkling type.For dinner we got seated at a high top table, which we weren&#39;t super crazy about. Just don&#39;t like high tops for a nice dinner.  We were seated for a bit before the waiter came over and we weren&#39;t even given menus. So finally got menus, but no commentary from the waiter asking if we&#39;d been there before, explaining the menu at all. Just pretty poor for a new restaurant and the menu was kind of unclear if the plates were meant for share plates or what. We ordered a couple starters and after we decided he says well they are small, you probably need more. So yeah just could def improve the experience.Ok so now done with the complaining and on to the food. Really loved everything we had. Food was not only beautiful, but so delicious. I even took a pic of my main even though I hate to be that gal!For starters we shared the fluke crudo, octopus, and farro salad. All were great, but the crudo was def my fav. Just super fresh and citrusy, loved it. For my main I had the pork belly and it was delicious and very beautiful plating. Had a few great sauces on the plate, but everything just went together beautifully.If they can work on some kinks and provide some better service, this could def be a five star place."

They said they wanted to give us a table with a view . Ok well , we were seated behind the bar at the waiter station with tables next to us that were empty of people  but with food and drinks not cleaned up and dirty? All the tables were empty of people so I don&#39;t understand the wait or why they left the tables un bussed . It&#39;s a shame . I&#39;m a surgeon and never get a chance to go out and was with a political rep . We were dressed and looked to the nines too. We had a choice of many restaurants and this was a poor representation of what Chicago dining is supposed to be at this caliber and embarrassing for a person trying to entertain  . We never received an apology and I wish we had just left. Utterly disappointed. My companion had to drink four cocktails to not be livid and start texting all of the political world.

I do not give this place five stars lightly!When I arrived, I was greeted very warmly and directed to the bar. I did some research on the drinks and knew that their mixed drinks was their specialty. I have been to some mixed drink classes so I have been told what to look out for with real professionals. These bartenders are some of the best I have ever seen: friendly, knowledgeable, and  knew the &#34;moves&#34; of making a mean drink. I knew something was going to be good when I saw that they had at least three different kinds of ice! I got the Easy Eddie and was not disappointed. For dinner, I had the 63 E. Adams which I thought I would like more, but it was ok. Eh, my fault.We were then seated promptly and our server came. I think it was a little busy tonight so we wished she came over sooner or more often, but when she did, she was nothing, but professional and friendly. We were a table of 8 20 somethings and 30 somethings. She gave us recommendations and answered every one of our questions! The reason why I overlooked the slow service is that the food was outstanding. We got a bunch of appitizers including cheese, octopus, and beef tartar. All of it was some of the best I have ever eaten, especially the beef. For dinner, I got the Suckling Pig which was like three large pieces of perfectly cooked bacon. This was the real star for me as it also came with green beans which I happily ate (I hate green beans).I wished my table got dessert, but we got another drink and took it on the beautifl outdoor patio! This place really has the view of the skyline and lake. We even saw some of the Fireworks from Navy Pier! I went with the Easy Eddie again. Did not disappoint!If you are looking for an extra special night or a date night, come to GreenRiver. It hits all the right spots. Very Midwestern, very upscale, and drinks that make you proud to be a Chicagoian!"

My only gripe is that I wish it had opened this spring so I could have enjoyed the patio longer!I came here for a late lunch with a friend on a beautiful October day. We sat on the terrace and the views were incredible. The terrace itself is beautifully done and quite spacious. There are succulents and small landscaped areas along with couches, tables and views of the lake.The service throughout our meal was timely and the waitress was very thorough and descriptive. We started with the beef tartare which was a nice sized portion and good for sharing. We then moved onto the farro salad with burrata which was delicious and very unique in flavor. Our final dish was the Parisian gnocchi and it was outstanding. Perfectly cooked and the sauce was so good-some of the best gnocchi I think I&#39;ve ever had.I cannot wait to come back for cocktails and will be doing so at the first chance I get!"

We also had the fries.Drinks: My husband had the old fashioned. I had the Lincoln Park and Lake Whiskey, which I didn&#39;t like either.I had high hopes for this place because of the Dead Rabbit connection, but this is no Dead Rabbit not even close.  I will hop a flight to get my fix!"

The approach, through long hospital-like corridors is a bit weird, but once there you can settle in and enjoy some interesting small plates and a lot of cocktails.One word of caution is that wine offerings are pretty limited, so it&#39;s definitely a cocktail place. I liked that there were a lot of choices that weren&#39;t overly sweet.Food was good, even if there were no real home runs. Service was very knowledgeable and helpful."

The Ocean Trout was one of the best seafood entree I&#39;ve tried honestly. The trout was evenly seared to a golden crispy crust over a warm buttery sauce. The microgreens added a hint of raw vegetable juice to the English peas and mushrooms. Excellent."

The absolute pinnacle of cocktail bars in Chicago and possibly beyond. I would not be surprised if Annex at GreenRiver actually surpasses The Dead Rabbit (Current Owners and operators of GR and Annex) and The Artesian in London (currently ranked #1 in the world) as the best the world has to offer. They have only been open for a few weeks but everything seems so well polished as if they have been open for years. That might be a testament to Julie Momose, who is an industry vet that has The Aviary, The Office, and Green River on her resume, who put the cocktail program together. You know your in good hands. She may not know me from two shits in a sink but she unknowingly has served me like a VIP.If you think of Green River as a modern, bright, airy place to drink and eat then Annex is its dark, quiet, mysterious cousin. Nestled down a long hallway marked by absolutely nothing on the door, thanks for the hostesses that know where they are going, you are literally transported into a world where you might feel only the elite are allowed , yet the average David can come in off the street and get a drink. Just make sure you brought quite a bit of cash. The atmosphere is dark, quiet, and cozy. Awesome date place or for a true cocktail connoisseur.Those drinks. Each drink is in the $16-$21 range. As you are seated you are presented with a sturdy wooden box with 12 or so slots that contain heavy duty cards. They are organized by lighter more approachable flavors in front, stronger more spirit-forward in the back.  Each card has your drink name, ingrediants, price and Spice. Spice you say? Yes! Each drink is created around a particular spice that brings the flavor of your drink alive. So the focus is more on a spice than a spirit. Such spices include Mace, Cardamom, Green Peppercorn, sesame, etc. I must say my first drink The Law-Maker with Sesame was a Euphoric experience, hands down one of the best drinks I have ever had, it seriously challenges Dragons of the West at Sable for best cocktail I&#39;ve ever had and I&#39;ve had a lot. After my first sip I had to almost back away and say &#34;where did you come from&#34; . It was strong and bitter with an ever so slight sweetness brought to be by the Sesame . A huge spherical iceberg sits in the middle all godly-like. It&#39;s a beautiful piece of art. There may be some women in this world that look that good but not many. My second drink was the Six Bit, a sweeter more after dinner drink type, but it&#39;s smooth silky texture made it go down quite easily. Lastly, Supernova was a drink similar to Law-Maker with a less sweet undertone. Again a Euphoric experience with a beautiful spherical iceberg. Speaking of ice they have an A+ Ice game brought by Julia, who seems to have a thing for icebergs (asymmetrical spheres of jagged ice) that she often shapes herself. It is a beautiful thing to behold.Overall the quality of drinks is unmatched. They do not have any fancy gimmicks or even many fancy pieces of glassware . Here everything is about the flavor of your drink and making sure every customer feels elite. So we&#39;ll done thanks for the awesome experience. 6 stars if I could!"

However everything that is in their power is done to make up for that.Once you get up to 18th floor you enter a dining fairytale. You enter a trendy and absolutely stunning space with a beautiful terrace! Excellent service doesn&#39;t even cover the full extent of what you receive! Our main waiter not only knew the menu, he knew what ingredients went into every dish, having a few vegetarians and a pregnant girl with us - he was able to answer the most unexpected questions with immaculate precision. The other staff members appeared silently to clear the table and bring out items at a perfect time, leaving us wishing for nothing else without having to ask for a thing!***When reserving through Open Table, I settled for the only available time, and later found out that it did not work for our friends. I called them and they accommodated without any fuss! They had our table ready as soon as we arrived even though it was a Saturday night and they were VERY busy!Obviously, those of you who read my other reviews know that they wouldn&#39;t get 5 stars if their cooking wasn&#39;t truly remarkable and it certainly was!We had a cheese plate, whitefish terrine (absolutely fabulous) chilled pea soup with smoked salmon (!!!), trout and halibut (both crispy on the outside and just poached inside) The fish arrived dressed up with unique sauces and spring peas and sprouts, prepared to maintain their vibrant coloring and their crunchy texture. Yum!!!I was also pleased that I didn&#39;t have to sit there and wait for my tea to brew (common practice which I find very annoying) They brought out my tea in a pretty glass pot, with a wonderful aroma, completely ready for consumption, at the drinkable temperature!Everything about this place was set up for a perfect evening, timely and delicious. We will be back!"

The drink menu is so extensive that we will certainly be back to try more. The bartender was also really nice and helpful in recommending drinks.The only reason I left off a star is we thought the drinks could have been a little bigger especially for the price.Overall, definitely worth checking out for drinks and possibly food although they have a small food menu so look beforehand to make sure they have something you like."

I&#39;m a gin girl, and the American Woman was the perfect blend of sweet with a slight bitter finish that I loved. The gin really got to shine. I ordered the pork belly for dinner and just about died it was so good. Incredibly flavorful with excellent garnishes and purée to pair with it! I can&#39;t wait to come back to Chicago and visit again.5/18/16 UPDATEStill exceptional. Had the Haley&#39;s Comet this time, and a rum cocktail with Mary in the name.

The decor was nice, the bar was hopping, the outdoor deck and views will be wonderful in better weather.But.....the drink menu is weird. Hard to navigate. The drinks look fancy-shmancy but honestly r not that tasty. Very pricy. Trying too hard.  My $16 tiny cocktail was a huge disappointment. Can i get a beer or a vodka?  I don&#39;t know.  I can&#39;t read the menu.Restaurant is small.  High-top tables near the bar and a few tables near the windows on a very cold January night. Brrrr.  After requesting a table change or more heat from 3 different people, we relocated ourselves.Menu?  No rhyme or reason. Nothing flowed. Hard to pair starters with salads with mains.  Our waiter Justin seemed ill-trained.  Maybe it was his first day--he forgot to bring the cheese and crisps to the table. Sloooooow service!--we were starving by the time our tiny $18 salad arrived. Hard to choose between a pasta, a $100 steak, a meh burger, a fish. This menu needs serious tweaking.Our bill was over $200.  At these prices one would think a manager would be circulating.  After Justin brought our cheese and crisps at the end of the meal we asked for a manger and Jessica stopped by our table.  She seemed unable to understand our concerns--that the training was weak, the service was careless, and the food did not stand out in any way from any other place in town. She offered us a round of after dinner drinks, and disappeared.  Rachel the bar tender tried her best to salvage the night for us and got the highest marks of the night.Bottom line....I will be back because I live nearby and I will check out the outdoor space.  I will probably just come for drinks and order something normal like wine or beer and call it a day. I think as a new restaurant, in a bldg where u will be very hard to  find, you really need to step up your game in this food city. Too much competition for a lackluster performance."

The views from the rooftop are amazing, you get the lake, city, and everything in between. But that was the only good thing about this place. The bartender at the outdoor bar was serving  another guy who worked there the entire time he was making our drink. In his defense, his shift had ended so it wasn&#39;t so outrageous that he was drinking, but it was unprofessional that they were just sitting there talking about what annoying customers had come in for the lunch seating, how bad their tips had been that day, etc. it&#39;s just not classy to let the servers drink at the bar, even if they are not on the clock.The drinks were awful. I got a vodka martini with a twist which is really hard to mess up, but they did. First the drink was warm, second it was served in a warm plastic cup and finally the bartender measured the shot in a shot glass so as to not over pour.  When I&#39;m paying $8 for a drink, go ahead and measure the shot, that&#39;s fair, but that brings me to the next ridiculous part - the martini was $19. A one shot, poorly made, warm martini for $19!My husbands old fashioned was equally bad with the same one shot problem and his cost $18. All in, with a 10% tip we spent $45 on two awful drinks. All the tables had dirty glasses on them and old beer cans so we were forced to sit at a table with a bunch of other people&#39;s old drinks in them. They didn&#39;t clear them for over twenty five minutes.We live downtown and we are used to downtown prices- I&#39;ve paid $18 for a martini before, but at that price, it needs to be the best damn martini I&#39;ve ever had, and this was far from it.Stay away- the views really are not worth it."

Just watching them make them is an experience.No not every drink is that pricey but the one I wanted was and it was divine.

Luckily, we stopped by before a big rush so we were able to grab a standing table without a problem.The drinks were very unique. I liked how the menus explained the history behind each cocktail, interesting stuff.

Oysters to start were gorgeous - the house rose mignonette is incredible. Had the whitefish tartine, chicken oysters, fluke, scallop, octopus, and saffron spaghetti. Would handsdown recommend any of these dishes. The hot sauce with the chicken was a nice highlight as well as the crispy chickpeas with the octopus.The drinks were fabulous, and while there is nothing wrong with the coctail list, make sure to not neglect their boozy sodas.I will also say as long time industry people, we&#39;re usually easy to impress, but the small details also get noticed. I mentioned it was our anniversary when the reservationist called to confirm, and I noticed she added it to our notes. We were wished a happy anniversary three different times by the staff and had a phenomenal table view to boot.

Food is good, service is competent, but ambience is a minus 7. This restaurant is literally located in a northwestern hospital building that is normally inhabited by doctors, researchers and patients. The building , neighborhood --and restaurant-- have all the charm of a medical facility.There are so many locations in Chicago with great charm and ambience, why would Danny Meyer put a place here ?  Would he do that in NYC?Bathrooms dirty and poorly maintained.  True definition of Good vs bad restaurantMeyers &#34;no tip&#34; policy doesn&#39;t apply here. Management was quick to reject that idea and explain it away as function of NYC min wage policy.

Each plate is a work of art. For dinner, we shared the halbut with summer squash and the saffron spaghetti. I couldnt stop taking pictures of everything! Nor could I pick my favorite dish because they were all so equally mouthwatering. Oh and dessert was the sage ice cream with some sort of cake-whatever it was, mindblowing!My only criticism of this restaurant is the lousy name. It reminds me of some southside irish bar.

View is decent and the patio should be a highlight in the coming months.The cocktail list is interesting with lots of creativity and originality. However, at 20 cocktails it was a bit much to look and choose from.

Having said that I&#39;d come to have a drink on the patio.The food was a mess and the downfall. Focus on the cocktails and this place might shine.The chedder dust fries were very cool.  Veal sweetbreads and pork terrine were adequate but nothing crazy.  The spiced carrots liked any spice but I did like the balance of the dish.  The pork belly was a nice slab that wasn&#39;t fatty. The cornish hen was cold and boring.

Love it! What I thought was so cool about the drink menus is it is sorted by key ingredients; ie corn, barley etc. Many of the drinks had ingredients I had never heard of but that did not deter me from trying the Easy Eddie.  It was smooth, tasty, well balanced yet quite flavorful.  The wonderful bartender who was serving me asked if I would like to taste the more unusual ingredients separately so I can see how they combine into the overall profile of the drink. I thought this was the greatest idea ever.  Not only was I very unfamiliar with many of the ingredients, I am also horrible at identifying flavors out of a overall profile.  In addition to the amazing drink service and company provided by the staff, they were attentive to my tendency to chug water as well :-).  I cant even begin to guess how many times they came over to fill my water. Once the rest of the group arrived we were seated at a nice table by the windows.  We had Kyle as our server.  He was friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and attentive. He understood that we were there for a meeting and checked in periodically but not too much.  He also provided suggestions for both drinks and food items.  When we found out that there was only one Fois Gras left he actually ran over to the kitchen to secure it for our table.  Talk about service! From the girls working the reception desk to the bartenders and wait staff this place definitely has it figured out.  I will absolutely come back here whenever in the area and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new classy spot. Kudos GreenRiver!"

In order from &#34;best&#34; to worst:- Al Pastor: best of the bunch and most flavorful- Chicken: used shredded chicken from a whole thigh. Tender, but lacking in flavor and &#34;chew&#34; texture- Steak: chock full of large chunks of tough gristle; this required a 2-taco minimum order, so very disappointingThe owner/cook does provide whole pickled jalapenos if you ask for it, and these were very well received.Even at $2.25 per taco, I can&#39;t recommend coming here for tacos unless you had no means of transportation to another place.

When I walked in, I took note of the tiny seating area, which wasn&#39;t really a problem for me as I came alone. I ordered one chorizo taco and one pastor taco. One thing I loved was chatting with the cook (who appears to be the only person who works there) while she prepared my order. I also enjoyed the addition of retried beans on my chorizo taco, but I know this might not appeal to everyone (and you can get it without). I&#39;ve had chorizo that was far too salty more than once, but this was nicely balanced. The pastor was tender, but with a slight pleasant chew. The tacos were also considerably larger than others I&#39;ve purchased in the city. I probably ate here 3.5 hours ago, and I don&#39;t plan to eat again today because it was filling enough. The total for two tacos of this size was $4.90, which I thought was a great deal for a broke grad student such as myself. The only thing that knocked a star off this review is relatively limited options, but that&#39;s fine considering you can walk a few feet away if you simply must have something that isn&#39;t available on the menu. All in all, a great experience, but I wouldn&#39;t suggest coming with more than a friend or two."

I tried their steak burrito, and I was able to see the whole cooking process because you&#39;re literally in a grandma&#39;s kitchen. She cooks the marinade steak in front of you, so it&#39;s very entertaining to watch the whole process. Her English wasn&#39;t the best, but her burrito was very delicious. Looking forward to coming back to this place!"

I didn&#39;t even know how to enter the spot because the door looks like it would open to an apartment. The owner came around the counter and opened the front door and asked if I wanted tacos. Heck yes I did!Sitting at the 5 seat counter I listened to an older man tell me how great life is because we&#39;re alive as I waited for my pork tacos. The owner threw tortillas on the comal, asked if I wanted &#34;un poquito de frijol&#34; (adorable) on my taco. Of course I did. In a matter of minutes, my two tacos were wrapped up with some green salsa on the side and my total came to a beautiful $3.89.I tried, tried, tried to make it back to work without busting open the bag but there was just no way. 1. I was hungry 2. The food looked delicious as she wrapped it up for me. 3. The smell made me even more hungry. As for taste, the tacos were delicious. Huge chunks of pork (there were a few fatty pieces but fat = flavor) and creamy beans with the slightly spicy salsa. Delicious. I look forward to going back. Tacos didn&#39;t even make it back to work (2 miles away)."

The food is good and she makes it 2 feet in front of you. I am a bit of a germ-phob and luckily I was not offended by anything I saw. The pork I accidentally got was actually wonderful!

Combine that with the fact that you have to speak at least a little Spanish to get by in this place (and that you are literally in this lady&#39;s ktichen) it feels authentic.

I also had a choice of 1 pasta item and 1 entree item, and I remember thinking, &#34;boy, I sure will be stuffed getting a pasta AND a separate entree&#34;Not so much.I ordered a Gorgonzola sausage pasta and beef medallions for the entree.  They brought both of them out together on the same medium sized plate.  The Gorgonzola pasta was the only truly good thing I ate all evening, but the portion size was nominal at best.  And the beef &#34;medallions&#34;?  They were sliced about as thin as lunch meat, and were similar in quality as well.  They were also borderline cool to the touch, and also of a meager portion.Swell.We did get the tiramisu for desert, which was A-OK, but unfortunately did nothing to salvage one of the most mediocre and incredibly overpriced Italian (or otherwise) dinner&#39;s I&#39;ve ever had in my life.So, I would recommend, if you&#39;re going to charge $65 per head on V-Day Eve, let those that reserved dinner at your restaurant know this ahead of time.  And, if you&#39;re going to charge $65 per head, make sure your food is worth it.  Granted, the idea of a $65 Italian dinner actually being worth it is a dubious proposition in the first place, but at least give some legit portions and better quality food.This place gets 1 star for decent service, and 1 star for the incredibly mediocre food.Perhaps the most frustrating thing is their regular menu looked much more enticing, and I don&#39;t doubt they make good food most of the time, but the ridiculously overpriced and incredibly underwhelming prix-fixe menu will prevent us from ever giving this place another chance in the future."

My point if you want good solid Italian food try RoSals, Taylor and Racine. Walk 2 blocks West and check out Duseks for EXCEPTIONAL calamari."

It is spacious inside with very limited on site parking. It is also byob.We started out with cypress salad which was huge. It also came with almost a green salad in the middle, which was unusual and great.My friend had the chicken and potatoes, which was very good. I had the veal piccata which was ok, not the best veal I had. I would definitely return and try the pasta but skip the veal.Overall, a very nice place with friendly service."

The service was great, until we got our food. My daughter ordered lasagna and I ordered a soup and my son ordered braciola with pasta. We saw the lasagna and saw it was way too soupy. My daughter took one bite and stopped eating. I asked why she wasn&#39;t eating and she said it was too salty.My son said the same thing about his Bracola and it was the same for my soup. I told my daughter to send back theLesagna. She ordered chicken which she said was much better. She wanted to try some of my son&#39;s pasta (which he didn&#39;t eat for a reason). She put it in her mouth and spit it right out, she said it tasted like pure sugar and the pasta was mushy in texture. My son ordered the brachola but instead he got a thin streak. He also said dont bring out the pasta but they still brought it out.The service was great until the owner came, he asked about why the food was sent back and we explained it to him. He said that, that&#39;s the way it should be made. That we don&#39;t like it because we&#39;re not American. Then later he commented on our wine and said it was cheap. Also my 16 year old daughter mentioned a culinary program she was in. The owner has attended her service and said he only went because it was charity and said the food was disgusting. The look on her face looked so upset. And to top it off he charged us for the food that was sent back. We asked about the bill and the owner hid in the back of the store avoiding us. We were so fed up that we paid and we left. If you want authentic Italian food, don&#39;t come here. PS. YOU EAT AT THIS PLACE AND YOU&#39;LL END UP ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR OR IN THE HOSPITAL."

The chef and owner Cesar, is a premier host and makes you feel taken care of. The pasta and wine is to die for. One guest said that it was even better than the best you can get in Italy. I cannot agree more. The delicate combination of fresh and home-made ingredients melt in your mouth as you enjoy every bite.

(Which ended up being yesterday&#39;s bread, toasted!!)3) &#34;Sorry,no veal tonight&#34;. At an Italian restaurant?4)The lasagna was literally swimming in liquid that had the consistency somewhere between water and cream soup... yes, liquid, not sauce.5) My gnocchi had the texture of marshmallows. To top it off, it was stuffed with red peppers (uh,not on the menu) which I continue to taste hours later :(6) Premium prices for so so Italian.

I cannot get enough, despite the generous portion, I always end up with the feeling of wanting more and more - just because they are that good. It must be the finger linking porcini sauce - definitely not for the health calorie conscious person - this sauce is creamy and delicious.But before you jump into the main entrees, you must try the fried calamari. They are by far the best I have ever had! I lived in South America for 15 years and I have traveled throughout the Caribbean extensively, so am familiar with fresh and crispy Calamari, but Ciao Amore took it to a different level. If there is a competition for crispier and flavorful calamaris these one would take the award hands down.I have been here several times, because I became a true fan. Therefore, I warn you to go to enjoy the music, the company, and make sure to bring your wine or beverage of choice, since it is BYOB, to culminate the experience with the most delicious Italian cuisine in Chicago."

This is a true gem of Pilsen. It&#39;s down the street from St. Procopius, a 5-min drive or 15-min walk from St. Pius V (the St. Jude Shrine), and a 4-min hop off I-90/I-94.Service:Everyone here was so nice. Chef Cesar came out to the dining area to introduce himself; he&#39;s got a great personality and makes you feel at home. Another great thing about a small business: meeting the chef and owner! :)Food:The standout for us was the spinach gnocchi - at first bite, the gnocchi melted away in our mouths, and we were hooked. We wanted to bottle up the sauce - maybe an idea for Chef Cesar!Every plate we had was 5 stars. Even the olive oil they serve with the lightly toasted bread was good - how is that even possible? The calamari appetizer was so fresh, and the red sauce served with it was flavorful. We had the spinach gnocchi of course *hands raised in grateful prayer* and would come back for this alone. The Petti di&#39; Polo Porcini, compliments of the chef, had the most divine creamy sauce. The lobster ravioli (Ravioli d&#39; Aragosta alla Pilsen) was beautifully balanced and tasty. The brascole was flavorful, and frankly, we didn&#39;t do it justice because we stuffed ourselves with all the other entrees!When our patient and cheerful waitress brought out tiramisu, we all stared at it with fearful eyes because we were so full, but since we never waste dessert, we finished that off as well, and it was, of course, excellent.Parking:Our group of 4 dined here on a Friday night. We found a parking spot on a side street, and overall parking didn&#39;t seem too bad. It was well worth the trek from the suburbs.Edit to add: It&#39;s a BYOB place, and they will bring you a nice little ice bucket in case your drinks need further chilling. There&#39;s a liquor store across the street from the restaurant."

This year, we&#39;d made reservations for 9:30 PM. After looking for parking for 20 minutes, we arrived at Ciao on the dot at 9:30 and were completely disregarded. When we said we were here for a reservation, we were told there were plenty of ppl in front of us. There is no place to really wait in this small restaurant so we kept getting bumped into by the staff. What&#39;s the point of a reservation then? We were seated past 10 PM.When we finally got our table, 30 minutes went by without anyone coming to bring us water, utensils, bread, or take our order. Finally, I got frustrated and got one of the waiters attention, who was surprised no one had gotten to us yet. He brought us out bread, but no plates or utensils. They were clearly understaffed and overcrowded and not prepared for this many people.30 minutes later we finally got our food. My gnocchi was not as hot as it should&#39;ve been. You could tell it&#39;d been sitting there for a while. I again asked the waiter for utensils and extra bread. The utensils came, but no bread. I AGAIN had to ask the waiter for more bread and finally 30 minutes later we got more bread, after we were both finished eating.We left past 12:30 because of the slow service. I&#39;m very disappointed in Ciao this year. If they cannot handle this many people, they shouldn&#39;t take this many reservations. Or turn ppl away at the door that don&#39;t have reservations.We will not be returning next year for our yearly VDay at Ciao."

Glad to know its BYOB and the server mentioned it right off the bat. Since we were getting drinks after we skipped on this option.We attempted to order lemonade and only one of the three options was available.Next was the appetizer which they didn&#39;t have our first choice of soup but the goat cheese made up for this.We encountered the same issue with the main course. They had no veal available and one of the sides wasn&#39;t either.The food itself was bland. The lasagna was watered down, it was literally sitting in mixture of probably 80% water and 20% sauce. The chicken vesuvio also had too much water and lemon seeds floating in the broth.We tried to order a cannoli but they also didn&#39;t have that. The gelato we ordered was average.Maybe this place had an off night. I respect that everything &#34;fresh/made to order&#34; but way too many procurement/availability issues when ordering.Overall the service was good (impressive that ONE server was able to handle all the tables) but the food was too much of an ItaliaNO."

Tea light candles are set on top of white table cloths. The artwork is for sale and is periodically switched out. The server encouraged me to walk around the restaurant to properly appreciate it all. I saw many Kahlo-esque paintings that day.The service was very good. Our server was an attractive Colombian man with an accent that I considered appealing. He was smartly dressed in black trousers and a crisp, white shirt. His person was well groomed and his manner was courteous. Although he played the role of host and server and he also juggled three different tables, there was never a time that I felt neglected.Although Ciao Amore Ristorante possesses the recipe for romance, they fall somewhat short for the food. I am impressed by the homemade pasta and the chocolate sauce inscription on the dessert plates. We ordered two specialties for our entrees: lobster ravioli and gnocchi. I thought the lobster ravioli was kind of fishy, but tasty. The gnocchi was also good but not the best. It did not hold up for reheating the next day.We enjoyed two different desserts. I got the cannoli and I don&#39;t remember the other one. They were just average quality also.The food wasn&#39;t bad or anything, but it also wasn&#39;t good enough to swoon over. I suppose that if you&#39;re distracted by the ambiance, service, and BYOB then the food doesn&#39;t matter. The notion of homemade pasta and chocolate sauce writing is ample ammunition to entice a date to join you at Ciao Amore but then it&#39;s just not that impressive after that. I couldn&#39;t tell the difference between their homemade pasta and store bought."

So they get a bonus half star!Ciao Amore is a great option if you neither want Mexican nor Hipster food in Pilsen. The restaurant&#39;s decor definitely reflects the heritage of the owner: Latin American and Italian. The name and menu is Italian, but the decor matches all the other Mexican art in Pilsen. Very cool.As for the food, sadly, there is not an option for vegans in every course. No vegan dessert. No sorbet, even? Come on, Ciao! But they do have options for us other than salad.The salad is good, by the way. Fresh greens in the insalata spinaci, but definitely heavy on the vinaigrette if you don&#39;t ask for it on the side!Also, when they bring out your bread and olive oil, ask for the oil without Parmesan cheese. They sneak that on top. Sometimes the Italian bread is a little too toasted (*cough* burnt *cough*), which is disappointing.Everything vegan-friendly that I tried so far is good, and they have a vegetarian section on the menu!  Though I was hoping for something a little more adventurous with the farfalla primavera. The &#34;seasonal vegetables&#34; in early August were broccoli, carrots and zucchini. Really? For a place like this, I want eggplant! Mushrooms! But if you like garlic and olive oil, they definitely don&#39;t skimp on those.Now, the portion size at Ciao Amore? HUGE. I dined in and got a take-home container.  My farfalla lasted 5 days. FIVE! So don&#39;t get turned off by the price tag. I don&#39;t think two people could finish the pasta in one sitting.Service is great and super nice. The Friday night band is very friendly too. If you don&#39;t want to participate in the drunken shenanigans of late night 18th street, go here. It&#39;s BYOB, btw.And tip the band!"

I commend the manager for sticking up for the restaurant. This is a small family owned restaurant, people like that should stick to the Olive Gardens.

Stay away from this place at all cost.Food was not as advertised, missing or ridiculously short on main ingredients.Veal plate was served ice cold while my wife&#39;s lasagna was hotter than the sun (probably just came out of the microwave).Waiter was unresponsive and originally delivered our food to the only other table that was in the place.I asked if their green bean  salad special was fresh green beans and the waiter ensured me that they were. The green beans were frozen, making the dish too watery to classify as an appetizer, and more of a soup.The bread and wine we brought was the only good part of the meal.The waiter hand totaled our check twice and twice it was wrong. I got fed up and paid it even though it was more than what it should have been.Save yourself the trouble and go to a more reputable and authentic restaurant.

The service we had was great and the restaurant itself is cute with a nice feel. The food was fair for Italian but I&#39;m also picky about my Italian food since my background is Italian. It&#39;s definitely worth giving it a try based on the friendliness of staff. If u have never been before you can decide for yourself!

We had the special oysters and I had the gnochi with vodka sauce. BYOB is a huge plus, and they did not rush us (had a nice 3.5 hour dinner). I felt like it was a little pricy. The veal my friend got did not look the greatest. It was also nice to have a small parking lot next door since street parking was tough"

The name sends an uncomfortable chill down my spine.Let&#39;s preface my opinion with my credentials in the culinary arts: non existent.I had went to Ciao Amore with my girlfriend in an attempt to exercise my adventurous/wild side from the norm of our well established Italian restaurants.Zipping forward, we sit down in what looks like a 12 year olds attempt to decorate the restaurant, but hey... I&#39;ll eat a meal in a cars trunk as long as it&#39;s damn worth eating. I digress.The waiter strolls over, and hands us a crumbled piece of paper consisting of the dinner specials (from what I could make up with the faded ink). Still, this is humorous and not a deterrent.We order (I a Salad I cannot recollect, and my girlfriend a pasta dish). Beforehand, we are given a plate of what looks like the quality of non toasted Wunder bread with oil and garnished with shake bottle parmesan. Still ... We hold our tongues.The food arrives. I should have brought a paddle and a life preserver for both of our meals. The salad was 60% dressing, and the rest food, drenched. The pasta contained shrimpAnd veggies that clearly was from a frozen bag. Her pasta.... Also a sea of sauce.I complained and the manager was receptive and also threw in a dessert . The bill was probably the most expensive restaurants I&#39;ve ever eaten at. The quality is equivalent to the frozen section at a gas station."

The menu can be a little confusing at first but read the description and you pretty much get the basics of it. We had a few questions for the waiter and he was just awesome. He answered all of our questions fully. There&#39;s nothing I hate more Is going to a restaurant and the waiter doesn&#39;t know the menu. Any way. We were greeted and seated right away. Some bread and olive oil was placed on our table as we looked at the menu.The food was absolutely amazing. Not one complaint. Pasta perfectly cooked. The sauce was equally as amazing and we&#39;ll seasoned.I forgot that this place is byob that&#39;s why I&#39;m not giving it 5 stars.  As amazing as our food was a glass of wine would&#39;ve put it over the top putting up into food bliss.Also, parking in that area is rough but to the right of the restaurant they do have a little lot that has free parking but be cautious if you have a large truck because it&#39;s a small lot. I found it easier to find parking on the street.So my tips would be- come on an empty stomach- go early enough to find decent parking- It&#39;s BYOB so don&#39;t forget the wine- enjoy their lovely atmosphere and the company you bring with you to enjoy some amazing food."

Ciao Amore, it&#39;s a friday night, Valentines Day, and you have 1 MAYBE 2 servers on the floor? And no one cares to apologize or warn the customers of how terrible the service is going to be? This was the worst dining experience I have ever encountered.We arrived around 715, and had a 30 minute wait, it started off fine because we were able to open our bottle of wine and watch the Jazz music, which was delightful....then things went down the drain.We were seated, and it took 30 minutes to be greeted and put the order in.  Working in the restaurant business, I know and everyone knows this is completely unacceptable.  We then waited about 45 minutes without refills on our water and never got our bread.  Then the server comes in and asks, &#34;oh sorry what did you guys order?&#34; We try to stay cool and tell him again what we ordered.. another 20 minutes goes by...our appetizer comes out, oh good maybe the food will come out soon too.  Nope.. we try to drink our wine slow as molasses to savor some for our meal.  Meal comes out another hour later... we are hardly hungry at this point, server acts like every thing is fine (I know he had been busting his butt though).  We thought about asking for the manager to try and understand what was going but honestly the place couldn&#39;t keep up with anything.We have a few bites of our food but at the point we just wanted to leave...it&#39;s supposed to be closed at this point anyways.. the band is done, etc.  We get to go boxes but of course have to wait a while.Then it gets even worse.... we pay with cash but need change and the server comes back and says &#34;sorry we don&#39;t have change for this&#34; so then we are forced to give about a 30% tip.  We always tip, even in this case we would have left a 20% tip, but seriously? You don&#39;t have change or did you just want to make sure we left a tip?We left around 11:00 ...essentially pissed we spent that much money on a crap shoot experience.  I felt bad for my boyfriend, he really wanted to have a nice night.I wouldn&#39;t be so upset if the manager/owner would have apologized and offered something to make up for this experience.  There is no way he didn&#39;t see what was happening in the restaurant.  We also called a few days after the experience but there was no returned call, therefore I wrote this review and will not be returning. :(As for the food, it was good and i&#39;m sure the Chef is wonderful...but there are plenty of places that can deliver consistent service, good food, and apologize if things don&#39;t go so well.---The last part is just funny... we walked home, of course we did not have a bag for our 2 boxes filled to the brim.  One explodes all over my coat and purse, it was a good laugh."

It may read like a wild combination, but after having gnocchi prepared this way, I wonder why the hell it isn&#39;t served more often in other restaurants because I&#39;ve not had it taste better! There&#39;s a smooth, buttery envelope around the fat noodles that hold a pocket of spinach and cheesy goodness that HAS to be the perfect, bitterly-cold winter comfort dish. And this was on on a very evening in early June. All I&#39;m gonna say.We&#39;d passed this quaint, Pilsen BYO several times going to and from Simone&#39;s Bar and this was the perfect summer&#39;s night to give it a try.

We had a reservation for 4 at 7pm on a Saturday and they were able to accommodate what ultimately turned out to be 7. Try that at any other restaurant in the city on a Saturday.Next was the food. Wow. I grew up with an Italian mother and Nana living with me and this is the type of old school, hearty fare I&#39;m used to as a kid. Dark tomato sauces we called &#34;gravy&#34;, gnocchi as light as air, ravioli filled with interesting items and flavorful sauces. And while I can only attest to the excellence of the dishes my wife and I enjoyed, the rest of the group seemed to be equally pleased with their various choices.We started with three apps: the stuffed rice ball, the green bean salad served with diced tomatoes and fresh mozzarella and the baked goat cheese with marinara. The rice balls were excellent - fried crisp but not soggy and generous in size. The green bean salad too was excellent. Who knew green beans could be so tasty... Didn&#39;t have the goat cheese app but the wife did and loved it.For dinner the wife had gnocchi which were light as air and served with a lovely marinara sauce. This was the right sauce for such a delicate dish. I had the Osso Buco which was was served with a side of ziti. The meat was cooked for so long it fell off the bone - no knife needed. And the sauce. Yum! Dark and hearty like a gravy should be. No wimpy marinara is going to stand up to that cut of meat.The rest of group reported their dished to be excellent as well. To the best of my memory they had lobster ravioli, bracciole, chicken with mushroom and a spaghetti and meatball dish.Deserts are limited to two but both excellent. We had one of each of the tiramisu and the chocolate cake. The tiramisu was excellent, light with just the right amount of espresso soaked in. The chocolate cake was also excellent. A combination of what appeared to be a flour-less dark chocolate cake on the bottom topped with a lighter chocolate cake.  Espresso and the usual coffees are also available.As others have mentioned it&#39;s a BYOB so yes the prices might be a bit higher than you&#39;d expect but honestly, they were very reasonable. The Osso Buco was $23.95. I&#39;ve paid more for a lesser dish so I was more than happy with my choice and the value.Service was also excellent. Whenever a wine bottle was empty, the servers (we had two) would open another clear various plates and the empty bottle and off they&#39;d go. never had to track down the server. Love that.Yes you will be confused going to an amazing Italian restaurant on a street lined with Mexican joints but hey, that&#39;s what makes Chicago a great city, right?Finally thanks to Chef Cesar for stopping by the table to ask how everything was on a busy Saturday night.  We will definitely be back."

Looks like it has since been updated, thanks.On our second attempt we did get in without a problem, but the food took way too long to receive.  The arancini appetizer took 30min with only 1 other table seated at that time.  I guess they were making our pasta fresh or something but that is ridiculous.  We finally got the food and it was only 1 med-size arancini ball which is crazy for $10.  It did taste ok, but somehow they managed to burn one side of it.Our entrees arrived another 30min after the app.  The lasagna my girlfriend ordered appeared to have absolutely no tomato sauce on it.  It only fooled us because the yellow hamburger grease mixed with the white cheese grease and made it look kind of pink.  I ordered the chicken and potatoes and it was pretty good.  A bit smaller portion size than I would have liked though and swimming in olive oil and garlic.  It was pretty moist and flavorful.Lastly, the owner or manager who turned us away the day before, was more than happy to sit and schmooze with the other people at the restaurant and give them complimentary soup but he completely ignored us.  This doesn&#39;t live up to your motto on the website of how everyone leaves as friends."

I was happily surprised with the entire experience. Being that Ciao Amore is a BYOB allowed us to content ourselves with a variety of alcoholic beverages.The waitress was very helpful yet never interrupted the conversation and always kept up any requests we had. The owner was present and stopped by our table to make sure we were having a great time.I ordered the lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the brasciole. Both dishes were excellent! The food was served piping hot and there was plenty on the plate. After we finished our meals (and plenty more drinks) some of us ordered dessert. The cannoli was fantastic and I highly recommend it!Chef Cesar came out at the end of our meal and chatted with us a bit and I must say it was one of the highlights of this dining experience. Overall, he&#39;s a wonderful person to talk to and I&#39;ll be back to eat his delicious concoctions soon!!By the way, the restrooms were clean and the restaurant was also clean and inviting. We were there a few hours and it was a very comfortable atmosphere. Loved it."

We had perfect Bruschetta, an amazing Zuppa Barese and wonderful handmade pasta featured in authentic Italian dishes (their gnocchi is light as air!).  It&#39;s also a beautiful space, decorated with artwork by the talented server Esperanza.  And in true European fashion, the meal is meant to be enjoyed and lingered over...you won&#39;t feel rushed here.  So grab a bottle of good wine (the restaurant is BYOB), a bunch of friends, and head to Ciao Amore....you&#39;ll love it!"

I was very impressed with the food and service the first time I was there when they first opened. This time the service was horrible. I finally had to get my own water. The Mahi-Mahi was dry and swimming in sauce. The Vitello Porcini was also swimming in sauce. Who serves food like that anymore? My boyfriend loves mushrooms but I don&#39;t think he will ever eat Porcini mushrooms ever again. I strongly recommend you choose another place. The manager could tell we were not happy and offered us free cake. We declined. Free cake cannot solve the problems here."

There is a package store right across the street where you can get wine/beer/alcohol that is very convenient. It is also right down the block from Thalia Hall, so a great destination before a show. We ordered a few dishes and split, everything was delicious! We started with Caprese salad which was very good, lovely balsamic on it. The lobster raviolis were very fresh in a yummy sauce with a hint of heat, large portion too. We wanted the Mahi entree, but they did not have, so the proprietor suggested a dish (not on the menu), grilled calamari, fish, mussels, clams in what I believe to be the Mahi sauce.

My sister and I ordered the bruschetta, Gnocci Ripieno Spinaci, and Tri-Color Tortellini.The bruschetta was good. It was a bit salty though.The dishes themselves were not so great. The gnocci dish was a weird green color. It has what appeared to be prosciutto and sun dried tomatoes. Both of those ingredients were not listed on the menu. The stuffing was also not good.The tortellini dish had a very watery sauce. The flavor was not the worst, but it felt like I was eating a soup. I also don&#39;t usually complain about too much chicken, but there was more chicken than anything else in this dish. The best part were the mushrooms."

I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone.  We also started out with a mussel appetizer which was nomnomnom.  Oh...and a little tip...if the server says a dish is spicy...they aren&#39;t lying!!

After my dinner here with them, I would have to agree it was pretty darn good. Yelpers talk about the green beans.. yes, eat these. But, warning - it&#39;s a big portion! Tossed with a vinaigrette it&#39;s healthy, light, and flavorful.The homemade lobster ravioli I had was cooked al dente and served with a spicy, arribiata (creamy) sauce. My friend&#39;s Brascole - beef brascole, stuffed with spinach, prosciutto &amp; parmigiano cheese and served over homemade cavatelli with marinara and basil - was a nice departure from the usual italian menu items you find.

(Note to south siders: We took the 55 bus and got the 8 on Halsted. Don&#39;t get the 8 on Halsted.) There was only one other table occupied, and granted it was 8:00 on a Tuesday, but I would have thought with the great Yelp reviews it would be packed.We had...Green bean salad - blanced green beans, fresh mozzarella, diced tomato, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and chopped basil. It really is awesome.Gnocchi ripieno - &#34;Pillowy&#34; is an apt description, very cheesy and VERY rich spinach parmesan sauce. Did I mention the cheese?Veal porcini - the gnocchi was awesome, but this is maybe the best thing I&#39;ve ever tasted in my life. Thin pieces of veal, ravioli, and mushrooms in a pool of cream sauce made with an earthy red wine. The server said they use chianti. I have never had a wine sauce like this anywhere else, but there was something oddly familiar in the flavor and it&#39;s still driving me crazy to this day. We definitely used some of the crusty Italian bread to mop up the sauce.Tiramisu - very good, but bad tiramisu is rare.Plus we did the BYOB thing.Then we went downtown and he proposed to me in Grant Park. :)We went back right before we moved away from Chicago and got the green bean salad and veal porcini again, plus a beef brascole which was as splendid as expected. We told our server we&#39;d gotten engaged last time we ate there and we were sorry to leave the city, and he came out with tiramisu on the house.So yeah, I love this place. I hope we just hit them on slow nights and their business is going well, because they will be a required stop on all our future Chicago trips."

We had a groupon-type deal, so we went on a weekday night. At 6pm the restaurant was absolutely deserted. The polenta was absolutely fabulous - the best I have ever day. The sauce on the linguine alla Daniel was also great. I was less impressed with the osso bucco. The sauce wasn&#39;t as flavorful and the meat was a bit dry. Mostly my discomfort was with the prices - $30 a person is quite steep for the area - and the decent but not exceptional service. I would go back, but probably only if I had another deal to bring the price down substantially."

I knew that I&#39;d have a reason to come here, at some point.Italian menu with a Mexican spin. Like lobster ravioli in an arrabiata sauce that derives it spicy flavor from jalapenos.It&#39;s a BYOB. If you don&#39;t bring your own, you&#39;re sunk as even the soft beverage menu is weak.All in, definitely worth a try. It&#39;s one of those places you&#39;ll only find in the city."

The restaurant played smooth jazz and our waitress was awesome. We had a large party of at least 10, they sat us in the back, but the staff was very attentive. We had the lobster ravioli, bruschetta, bread with olive oil and parmesan cheese. All of the food was great. Its also a byob and its a liquor store right across the street, with plenty of street parking."

I&#39;m still thinking of the sweet and tangy balsamic vinegar tossed green beans with the soft and marshmallowy mozzarella, gnocchi, and the creamy portobello pasta dishes.Most of the time, when I think of Italian, I typically think pasta is something I could make myself. So, if I go out for Italian, I want the food to kick my mouth into overdrive and this place definitely did it for us. You can smell the garlic aromas emanating from the kitchen pulling you in by the nose.A few notes:1) Yes, BYOB and boy did we bring plenty of bottles. Best part is there is no corkage fee. Someone brought vodka since they don&#39;t drink wine and the restaurant supplied us with cocktail glasses with ice.2) $5/entree &#34;sharing&#34; fee. I am not a fan of the sharing fee, but apparently, they do make the portions a little bit bigger - however, I feel that this was not by much.We did family style consisting of 4 different appetizers, 5 entrees, and dessert. Even though the reviews down here said it was a lot of food, I felt there could have been a just a little more, maybe because everything tasted so good, I just wanted another bite. We all took small rations of each dish. Maybe that is a good thing as everything was so rich. I didn&#39;t feel full until fifteen minutes after the end of our meal. My friends had a latte and espresso which they said were excellent.Great atmosphere, great service."

Why not just go to Taylor Street or to the Heart of Chicago area&#34;? I never really wanted to go in and had been successful in that endeavor for years.One night a couple of weeks ago, I was in Pilsen with my SO and he wanted to be adventurous. So we entered Ciao Amore. It was earlier in the evening, so we were the only guests inside the restaurant. There were a few other people at another table but I believe that they were family members. Not unusual in Pilsen so OK.We look at the menu and I see that there is the outline of a Microsoft text box on the front of the menu that someone obviously forgot to remove before printing. Then I see gnocchi for over $20. More expensive than the nicer places on Taylor Street. I take out my phone and start looking at the Yelp reviews, including the pictures. The &#34;stuffed gnocchi&#34; don&#39;t look like gnocchi and every pic shows an entree drowning in sauce. Regardless of what other people have said in these Yelp reviews, authentic Italian food is not drowned in heavy sauces. That is why I never eat at Olive Garden, but I digress.After seeing the prices for the entrees, I suggest to my SO that we order a couple of appetizers before committing to entrees. The appetizers were also very expensive - $11 for arancini - more on this in a moment. As I am questioning the prices in my head, small children proceed to run through the center of the restaurant. Really? I will take my overpriced food without small kids running past me, thank you. I know it&#39;s Pilsen, but the prices are gourmet so I would expect more of a Nightwood atmosphere.I am really thankful that we stopped at the appetizers. We ordered the bean salad and the arancini. The bean salad was drowned in balsamic vinegar on a plate with a huge chip in it. I like to enjoy really expensive food without the thought of eating porcelain with it.  Some of the beans were soaked through with the balsamic vinegar while others were not. It was a special and I told my SO not to tell me how much it wound up costing because I wanted to avoid the increase in blood pressure. And the arancini - whatever this was, it was not an arancini. I did not see rice anywhere inside of it. I think it was actually a ball of cornmeal mush that contained a very small amount of meat and one single pea. The sauce was dark red and caused some gastric reflux after we left. You may also want to know that $11 bought one single ball of cornmeal mush with questionable sauce.I have read the owner&#39;s (?) responses to the negative reviews here. He keeps asking why people don&#39;t say anything when the food is bad and claims that the prices are so high because it is BYOB. People don&#39;t complain about restaurant food for a variety of reasons but here are my thoughts...if the food that you send out to me is so bad to begin with, how much better is it really going to get if I send it back to the kitchen? And furthermore, I don&#39;t do anything that could potentially upset people who are serving me food. As for the prices...the food is not even remotely worth these prices. I would sincerely suggest that the owner get some help with his business plan because nothing about this place justifies the prices. From the chipped plates to the decor that is in need of some cohesiveness to the lingering text box on the menu, this restaurant needs to be referred to that &#34;Restaurant Impossible&#34; guy on the Food Network.Our server was super nice but I overheard him tell other patrons that they have some of the best Italian food in the city. Um, no. Sorry."

Out. Saturday Night. 7 PM. Ouch. I felt bad for the next several hours of tables they sat for dinner.The next 30 minutes went by with our appetizer- the very tasty rice ball made with meat and cheese- that came and went in 5 minutes, and we sat there for another 30 waiting for salads, and the place was not full.  We finally asked about them and they came right out seconds later, only to be follow by our main course seconds later... and the second waiter said they had been made and were sitting in the kitchen awaiting the main course, um, no, not requested and now this was a bigger issue.  Hot food, cold caprese, not good.The food was ok, nothing spectacular, vesuivo w/ lemon and garlic, but not with any real lemon or garlic taste... I wonder if they were out of lemon and garlic?Lastly I wanted a decaf Cappuccino, they only had regular. They had the espresso machine but no decaf.No apoligies and no offers to remove anything from the bill, when we asked they said they had already rung it up and could not change it, they did finally offer some future coupons, 2 little 2 late.Saturday night, no soup for you, no bread for you, no decaf for you, no return for me.UPDATE - the owner did send me a very nice email on the week following with a more heartfelt apology and their current battles with the city and landlord to get a new door system in place as well as personally say he was sorry we had a negative experience. He expressed his hope we would return and let them honor the discount and give the place a second try.  Very nice effort and appreciated."

I basically had to sit through it to listen to them talk about all shellfish products that I can&#39;t eat.I ordered the spinach and cheese gnocchi. The other was the veal with angel hair. The starter was the calamari. Everything was pretty good. My significant other said the olive like bulbs were really sour. The overall dish for him was sour and didn&#39;t really like it. The waiter recommended that... And said he liked it.The gnocchi was good, I enjoyed dipping bread for the sauce.The place is pretty cozy and had a really good feel to it.

We had two bottles of wine and wanted to find a nice spot nearby. I&#39;ve had Ciao Amore bookmarked for awhile so it was an easy decision. We knew that being a walk in at 7:30pm on a Saturday would be hit or miss so we crossed our fingers.They greeted us right away and sat us on a couch in the back. It was clear they were  busy but they were wonderful in trying to accommodate our walk in. They ended up splitting two larger tables to get us a place and we were very happy.Matt was our server. He was professional and knowledgeable but most importantly he was very personable.I ordered the Brascole which was delicious and my friend ordered the Festaitaliana which she really enjoyed. Additionally we got the spumoni and tiramisu for desert which were tasty.I&#39;ll definitely be back to visit. Our meals were delicious. The portions were good. Best of all is that there&#39;s no corking fee! I highly recommend.

The little pastas that came with were like pillows filled with cheese. So awesome. The ragu was good but there was too much of it.

In the end, we and our sig others discovered the right place for our long-awaited reunion with enjoying the BYOB option and the massive amounts of quality food.While starting out our night by uncorking our two bottles of red wine and requesting multiple bowls of olive oil/parm for our bread, the server enthusiastically suggested we order the mussels special for our app (not on the menu). We were grateful for his suggestion because the flavorful cream sauce was one of the highlights of the night for us. However, the actual size of each mussel meat was a bit small for my liking.When we got to the entrees, I admittedly already felt full but still anticipated our choices. The four of us selected different dishes and sampled each others. I fell in love with my husband&#39;s spinach gnocchi because of the pillow-like texture of the ricotta cheese in the middle with the comforting spinach cream sauce that the gnocchi drowned in. As for my osso bucco, it had ginormous pieces of meat and it didn&#39;t even look like I made a dent in it once the night ended. I was happy to honestly just have the dish as leftovers to eat at home for the next three days.I would definitely return to double date with our friends who live nearby, and the atmosphere would even be perfect for an even bigger group of friends."

Breakfast House does it right. I don&#39;t know what they brew, but it&#39;s a strong brew. And that extra mile in the small things is what takes this place to transcendent brunch experience."

This place is locked in a time warp, in the best way. It has that cozy neighborhood diner vibe without trying too hard. I had the best cup of coffee in my 5 day trip to Chicago, and the refills kept coming. Pancakes were fluffy and had that slight buttermilk tang. I will make a point of stopping in again any time I&#39;m in Chicago."

I thought it was easily the best breakfast I had on the trip, even after paying considerably more at other places (*ahem* Little Goat Diner).My wife had the cornmeal cakes and enjoyed them. I ordered the chicken and waffle, and it was great. It was the hat trick: Really good food, a whole lot of it, and a fairly low price. Oh, and the service was also very friendly.Don&#39;t overlook this place. I&#39;d go back without question."

It arrived nicely packaged, separately, and HOT! Yes HOT! This seems to always be a challenge for deliveries. Not for Breakfast House, though.Pancakes were perfectly light and delicious.

Really nice menu with both breakfast and lunch items. Numerous Mexican inspired options. I had the baked vegetable frittata with tomato sauce , (which sounded much better in the menu description than it actually tasted. ) It&#39;s actually a veggie / egg casserole which is pre-cooked, then nuked before service . Unfortunately , it was served just slightly warm. The tomato sauce brought back fond memories of Campbell&#39;s Tomato soup!Also had a beet salad which was just what I expected. Terrific Intelligentsia coffee. If I come back again , I&#39;d probably opt for  the chicken and waffles. That really looked outstanding ."

This place was awesome! Not only did it have a quaint, family-style atmosphere, the food was pretty amazing.We tried the chilaquiles and the breakfast burrito. The latter was actually a special for the day, but if you ask me, it should be a permanent fixture on the menu. The chilaquiles were cooked to perfection.

I had a craving for it. Otherwise, I would have ordered something else. I hope to come back again to review their other dishes! I was disappointed by the presentation of the salad. There weren&#39;t many croutons and the parmesan was unevenly distributed. The chicken had some good pieces but also some fatty pieces. It was grilled and overly charred. It did satisfy my craving though.I tried my boyfriend&#39;s turkey sandwich, which is well worth your money&#39;s worth. There were giant slabs of turkey and provolone along with lettuce and tomatoes. The fries that came on the side are pretty good, but also pretty standard.I love that they offer Intelligentsia coffee, one of my favorite brands of coffee. I got an iced mocha, which was quite good - a perfect balance of espresso and chocolate flavors.Also, while the music wasn&#39;t fitting for a brunch atmosphere, I thoroughly enjoyed that they were playing ATB.

The house one of my favorite coffees at this spot - Intelligentsia. Although I&#39;m bouncing off the walls after only 2 cups, it&#39;s still worth drinking.

We both ordered a cup of coffee as well, I believe they were toasting Intelligenista, which was super good.My only gripe about my order was that the cup of fruit was all your basic, cheap fruits, i.e. melons and a few blueberries.

We got a bucket for our drAnk, a carafe of freshly squeezed delicious orange juice and starting our Sunday Funday off right. My mom had a chicken salad... for brunch... smh... but she said it was great and truly enjoyed it. My bro created the world&#39;s largest omelet which he smashed. Our server, Roberto, laughed at him a little bit (rightfully so) because he had to eat around some of jalapenos he added to the omelet. Roberto was like &#34;what, too hot? ;-)&#34; LOL. We love spicy food so I know those jalapenos had to be extra ripe, fresh and potent! I had the signature breakfast house hash with poached eggs, chicken and andouille sausage, roasted potatoes, onions, red peppers and a side of Dijon aioli. I don&#39;t do mustard in any way shape or form so it was good it was on the side. The rest of the dish was delish and I was happy with my choice.

I can&#39;t say this meal helped with the shopping at all, but my athletic ability was greatly enhanced that day and I would like to attribute it to the magic hash I consumed.For starters, $2.50 for unlimited intelligentsia coffee is already a win. My dining companion had the cornmeal cakes, while I had the breakfast house hash, and we were both very pleased with our meals. The portions aren&#39;t outrageous like some other brunch places, but just the right amount so you can lick your plate clean and not feel like a total cow afterwards. The service was a little slow, but given that it&#39;s a small spot and they&#39;re already very busy at 9am, you really can&#39;t dock them too many points. Plus, whatever points you do dock can be easily made up by the readily available (free) parking and cute, welcoming atmosphere."

But the icing on the cake is that the food is really good. I&#39;ve tried a few different things and everything was delicious. From the open faced egg white frittata, traditional eggs and bacon, to the chopped chicken salad the service is great and food always hits the spot. They also have mango tea which is my favorite! And if you live nearby skip the delivery, just call it in and by the time you walk there your food is ready."

Loved this place so much,  I came back for seconds with more family members.  They have their own blend of Inteligentsia coffee, uh yes please! I ordered the breakfast burrito, but forgot to remove the onions. The guajillo sauce is not spicy, so go ahead and try it if you don&#39;t like spice.  My husband really enjoyed his chicken and waffles. Fried chicken with juicy meat, and soft waffles. My kids had the french toast. They are oven baked with a hint of cinnamon on them. My daughter didn&#39;t even want the syrup because of the original sweetness. Will definitely be back!"

So that all is great. But Breakfast house could update their green practices for the good of the earth.Positives: Breakfast house serves all of their eat-in orders on washable dishware, glassware, and silverware. Their cream for coffee is served in a small, washable milk pitcher.Negatives: Their to-go orders get sent out in Styrofoam containers in plastic bags. When eating in, their silverware is wrapped in white napkins, and their extra condiments (butter, jam, etc) comes out in single, individual packs of plastic.The breakfast house has a lot going for them, but changing a few of these practices would really plus things up. To-go packaging could instead consist of paper bags and plant-based, biodegradable containers and silverware. By serving condiments in small washable cups instead of single use butter and jam packets, it would lessen a lot of waste (like they do for their cream). By switching to recycled paper napkins, it would help support the recycling industry and help slow unnecessary deforestation.  :)"

I can choose my fav dishes and have it delivered in less than 30 mins. On the first day of my YELP purchase, the delivery guy seemed very happy to deliver to my place of business. He said, &#34;I&#39;ve never delivered over here. It&#39;s nice to deliver to new places.&#34; And he smiled. So Of course I gave him a tip. By the way, I love the pancakes, spinach/bacon/mushroom omelet, and the special hash with eggs!

Good amount of choices. Breakfast and lunch. The steak and eggs looked very good but wasn&#39;t in the mood for a food coma. The staff was very nice and quick to refill our water and coffee.// breakfast house hash - 9$ i ordered this because I loveeee hash browns but it was pretty good besides the sausage. It tasted sort of like jimmy dean sausage. Other than that. I really enjoyed my plate. Pretty affordable and a lot Of food.// cornmeal cakes - 8.50$ this one was tasty. It was also pretty different. It had a cornmeal like texture with a great southwest tangy sauce on the side. I started usually this sauce on my plate! That&#39;s how good it was.// house pancakes w strawberries - 5$ the pancakes them self were very tasty. Even without syrup. They only put like one chopped up strawberry on it. That was my only complaint. I like my pancakes to be SMOTHERED in fruit.// intelligentsia coffee - 2.50$This place is a pretty good spot to go to. I would definitely go back. The steak and egg burger sounds good. And the sandwiches with fries were enticing."

It may sound like a weird thing to rave over but they have awesome iced tea here too, which any iced tea obsessives like myself can appreciate (I can&#39;t tell you how many restaurants I go to where their iced tea is weak &amp; bland) We made this place a must have on Sundays after church!"

I also recommend the Roasted Pork Chop.  Our waiter Roberto looked genuinely happy to see that we ate every bite, it reminded me of the look my parents give when I plow through a home cooked meal.  We were seated outdoors, and were encouraged to stay as long as we wanted and to finish our bottle of wine (BYO). I&#39;m sorry to admit I went in not knowing what to expect, as they just started to serve dinner here and it would be hard to beat how well they do breakfast.

The outside of Breakfast House doesn&#39;t look like much, but the food more than makes up for what is lacking in ambiance. The space is no frills and they have attempted to create outdoor seating out front on Grand Ave (I don&#39;t know who would opt to sit on this side since there is nothing remotely appealing to look at) as well as on the Wood St side (at least this part of the block is tree lined and pretty). My fiancée ordered the chilaquiles which were more than generously portioned and I opted for the veggie frittata. My portion was definitely on the smaller side without being stingy. Both of our items were excellent and thought that the food came out in a timely fashion. They also serve intelligentsia coffee, which is a bonus!My openly complaint is that I ordered a side of toast which they forgot to being out. The server never came to ask how things were and I was done with my frittata by the time I was able to flag her down to remind her my order was incomplete.I&#39;m sure this was a fluke, which is why I&#39;m not holding it against them. This place is close to home and with an abundance of FREE street parking, I&#39;m sure I will be back!"

My sandwich was HUGE, it could easily be split into two meals if you&#39;re not that hungry.  My husband literally did not even have a crumb left on his plate.Our bill? $27 before tip!  Usually my husband and I spend closer to $40 at other Breakfast &amp; Brunch places in the city and ordering similar items, it was such a pleasant surprise!

The staff is very friendly and attentive, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the food is always fresh and high quality. Basically everything you want in &#34;regular spot.&#34;Also, because it&#39;s a little off-the-beaten-path, it&#39;s usually not hard to get a table. This isn&#39;t always true during brunch, but even then it&#39;s not bad.My quest for amazing Huevos Rancheros is what brought me here. And while I don&#39;t claim to be a connoisseur, they are the best I&#39;ve had. Fresh, simple, and when you add Chorizo, extra delicious. I&#39;m also a fan of their steak and eggs. The meat is always cooked right and tastes great. With it they give you some mushrooms that have really good flavor. With both, I usually get a fresh orange juice. This may seem dumb, but if you really like fresh orange juice and get it at restaurants you know it&#39;s something places can actually screw up. Somehow. Breakfast House does not. It&#39;s usually chilled and tastes like fresh orange juice should (i.e. like real oranges).Those two dishes make up 90% of my visits, but I&#39;ve also tried the fried chicken and waffles, croissant sandwich (which is huge), goat cheese salad, turkey sandwich, pulled pork, and hamburger. All of which were great.One last standout is their coleslaw. It has green apples in it which give is a little sweetness to balance out the creaminess, and some added crunch. It&#39;s by far my favorite coleslaw... I&#39;ve even gone in just to buy a big bowl to go. That. Good.I could go on, but basically it&#39;s a solid spot that more people should go to (which I say in the hopes that they&#39;ll bring back their dinner menu)."

Very disappointing coffee for a breakfast spot.The ambience is uncluttered and attractive without being cute, quite peaceful.Oatmeal is cooked with water and therefor healthy.All egg dishes can be prepared with egg whites for a minimal upcharge. They come with a choice of breakfast potatoes, fresh fruit or sliced tomatoes &amp; toast.We love that there is no upcharge for fruit in lieu of potato.The food is very good and the value received is commensurate with the price point! Lots of choices for vegetarians as well as carnivores.Street parking is available on Grand.Small sidewalk areas alongside the restaurant are available, but there is no protection from the sun along Grand.I recommend trying Breakfast House.I deducted a star because the coffee became undrinkable so very quickly on both of our visits.Someone needs to let me know when the coffee is improved, then I may return.

Glad we stopped. Cute small place, the waiter was great and the outside patio tucked under the trees of the side street was a perfect place to sit that day. I had the steak and eggs . Steak was well seasoned topped with mushrooms and very tender, cubed house potatoes and wheat toast. The wife had an omelette with slices of ham off the bone and cheese with the house potatoes. We also shared a short stack of pancakes. the pancakes were just incredible and can&#39;t wait to bring our granddaughter down. she is the pancake expert.  And to top it off they serve my favorite coffee (Intelligentsia). we are both big coffee drinkers in the morning and always like a full cup of hot coffee. the only minor downside is they could have come around more with the the coffee pot. This Hungry Hound gives it 4 stars. Will be going back."

First let me say the restaurant is cute and quaint. I was dining alone and I was greeted and seated immediately. The service was great. I also noticed they are kid friendly so that&#39;s a plus for me when I am dining with my family.So the reason for 2 stars....the food. I ordered the chicken and waffles. My food came out quickly. Almost too quick. The food looked very good. So good I memoralized the moment and posted a pic.I started eating the chicken. I picked apart the breast and it was cold and undercooked. I told my waitress and she took care if it quickly and brought me out a fresh waffle and bacon.I do think I will try again because the waffle was good and I looked at other patrons dishes and they looked good too!  The waffle was light and fluffy and had a good taste. Hopefully my next visit will be better.

I went there recently on a Sunday with my fiancé around 10 am. We were seated quickly and were surprised that the place was some what empty.I didn&#39;t get coffee until 10:15. Sure we had people come by the table, greet us, ask if we had any questions and what we would like to drink. I think I told 3 people, &#34;coffee please&#34;. I also only got 2 refills. I mean I don&#39;t want to keep quoting Mr Pink, but when you go to a breakfast place and get an 8oz cup of coffee, I expect at least 3 or 4 refills.Yes everyone was REALLY nice and polite. Besides the coffee we were treated as expected until it was time to leave. The place did start popping around 10:45 so I am sure our server got busy, However, once we finished with our meals and plates cleared, we waited another 10 minutes for our bill.We had stuff to do and places to go. My ideal breakfast place would include a grab your own coffee option and a cashier to walk up to when you want to leave.The food was just ok as well. I mean I had the special pulled pork hash and it was basically cubed potatoes mixed with pulled pork and two poached eggs on top, nothing hash about it.I&#39;d probably go back, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to get here. And if there was even a slight wait, I&#39;d hit some other place."

After we got our food, we didn&#39;t see our server for another hour. I will say it&#39;s possible our experience was not typical though, judging from the other yelp reviews.The food itself was decent - we ordered the chicken fajitas with corn tortillas to split. I did feel the portion size was a bit small for the price but we both liked that the dish seemed to be on the &#34;healthier&#34; side, served with fresh ingredients and not greasy at all.

First off service sucked last night and food was not good at all. Tried empanadas for appetizer with some super spicy dry beef then a steak entree and chicken entree. Steak was more like a cube steak which I wouldn&#39;t expect for 20 dollars and the potatoes that came with the steak were hard and inedible. The chicken dish came out and the potatoes were softer but the chicken was rolled up and weird. I wouldn&#39;t eat here again. Ambiance is cute tho and romantic with red lighting.

We can&#39;t come here without getting the ceviche, and we also tried the crab cake which was recommended by our server as one of his favorites.For main entrees I got the filet which comes with grilled shrimp and sweet potato purée. My steak was cooked to perfection and literally melted in my mouth. There are no other words for how good it was. Hubby tried a special of skirt steak with cilantro pesto served with yuca and plantains. It was spicy but he loved it!!Our service was fantastic.  Everyone is so friendly there. We actually got the opportunity to speak to Rick, the manager there, and give feedback about our previous experience. Las Palmas is a family run business and you can tell how passionate they are about it. Rick was so open to our feedback and how to make the dining experience better. Not a lot of places will do that and I think that help to set Las Palmas apart.Can&#39;t wait to go back and drink a coconut mojito on the patio!"

It was you and not the salsa. After finding out you were an Aquarius I&#39;ve spent the entire morning listening to The 5th Dimension albums and even the closing credits of The 40 Year Old Virgin. You judging / staring at couples on dates made me wonder why you and I weren&#39;t on a date judging one another. I wouldn&#39;t even take my coat off. Again, I would be hot. Food was good, too!PS.

Starting off, I&#39;ve never had tequila that actually tasted good, until the manager Rick welcomed us with some of their home made blend, it was fantastic. The margaritas were incredible as well. The chips and guac were out of this world. I asked or waiter for his favorite menu item with pork, and whatever he brought me was by far one of the best meals I&#39;ve have in Chicago, bar none.As a side note, I&#39;ve known the manager Rick since college. He was a very hard worker in college and he is a very hard worker today. He really does a great job with the restaurant, it has a perfect Wicker Park vibe.

The menu features amp&#39;d up Mexican favorites as well as new interpretations of bisto dished from other cuisines. Good menu choices, compact wine list, fairly priced.VIBE:  Pleasant room, cozy, cute décor but not trendy. Eclectic Latino-tinged music at conversation-friendly level. It was nearly empty when I was there, so noise was not an issue.SERVICE:  Cordial, attentive but not rushed. The proprietor circulated and warmly greeted a few regulars while we were there.LIKED:  Someone in the kitchen knows what they&#39;re doing -- nice menu, well executed. Good flavors all around. Amazing molé (chocolaty, nutty, chili-kissed) on the lamb chops (borrego). Tender (and not stringy) cochinita pibil (pork shoulder) in a superb sauce. Corn tortillas and tortilla chips were very fresh &amp; tasty, not greasy at all.This was a real find for me. I don&#39;t often dine in the Bucktown neighborhood, and this is a great choice (as is nearby Cumin). I&#39;ll make it a point to be back."

Irritating as all hell.  Insanely overpriced. I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s nearly $20 for chicken fajitas that consist of ONE bland, sliced chicken breast and veggies.  My filet was good and seemed on point for price, but I&#39;ve had much less expensive/tastier Sangria elsewhere. Was told a $28 carafe would provide 4 glasses. Catch is, they aren&#39;t wine glasses, but instead highball glasses.  I just didn&#39;t feel anything here was a standout..despite a dinner bill for 2 in excess of a $100, plus tax &amp; tip.  For just a LITTLE more, I could have dined at a Fogo de Chao.  How they stay in business is beyond me. Yes, they smile. I would too if I was getting almost $30 for a carafe of cheap wine...just sayin&#39;...In summation, I dined in a nearly-empty, noisy sun-room with a sad view of tarp-covered patio furniture that piped in Top 40 tunes..while sitting beneath several burned out ceiling bulbs. Blah.  Honestly, I felt robbed and was bummed about the entire experience.  Quite the racket, Las Palmas.

I ordered the Tacos De Pez , which is 3 pan seared tilapia tacos topped with jicama and mango slaw. They were served on corn tortillas. Fish was flaky, seasoned well, and light.Overall, great service and delicious food. Although the tacos were great and I would eat them again, I don&#39;t know if I would pay $17-$19 for 3 tacos. - 1 point"

I had dinner at this great restaurant on a Friday evening.  I met some friends there and from the moment we walked in it was a great experience.  It&#39;s family owned restaurant and the family is there to greet you and serve as well.  We walked and in decided to have dinner in the back patio.  It was a beautiful summer night and there was a guitar player singing boleros in the back. The music added to the relaxed but romantic mood of the restaurant.We immediately ordered some margaritas.  I had the Jarochita margarita, it was a vanilla bean and pineapple infused tequila with a little rum.  My friend had the pepinada, also great.For dinner I had the camarones al mojo de ajo and and my friends had La Calabaza. The entrees were delicious! We even had a Chicago Star show up and sit next to our table.  Ozzie Guillen had dinner right next to us! He let us take his picture and even took a picture with us!We really enjoyed dining here and I hope to go back many times for lots of special dinners!"

They have a hopping back patio and a large dining room in the rear of the restaurant.  So, size can be deceiving from the front.The decor is a bit dated in the back dining room and it&#39;s awkward getting from the front of the restaurant to the back passing through a &#34;working area, &#34; but you will get over all if that when you taste the food.  YUM!  Averaging $17-22, all entrees from the scallops, to the pork chops, the fish tacos, skirt steak and rack of lamb were cooked to perfection for our group of 12 with interesting sauces and sides. That&#39;s hard to do!The only thing that&#39;s missing is tres leche for dessert.  The dessert menu was just ok.Thanks for a great meal Las Palmas!"

We were seated right away in the back room which had a great ambiance. The waiter was very attentive, and our food was ready very quickly!We started off with chips and salsa, and my only complaint was that they were so yummy I was halfway full before my entree was ready!My SO had the skirt steak, which was delicious. But the garlic shrimp... I had the garlic shrimp, and it was AMAZING. My SO kept trying to trade me some of his steak for my shrimp, but I wasn&#39;t having it!One of the impressive things about Las Palmas is the way all of their dishes come together with flavors that perfectly compliment each other. Many restaurants add sides or garnishes just for presentation, but the Las Palmas chefs really pay attention to how each flavor will work together.I really recommend this place for great Mexican food!"

I came here with my girlfriend and cousin because we read the reviews on Yelp and saw lots of praise.The Margaritas Fresca were simply amazing. I had two.Our appetizer was a combo of shrimp, scallops, squash...and a ton of awesome. It was something I&#39;d never had before and it was a beautiful creation.Each of us got something different for dinner. El Casa Barracha, Mar y Tierra, and another unpronounceable with corn tortillas stuffed with some of the most amazing flavors. Each was better than the next and I was tremendously impressed.The waiter struggled early on with our English (no big deal) which actually made the service feel more authentic.I would recommend this for anyone. Gourmet Mexican. $50/person at the end of the night but worth every penny."

It&#39;s always fun walking through the front section to just open up into this gorgeous green space.The chips, salsa, and guacamole are tremendous. They make the guacamole at a central table--so it&#39;s not quite table side, but you pretty much watch them do it. The service is also excellent, so those chips never run out.The menu is an absolute gem. The Casa Barroacha is essentially their house steak, and I&#39;m not usually a fan of steak, but this is steak that is essentially soaked in a flavorful tequila all day and served in absolute marinated perfection. La Calabaza is essentially a saffron risotto that is packed full of flavor and incredibly savory. The taste lingers, and it&#39;s definitely divine.Las Palmas offers some American favorite dishes too, like steak/chicken/veggie fajitas or queso fundido, but I wouldn&#39;t necessarily recommend these staple items since they really thrive in their creative masterpieces.I will definitely be back for more!"

After reading so many great reviews I thought that maybe this restaurant was coming back again! I stopped coming here a few years ago due to bad service and bad food.-Ceviche was okay, it was a combination of pico de gallo with fish.-Taquitos de pollo were bland and chicken was dried-Pastelito de cangrejo(crab cake) was cold and the &#34;jalapeño aioli&#34; was missing the jalapeño because all I got was mayonnaise-Carne Azteca was somewhat okay, the meat was tough.I was a bit confused when I ordered a &#34;House margarita&#34; and was told that for a dollar more the &#34;Fresca Margarita&#34; would be a better choice since they mix is made in house versus the &#34;house margarita&#34;  that is store bought.Chips and salsa - Chips were delicious but I didn&#39;t understand the &#34;salsa&#34; which consists of, what i believe is, canned tomato sauce with chopped up onions and cilantro.Overall, the food is bland... blah, blah, blah. They are almost afraid to add some spice into those dishes. The restaurant needs a face lift.Service was okay, although, I&#39;m not sure what the two hostess were doing in the back the entire time. They were loud and obnoxious with this one table of guys. Very unprofessional. Its a restaurant not a park."

My group came here for a birthday party but people came about an hour late. Despite this, they held our table and treated us with utmost respect.As for the food, the skirt steak isbomb.com. Well marinated and packed with bold flavors. Also, if you think that the standard salsa isn&#39;t spicy (I sure as hell didn&#39;t), ask for their special HOT ones. Seriously....I&#39;m Asian and I thought that &#39;ish was spicy. First couple of bites I felt brave and kept getting larger and larger portions until my tongue decided to shut down on me. Too manly to ask for milk either so I just accepted my hot and spicy fate.Oh yeah, Sangria is good to boot. Waiting staff here is funny too as we asked them for slang translations in Spanish and they laughed along with us. Definately come give this spot a try."

Both were sensational and memorable times. Coming from a Mexican-american I can vouch without a doubt that these recipes are authentic and also innovative as well to modern cooking. Have tried the Salmon a la parilla and it was off the hook. Picky about Salmon, but they cook it just right. Most recent visit here, I tried the Carne Azteca and it was amazing! The steak was medium rare to my liking, and was still juicy. El guacamole complimented the carne so well. For it being in a nice area, the prices arent bad at all. The quality is definitely there. I am a fan of having dinner in the back by the patio. Estuvo bien rico mi platillo y las meseras muy amables. A mi gente se los recomiendo por la calidad y el servicio."

Server basically only took our orders and that was that, there was no descriptions of food as plates were dropped, empty plates sat on the table for a while, check was dropped before I could vocalize that we were all set. No one said goodbye to us as we exited.Now as far as the food goes, it is high quality and enjoyable. We ordered the empandas, they were great although in the future I would ask for sauce on the side. We ordered the surf and turf and tequila soaked steak, the surf and Turf was overcooked (asked for medium, got medium well), and shrimp was rubbery. The tequila soaked steak was much better, well balanced and cooked to perfection.Got two desserts, both were quite disappointing and we should have skipped it. The cheesecake tasted like box mix and the chocolate cake was just okay."

I&#39;m working on my Spanish vocabulary, but none of those words hits the top 1,000 most used. So, I&#39;ll just say, &#34;salmone,&#34; the fish that they prepare with a tasty poblano cream salsa, tasty sauteéd spinach and well-crisped polenta cakes. Not your papás taco stand here. Muy deliciosa.We had queso fundido as a starter--what&#39;s not to like about a big hunk of melted cheese--though nothing especially especial. But when matched with a pitcher of the margaritas, there&#39;s no problemo waiting for food. The server was very friendly and knowledgeable, and the couple on the other side of the room whose body language radioed that they were on a first date was entertaining. I&#39;m not giving Las Palmas credit for that, though; which in the end turns out to be good for them. That telenovela lacked even the low-key passion of our queso fundido--it was tasty, but after a small sample, there would have been too much routine to keep the flame high enough to keep those fatty non-acids from congealing.Also, some serviceable guacamole--now that, I can never get enough of."

Our waitress was a cute older Mexican woman that was just adorable to listen to. Initially my husband and I were sat outside in the back of the restaurant on their patio. Lots of families with children out there and you don&#39;t have too much privacy. Luckily, for us, the other half of our party had been sat inside so we ended up moving inside to join them.We started with one of their homemade guacamole with spice, since they make it as you request.  It&#39;s a large serving; one serving could easily serve 4 people. I also had them make my margarita with some spice and boy did it have a kick to it!For my entrée I ordered the salmon, which is served on two small polenta cakes and some arugula. The salmon was cooked exactly as I asked for it, which was a huge win in my mind since I&#39;m extremely picky about fish. My girlfriend ordered chicken fajitas which looked very fresh and delicious. The boys&#39; entrees looked fresh and yummy as well!Overall I would definitely recommend this place, it&#39;s just a tad bit expensive for what I would think I would end up paying."

Hmmmm.I had the Cochinita Pibil; OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I absolutely LOVED the roasted habanero salsa.  (Yes, take care of that one. It has a kick hot enough to have a fire engine closeby.)My wife who is a vegetarian had the ENCHAYOTADAS.  THAT WAS DELICIOUS.  In fact, I liked that better than my own dish.  Hmmmmmmm mama mia, I can still eat that again and again.  Absolutely stunning dish.All of you know I&#39;m big on service.  This restaurant scored full points from my side.  Very nice service, never felt rushed in any way, were taken care of absolutely well and our waitress as well as the other staff were very attentive in making sure our water glasses were kept filled, empty plates cleared in a quick manner, etc.I will definitely go here again.  BTW, decided on this restaurant because I saw it on Check Please."

I thought it might be iffy ordering duck in a Mexican restaurant, maybe that&#39;s ignorant, but I don&#39;t think its unfair to say that its not a typical menu item. Let me just tell you that this duck was sensational. Everything from the gorgeous crispy skin, to the perfect cook temperature (Mid-rare), to the extremely flavorful peach salad that came with it. All on top of buttery sauteed spinach. I intentionally made myself eat slower so that I could prolong the experience. They even slice it up for you so you see all the gorgeousness and don&#39;t even have to work that hard to eat it :)We had to get a Margarita pitcher, that was a great decision. She said it would be like 2 Margs each between two of us, ended up being 3 whole Margs each in the Tiki glass they give you, which was pretty big regardless.We sat right next to the Guac station which was nice to watch. The guy smashed up all the ingredients right in the middle of the place so you see all the freshness going into it while he uses an authentic pestle grinder to get it all mixed up."

WOW!We were planning on going to Big Star, but the wait was 40min and we were both very impatient and starving. So we ended up looking up similar cuisine on Yelp and Las Palmas showed up. Perfect! We decided to come here instead and were VERY pleasantly surprised.The owner/server welcomed us right away. We ordered guacamole, some rib special on their special menu, tilapia taco, and pork loin. Their guacamole was freshly made (I saw someone standing at the guaca station and made it from scratch). It&#39;s definitely one of the best guacamole I&#39;ve had. The rib special (don&#39;t remember the name) was AMAZING! The meat fell right off the bones, seasoned very well, and the sauce added a bit spice to it but not overwhelming. More importantly, it&#39;s already a lot of food and we haven&#39;t even had our entrees yet.Then here came the entrees. My fish tacos were tasty and BIG, and there were three of them. One bite and I couldn&#39;t stop eating. My husband&#39;s pork loin was very moist and tender, which is really hard to achieve as most places have dry/tough pork loin. We think this was the second best pork loin we&#39;ve had, behind Ruxbin (which is really nothing to be ashamed of, Ruxbin&#39;s pork loin is unreal).In summary, this is one of the best Mexican places we&#39;ve been to. And personally. I think it blew Frontera Grill out of the water."

We had no problem making a reservation for a Friday night and were seated promptly when we arrived. It was one of those early spring nights where it just a little too cold to sit on the patio, but I will definitely be back to sit out there this summer. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, he came over right away to take our drink order. I started with a mojito that was one of the best I&#39;ve had in a while. Not too sweet, just enough lime, great start to the meal. Sunny thoroughly enjoyed her margarita an Claire also enjoyed her wine.To start, we had the fresh-made guacamole with some spice. All of the ingredients tasted incredibly fresh and we devoured that pretty quickly! For dinner, we all went different routes with the scallops, seafood stew, and duck. It was extremely difficult for us to choose our entrees because everything sounded so delicious! Each entree is unique and contains many elements. I ended up going with the duck and was really happy with my choice. The meat was cooked perfectly and the accompanying sauce, spicy slaw, and sauteed spinach completed the dish. My dining companions were really happy with the seafood stew and scallops, both of which looked great.Overall, I can&#39;t wait to return and eat on their patio this summer.

The flavor didn&#39;t pop. The mole for the chicken was okay; flavor could have been darker and deeper. The guacamole prep station was oddly in the dining area. Every five minutes, I heard the pounding of the ingredients against the stone bowl. It was loud and very annoying. We asked ourselves if they didn&#39;t have room in the kitchen. The only reason I give this place three stars is because of the customer service, which was better than the dishes for sure. I appreciate their smiles and attentiveness. Very good people."

My boyfriend and I went here the day after Valentines Day because I worked on that most &#34;romantic&#34; holiday. He took me here and let me just say it was absolutely amazing. Parking was not much of a hassle. The day we went there was seriously a blizzard going on outside. We just parked right across the street with no problem. When we got inside we were seated right away. *amazing* The atmosphere was subdued which was nice. It was dim lit and there were small little votive candles on each table. HOW ROMANTIC! Trust me I really liked it. The menu was a little was well thought out and the service was outstanding. Our server was the restaurant owners son. Great guy, great server. Our food was amazing as well. We first started our with Pastelito de Cangrejo (crab cakes) which was garnished with jicama, cucumber, and avocado relish. So good and you can tell it was made to order. It was very fresh. Now for our main meal...my boyfriend ordered the Cochinita Pibil (braised pork shoulder which was slow roasted in banan leaves with black beans and habanero salsa) So so so good and the meat was so tender and melted in your mouth. I ordered the Pato Picoso which is grilled duck breast with orange black berry glaze on a bed of greens with pecans, goat cheese and a ginger honey vinaigrette. DELISH! We also ended our meal with dessert which was their top selling dessert, Churros. I know you may think, huh?? Churros? That&#39;s such a lame dessert to order at such a great restaurant. No, no, no my friend....Churros served at Las Palmas comes with a tequila-abuelita chocolate fudge dipping sauce.I&#39;ll let you just digest my review.

What a ringing endorsement!  We came over on a warm September evening; so warm we were able to sit on their back patio. We opened our dining experience with ceviche and a coconut mojito. The coconut mojito was out of this world ...the flavor rocked my taste buds in a way it has never been rocked before. Really was good!For my meal, I went with the Costillas which is oven roasted pork ribs in a guava bbq sauce served with fries and corn salsa. The meal was delicious as the ribs were very tender and melted right off of the bone. The meal was sooo good I had o get another coconut mojito to accompany the delicious food.

Come here to relax on their no frills yet serene patio while enjoying authentic, delicious Mexican food at an affordable price. We brought our own beer that we bought at Rich&#39;s Deli, a cute little market down the street. I ordered two pollo adobado tacos. After some chips, salsa and guac, the two tacos were more than enough food. Come here hungry. The portions here are generous! My friend ate his entire burrito which regretted later as he was super full all night!We spent a long time on the patio, drinking for about an hour after we finished our food. The server was very hospitable and didn&#39;t rush us at all (it was kind of quiet though). You pay inside, which prevented us from feeling rushed.Overall, this is a great place to come on a date or to catch up with good friends, but the kind of friends who want authentic good Mexican food and don&#39;t care much about decor or a scene. Afterward, check out the EZ Inn down the street for cocktails and dancing!"

Over 60 reviews of Salsa Picante and no one has pointed out the glaring fact that at Salsa Picante the salsa is not picante? Here&#39;s a fitting slogan for this restaurant, I&#39;m great at Spanish.SALSA PICANTE: DONDE EL SALSA NO ES PICANTE.It might as well have been tomato soup. The al pastor burrito I had was sizable, not overpriced, and came with avocado, which was cool. Unfortunately, the meat was way under seasoned and under spiced. It was similar to the pork shreds that would be in a pork chow mein, to be honest. The rice was bland too. The main flavor I got from the burrito was sour cream. But it looked so good! Darn.I might come back and try a different meat because the price was good for the amount of food, and the service was quick and friendly. Overall, this is not 4.5 star Mexican food. More like 3.5 rounded down to 3 because, seriously? Salsa Picante. Lol. It&#39;s like if Red Lobster only sold green lobster. It&#39;s a mind blow. Change your name or put some kick in your salsa for crying out loud."

The restaurant was not busy with partons at the actual establishment but I could see they had a ton of grubhub and called in orders so I let it slide.  I mean, it must be good if that many people are ordering, right?!I ordered a chicken burrito with marinated shredded  chicken instead of chopped plain chicken for my husband.  I went for the marinated chicken taco dinner and we split the guac and chips which actually comes with a second choice of queso dip or salsa so of course queso, how is that a question?!So on to the good, bad, tasty and not so yum...Burrito= smaller to average size, my husband enjoyed it, good amount of flavor and the marinated chicken has a good kick.Chicken tacos= pretty much the same as above, good flavor and kick in tacos and the rice and beans in the dinner were decent. Rice better than beans.Guac/chips/queso= guac was flavorless and really small portion.  Queso was excellent and probably the highlight for the meal. Chips were pretty fresh and had a hint of lime.Price= $31.00 in total for all of the above which is not terrible but for to-go mexican a bit high for my taste.Not sure this place will make it into my rotation, not terrible my any means but just not one of my favorites when we have so many amazing places in the city.  I think I would rather drive about 10 min south and hit pilsen."

The space is tight - 3 tables and 7 bar stools is all they offer for seating. My server was so delightful and to be honest she&#39;s the main reason I&#39;m giving Picante 5 stars.  I had American brunch food on my mind walking into here, so I asked if they could make me steak &amp; eggs tacos.  Lol, an odd request for a Mexican establishment (I know), but she was ever-so pleased to meet my requests. It&#39;s funny because I&#39;m not one to alter menus, I usually take food the way restaurants prepare it.  Not to mention, most servers nowadays aren&#39;t too pleased about adjusting recipes.  Her joyful personality and grateful hospitality will definitely bring me back in for another lunch.My girlfriend really liked her steak torta. The bread tasted fresh and was jam packed with avocado &amp; she didn&#39;t even ask for it.  They offered 3 different salsas, all of which I demolished. The verde was my favorite: not overpowering with spice but very robust in flavor. Oh and they got churros that aren&#39;t sitting underneath a heat lamp all day. Yes."

Stumbled by after striking out at the empty bottle&#39;s block party.First off, BYOB. We were too hungry to go searching for booze though so we stuck with tacos.Now to the food. They have 2 kinds of tacos: a &#34;super taco&#34; and a &#34;regular taco.&#34; The difference? Think of a super taco with the trimmings - sour cream, tomatoes, lettuce cheese. Their regular taco - cilantro + onion.I will say, I had my reservations about this place - some of the food looked pre-made and sitting there (vs. made to order). but...one bite, and I was convinced I&#39;d be back. Easy on the wallet too."

We stumbled on this little mom n pop shop Mexican joint. I wasn&#39;t super hungry but definitely wanted to grab a bite since I had such a light lunch. Tacos anybody?Their super tacos are served with sour cream, tomatoes, lettuce and cheese on flour tortillas. I preferred their regular tacos which was essentially your traditional Mexican street taco served on two corn tortillas your choice of meat topped with chopped cilantro and onions. I had a bite of my girlfriend&#39;s pollo and asado super tacos, the meat was great and super tasty. I went for the regular tacos with carnitas and chorizo. Carnitas was super tender and juicy and chorizo was a bit oily (expected) but a nice mild spice and flavor to it. Would probably prefer the chorizo with some eggs in a breakfast taco / burrito but that&#39;s just my two cents.Anyways, this place is BYOB! To sure to bring modelos, dos equis, or bohemias to wash it all down! &#39;Til next time, cheers!"

So yeah expect a lil longer wait times if they are working together.Brought my torta I mean burrito home. lol.  Overall flavor I&#39;d give it a 3 but the proportion of ingredients was off. I had more rice than anything else, (hence all filler and no thriller), in this case I don&#39;t recall ordering a rice torta.  Anyways what I enjoyed most besides the counter top seating was the salsas.

I love authentic, non-hipster Mexican food, and this place looked like a more modern version of the great Chicago taquerias I grew up eating at on the south side, so I decided to give it a try. I had picked up a beer from Rich&#39;s Deli so I could BYOB, and luckily Salsa Picante is. The ambiance is very casual, with Mexican rock and pop music playing on the radio instead of the more usual banda music. It is very clean and the employees are very friendly.I ordered a steak burrito, and my meal came with chips and salsa. The chips were warm and fresh, and the salsa was a fairly good medium red salsa. I ate my burrito with their green salsa, which was very good. Most Mexican restaurants cook their carne asada relatively well-done, and it can ruin the flavor. The steak on my burrito was very tender and perfectly seasoned. The burrito was stuffed with rice, beans, lettuce, sour cream, tomatoes, and avocado. I was particularly impressed by how well-made the burrito was, in terms of construction. It never once fell apart and made a mess like so many burritos and pita sandwiches are wont to do. Overall it was an excellent burrito."

First and foremost, the food and service is terrific. The food came quickly which is smart, by staffing up the kitchen for increased throughout they can turn over more tables, but that said, we never felt hurried our rushed to leave. Just the opposite, we felt welcome, appreciate and happy that our food came so quickly. Shortly after being seated, the manager came over, introduced himself, welcome us and told him to let him know if we needed anything which resonated with me. Nice touch.  Obviously he&#39;s comfortable enough that his ship is being run well that he can personally focus on the most important task at hand, a satisfying customer experience.Second, Luxbar is deep in the heart of see and be seen country so it is as dynamic and vibrant a brunch people watching scene as you can find in Chicago. That said, many locals, such as I, who enjoy the beautiful flowered street ambiance as well can be found nestled throughout the posh crowd.I don&#39;t remember what I ordered but it came with freshmy made tasty home fries, fresh perfectly scrambled tasty eggs, deliciously spiced breakfast sausage,  fabulous double smoked artisan bacon strips and what appeared to be a home made jam. It was served in an iron skillet so it was nice and warm when it arrived. The portion was substantial. I recall making a mental note that the coffee was quite good as well.  My entire party enjoyed their food as well.For my own selfish reasons I&#39;d like to see them take more risk with more innovative menu choices but I also understand that given their volume of customers, the need to simplfy and focus on the quality of food and service. I also understand that they understand this is a more mainstream crowd then one finds in fringe neighborhoods.Luxbar is back on my A list for brunch destinations."

Most people were sitting outside but my brother wanted to stay inside so we were the only people indoors. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. She brought out the bread basket when we asked and took our orders. My brother enjoyed his shrimp cocktail and my mom and I split the lobster cocktail which was pretty good, I enjoyed the Dijon sauce it came with.For my entrée I got the BLT salad which is basically a wedge. I did not care for the bacon, but that was just me. I know a lot of people like it thick cut and chewy. My mom had the Maine Lobster Roll sandwich and she loved it. My brother got the Lux burger and said it was one of the best burgers he&#39;s ever had. We also got a side of the Brussel Sprouts, but they were just ok. I wouldn&#39;t get them again.We did try the turtle sundae and the snickers pie for dessert. The sundae was very boring but the pie was HUGE and very good. 4 people could likely share it."

Honestly, I just feel like if you&#39;re gonna go out to dinner in Chicago, you can do better.The service is always friendly, but good lord is it slow!  My most recent visit took 40 minutes to get our food from the time we ordered, and it was a pretty empty restaurant.  We had to flag down anyone we could find to close out because our server was non existent.  This could be a fantastic place is a great location; make it happen!"

LuxBar is yet another huge success by Steve Lombardo and Hugo Ralli, from Gibsons Steakhouse and Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar &amp; Fish House fame.LuxBar was inspired by the work of Adolf Loos whose &#34;American Bar&#34; was designed and built in early 20th Century Vienna. The bar captured an elegance in simplicity; a style that greatly influenced the work of Frank Lloyd Wright and other American architects in the &#34;prairie school.&#34; Stone, glass, brass and wood bathed in natural light, presence in the neighborhood is welcomed and profound. This is a special place by design.LuxBar is often referred to as a &#34;neighborhood saloon&#34; and is designed to convey that same simple elegance, just remember that the neighborhood is where you&#39;ll find the 40-something Neurosurgeons and Hedge Fund Managers mixed with the 30-something tourists and the 20-somethings lost from Division and Rush.The food is feel good fresh, natural and easily understood. Artisanal in style, the menu reflects what the partnership views as an accessible cornucopia of what you might eat on just any occasion. I feel like I&#39;ve tried almost everything on the menu, and have always been extremely pleased. Some of my favorites are the filet mignon sliders, jumbo shrimp cocktail, and jumbo lump crab cake. Sometimes, they don&#39;t have what I want on the menu, and I&#39;ll have them make me something. My usual is a toned-down Caesar salad with light dressing and grilled chicken.The specialty cocktails are from natural, fresh ingredients: simple elegance. My favorite is starting with a glass or two of Champagne and from there, most of the bartenders mix me up my favorite fruity vodka drinks. Although, the &#34;Drink Book&#34; has a very impressive list of specialty cocktails, &#34;Make Your Own Manhattan,&#34; wines, drafts, spirits, etc. For example, the bourbon list goes on for 2-3 pages, so you will definitely find anything you&#39;re looking for, and much, much more.The staff at LuxBar is trained in the customer care philosophy that has made Gibsons Steakhouse and Hugo&#39;s Frog Bar and Fish House famous for legendary service. I enjoy the pleasant mix between the staff knowing my order and chatting, but not getting too personally involved. I have always received impeccable service.Oh, and for all of you restroom obsessed Yelpers, like most quality bars and restaurants around Division and Rush, there is a restroom attendant who makes sure that not only the restroom stays spotless, that also there are plenty of beauty accoutrements for even the most picky, so make sure to bring some cash to tip accordingly.Of note...Parking is usually very difficult. The easiest for me, is to take a cab and get dropped off. Also, there is valet across the street for the hotel, which is always very accommodating, if I happen to drive.Private Dining and Party Hosting is AvailableEventsLuxBar often has seasonal events, so definitely frequently check their website.This Easter Sunday, there will be an appearance from the Easter Bunny from 11am-2pm.Mondays are &#34;Industry Monday&#34; with 50% off drinks and appetizers, in the bar only, from 11am-2am.Hours:Mon-Thurs: 11:00 am - 2:00 amFri 8:00 am - 2:00 amSat 8:00 am - 3:00 amSun 8:00 am - 2:00 amFor more information:luxbar.comI 5/5 highly recommend LuxBar!"

They boast one of the city&#39;s most comprehensive whiskey selections, as well as a respectable draft beer and wine-by-the-glass list, and for that they (would) get five stars.From the hummus to wedge salad to roasted salmon with celery root to meatloaf with mushroom gravy, food here is usually solid, although never exceptional or moan-inducing -- likely a symptom of being a part of the Gibsons family. I advise against the goopy, tasteless, heartburn-inducing steak and black bean chili, as well as the beef carpaccio, which suffers from a jumble of too many sharp flavors (pickled shallots, balsamic glaze, parmesan).Service, while efficient, rarely offers much in the way of warmth; a smile every now and then would be lovely. Maybe by the time I arrive, the staff has already had hours of putting up with corporate asshats and airheads. Shouldn&#39;t matter, though.Whatever. I come for the whiskey.For those of you complaining about the prices, you know what area of town you&#39;re in, right?"

I had the fried chicken and my roommate had the lobster roll. She said her lobster roll was good. My fried chicken was a disappointment. I liked the crispy skin, it had a good crunch but the meat didn&#39;t taste seasoned. It also came with honey as a sauce, which I didn&#39;t get understand, but that might be an American tradition I don&#39;t know about. Other than that everything was okay."

I emailed her with questions and she replied the same day with clear answers. I called her about an impromptu visit and she was available. She did not pressure us in any way, shape, or form.The event space was above the LUXBAR restaurant and was divided into two sections by a bar in the middle. There was a fireplace and tall windows that opened out to a small balcony. If we didn&#39;t like the furniture they would swap it with something else from another Gibson Group restaurant. They could comfortably accommodate 80 guests on each side of the space allowing us to have a ceremony on one side, switch to the other side for cocktails, then back again for a seated dinner, and move on to dancing.An open bar, passed hors d&#39;oeuvres, and a seated two course dinner for 80 guests including tax and gratuity would cost us $12,500 on a summer Saturday evening. Our guests would have a choice of five entrees. The staff would take care of set up and clean up. If we had decorations they would arrange them for us also. We would have to bring our own dessert or pay more for theirs.We enjoyed dinner at LUXBAR in the restaurant to see if we liked the food. We had Steak Frites and a Birkshire Pork Chop (pictured). Both were seasoned and cook PERFECTLY. The meat could be easily chewed without being too soft. The sauces did not overpower the natural flavors of the meat. I am having a hard time recalling if I&#39;ve ever had better cooked meat - especially without any direction to the chef. My props to Chef Michael!The fries with the steak were narrowly cut and fried crispy and seasoned. They reminded me of shoestring fries. Even though we were not impressed by the fries we couldn&#39;t stop eating them!We finished with a Seasonal Cherry Pie. We loved the crumbly crust and the locally sourced vanilla ice-cream. Beyond that, the pie was satisfying.We enjoyed two of the Build Your Own Manhattan and were delighted that they had high quality options including hand-cut ice. I also had an adult hot chocolate (Jalisco Hot Cocoa) sprinkled with paprika (delicious) followed by the Eventide. The Eventide was surprisingly ah-mazing. It mixed my favorite beer (Left Hand Milk Stout) with Few whiskey among other components. It was smooth, mature, delicately sweet, and creamy. I had two of them!Dinner, dessert, and all of our drinks cost about $150.The service at LUXBAR was incredibly professional. The servers wore black slacks, white shirts, and black ties (even the ladies). They are well accustomed to satisfying the demanding whims of wealthy local seniors and then switching to the unpredictability of tourists. They are smiling professionals who are able to deliver a consistent experience across the board."

Honestly, we came across the site on OpenTable and, unlike many restaurants in Chicago on a Monday, they were open. SOOO glad we chose them! The menu is simple, but what they do is great! We got there at 11 for an early lunch, and we were able to choose anyplace in the dining area. We sat by the fireplace, which on a Chicago winter afternoon, is a great place to hang out! The servers always made sure that our water glasses were full, which is always a sign of a great restaurant with great service!We started off with drinks, and I had the El Diabolo, a tequila based drink with ginger beer and cream de casis. It was definitely different...a little bitter but it was good! Between the four of our, we shared two appetizers. One friend and I had the tuna tartare, which really hit the spot! The tuna was very fresh, lightly mayoed and served with a good helping of fresh home chips. I really appreciated that there was more than enough chips for the amount of tartare that was there. The other two had the appetizer mac and cheese. Not the best mac and cheese I&#39;ve had, but it was definitely good and tasty!Honestly, what drew me in when deciding on coming to the Luxbar was the filet and lobster sliders! It was even better that I found out when we arrived that they had a slider combo with two sliders and a side salad or soup! I also really wanted to try the King Crab bisque, so problem solved! The sliders were.....simply....to die for! The fillets were cooked to a perfect medium rare, which is pretty difficult for the size of the meat! There was also a very large piece of lobster tail on top of the two fillets. Just perfect! The bisque itself was also amazing! Very rich and creamy, however not huge pieces of crab. The flavor of crab within the soup, however, was amazing!Service was on par, with the waiter showing the perfect amount of attention and not hovering at all. We also never had to ask for a waiter when we needed it! I was a little nervous with the size of the table for four (on the small side), but they cleared plates away very quickly to make sure that everything fit on the table and that we didn&#39;t feel crowded.Since we came right when they opened, we had no problem getting a seat, but by the time we left, the restaurant was full, so I&#39;d definitely suggest a reservation if you&#39;re planning ahead.Great service....great food....we&#39;ll definitely be back!!"

The sliders are tasty little filet mignon&#39;s on soft, buttery buns. I order my steak medium rare... they melt in your mouth. I paired them with either mashed potatoes or broccoli. One little slider and you&#39;ll be hooked. ;) Try their brunch too."

Not so fitting of its name LUXbar... more like a family or everyday kind of place you go for a sandwich or a salad. Portions are large and quality is good. Nothing spectacular but defiantly worthy of a meal if your in the area.

The service, food and ambiance all make Lumbar worthy of 5 stars.The sweet chili fried calamari is a really good appetizer. The calamari pieces are really big and the sweet chili sauce is the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.The classic cobb salad is really good and the rotisserie chicken they use gives the salad a little twist from what I have usually thought of as a &#34;classic&#34; cobb. I may be partial to this salad because I love Cobb salads in general!The crab cake entree is really good, however it may not be enough food to warrant an entire, especially without an appetizer or added side. The dish consists of 1, very large and thick crab cake, with a slaw on the side. I aded saluted spinach as an additional side dish and between the two, I was full and satisfied.Clearly, I recommend trying lumbar!

Perfectly cooked, lots of great toppings. A little messy, but that&#39;s how you know it&#39;s good. The truffle fries are divine and definitely worth the extra couple bucks.Our waiter was really nice and was making non-cheesy jokes and conversation. I do have a complaint about the patio though: there are way too many table and chairs in such a small area. It was hard to maneuver into our seats, and we constantly felt in the way of food runners and other patrons. That aside, I would definitely come back if I found myself in the neighborhood.

Just like always though the staff is friendly and with no reservations at 9:30 on a Thursday night they were able to squeeze us in and we got a table in a matter of minutes.Our waiter (shout out to JJ) was a sweetheart. We were ready for some cocktails and he did a great job helping us make our selection. Watch out for the Rose! It has a light taste but will sneak up on you...2...3 of these...lol and your done. The Hibiscus was good as well. I wasn&#39;t a fan though of the orange blossom.  My girl called it &#34;the no playing around drink &#34; it was strong and the taste I would liken it to peeling an orange and then just chewing on the peel for a while.The truffle fries were good, but I wish they had been a little less crispier.

The homemade bun was fantastic.The only reason I&#39;m giving 3 instead of 5 stars is the burger came slathered in mayo and this was absolutely not listed on the menu. Mayo is the ultimate dealbreaker for me and it makes me irrationally angry when restaurants don&#39;t list it and then put it on your food anyways. Why not either clearly list it on the menu or serve it on the side? I know I&#39;m not the only person who doesn&#39;t like mayo.  Personal pet peeve, but it gets me very riled up.

Pretty simple dishes that I would expect could be easily well-executed. The calamari was generic, with a great sauce over it - but the calamari itself was not cooked exceptionally well. The mac &amp; cheese I was very disappointed in - particularly in Chicago with phenomenal food all over, you would expect &#34;good.&#34; The cheese was hardened over some mediocre noodles.

The meal would&#39;ve been perfect if it cost $21.95 at a Denny&#39;s in Hammond, IN. The bone-in skin-on chicken was devoid of any seasoning- a simple pan sauce would have greatly improved it. The same counts for the roasted veggies and brown rice- a little s&amp;p, some garlic or fresh herbs would have gone a long way. The tuna melt was utterly bland with zero flavor. The seasoned fries couldn&#39;t stand up to McDonald&#39;s fries. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if our entire dinner was purchased from the freezer section at Costco and microwaved.I&#39;m revising this review a day later. My meal was this: fried chicken, veggies, fries. I can get that at KFC for $10 and it&#39;s GOOD. I paid $85 and the meal couldn&#39;t hold a candle to KFC.

I had to go to the grocery story immediately afterwards to make more food for dinner.

Inside is great, and if you can stand the redic wait for an outside table in the summer it&#39;s phenomenal. The Triangle at its best.Lunch/dinner options include some favorites -- all of the sliders are excellent, particularly the filet. The slider combo is by far one of my favorite dishes in this neighborhood to indulge in -- 2 sliders and a side salad for $12?! Literally cannot beat it.My rub with LuxBar is brunch. I&#39;ve had brunch at LuxBar a double digit number of times. EVERY SINGLE TIME someone at the table is served raw eggs. Either criminally underdone poached on a benedict or still super slimy over-easy.... I&#39;m talking not cooked to the point that the servers obviously just don&#39;t observe the plates of food they are serving. ANY reasonable human could have pointed out these were not palatable eggs. The last time I ordered a veggie benedict, the eggs were literally barely holding their shape. That&#39;s how raw they still were.So, as much as I love LuxBar I might have to permanently give up on brunch. But that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not coming back for sliders."

However, those tables are where EVERYONE wants to sit. But inside is nice too. It has a kind of old school pub look/feel to it. It&#39;s pretty cool. There is also plenty of space if you have a big group (like we did). Although, I will say that the tables seem VERY close together (and this is coming from a New Yorker!), we almost couldn&#39;t even pull chairs away from the table to sit down.Bathroom: It&#39;s nice and inviting. Not too well lit but neither is the restaurant itself.Staff: Our waitress was fine, nothing special. She wasn&#39;t speedy but wasn&#39;t slow either, and all our food came out at the same time. She could have been better about keeping our waters filled though.Food/Drink: General consensus (of the whole group) was that the food was good. We had the sliders (pretty standard) and the club sandwich w/ chips (DELICIOIUS!!). We also had a few beers, of which they don&#39;t have a very extensive selection.Value: Given the location the prices were reasonable. Depending on what you order you definitely get your money&#39;s worth (e.g. the club sandwich is a great value!)This was a good spot to grab a bite and I would return, if I were in the area, for another meal (hopefully being able to sit outside!)"

When my date for Cider Summit had a conflict, he knew he had the pleasure of being my stand-in. To try and sweeten the deal, I suggested we hit Luxbar afterward.Manhattan&#39;s have become hot. Personally, I have an aversion to scotch, whiskey and many other brown liquors, but when it comes to Manhattan&#39;s, I have his back. I follow 312DD&#39;s blog and saw a feature on Luxbar&#39;s Make Your Own (Rye) Manhattan special for the month of February; strangely, the menu isn&#39;t really promoted. If you&#39;re interested, ask for it - had I not read about it, I don&#39;t think we would&#39;ve been the wiser.I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect from Luxbar; I intentionally avoid the Viagra Triangle whenever possible. Frankly, I was pleasantly surprised; while the decor seems very classy and upscale, on a Saturday afternoon the vibe was quite casual. He started out with the bartender&#39;s signature Manhattan and then followed up with his own creation choosing his rye, vermouth, bitters and type of ice. I went with the Red Azalea, at the recommendation of our server. We loved our drinks; mine, a mix of vodka, shiraz and mulling spices was surprisingly excellent. We also had a snack, the seared yellowfin appetizer; good, but nothing so unique it would warrant a trip back for it.While Luxbar hasn&#39;t changed my feelings about the Viagra Triangle, they make a great cocktail and would get my business if I were nearby again and parched."

However, after explaining our wait to the waiter, the rest of our experience was expedited and very pleasant.First, I am not a fan of their Moscow Mule. The ice they use is almost the consistency of a snow cone, so the drink gets watered down quickly and there is not so much of the actual drink inside the mug.  The seasonal Ginger cocktail was quite good though.For food, my favorite dish was the spicy calamari appetizer. The calamari isn&#39;t crisp, but it is breaded and sautéed in a delicious sauce with red and green peppers. I also ordered the fried chicken sandwich, with cheese, bacon and apple slaw.  The flavors of everything went well and it was an especially savory sandwich. I&#39;d recommend ordering the half sandwich and trying one of their soups.The rest of my group seemed pleased with their food, when it finally arrived. Two of the guests ordered a couple bottles of wine which were nice to have as we waited for our food. The icing on the cake was that the manager visited our table and apologized for how delayed our service was at the beginning of the meal.  He bought us a round of drinks, but since we were just about through, we ordered a dessert in lieu of more alcohol.  The Snicker&#39;s pie is ENORMOUS (enough for 4) but delicious.  I&#39;d save room for this next time I visit!"

A group of six of us came in this weekend around noon for brunch and right off the bat, I was apprehensive about the atmosphere.For the overwhelming part, it was packed at noon this weekend for brunch - not surprising, but the way they pack those tables together is just horrible! We had a table in the back corner on the first floor next to the fireplace, which was nice until they seated the tables around us. I had to scoot my chair in closer to the table (TOO close to the table) in order to not hit the girl sitting behind me. At one point in time, I was trying to talk to the two girls next to me but it was literally so loud in the restaurant that they couldn&#39;t hear me, even when I was yelling.On the underwhelming side, the service was barely there - took our orders, dropped the food off, and never checked back. The bus boy who cleared our table used my dining space to collect and re-organize the plates he was carrying and at one point even left a few of my friends&#39; half-eaten dishes in front of me because he couldn&#39;t carry them. It was super uncomfortable and just all around not even the minimum service I would expect.The food was uninspired...I mean, I got oatmeal, so I wasn&#39;t looking for anything too special, but the pomegranate jam had little flavor and the oatmeal itself seemed to be overcooked. The ladies I was with ordered a variety of soups and salads and I didn&#39;t hear anyone even comment on their food, much less rave about it.The more I eat in the Gold Coast, the more I&#39;m feeling like the food there is overrated...hoping to find a restaurant soon that debunks that thought, but Luxbar was not the place."

Initially I wanted gelato but we opted for gelato from Mariano&#39;s freezer section just so we could get out of there. It&#39;s a bummer because we live about a block away but we won&#39;t be back."

We had a latte, a cappuccino (with almond milk) and two paninis.Everything was outstanding. The sandwiches were delicious and not overly heavy. The menu had a lot of great food options.The coffee products are great. We are a little high maintenance (I wanted mine iced and my boyfriend wanted almond milk) and they accommodated us with a smile.The atmosphere was very clean and contemporary. The family who owns the store was super friendly and  neighborly. We chatted with them for a while about their family, their inspiration and their food. I was super impressed and we will definitely be back."

Similar vibe with a distinctive Italian flair. (Not to toot my own banana, but this monkey has been to Italy more than a few times.)Having tried multiple soup and panini for lunches, the quality has always been high and reminiscent of authentic Italian Cafe fare.Now, if they just introduced aperitivo--between here and the nearby Spacca Napoli, I could get my Italian fix anytime."

Yes, this review is entirely based on a gelato experience, and that&#39;s okay. There were about 8-10 gelato flavor options. I decided on cherry, remembering the delicious fresh fruit gelato of Italy. However, this fell short. Far too icey to be considered gelato. I&#39;m not sure if they stored it too cold or for too long. I nearly threw it out. My grocery store gelato tasted more Italian than this, which is very sad! I wouldn&#39;t go back for gelato, maybe for food or their other desserts."

Is this a coffee shop or an Italian restaurant?  I bit the bullet and entered and I&#39;m glad I did.  Now I get it. It&#39;s a laid back Italian concept cafe where couples eat plates of (delicious) pasta alongside people on laptops sipping cappuccino.  Order at the counter and plates are delivered to your table. My gnocchi was piping hot and very flavorful.  The finishing olive oil was to die for. Affordable enough to come in and have a panini and do work but can also see myself meeting friends here for a full Italian meal.

Also, we heard they make their own gelato including authentic pistachio which was our favorite snack in Rome last year. Went last night for dinner. The atmosphere is a little sterile and coffee-shop-ish, which is fine if you&#39;re going for coffee or gelato, but it wasn&#39;t very comfortable for dinner. Food was an A+. (Even though they were out of pistachio gelato.) We had spaghetti with zucchini and leeks, a gorgonzola risotto and a burratta antipasto. Delicious, all of it. Unfortunately, the service was awful! We waited almost 40 minutes between our appetizer and entrees. No one came to check on us. Then after the food was served, we did not see a waiter again until we asked for the check. They don&#39;t serve bread or breadsticks or anything, which could have kept us distracted... So, we&#39;re torn. We live in walking distance, so will be back for gelato or espresso. Dinner?

Homemade pasta was fantastic, coffee was superb, homemade meatballs were excellent, service was very friendly. We weren&#39;t in any hurry, so the pace of the meal was perfect for us.

The view is spectacular. You can see Lake Michigan off in the distance and it&#39;s truly a serene location to have a peaceful lunch. Unlike the rest of the tourist traps on Michigan Avenue, you most likely won&#39;t find long waits and a loud noisy atmosphere.The menu is seasonal and is always changing. I was trying to decide between what soup to order and the waiter was kind enough to bring a sample.  We ended up ordering the egg white scramble and the chicken avocado club.

When I dined here with a friend, there were only 2 other tables that were occupied, so I was a bit confused. Maybe it is the kitchen that is incredibly slow? I have no idea, but Daniel was our server and he was very good, engaging, and had a hand in helping us make our lunch selections. For drinks, we had the peachy palmer and basil gimlet which were both very refreshing, especially for such a hot day. For our meal, I chose the salmon caesar which was fantastic and my friend had the chicken avocado, which she enjoyed. For dessert, we chose the coconut bread pudding and rhubarb pie. I have had much better bread pudding, so I was not impressed. The rhubarb pie was runny and again, I was not impressed. It&#39;s not actually a slice of pie, but more of a crisp that is served in a mini cast iron skillet with a serving of ice cream. It was a bit tart, lacked enough crisp to absorb the liquid, and was very soupy within a couple of minutes."

I had made reservations here over a month in advance as my mom were having a much needed quality mother daughter day in the city on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. We usually go to Zodiac room and or the new Mariposa for lunch and sometimes make a visit to the lovely Fred&#39;s at Barneys but never ventured out here and I&#39;ve heard good things so I planned a surprised lunch for my mom here. Upon arrival and we came at 12:15pm the place was pretty empty which made me a little curious since most places are packed on a Saturday afternoon and the lady says &#34;Sorry but unless you have cash only you can&#39;t eat here.&#34; At first I was taken back because I&#39;m like &#34;what do you mean by that&#34; she said that their system that takes credit cards is broken so I either need to find an atm or we had to leave.This really screwed us over for many reasons. One we didn&#39;t have our debit cards to withdraw cash, we couldn&#39;t make a reservation anywhere decent last minute as we had planned to come here all along and my mom was really upset about the situation since no one Called us or could have seen that we had a reservation and given us a heads up. I then said, is there anyway I can pay with a Saks gift card and she thought about it for a minute and said no. Honestly, I get the credit card system was broken but I don&#39;t see why they couldn&#39;t have charged our gift card or went to a different counter at Saks and taken our money off of it that way. I get things happen but the way it was handled left me with a very sour taste in my mouth and we had to scramble to find another lunch spot as my other favorites were all busy for another 2 hours and we were starving.I wish they could have accommodated us but considering there was one other table in the whole restaurant I didn&#39;t think they cared about their business or at least that&#39;s how it felt. A little warning even a half hour call before would have been nice. Sophie&#39;s, you really disappointed us!"

There were probably two other people eating at the cafe and a fashion clinic going on in the private room. We ordered the mushroom flatbread, burger with fried egg, and the coconut bread pudding for dessert. Although the burger bun seemed dry, the burger was good overall. I think the best part of the meal was the bread pudding which tasted amazing. A lot of texture and the pecans were perfectly candied."

Every other restaurant take notes from this, adorably quaint intimate little restaurant.Hidden on the top floor of Saks off of the Magnificent Mile is Sophie&#39;s: a swanky, upscale, All-American eatery that pulls off an excellent balance between casual dining and sophistication like no other. The view alone is reason enough to check it out. Where else are you going to look down on Lake Michigan,  Michigan avenue, the Sears Tower and the bustle of cabs and tourists running about while sipping coffee and eating a delicious meal in a calm, quiet atmosphere?And the food? Works of art! I mean everything we ordered was plated almost too pretty to eat. (Note that I said &#34;almost&#34;). Our party started with the crab cake and calamari appetizers that were recommended to us from other Yelp reviewers. Spot on. Flavorful, generously portioned, fresh and done exceptionally well. I selected the tuna melt, sweet potato fries and tomato bisque soup for an entree. Sounds simple enough, but OH EM GEE. This was the best meal I had all week... and trust me it had some stiff competition in the mix while on vacation. I don&#39;t know what kind of crack they put in that soup or sandwich or fries, but I was sold.The service? We were greeted promptly, they took and hung our coats, and escorted us to the best table in the house alongside windows facing a breathtaking view of the city. Our waiter was polite and helpful with suggestions and was attentive without being pushy. Perhaps the most memorable about his service was when he accidentally dripped the tiniest drop of coffee on my boyfriend while picking up a few dishes from our table. He not only was super apologetic, he went out of his way to actually dampened a fresh towel to assist him in wiping it off. Above and beyond. Service like that really stands out in my book.Best of all... one would expect (and be willing) to pay the price for such an experience, over the top service, and top notch food but no... it&#39;s surprisingly reasonable. For appetizers, 4 entrees, coffee, and various beverages we ran up a tab of about $150. Not too shabby considering it was one of our highlights of the trip. Whether for a date, weekend brunch (Sundays only), or business meeting, Sophie&#39;s is a must."

We were greeted and seated immediately. Small restaurants with less than 10 tables. Very modern and elegant place!I ordered the sunny side burger: angus beef, applewood smoked bacon, wisconsin cheddar, and sunny side up egg served with a brioche bun. We didn&#39;t wait long before our food was served. The burger tasty and full of flavor but the fries were a bit oily and salty. My friends also ordered mimosas which put some damage to our bill.Overall, its an upscale casual brunch spot but definitely not worth it. The bill for the six of us was $250. (The $11 mimosas probably didn&#39;t help) Decent food but I would much rather spend this money at The Publican or Purple Pig for brunch. Most likely won&#39;t be returning to Sophie&#39;s."

While everyone flocks to Pierrot Gourmet or the Nordstrom Cafe, it looks like the small, elegant, and exquisite restaurant on top of Saks remains relatively quiet. I came here for a lazy Sunday brunch and left with a food coma and a desire to come back.[Ambiance - 5/5] Sophie&#39;s is nestled in the corner of the 7th floor men&#39;s department of Saks. A sleek, modern restaurant invites patrons with a great view of Michigan Ave. While the decor plays towards Saks&#39; upscale image, the restaurant is by no means pretentious, and welcoming to everyone from families to the average joe wandering the mile.[Food - 5/5] Seeing as I came for brunch, I had to try the Chicken and waffles. The chicken and waffles were by far the best chicken and waffles I&#39;ve had! Moist, flavorful waffles with crispy tender chicken...what more can you want?!?! My girlfriend had the Croque Madame, and despite the resulting clogged arteries, it too was a delicious way to start the day. Buttery rich toast, savory ham, cheesy gooey goodness, a runny egg &amp; crispy truffle fries. Be prepared to take a mid-afternoon nap after your meal! Overall the food was fantastic, and far exceeded my expectations! nevermind that the restaurant is within a department store[Service 4/5] The service when we went was pretty good. There was only one server, who was fairly attentive, but also only a handful of people dining. If it wasn&#39;t a Sunday brunch, and Sophie&#39;s was busier, the service may be seen as somewhat slow.[Value 4/5] While the food was outstanding, the prices clearly reflect the ambiance &amp; location.

We started off with cocktails. I had the Sophie&#39;s Sonnet which was like a mimosa but with a much more refreshing taste. I had the Designer Club with the truffle fires. The club was fresh, crisp &amp; tasty. The fries were incredible! My partner had the lobster roll and also loved it. His mom had the apple &amp; brie grilled cheese which she also enjoyed. They surprised with a &#34;sweet bites&#34; platter to celebrate my partner and his mother&#39;s birthdays. Nice touch, guys!The only &#34;dings&#34; I would give Sophie&#39;s was that staff (and a few customers) seemed a bit pretentious.

There was also a table of four girls next to us who ordered glasses of wine but the staff brought out half finished bottles of wine and presented them to the girls. That seemed strange to me because usually restaurants simply bring out the filled glasses. To present half empty bottles that were used for other tables and then fill the glasses at the table just seemed weird.Aside from the snooty manger and the weird wine presentation, Sophia&#39;s was a great lunch choice for us and we will definitely be back."

I&#39;m almost surprised Saks hadn&#39;t opened a restaurant prior to Sophie&#39;s. Tucked away upstairs and in the back corner of the store, the clean decor and big windows make the atmosphere of Sophie&#39;s very pleasant and calming. The beautiful view of Michigan Avenue doesn&#39;t hurt either!Probably the reason women go nuts over Sophie&#39;s is their bread service. Small trays are brought to every table that have dishes of herb butter, an olive tapanade, and a sweet preserve. Then, you&#39;re able to choose what types of bread you&#39;d like, whether it&#39;s a rosemary cracker, white, or wheat baguettes. This was a really lovely way to start the meal and everyone enjoyed knoshing on the bread while we waited for our food. We ordered a variety of items, but I ended up going with the Cobb salad which was really tasty and delicious. All of the ingredients were very fresh and the roasted turkey was particularly flavorful. My dining companions went with items such as the chicken caesar, unique because of the kale and yogurt dressing, and the grilled cheese and tomato soup. Everyone was pleased and the service was nice, if not a little overbearing.Overall, very pleasant, but pricey lunch for sure. However, if you&#39;re dining at Sak&#39;s, I suppose that&#39;s to be expected. Lovely ladies lunch, definitely recommend if you&#39;re in the area!"

My friend and I each ordered a soup to start and we split a salad and sandwich.  My tomato soup was average. Then when he brought the sandwiches and salad we had to ask for rolls or crackers. He brought some very thin and hard, tasteless flatbread. The lobster and shrimp roll Sandwich was extremely salty. Our server never came back to refill our water and as the restaurant was maybe 20% full, he certainly wasn&#39;t busy.  Finally, we had asked for a specific table when we arrived. The hostess told us it was reserved. When we left an hour and a half later it was still empty. Saks, get your act together or your restaurant may not be long for this world."

My grilled cheese didn&#39;t taste any different than my own homemade version and my fries lacked truffle flavor.  I ordered the mushroom soup instead of the tomato (which normally comes with the grilled cheese) because I was told it was amazing.  Unfortunately, I felt like I was drinking mostly mushroom infused Half and Half.  Also, my friends JUMBO  crab cake looked more MINI than anything and she wasn&#39;t blown away by the taste either.Despite the fact that the food was not worth the price, I thought the service and atmosphere at Sophie&#39;s were quite nice."

The menu is very appealing, certain to have something good for every taste. The cooking was top-notch: very fresh ingredients, cooked epertly, commendable flavor combinations and balance.

Plates are beautiful, decorated with saucy swirls.  Because of that, I&#39;d recommend opting out of an extra side of spicy mayo (which is a typical side order for me). I think their swirls are made of unagi sauce, spicy mayo, and regular mayo (if it&#39;s not cream cheese, or wasabi mayo...)Average larger/fusion rolls range from $12-18, and your classics are typically $6-8. The ambience is definitely good for date night/girls night, although i wouldn&#39;t recommend a group of more than 4.  It&#39;s a little darker with hip music and a classy vibe.You won&#39;t get your freebies here (like miso soup, veggies, or a ginger salad.)It&#39;s BYOB.

I said forget it and ordered the large sashimi plate, seaweed salad, and miso soup.The soup and salad were pretty good, but you can&#39;t mess up those items. The sashimi plate looked amazing, super colorful. The quality of fish was horrible. The white fish which was supposed to be buttery and delicious was soggy and tasted like it was previously frozen. It was so disappointing. Also the fish were cut super thick, which isn&#39;t like traditional sashimi.As a result, this morning I was so sick from the food.

I have ordered a few things at Butterfly that were underwhelming, such as the Mussamum curry (I thought that the curry had too much of a peanut flavor.) I also thought that the garlic chicken dish was a bit bland. Those were the only two dishes I was not pleased with. The sushi is great, fish always tastes fresh. I like their shoyu ramen, it is topped with sea weed tempura. This tempura is excellent when dipped in the ramen broth. In addition, the rice and noodle dishes that I have purchased, pad thai for example, were solid and the portions/prices are extremely reasonable.

The Penang noodles were super big and squishy. They really got coated well by the sauce. The Khao Soi had a good flavor as well, but I didn&#39;t like the crispy noodles as much. The only thing I really didn&#39;t like was the sweet miso eggplant appetizer we shared. I was expecting something more like dengaku, so the miso glaze was disappointing.

Everything I&#39;ve tried here is good. Despite this place being a sushi joint, even their other dishes are tasty. I really enjoyed the spicy tuna hand roll and the panang curry.

They kept giving our table of 4 to other people. Service is slow. Called them earlier to make a reservation and they didn&#39;t take any. To only get here and they have a list of reservations. Services are slow and the worst I have seen in Chicago. I wouldn&#39;t even leave one star but I had to, and the measly one slice of cheesecake, cut in two pieces doesn&#39;t change my perspective or experience. The service at the table was just as slow and they tried rushing us out as soon as possible which only made me take my time even more.Just wanted to add how rude and unprofessional the hostess was dealing with this situation. She even came by our table to set up the adjacent table to us and was basically yelling and slamming the menus down at another Coworker. I don&#39;t think I will ever visit this location ever again. Management needs to look at their staff and reevaluate who they have working for them. They are the face people see at the door and it is and will ruin their business."

Yelp pictures looked decent and prices were fair so we thought we&#39;d give this place a shot. Good thing we did, b/c the Thai food here exceeded my expectations. My expectations weren&#39;t high to begin with, but the meal hit the spot. PLUS, it was super close to our place like less than a mile, and they deliver! Not many Thai places deliver to our place, so that&#39;s an extra star! Website was also very intuitive, good work. We only ordered Thai so i can&#39;t speak about the Japanese food.We ordered:Red curry with chicken and pineapples - very saucy, just the way i like itTom kar - excellentPad thai w/ chicken - goodTwo more stars for awesome food.Ok, now this is where i give out an extra star for delivery b/c this place breezed the test. I usually ask for limes and hot sauce and 3/5 times, restaurants will charge me extra or forget something...or give me lemons instead. Not only did they get the order right, but they hooked me up w/ tons of lime wedges and hot sauce for free. Lastly, they delivered under the quoted time frame of an hour which gets them to 5 stars! Cheaper than most Thai places in the River North/River West area.Warning: i honestly can&#39;t think of anything. I&#39;ve only tried this place once, and loved it. I&#39;m claiming it as my &#39;go to&#39; for Thai delivery."

It took them forever to get us seated even though there were tons of empty tables and we had a reservation. The server seemed visibly annoyed every time we asked him for something. The only reason I would rate this 3 stars is that it&#39;s BYOB and the sushi rolls are very affordable.

Butterfly sushi was the first place that I have ever tried sushi so it holds a special place in my heart. It may not be the best but is sure a bang for your buck!Here are some personal favorites, tips &amp; tricks-(1) Stay away from the Thai Food because their specialty is SUSHI, so stick to that-DUH(2) Makis to Ordera. Godzilla Maki  (personal favorite if you&#39;re not allergic to shrimp)b. Spicy Tuna (Don&#39;t be fooled. It&#39;s not actually spicy)c. Sunrise (WARNING: contains jalapeños)(3) Vegetarians can enjoy maki too!a.  Avocado maki  for a non-fishy sushi experience.b. Sweet Potato Maki (comes with a delicious sauce)(4) Take out/delivery has a deal if you order more than $10 you can get free crab Rangoon or egg rolls. Make sure to eat your sushi within 24-hours otherwise the rice become horribly dry.(5) BYOB!!!!SERVICE (4 Stars)The staff struggles with their English and tends to get a little impatient at times. Regardless, they get you your food in timely manner whether being dine-in, carry out, or delivery.ATMOSPHERE (4 stars)On the weekends, Butterfly Sushi is rather lively. During the week there tends to be a small but constant flow of customers. Definitely a place for all types of demographicsACCESSIBILITY (4 Stars)There are multiple locations but the Grand Avenue one is the most customer friendly (...and the food tastes much better)"

We started with the Vietnamese rolls which tasted great and the sauce that was provided with them was fantastic. All the ingredients tasted extremely fresh.After that we ordered the the Tom Yum soup. The soup looked a bit darker than most Tom Yup soups I&#39;ve had. It was also a bit sweeter than I expected and I would have liked it if it was a bit more spicy.The sushi we had was fantastic. Very large portions and very flavourful. The Nigiri was especially large and tasted extremely fresh.I liked the ambience, the music and the service a lot too and if the soup was better, I&#39;d probably have given it 5 stars.I&#39;d definitely come back here."

The place was pretty empty, but the girls taking care of my friend and I never let out water level fall below halfway, and always checked up on us.I ordered the sake (salmon) nigiri and a spicy salmon roll.First off....the sashimi pieces were HUGE. Almost like....a salmon...steak....Now, maybe I shouldn&#39;t complain because &#34;hey, you got more than usual,&#34; but the ratio was totally off, and I guess it&#39;s strange to have a huge chunk on top of a delicate little mound of rice.Second...Holy crumbs. That rice was CRAZY overseasoned. I can handle rice that isn&#39;t seasoned much, but this one had so much vinegar in it that it was almost inedible. I get nigiri because I love the delicate taste of the salmon. Despite the huge slab they gave me, the vinegar in the rice completely killed the flavor...:( The roll I got was messily put together and not visually appealing. Rather than spicy mayo, they had mayo and sriracha...which was very strange to me.Overall, I probably won&#39;t come here for sushi, but their thai dishes seem awesome, so I&#39;d recommend getting those instead."

We also had the Fire Dragon roll which was Deep-fried battered seaweed roll, salmon tempura, spicy tuna, cream cheese, avocado, sweet potato, scallion, spicy honey-mayo, top with wasabi and golden tobiko. That was really good. All the rolls i saw look very good too. My entree was Yakisoba. It was very tasty, but i was disappointed with the amount of cauliflower to chicken.

My boyfriend spilled some wine accidentally when we were last there and someone came to the table immediately and helped us move to another table, meanwhile cleaning the spill.The old location was a little crammed, however at this new location, there is plenty of room between tables so you can keep your conversations between the people at your own table.  When the weather is nice, they offer outside seating, which is always a plus!"

I typically don&#39;t go for places that mix several cuisines (Thai, Japanese), but great reviews and perceived proximity to my hotel caught my eye. The restaurant has a location at 1156 West Grand Avenue (cross street -North Racine Avenue), about 1.5 miles away from where I was staying. Oddly, the Yelp map listed the restaurant as just two blocks away with the red (destination) dot in the middle of the street. My attempt to pick up food not so easy. I called and learned that this had happened before due to an outdated address on yelp. Fortunately, their delivery person arrived 7 minutes later and the food was still fresh and hot.I ordered the Pad Woon Sen - stir fried glass noodles with chicken, egg and mixed vegetables e.g. straw mushroom, baby corn, onions, carrots, peas, and lima beans. A well seasoned, generous serving and a good ratio of noodles to protein and vegetables. Even better with just a few drops of soy and chili sauce.Black Dragon Roll: Shrimp tempura, cucumber and mayo wrapped with unagi, avocado topped eel sauce &amp; black tobiko. Fresh and visually appealing. A bit on the bland side but that&#39;s due to my roll choice and not the quality of the ingredients.My takeout order did not disappoint! Definitely worth dining in at some point."

I love all types of seafood &amp; it was a mix of shrimp, mussels &amp; some mini scallops. Spicy! So be prepared to chug water ;) Also had Chicken Satay &amp; Vietnamese spring rolls. We shared a mixture of their meat dishes &amp; the Fire Dragon roll, which was delish! I frequent many sushi places in the city &amp; I was not disappointed with the menu items we chose!!Service: This place gets crazy busy on Friday night at 7pm. We had a reservation for 3 people, but one of our members was running very late. The host clearly was seating other tables without their full party but since it was taking quite a bit of time for a table for 3, we opted to be seated at a table for 2. An hour later, when a table was clearing out next to us, I asked the host if we could put the two tables together since our last member was on her way. She said to tell her when she arrived. It was boggling since every other table in the restaurant clearly was being seated while waiting for other people to join them!Would definitely visit again, but probably not on a crazy Friday! People love this joint!"

My goodness and the people are rude. We called to make a reservation and the girl on the phone said we didn&#39;t need one that there was no wait. So we get there 10 mins later and now there&#39;s  a 30 min wait. We tell the girls we just called and you told us there was no wait and she just blows it off and says yea there&#39;s a 30 min wait we have reservations and holds the paper up to my face. Wtf. So after 50 mins of waiting we finally get sat. And the service there continues to be unacceptably slow and scarce. To top off the night they try and rush us out so they could seat another table not long after we got our food! Even if the food was good you can&#39;t enjoy it long enough to know because they clearly just want to turn tables here. This places lacks class in customer service which in a big city where there are so many choices to eat why would you want to subject yourself to being treated like cattle.

Very attentive, but not annoying. They also serve Thai food, which is what brought me there initially. I had a Thai Escargot appetizer, which was snails in an escargot plate, topped with red curry sauce. There&#39;s a good bit of heat to it, but not too much for me and it was delicious. I had some sushi, too. A tuna roll that was quite good, and some scallop nagiri (sp?). The tuna was very good but the scallops were only ok. I would bring a group here, or go again. Alcohol is BYOB."

As a former waitress myself of over 5 years, I&#39;m all for giving servers the benefit of the doubt when it comes to a busy Saturday night; but our experience went beyond just a busy weekend with a small staff.Upon being seated, it took about ten minutes for us to be greeted by the waitress. When she finally did appear; there was no hello, no good evening... just &#34;What&#39;s your order?&#34; We gave our order, and simultaneously asked for the volume on the speaker directly over our head to be turned down (for the second time). She told us, &#34;no&#34;, we asked to switch tables, and she left the table immediately. At this point the volume was so loud the vibrations from the speaker were now hitting the table and our booth. After a third try (this time with the hostess that we had to get up to speak with), we successfully got them to turn the volume down.We ordered our food and the sushi rolls came out 15 minutes before our third guests entree came out. During this time, they hid the rolls under a water station to try to time the meal right. Big fail on that, particularly since I saw my food being stored on a shelf not far from us.We finally ate (the rolls were pretty great!) and were rushed out of the restaurant so they could seat the next set of unfortunate souls coming in after us. When they dropped off the check, there was no thank you, no have a good night, just a check and a big fat frown.The restaurant is about a five minute walk from house, serves pretty good sushi and is very reasonably priced. Unfortunately the wait staff has turned me off to this place and I&#39;ll be taking my business elsewhere."

The cafe had a pleasant stream of customers (many just grabbing a coffee and leaving; some staying) and wasn&#39;t too loud. Unlike many other coffee shops (Starbucks, anyone?) it also wasn&#39;t blaring annoying music. There were a few seats; I took one and stayed for a few hours, working on their speedy wifi and enjoying a very well-brewed cup of coffee. I also ordered an artichoke sandwich; it was delicious--way better than I expected it to be and definitely great enough to lure me back for lunch.I went back recently and ordered a pick-me-up cappuccino in the afternoon. It was perfectly made with the right balance of foam to milk to espresso.A nice find in the neighborhood; it has a good neighborhood vibe, too."

The huge variety of food and drinks available makes this place great for anyone with any dietary needs, from a full lunch to a snack on the go. I&#39;m especially thankful for the vegan dessert options. The Mediterranean Veggie sandwich is to die for. Fresh tomatoes, red peppers, hummus, spinach, and avocado on top-notch focaccia bread. My only complaint is that the music is awful. They play pop FM radio with the volume up. It kills the mood and makes it difficult to concentrate on reading or engage in a conversation with company. It&#39;s a serious deterrent, unfortunately. I always leave with a bad song stuck in my head. Serious suggestion: invest in a Spotify account and let your employees curate some playlists!

It is definitely a lot smaller than you&#39;d imagine, and there is some limited seating. Their sandwiches are (for me at least) a bit pricey, but still good to eat. They supposedly serve good coffee, and offer free water to customers. However, when I got a macchiato there, the espresso was too acidic and way too bitter. Someone pulled the shot badly, so I am probably never gonna order an espresso-based drink and just stick to a regular cup of joe if I ever visit there again.All in all, the cafe is not too shabby.

It has a high ceiling, pretty murals, and an open space by the entrance.Most places will give you a frequent buyer punch card if you request for one. The first time I was here a few months ago, the cashier automatically gave me one. I thought that was nice, especially since I didn&#39;t know they had a loyalty punch card thing.

Jackson.  I walked around a fair bit attempting to find it before I buckled and called the shop.  One of their staff offered to pop out of the front door to wave me in, more than making up for the lack of proper signage, rounding out this experience to a smooth four stars.  A great little place!"

Service here was great! Everyone is really nice.Was in the mood for soup but didn&#39;t see any on the menu board, turns out though they did have soup, but the options were posted on a little sign near the register instead. Had the yellow lentil soup, it was tasty and light, perfect for a cold winter day. (would be more awesome if it came with a little bread roll and butter :D I like to dip bread and butter in soup sometimes haha)They have a bathroom but it&#39;s misleading because there is a sign that says &#34;Employees Only&#34; lol but they let you use it.Didn&#39;t try any coffee on this visit, but will be back soon :)P.S. not sure why, but the sign outside of the cafe only says &#34;M2&#34; instead of Morgan Street Cafe... a little confusing lol maybe change the name of the business on yelp?"

I had a bit of a Laney Boggs situation going on with this place (long live the 90s). I go to school down the street from M2 but have walked by it many times without noticing it-it was too plain, too unassuming. I stopped in today and suddenly realized M2 has been here the whole time, but wearing glasses and a ponytail (gross). I had to make an effort to look beyond appearance. M2 isn&#39;t particularly stylish. It&#39;s fairly small, with high ceilings and an assortment of mismatched seating options. It didn&#39;t quite have the cozy coffeehouse feel I look for. There was plenty of seating since most people seemed to be getting their purchases to go. And instead of Sixpence None the Richer on the stereo, a Christmas radio station was playing. I realize this wouldn&#39;t bother most people, but hearing Wham perform Last Christmas over and over really diminishes my coffee pleasure. Happily, M2 turned out to be a beauty on the inside. The employees were friendly and efficient, my latte was good, and they had a nice sandwich selection with plenty of veggie options (I liked the artichoke sandwich). You could work all day here without anyone disturbing you. So I probably wouldn&#39;t take M2 to the prom, but I WOULD introduce it to my friends, because in it&#39;s own distinct way, it&#39;s a cool place when you take the time to get to know it."

I had a sweet tooth the next time I stopped in, and was feeling a little adventurous, so I ordered the Bacon Mocha Latte. My taste buds are still partying. This drink is not for the traditional sweet mocha lover as it carries the bold flavor of, what else? Bacon. As in beautifully crispy, oven-baked,  just-a-little-burnt-on-the-edges, savory, bacon."

I did not feel like I was chewing on chemicals &amp; disappointment/regret like I normally do with most vegan meats.I&#39;ve been so curious of trying Korean bbq tacos, but for obvious reasons haven&#39;t been able to.

Upton&#39;s version tasted just as good as I recall a real one tastes, and was super generous in size. I had the BBQ plate, which was ample in size and delicious. The &#34;bacon&#34; mac and cheese might be the best vegan mac and cheese I&#39;ve ever had and their fake bacon is the most convincing in both taste and texture that I&#39;ve ever encountered. The price was right, and servers were friendly. The only bummer was that we didn&#39;t have room for desert, but we did try samples of the cinnamon soy-based soft serve and it was fantastic.

It&#39;s very small, just like a &#34;break room&#34; because that&#39;s what it is, only it&#39;s also open to the public. The meat dishes they prepare here are absolutely delicious. I eat here quite often and everything they make is indistinguishable from its meat counterpart. I really recommend it but it is very very small and can get quite crowded, so take-out might be a better way to experience their unique cuisine. Their vegan (non dairy) ice cream is out of this world!The meat substitute they make is called seitan (sometimes called &#34;wheat meat&#34;) and is created by washing the starch away from wheat flour with water. What remains is the wheat protein, making seitan a high-protein food with a similar texture to meat. In fact, it is so similar that it is somewhat indistinguishable and the way they prepare it is absolutely delicious. Upton Naturals is a huge and growing supplier of seitan and their products can be purchased at natural and conventional food stores all over the country and abroad.I am a raw vegan and my main concern about seitan is that it&#39;s just plain and pure gluten. There is evidence to support the claim that the human body can easily become over-saturated with gluten, leading to gluten intolerance (aka celiac disease). Our bodies can process gluten, but if it is overconsumed it can prompt inflammation, and ultimately intolerance, so I think moderation of consumption is recommended. I have searched quite extensively for side effects of seitan and I cannot find anything but this, so an occasional visit is definitely built into my dietary calendar.I really like this place and highly recommend it!"

For a small place, there was a pretty wide variety of menu items. I got the daily special - &#34;Sancocho&#34; which they explained is the national dish of the Dominican Republic. It was an amazing spicy bean and vegetable stew with plantains and yucca, topped with avacado and purple rice. My husband got the bacon mac and cheese and mashed potato with gravy - it&#39;s always nice to find vegetarian versions of foods that are never vegetarian.I&#39;d give the food 5 stars, but the restaurant itself was a little lacking. This place seems to be primarily carry out and delivery - which would be fine, if that&#39;s how it was billed on the website. There were exactly 4 tables, each seating 2 people. So basically a restaurant only 8 people can eat in at a time. I guess during the summer they have outdoor seating, but this time of year, it would be disappointing to plan to go out to lunch and not have anywhere to eat. While we were there the tables were filled, and someone came in and was surprised he couldn&#39;t sit down to eat, and seemed resigned to get his order to go. Hope there&#39;s some way they could reconfigure the seating, or expand the restaurant - the food was fantastic, but come prepared for the possibility that you&#39;ll have to take it to go."

May due to the reviews on Yelp, expectations were high. I brought my wife and two children here and we are always on the look out for the best vegan restaurants that fulfill our two greatest criteria...good price and generous portions. My family and I ordered the Korean tacos, the mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and the togarashi bowl. No doubt, the taste was good to okay, but the portions were extremely lacking. We felt, after we were done, &#34;That&#39;s it?? All that was like an appetizer!&#34; First of all, just to be clear, we are not a fat, overeating family...but as vegans, when good food is hard to come by, we expect to get what we paid for. The Korean tacos we were expecting them to be regular taco size, but they were 4 mini-taco sizes. The Togarashi bowl only had 1 small scoop of rice to go with the mixed veggies. ($5 for a cup of mac and cheese? $4 for a cup of mashed potatoes? C&#39;mon!) We want to break the stereotype of vegans being scrawny and weak and refer others to great restaurants to prove that it&#39;s possible to be vegan and enjoy it! Driving all the way from Michigan to Chicago to try this place only to be left unsatisfied and left with a bill that says we should&#39;ve been satisfied was a great disappointment.  People are raving about the flavor and the taste, but if Upton could be more generous with the portions, that would be reason to return as well as to refer to others how exceptional it could be. We ended up going to another restaurant right after this experience."

With only one day in Chicago and tons of vegan restaurants -- where to go?! After much contemplation, the choice seemed obvious -- Upton&#39;s Breakroom.In case you don&#39;t know, Upton&#39;s Naturals makes the best seitan in the country and is located right there in Chicago. So, it seemed only natural to them to incorporate their seitan into delicious meals and open a cafe right in their building -- so Upton&#39;s Breakroom was born.When I arrived to this unassuming tiny little cafe, it was pretty busy.  I had just hopped off the plane and was waiting for my friend to arrive so I took a seat at one of their three tables. Their menu had so much delicious-sounding stuff on it that I found it hard to choose. And all of it is vegan!I will disclose that I have gotten to know the owner and his partner over the years and they came to say hello while I was there. I almost felt guilty, but I was really in the mood for one of the few items on the menu that did not have seitan. They encouraged me to try the Chicago Style Italian sub along with the selection I was most interested in so I convinced my friend to order the sub. :)I went with the Togarashi Bowl made with baked tofu, grilled kale, pickled radish, scallion, shredded seaweed and sesame seeds over purple rice with a lemon tahini miso dressing and togarashi seasoning. It was quite good -- a macrobiotic bowl with spice!But, even better was the Fried Bacon Mac. Remember, calories don&#39;t count on vacation. I dare to say this was the best vegan mac and cheese I&#39;ve ever had. A housemade mac and cheese made with nutritional yeast and fried Upton&#39;s bacon seitan all fried on the grill made-to-order -- the flavors mesh in a way that makes you want to eat a trough of it!My friend got the &#34;Chicago Style&#34; Italian that featured their herbed seitan with giardiniera. This is a classic-style Chicago sandwich veganized. We liked the inside - you can&#39;t go wrong with seitan and giardiniera (pickled veggies), but felt it was a bit too much bread and not enough filling.On the side, she got the flash grilled seasonal greens. Yum.Other choices that sounded yummy were the Bahn Mi, Bacon Ranch Cheeseburger, Korean Tacos, and Nacho plate.The dishes and sandwiches average $6 - $9 each with sides being $4. That&#39;s awesome pricing for excellent food. The cafe is quite small with no service, but as long as you can snag a seat, it is well worth the trip. During the warm months, outdoor seating is also available. I&#39;d totally rate this as one of the top vegan cafes in the city -- totally worth the trip. And I&#39;ll be back next year!"

We also bought a giant cookie not sure if it was supposed to be chocolate chip or banana nut chocolate chip, it was just okay more on the bland side since we couldn&#39;t tell what flavor it was.

Upton&#39;s various seitan products are in local grocery stores all over and I really enjoy them as a meat free alternative. I felt like we&#39;d come to the mothership.We went a little overboard ordering because it was so exciting - so I got the bacon ranch cheeseburger (the bacon, ranch, and cheese were amazing. Burger was a bit too herbaceous to be convincing but still tasty), the fried bacon Mac and cheese (amazing, perfect, delicious, crave worthy, cheesy goodness). My friend got the Korean tacos (I didn&#39;t try but they looked incredible - smallish portion, but she advised they were delicious), and the loaded potatoes (these were to die for - the cheese was possibly even more convincing on these than in the Mac and cheese. The sour cream was dead on. The textures of the bacon, the creamy potatoes, the cheese, all together? Perfection). I got a cold brew coffee to drink and we sat in the teeny tiny little restaurant and enjoyed our freshly prepared, quickly ready feast. When that was done, we got the soft serve ice cream (flavor of the day: coffee!) as dessert, and left full and satisfied of vegan goodness.I can&#39;t wait to go back. I wish I was already back. Enjoying incredibly delicious, flavorful, exciting vegan food for an equally wonderful cause."

The flavor was authentic and the texture of the seitan was amazing. However, the avocado was not even close to ripe and I wish it was served with a lime wedge rather than lemon.

As I&#39;ve mentioned before in previous reviews, I&#39;m very much a carnivore, and I have an aversion to fake meats due to past horrific experiences. However, it should be mentioned that everything here I tasted was pretty good, including the seitan. The owners of Upton&#39;s apparently own a factory that produces their own seitan, and they ship it all over the country.When our party arrived, we managed to snag the small section of outdoor seating. The actual place is a fairly small space, with only 3-4 tables and the counter. We went with mostly sides including the breakfast potatoes, Brussels sprouts in mustard vinaigrette, and the fried &#34;bacon&#34; mac. Pretty standard stuff with the vegetables, but the macaroni was delicious and not too greasy. The bacon seitan had a smokey flavor, and while it definitely was not the same texture as real bacon, it was fine holding its own. We also ordered the waffles, which were a bit on the dry side, but once you put on the maple syrup it was fine. I tried my friends breakfast tacos, which had a tofu scramble instead of eggs, which weren&#39;t too bad, especially with the amount of avocado they give you.The prices are pretty standard, and the waitstaff was very accommodating and friendly about explaining the menu items.  Overall, no fake meat will ever beat the real thing in my book, but Upton&#39;s comes pretty close. In all, you can get a decent vegan meal here, without sacrificing quality."

The food is so delicious and varied that we end up taking many days of meals home. The staff is friendly and capable, wearing multiple hats as chef, cashier, and server. First order of business: get the Fried Bacon Mac! Best vegan mac and &#34;cheese&#34; in the city! We love the flash Greens, the Togarashi Bowl, the Loaded Potatoes, the Nachos, and everything else we&#39;ve tried. Oh, and the Brussels Sprouts side turned my wife into a lover, not a hater, of that much maligned vegetable. Honestly, in a city awash in vegetarian options, including that chain that shall not be mentioned, Upton&#39;s is our favorite. The space is small (three indoor tables and a few more outdoors), so we worry about Upton&#39;s being &#34;discovered.&#34; Yet, we hope it is. What a gem!"

Had the bacon mac and cheese, bacon cheeseburger, banh mi, nachos, and soft serve (chai was the day&#39;s flavor).Not far off 90, at least for anyone specifically seeking vegan eats, and easy to find. Seating was minimal but readily available for an early lunch. Nothing fancy, but certainly a friendly atmosphere and pretty quick service. So it was great for a little break, or for a bite while out and about in Chicago.And everything tasted great.Homemade cheese sauce was smooth and creamy, not too salty, over seasoned or bland.The tofu and pate on the banh mi were delicious with a little spicy kick (mild for my senses but noticeable, not too spicy for anyone not so tolerant of lotsa heat).Seitan was all wonderful taste and texture (it&#39;s their main gig of course), and did not seem too similar between the bacon, burger and chorizo sausage crumble.Nacho and burger toppings were fairly standard and did not disappoint, with the nice additions of the crema on the nachos and ranch on the burger.Mac and cheese was neither too oily/heavy or dry, but good comfort food being fried with seitan bacon chunks and all.The ice cream, from Temptation/Chicago Soy Dairy, was a generous portion, good texture and the Chai flavor was great (a spicy, cardamom and pepper heavy chai).Portions were decent (we were pretty road-hungry), but you&#39;ll probably want to get the mac and cheese as a side with any sandwich. $12-15 will get you a pretty solid lunch that feels worth it."

We got the bacon ranch cheeseburger, the Korean tacos, the breakfast combo (since it was a Saturday), the BBQ plate, and the loaded potatoes, topped off with a cookie.I grabbed the order (which was perfectly on-time) and we had to drive for a while before we could eat any of the food.I thought we might see the quality of the food degrade as we got further and further away from the restaurant. Boy, was I wrong! This stuff stayed delicious and warm, and even by the time it was cool it was still fabulous.My favorite was the bacon ranch cheeseburger, with the bacon mac (comes with the BBQ plate) as a close second. And the cookie was AMAZING. The Korean tacos were a lovely treat, and the loaded potatoes felt like a ball of cholesterol with none of the health implications of a real loaded potatoes ordeal. The breakfast combo was just okay--but &#34;okay&#34; at Upton&#39;s Breakroom is still really, really good. The waffle was perfectly soft, and the bacon was fabulously smoky. The tofu scramble was perfectly seasoned and just the right texture.TL;DR: I would eat here all the time. Straight up.

I was ecstatic when I heard they opened their new facility which features a cafe to boot!We shared a side of bacon mac and cheese ($4), a BLT ($6), and a tofu bacon breakfast sandwich ($5). The mac and cheese is just awesome---it&#39;s savory, hearty and crave-worthy.I loved the BLT, too, which had that perfect balance of crispy seitan bacon with great bread and vegetables.The breakfast sandwich was a real gem, and a rare find---vegan breakfast sandwiches are hard to find. I think the sauce on this one could have used a bit more seasoning, but it was still quite tasty as-is.The space is small with seating for about 8 people. Outdoor seating would be nice and a selection of loose-leaf teas would put this place over the top for me.As it is, Upton&#39;s is an amazing company with great products in-store and a wonderful cafe to add to the local scene."

Also, while I haven&#39;t had them yet, it&#39;s nice to see that they&#39;re now offering a few gluten free options.

The CEO, Nicole, is one of the nicest people you will ever have to pleasure of meeting.Finally, they are now selling packaged jackfruit over there! You have a choice of either BBQ or Chili Lime. Both are so tasty and great for making tacos or BBQ &#34;pork&#34; sandwiches.Upton&#39;s Breakroom is truly becoming another &#34;must go&#34; restaurant for vegans all over the country and I hope non vegans alike give it a shot.

My (vegetarian) boss mentioned Upton&#39;s, and we all agreed it sounded good. I&#39;ve never been before and had no idea what I was getting myself into... BUT.... on approach I recognized the logo and realized I have tried, many times, their grocery store brand vegan sausages... specifically the chorizo seitan which is great!So my boss and his assistant both got the club which looked good, and I got the Tempeh Sandwich. The &#34;grilled&#34; (it was actually griddled) lemon rosemary tempeh with spinach, pesto, wilted spinach, and a seared tomato on focaccia was a great combo! But I will say in general the sandwich was a bit slippery and hard to eat. I added avocado and it, along with pretty much every other ingredient kept slipping out.I added a side of grilled kale, and we also ordered the &#34;bacon&#34; mac &amp; cheese.

I have previously had macaroni &amp; cheese dishes at Native Foods Café, The Chicago Diner, and even Karyn&#39;s Cooked that have been AWFUL! You hear me?

I tasted both and liked them as well.

DID YOU HEAR THAT! Homemade vegan soft serve ice cream coming soon!P.S. Did I mention I LOVED their Fried Bacon Mac? Definitely took an order to go!"

But if you want a quick bite of vegan delicious this is the place to come. Their menu is small but offers all kinds of great options. Everything sounded fantastic to me but I was in the mood for tempeh so was torn between the employee meal (which was rice, kale, and your choice of tempeh, tofu, or seitan) for the day and the tempeh sandwich. I took a peak at the focaccia and on the recommendation of one of the worker&#39;s went with the tempeh sandwich. Oh man, I was glad I did, first off, focaccia, delicious. They also are currently topping it with a pesto sauce, I was asked if this was okay and I was all &#34;Of course!&#34; their pesto is amazingly good. Bring that together with some awesome tempeh, and a little tomato and spinach and you have quite a sandwich. Worth the stop."

As soon as I saw the menu, I knew I had to hurry over and try some of these awesome plant-based eats!I got the vegan bacon mac and cheese, some dark chocolate and lavender cookies, and the chocolate vegan soft serve. The vegan bacon mac and cheese was an uber pleasant surprise. It&#39;s not your typical, run-of-the-mill vegan mac. It&#39;s got this distinct flavor and seasoning to it thats absolutely delicious! The bacon to mac ratio was pretty much spot on as well.The dark chocolate lavender cookies I knew about before even getting to Upton&#39;s because I had seen them post pictures of them on their instagram. (thank god for social media!) I am a lover of all things chocolate and all things edible lavender so I pretty much knew this cookie was made for me! Lucky for me, when I got there, there was only one cookie left and a fresh batch was just about to come out. I grabbed the one remaining and decided to wait for the fresh batch to come out to get more cookies for myself and a friend who I was seeing later who had not yet been to Upton&#39;s. This cookie was to DIE for! Ooey gooey, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. If it was my last day on earth, I would want to eat THIS cookie. The best part was smelling the fresh batch of cookies as they came out. I must admit, I kept smelling the fresh baked cookie I took to go in my car! haha! INTOXICATING!And last, I had the chocolate vegan soft serve! I had had this before at Chicago Health foods but really enjoyed having it on a cone - it was a hot day when I went so it was the perfect refreshing end to a yummy meal at Upton&#39;s!If you haven&#39;t already been there, get there NOW! Super friendly service and yummy food!"

I had the rosemary tempeh sandwich and it was seriously bland. The fried bacon mac was ok but kind of greasy and my husband&#39;s Italian seitan sandwich was tasteless.I kind of felt like I could have made a better version at home of everything I ate here, and for a fraction of the price. Two drinks, two sides and two sandwiches totaled $36.Chicago is full of amazing vegan options, so I think you can safely skip this one."

Please understand that I say that as someone who does eat meat. So, why would I eat at Upton&#39;s if that&#39;s the case? Well, I like to change things up and I don&#39;t meat all the time. So, options like Upton&#39;s are pretty sweet when they come around.In the past I&#39;ve been lukewarm towards the seitan I&#39;ve had. It has generally come off as trying too hard to be meat when it clearly isn&#39;t. Upton&#39;s doesn&#39;t seem to be doing that. Yes, in some sense they are presenting it as a meat alternative, but it doesn&#39;t feel like it is something that it isn&#39;t.While the menu isn&#39;t huge here, it certainly has its focus. Since I am very much a person that loves the two-breaded with things in the middle arts, that was yet another reason to test out Upton&#39;s wares. Given that this is a 4* review, the instant conclusion is that these are mighty fine sandwiches. Just allow yourself to enjoy the sandwiches and you honestly don&#39;t notice that it&#39;s seitan as opposed to meat. It may seem like a shocker, but if you pack real good flavor into something you will make something tasty. It&#39;s a real novel idea and I&#39;m glad Upton&#39;s has followed through with it.Let your preconceptions go and give Upton&#39;s a try. They are bringing something delicious to town and the sandwiches work for all sorts of eaters."

I live around the corner and am a HUGE Upton&#39;s fan. I bought two sandwiches to split with my wife. First, the Italian with giardiniera. It was wet and fantastic! Bread was tasty and the &#34;meat&#34; was juicy and flavorful. Second, the Pastrami. Sourkraut - great. Mustard - awesome. Pastrami - nicely seasoned. Bread - BLEAH! Soggy, not crisped up. Really made it a subpar sandwich. If that bread was crisped up nice..man that would have been a great sandwich. Also had the bacon mac &amp; cheese. Was good, but not enough bacon bits and the breading was ok, not fantastic. Overall, place was pretty darn good. Next time, I&#39;ll ask them to crisp up the sandwiches a bit more and then hopefully, I&#39;ll be able to give it a 5 star review."

Finally made it here just to try their infamous mashed potatoes... Which they were out of at 2pm. So I decided to grab native foods instead but my boyfriend decided to try Upton&#39;s nacho plate. They were good! The service was mediocre, not much enthusiasm at all. We decided to try again the following day for the mashed potatoes and breakfast sandwiches. They were out of the mashed potatoes once again at 1pm. BLAH! I got the breakfast sandwich and my boyfriend got the nacho plate again. They made his nachos and then told him they were out of one of the main ingredients, the beans, and handed him his plate. The chef did come out and offer avocado, so that was nice but the beans definitely made the dish. They didn&#39;t cook my breakfast sandwich enough so my english muffin was soft and not crisp at all, the seitan bacon was all undercooked and soft (not sure if that&#39;s how it always is though). The cheesy sauce on the sandwich was pretty good and the tofu was fine too. We went back in after eating to grab some cookies to go and they were out of those too. All in all, what he had was fine and the nachos were great when they had all of the ingredients but the lack of customer service and missing items have left a bad first impression. I think it&#39;s for sure something they should work on because the place seems to have good potential. Maybe we will try again in a year so they have some time to settle in."

There is actually flavor in this American food!! I had the pastrami sandwich, which tasted wholesome and interesting. Whether or not it tasted anything like an actual pastrami sandwich, I really cannot say because I have never had one. The bacon mac and cheese was almost too salty, but it was otherwise delicious. I would have liked for it to be a little spicy but that might just be how I like to have mac and cheese. The sandwich size was appropriate for me, but considering that I usually end up taking half a sandwich home, the size of the sandwich might be small for others with larger appetites.You might be thinking, &#34;why the 3 stars if the food was so good?!&#34; Well, it was because of the service. My friend and I were literally the only ones that were there when we were trying to decide to order and the guy that took our order made it seem like we were being extremely bothersome to him. I asked him what the employee special was today and he flat out said there was none left. It was rather obvious that neither of us had been there before and he made no attempt to provide us with a suggestion or ask if we had any questions, instead he literally moved away from us. He also didn&#39;t even ask if we wanted anything to drink (hello, upsell opportunity!). Then, when my friend was paying, he just walked away from us. Are we supposed to just lurk by the counter? Can we sit down? Nothing. So we just stood there. When the food came out, I asked another guy if we could get cups of water and he was more than obliging - why can&#39;t the first guy learn something from this one?As much as I like the food, it&#39;s not worth the poor treatment. Maybe ordering online will prevent that? But I&#39;m not driving out there to pick up food. Guess I won&#39;t be coming back..."

The vegan pastrami was full of flavor and spiced just right.  It was topped off with sauerkraut.  The tangy and the spicy went perfectly together.  I also had the mac n cheese with seitan bacon.  It was served very hot, and was gooey and slightly salty, the way mac n cheese should be.  Delicious.  Everyone raved about the vegan soft serve ice cream.  My tummy said no more, so I passed on it.  This is seriously a good, and inexpensive place to pick up a quick meal.  Also, the owners have such heart,  compassion, and commitment which makes me happy to support this establishment."

All were well seasoned and the textures were good.-The texture of the pastrami with the sauerkraut was on point only issue it was waaaaay to full of sage/thyme  flavors. I would tone done the herbs and amp up the garlic/pepper for a more pastrami flavor. If it had more authentic spice It would of been a 5 star for a vegan sandwich based on a processed meat idea.-funny thing the mashed pot and gravy were very peppery, I kept wishing I could swap the herby sage flavor of the pastrami into the gravy and some of the pepper bite into the pastrami. but the were tasty regardless-the mac and cheese flavor was really good it was just dry...plenty of vegan options to get a little moisture in there"

The feedback I got back from my guests was that the texture was somewhat chewy so I felt it necessary to make a pilgrimage to Uptons Breakroom (I had Chimichurri Seitan Skewers at the Candle Cafe in NYC that were just to die for, pretty sure my sauce was the bomb so been searching for similarly textured seitan ever since). The place is not hard to find with a lot of street parking around. The CTA 65 Grand bus stop is right in front of the place, and has stops at the Blue Line, Red Line, and Navy Pier. Grand is a fairly busy street so even though it&#39;s in an industrial section of town, it seems very safe. Seating for the place is definitely limited so it&#39;s much more suitable for pick up or delivery, especially if you&#39;re ordering during peak hours. I got the Fried Bacon Mac and Pastrami Sandwich to go. They make it right in front of you and the staff is very helpful and friendly. Food comes out fairly fast too. The Pastrami Sandwich had sauerkraut which was crucial but I did find the seitan a bit chewy as per what my friends at my bbq had mentioned. Note though: I still eat meat and was a huge connoisseur of Jewish Delis back in NYC so I am very difficult to please when it comes to Pastramis and Ruebens. The fried bacon mac tasted like it could pass for real meat so whatever they were doing, please continue spinning that magic. I will definitely be going back to try out other items on the menu (which I hope will expand!) and hopefully find inspiration for my own vegan recipes courtesy of Upton products from Whole Foods"

The mac and cheese isn&#39;t cheesy (I know it&#39;s vegan, and I&#39;M vegan myself so I know what a good vegan mac and cheese is), and the food in general was kind of bland. I had the tempeh sandwich and my girlfriend had the Italian. Just ok.This evening I wanted to try their other sandwiches so I ordered delivery. We got their Pastrami and Breakfast sandwiches, and they were great! Really flavorful and not soggy at all which is common when you get sandwiches delivered. I did have the soup of the day which was a slightly vinegar-y broth with veggies and tofu, not my favorite, but perfectly acceptable. Everything arrived hot, and to top it all off the delivery guy BIKED to my apartment in 25 degree weather. He was the nicest delivery guy I&#39;ve ever met, too. Give that guy a raise.I&#39;ll definitely be ordering again, even if it&#39;s just for the same two sandwiches. I would suggest re-thinking some of the menu items (mac and cheese, tempeh and italian sandwich), even if that just means rotating out stuff on a seasonal basis or something."

Ordered pick up and arrived 5 minutes late expecting good to be waiting. This wasn&#39;t the case waited about 10 minutes. My total wait time was 40 minutes (was quoted 30 online).

A very small and sparse place, only three tables, small menu - huge value and a really good meal. Nothing fancy just very tasty vegan food. BLT - excellent. Even something simple like mashed potatoes and gravy, very tasty, good seasoning. A vegan chocolate shake. The Yelp reviews (read them in the place) about the fried bacon mac and cheese led us to try that too - a nice side dish. I guess the reason I give this place 5 stars is that it is so very nice to have so much of the basic food I grew up with - in non-vegan form - available in vegan form with good taste at a very reasonable price. We live in Oak Park and I think if they opened one there it would be absolutely mobbed. Given that this is also a local place that makes its own seitan - I think Chicago area vegans and their friends should go out of their way to try this place, to support this sort of thing and get a great meal. The reviews mention &#34;comfort food&#34; - that&#39;s maybe the best way to think of it. It&#39;s comfortable, comforting food and you feel good after you&#39;ve eaten."

Sometime back in 2010 or so I was shocked that my favorite Chicago bar and eatery was closed. This past Tuesday I was reading through the Where magazine after coming back to town on biz. A short piece on The Red Lion was featured. Thursday night I made my way to Lincoln Park and into the beautifully remodeled Red Lion. It&#39;s amazing, the old bar and war artifacts are displayed nicely. Have Colin show you the World War 2 pics his father drew up. A talented man and POW survivor of WW II.I tried the bar pasta and loved it. Also had the Cielo Pinto Grigio. A very nice pairing.Parking always bad all over Lincoln Park so Uber it there like I did.This place is loaded with charm, character, a traditional English pub feel and a fireplace.

Colin, the owner, is an expert bartender and historian. Amongst all the impressive museums Chicago has to offer, an unrivaled collection of World War prints and art is hidden away in Lincoln Park. Any war buff such as myself will be wide eyed and blown away by the anthology Colin has built in this absolutely beautiful pub. (Pub? Museum? Cozy ski lodge? You decide).Colin noted our enthusiasm and gave us a tour of the premises and told the stories each photo had to tell. This is no decor- the pictures and drawings on the wall are original, and he knows the faces behind each one.As for the drinks, there is a wide selection of beers and cocktails. He knows as much about alcohol as he does history. Colin&#39;s classical bartender style mixes perfectly with his sense of humor. When he asks you what you&#39;d like, his attention to you is undivided- a trait that has nearly been lost in the industry. His hospitality is without equal.This is an experience I&#39;ll never forget. You&#39;ll feel smarter just for having been here!  You won&#39;t find another place quite like the Red Lion."

They have a cool beer selection with lots of beers to try from across the pond. The food served to the people around us all smelled and looked really good, so I would definitely return to give some of that a shot. The biggest draw was probably the place itself - awesome building with great decor. It has a great pub feel and made me want to spend all evening there.

This place is the stuff of Anglophilic dreams, decorated in war propaganda posters and memories of the British Empire. There is an extensive and reasonably priced whisk(e)y book and rotating drafts from all over the world. Bartenders have been friendly and well-educated, happy to discuss any and all options. Music, if they play any, stays in the background. There are a few TVs, but they&#39;re for resting one&#39;s gaze - patrons are here to talk to one another and enjoy a nice night in a local.I should say the food is pretty good - slightly classy British pub fare, very competent fry cook, and above-average bread.

Both times I have found the hospitality beyond any other restaurant I have ever been to. The owner, Colin, is extremely intelligent and knows how to make everyone&#39;s experience comfortable and enjoyable. The fish and chips is the best in Chicago, and there is a selection of other traditional English dishes that I am excited to try next. Based on my experience working in the restaurant business, the alcohol selection, especially the beers, (as you can find in all other reviews) is phenomenal.

But, most of all, the atmosphere is top notch. It makes you feel smarter and more worldly for having been. The experience here is truly unique and not like any other I&#39;ve encountered in Chicago. I could not recommend The Red Lion enough.I used to frequent here when I went school in Chicago 10 years ago. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, it was closed for renovations. Unfortunately for the rest of my time in Chicago.I was extremely pleased to happen by the other day after a Cubs game and see it open and flourishing again. The inside is much more spacious than the old place (the bathroom is a major upgrade!), but loses a bit of that dusty, lived in charm that made the old place so compelling.

The decor is gorgeous, they really went all out with the reboot, and it is perfect for a night out with friends, a date, dinner with out of towners, or just stopping in for a bite and a pint. The beer selection is unique and interesting, and there are more whiskeys than I can count. I am also really glad to see how well they&#39;ve been accepted into the neighborhood. It&#39;s a good mix of professionals, old regulars, students, and young families who come in for dinner. There not a lot of quality options in that area capable of accommodating such a broad clientele, but they do it without missing a beat.As for the food, I&#39;ve eaten here probably close to a dozen times now, and have yet to not be impressed at the quality. The menu is well constructed and constantly evolving, and you can tell everything is made from scratch- a rare find in Chicago among a sea of Irish/British pubs with huge menus and apparently huge freezers. I also like that they seem to find a good balance of things you would expect to find (Fish n Chips, Scotch Egg, Shephards Pie) some things that you may not expect to see but are nonetheless authentic and impressive (Pork chops, Rack of lamb, Ham Pie) in addition to some real creative variations and specials (Lamb BLT, Lamb Keftah, Soft Shell Crab on salad).The drink prices are about average for the neighborhood (maybe with the exception of some DePaul dives with buckets of PBR or whatnot) and the food cost/quality ratio is exceptional.I really dig it and would recommend to just about anyone. Check it."

We popped in on Thursday after work and were immediately seated in the sunny front room. The ambiance at The Red Lion is awesome and it&#39;s really not the type of place you expect to walk into off of Lincoln Avenue in Lincoln Park. There&#39;s a ton of warm wood, unique English pub themed decor, and comfortable seating - definitely the type of place you want to get comfy to enjoy a pint.After settling in I perused the draft beer list which had nothing I&#39;d ever heard of but appreciated. Since their draft selection is so unique they do a great job with the descriptions and our waiter was also really helpful in answering questions. We sampled a few different things throughout the evening and were pleased with all of them.What really set the experience apart though was the outstanding food! For an appetizer we started with the Pub Cheese. The toasted pumpernickel bread triangles were the perfect palate for the cheese. As a big pub cheese fan I have to say that The Red Lion&#39;s is by far the best I&#39;ve had in awhile and you can tell it&#39;s super fresh as well.While I could&#39;ve been satisfied with just the appetizer we opted to order dinner as well. My companion went with the Fish and Chips and I went with the Watson. I sampled a piece of the fish and I have to say... Red Lion has the best fish and chips I&#39;ve had in a long time, maybe ever. I&#39;m also a HUGE sucker for vinegar when eating English fare and was totally wowed by the malt vinegar aioli that came with the dish... it definitely takes English food to the next level.The Watson was also really good, I was a bit nervous to try to the &#34;salted beef&#34; the the horseradish slaw sold me on the dish and I was happy I tried it! It was just as the waiter said, a tender, juicy, salty cut of corned beef with delicious slaw on top of it. If you&#39;re a Reuben lover like me go with The Watson, it&#39;s the English variation in my opinion.In addition to the delicious food and fabulous ambiance our waiter was very friendly and attentive. The only time we lost him was when it was time for the check but he was also attending to several other tables, including a very large birthday party.All in all a great experience at The Red Lion Pub - highly recommend it."

The decor is stunning. I especially like the books lining the shelves and walls - it is befitting of the pub&#39;s location near DePaul University. If I worked at DePaul, I would spend alot of time here.Speaking of which, the Red Lion is set amid a bunch of bars catering to the DePaul student. Thankfully, its elegant new design was offputting to the students (so far) and so it was very adult friendly.The owner, Colin, was posted up behind the bar and was happy to take orders or make suggestions based on our preferences. I had a couple of Irish whiskies, my wife had a cocktail, and my buddy had some bourbons. All good.I have heard the food needs some work, but the bread pudding we ordered was delicious."

Kudos to the owners for whipping up good old English nostalgia both in the food and decor. The restaurant will satisfy most anglophiles&#39; cravings but is also a great spot for first dates and casual dining with friends.Try the curried fries and shepherds pie.P.S. On one occasion, my sister and I were sipping beer and cider in front of the crackling fire in the library room when an unexpected guest walked over to us. She was marketing Glenlivet and offered us a free flight of whiskey. My first response was &#34;yes&#34;, and then my second was, &#34;whats the catch&#34;? There was none as I found out this is a standard marketing tactic of distillery houses. My sister and I were very pleasantly surprised and had a great time sampling the different batches."

The clientele around 7pm was generally older and this definitely seems like a neighborhood hangout/no blacked out 21 year olds.We ordered the Scotch egg salad, fish &amp; chips, and the crispy spiced chicken sandwich. We also were able to try to  the pub cheese &amp; bread on the house (just ok, wouldnt order again).Everything was average tasty but the fish &amp; chips I would come back for. The batter was super light and cooked perfectly, and the chips/fries were nice and medium thick-cut. The chicken sandwich was a 2nd contender and pretty flavorful, although the curry spiced fries I got were just ok (prefer curry sauce instead of curry spice on the fries).We tried a couple beers off their English-heavy draft list and my favorite was the Thornbridge English IPA. It was really light and not super hoppy.Our server was a super nice lad, but he seemed a little overwhelmed with many tables. Since he slightly messed up our order, he gave us a round of drinks and pub cheese &amp; bread on the house, which was a really nice touch.All in all, I&#39;d definitely come back to Red Lion for its dark British manor atmosphere and the fish &amp; chips."

Books line the walls, high ceilings, history around you in the photographs, perfect amount of lighting etc. a great place to come on a date, with a group, or even to stop in alone at the bar for a drink.Service. Our waiter was excellent and knowledgable about the pub, it&#39;s drinks, it&#39;s menu, etc. and taught us about how the kitchen makes everything from scratch. Excellent service all around.Menu. Very English and very good. Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection. The choices were outstanding, especially the beer and other drinks menu, they had beers we haven&#39;t had since we were in London. If you haven&#39;t had monk&#39;s cafe, order it. If you aren&#39;t sure whether there will be something to eat for the picky eater in your group, there is a three cheese toastie which has great cheeses and a jam spread and comes with fries - the vegetarian in our group loved it.Overall we loved our experience and will definitely be back. You should definitely at least go once and take in the atmosphere of the place. Makes you forget you&#39;re in Chicago, felt like Europe.Thanks red lion!"

The pictures looked great, I&#39;d heard decent things.The atmosphere is really cool, and their alcohol selection is nice. But the food. The food was terrible. The sandwich I got was decent, not the best, but the fries they came with were cold and tasted old. Like, several days old. As if they were trying to unload last week&#39;s uneaten fries on me and my friends. Everything was horribly greasy. I ate my sandwich and only a couple fries, and I felt sick the rest of the day. If you want to go here, come for a drink in the evening, not for brunch on the weekend."

We came around 7pm Friday and there were a few tables dining but most were enjoying their drinks around the bar.Loved loved loved the ambiance and décor. Very refreshing to find a nice place in Lincoln Park especially by DePaul that has a sophisticated crowd, one that isn&#39;t inhabited by obnoxious youngins (besides actual kids during the day/early evening). All the books and aviation/war art and photos made you feel like you were in grandpa&#39;s home. The upstairs looked even cooler, in which I hope to get to experience next time around.I got the fish &amp; chips as boo got the bangers &amp; mash. Both were very good and tasted very fresh. The fish was perfectly fried with a light crispy batter. The fries were fine and nothing outstanding. The accompanied tartar sauce was very good and a little different than to what I&#39;m used to. The sausages might even have been better than the fish. The potatoes were also quite nice and had a subtle cheesy flavor. We also had a side of brussel sprouts and while good, it wasn&#39;t amazing. Didn&#39;t really pick up on the bacon flavor, even though the bits were there. Decent beer list.Service was good. Our server was delightful and came by to check on us not too much and not too little. Prices were about right. Maybe a tad more than your run of the mill pub, but nothing outrageous by any means.Overall, would love to come back with some friends and lose track of time here."

This new iteration is none of the above. It&#39;s got a gorgeous high ceiling with wood beams and skylights and a balcony seating area upstairs, complete with fireplace and cozy couch and chairs.The front room has windows that open out to the sidewalk, creating a lovely airy feel. I have spent more time than I care to admit in British pubs and while it didn&#39;t remind me so much of the ol&#39; carpeted local down the block, it&#39;s just a really lovely space.We ended up seated in the back, where we weren&#39;t quite in the thick of the action, but it was nice, nonetheless. I had the burger, which, with 2 patties, made me concerned about the amount of meatage, but it was very delicious (and I got to take half home to enjoy the next day!) The burger was well-seasoned with the addition of Red Leicester instead of boring ol&#39; regular cheddar. I got the curry fries, as well and they were heavenly crisp on the outside and coated with delicious curry seasoning (not drowned in curry sauce.) Hubs had the fish and chips. With only 3 pieces of fish, he was a little disappointed, but the batter was awesomely crispy and the fish, nice and flaky.There&#39;s a selection of various British bevies and we tried a cider and an IPA. I didn&#39;t love the cider, but that&#39;s just me. After dinner, we ended up taking our drinks upstairs to hang out on the balcony, which was really nice. Very cozy, AND good people watching, It&#39;s nice because you&#39;re away from the crowd, yet still part of the action.Colin, the owner, was very personable, mingling with the patrons and taking them around to tell stories about the artwork. James, our server, was also a hoot. I&#39;m definitely returning."

It was a Tuesday night, so the place was sparse. It was &#34;half off bottle of wine night&#34; and they were out of the first 2 bottles we asked for (conveniently the cheapest bottles at 33$ and 46$, before half off calculated).  They had an extensive list of alcohol. The menu was limited and I had fish/chips, it IS an English pub. Food covered half of my plate. The fish was fine, nothing special as were the fries. My friend raved about her Brussel sprouts. The bartender was non comunicative and was generally uninterested in providing us with good service, he was not interested in working. We didn&#39;t drink nearly as much as we had intended, as he was not attentive to our empty glasses. We called to him a few times and he either didn&#39;t hear us or pretended not to, but there were only about 9 people at a 20 person bar. Just before we left, my friend asked for a coffee drink and the bartender made a suggestion. She said to him, &#34;I can&#39;t have carbs&#34; and he rolled his eyes, threw his hands up and made an insulting look on his face. This in any situation is rude, but my friend has recently lost ALOT of weight by disciplining herself to a no carb diet. The atmosphere and ambiance of the red lion is original and beautiful, but the staff and service we below par, which would make me not return again. C&#39;mon people... you bartend in a downtown Chicago iconic bar, you should have better social skills!!!"

My fiancé took me here in December for my birthday weekend, and it is truly cozy inside. We sat in the front room and the fire place was lit which just made it even better. That said, while the waiter we had was really friendly, the bar was totally understaffed. He had to bounce back and forth between being the only server and host. I ordered a chicken sandwich and my fiancé ordered the fish and chips. The food was piping hot, but just lacking in much flavor and for the price, we both were a bit disappointed with the end product. We did love the plowman&#39;s cheese board, and it we return that will probably be what we stick with."

Menu has many interesting options besides the fish n chips, which is the main event here.  And the recipe is excellent, light and airy, with delicious house-made tartar sauce.  Several sandwiches sounded good for my next visit.Dined on a Saturday night and Colin Cordwell, the owner, was tending bar and shaking hands with countless friends. This is an adult crowd, possibly the hangout for half the DePaul faculty. And that suits me fine. No one in the entire place had a baseball cap on backwards.I checked the wine list before I headed home and there are plenty of good selections for those who don&#39;t go for English drafts.  You&#39;ve got to see the entire interior since it is quite an architectural gem."

A more mature clientele than most of the bars on Lincoln.The atmosphere is fantastic--all wood tables, leather chairs, and has an authentic old world luxurious pub feel. I especially like the front room, which has high ceilings, windows, and walls lined with books. (We use this room for reading groups sometimes and it&#39;s perfect.) There&#39;s also a small lounge area upstairs for small groups. The main seating area gets a bit loud for my tastes on a weekend night, but is otherwise fine.My only complaint is that it always smells strange, like wood stain or something."

Soak up the old world atmosphere. This place as well as the old place are documented haunted buildings.

The food was poor and the service even worse.Food:We shared a Scotch Egg Salad appetizers which was OK. The Scotch Egg itself was actually very good but the salad was past its best and incredibly over-dressed.I ordered a Sheppard&#39;s Pie, which at $15 I expected to be good.It was not. Dry, chewy lamb and not a hint of flavor. Plus it was a very small portion for the money, I came away very hungryMy Husband had fish and chips which was passable, but not memorable and no better than the fish and chips I&#39;ve had in any other bar or restaurant out here.Service:Where do I begin?? We had to wait nearly 15 mins to order our drinks, and only then because I flagged down a server. I then had to grab another server to take our food order and at this point had been sat down for half an hour. Our drinks were nowhere to be seen at this point either - someone came over about 20mins after we ordered them and said &#34;oh, have you not got your drinks? I&#39;ll sort that now&#34;. 10mins later, still nothing so I had to get up and go to the bar to inquire where they were. They eventually arrived, 5 mins before our food did.We only had our appetizer 5 minutes when they brought out our entrees, which then sat there whilst we finished our appetizer.When the time came for us to pay, it was another mission to get our check and I had to hunt down the server to take our credit card.I wanted to like this place, I really did. But it was a disappointment and will not go back. For great British style cuisine - Owen &amp; Engine offers better food and service at comparable prices. And Paddy Long&#39;s does better fish and chips.Sorry :-("

Lots of dark wood and books, with a fire place and leather chairs. It is also nice that there don&#39;t seem to be too many idiots wandering in from some of the other establishments on Lincoln. It is a bit more relaxed. The prices are bad here though, expect every beer to be at least a dollar or two more expensive than it should be. The food is okay but also a bit overpriced, I had the fish and chips. The fish was decent, the chips were average and the sauce they had for the fish was weird, not your typical malt vinegar sauce, it was something that tasted like it couldn&#39;t decide if it wanted to be tartar or aioli.Overall I enjoyed the decor, thought the food was okay and disliked the beer prices."

There are books, photographs, and artwork that fill the bar. The decor is elegant but not stuffy, the setting is quiet and chill and is perfect for some drinks and food after a long day at work. The bar has a separate room which acts as more of a lounge with nice comfy leather chairs right by a fireplace, perfect for warming those cold fingers in the dead of winter!  Now as for drinks, their beer menu is very euro-centric (mostly British beers and food, as one might have guessed from the pub&#39;s name) with a few local beers here or there, but mostly not well known. However, that completely doesn&#39;t mean the beer wasn&#39;t good, because it was some of the best beer I&#39;ve tasted yet! The Schlenkerla Helles Lagerbier was a total revelation, with its smoky (almost tea like) flavor and is the perfect lager to relax to in front of the fireplace. I will definitely be going back for more, not only to try other beers, but also to dip into their food menu as well!"

It&#39;s a two story deal, that I ,did not manage to make it to the second level. Not being from England or even been near the U.K. I had no idea what to expect. I know they have bad food, teeth and they drink Guinness. I wasn&#39;t going to have any of that. I wanted a Belvedere and lemonade in a pub glass. This place didn&#39;t even have lemonade. But that didn&#39;t stop the bartender. Squeezing the lemons and rounding up the sugar packets. He was as awesome as the homemade drinks he made! After the 5th one I started to get hungry and a bit worried. Should I take a chance. I get for the bangers and mash. Now I saw plates flying by all night. But after more than a half hour I wondered if he was pissed at me for ordering an American drink in an English pub! He came by with the food and apologized. The oven broke! I don&#39;t know how they were cooked without a stove. But they were delicious! The whole evening was fabulous and aces to the bartender for making that happen!"

Well yeah,  we asked 15 min ago.  Anyways, so we finished eating and were thinking that maybe dessert would help.  It took the server 25 min to come to us.  By the way, it wasn&#39;t slammed, so no excuses.  Since it had taken him so long, we had decided to skip dessert and get our check.  The server walked out of the back typing on his cell phone with no cares in the world. When he finally did make his way to us, we received our bill.  There was no sort of apology from him or anything comped for the ice cold Shepard&#39;s pie.   I am a server, so this really bothered me.  I would NEVER give any of my guests this type of experience.  When we were leaving,  we tried to say bye to the server, but he was standing at the host stand texting.  He finally yelled, &#34;Bye&#34; as we were almost out the door.We came here with excitement and were really looking forward to discovering a new gem.  We left with disappointment, $70 less in our pockets, and in awe regarding the terrible service and sub-par food."

We were quickly seated and definitely admired the decor/atmosphere. There was so much to look at and you can tell that the owners did a really great job paying attention to small details. I did see the owner around talking to different tables quite a bit, which I thought was nice, and I could tell he took great pride in his new place. A few people wanted to sit in the oversized chairs in the front room; they asked the hostess if they could sit there and she said she didn&#39;t know. The owner happened to be in the room, and was quick to say &#34;of course!&#34; and the group seemed very pleased. I loved the owner&#39;s innate, and quick decision to make his customers happy. Perhaps the message of what is considered okay/acceptable could be relayed to the hostess in that situation for the future. :)My friend and I ordered once the waiter arrived; I had the fish and chips and my friend had the voodoloo chicken. We both passed on the beer and just had water. Both meals were fantastic. I would definitely come back here for the food.However, I might wait to come back for a bit based off of the service. I know that the restaurant is brand new, so I tried to give our waiter the benefit of the doubt. I noticed small things, such as having to ask for a new carafe of water when we were all out, etc., but I can definitely look past that. But, as someone with previous food service experience, I found it outrageous that it took 12 minutes after we asked for our bill to actually get it; instead of dropping it off when he delivered drinks to 3 neighboring tables, he made individual trips for each table&#39;s particular need - most of which were beers, not dinners. Often times, our waiter would look right at us, see us motioning for him, and then continue walking - it appeared that he was avoiding us, or (more likely) he was overwhelmed by three tables he had. Our dinner took an hour and 15 minutes to complete, not because we weren&#39;t done/ready, but because we were waiting on our waiter. I&#39;m not sure if the restaurant was understaffed on this Friday night, but our section wasn&#39;t particularly busy.Again, I would definitely go back, but I would probably wait a bit until the service has a chance to catch up/work out the kinks."

We asked the bartender for another that was extra dry and she didn&#39;t know what that was!  Both of our burgers came with the wrong toppings and sides.  The server was unapologetic and seemed bothered that we told her the orders were wrong.  Lastly, the restroom had two paper towel dispensers, but both were empty.  Clearly nobody checked on that for a long time.  We won&#39;t be back."

The manchego never melted.  Not good.   The vibe at Esencia is decidedly Mexican, but the beef chorizo didn&#39;t haver the chili flavor that Mexican chorizo always has.  House potatoes were the highlight.Everything is cooked to order  ,(not necessarily a bad thing) so expect to wait for your breakfast. My omelette was just OK, yet the plates passing me by looked awesome.  I will go back and try something else.Last, but not least, the menu on their  website needs to be tweaked.  I felt like Helen Keller trying to make sense of it."

It&#39;s hours are so limited making me wonder how they can afford to stay open yet whenever they&#39;re open there are always patrons there. And for good reason too! I have been to Esencia twice for brunch and have never been let down. Two weeks ago I went with a friend for brunch and I built my own omelette with chorizo and bacon. It was delicious! The ingredients were fresh and tasty however the chorizo wasn&#39;t as pronounced in the dish as I&#39;d like, especially given that it is one of the few protein options in their optional ingredients list. Otherwise, it was really good!Broadway has quite a few good options for brunch (Rocks, Ann Sathers, Revolution, Wilde, Melrose, etc.) however I&#39;d say Esencia is one of my favorites. I feel like the kitchen prepares all dishes from scratch and that everything comes out with a bit of a twist. It certainly beats plain ol&#39; bacon and eggs. I&#39;m a fan. 4 stars!"

The food was 3 stars, with so many good Mexican spots in Chicago the enchiladas were forgettable. The rice and beans were pretty bland. My friend had a side order of Mac and cheese that she barely touched. She said there was not much taste.I want to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt that maybe they were experiencing higher than normal traffic during lunch, but what was supposed to be a quick work lunch turned into a 1 1/2 hour meal. We ordered chips and guacamole as an appetizer and they forgot. They ended up bringing it after our meals were complete. It would have been nice to snack on something while we waited 45 minutes for our entrees. I thought they would comp the chips and guacamole because of their error and to attempt customer recovery but to no avail.I ordered a diet coke and it came in a can with no refills. If I order a $2.50 soda I feel free refills is appropriate. One of my biggest pet peeves of restaurants.After we finished our meals we ended up taking our credit cards to the waiter because he disappeared and we were tired of waiting.

That changed when friends who lived down the block suggested it one boozy evening when we were making 2 am brunch plans that we nearly forgot about the next morning.

The restaurant space itself is small (only a few four-top tables and some bar-seating), but there are several sidewalk four-tops as well. I thought I knew what I was doing when I said &#34;outside would be fine&#34; - but understand that the outside tables are on the north side of the restaurant. In the brunching hours, it is totally in the shade. In June-July, that would be great, but in mid-September, it was a touch chilly!The server was very polite, and she was quick with the coffee. I was delighted when I detected a nice hint of cinnamon in the flavor! I think I may have gotten four or five cups because it was so good. My friend recommended the Egg and Pesto Sandwich. We saw one on the table nearby, and it was appealing enough that we all three got it. No regrets here! I finished it off in short order.

Went with salsa verde, chicken (which was shredded), and eggs over easy.This dish was absolutely awesome. I opted out of the beans, asking for them on the side and giving them to Susan - she thought they were great. I cut and mixed up everything, getting each bite with egg, rice, cheese, chicken, salsa, and chips. The salsa was a solid medium spicy and the homemade corn chips were just the right amount of soggy: moist, but still had some crunch. The cheese was tasty and creamy. The rice had a lot of flavor and was a great way to get the salsa on a fork.I don&#39;t want to brush my teeth right now since the flavor is still there.Susan had an egg white omelet with mushrooms, bacon, and white cheddar.

When we called to make reservations they didn&#39;t pick up and the line kept ringing. I know this is a new-ish place so maybe they&#39;re still getting all set up. The service was awkward, but fine. It was just clear that the servers hadn&#39;t been working there long.I got the Huevos rancheros and my friend got the Huevos a la mexicana. Both were very yummy and filling. The food really is quite good. The coffee was also really unique. I asked-they put cinnamon in it and it has a great flavor to it.Also it was kind of weird that to get to the bathroom you have to walk through the kitchen. Nothing wrong with it, just kind of odd.Overall, Esencia is great. It is very reasonably priced and delicious. Great outdoor seating and a very nice decor inside as well. Go check it out!!"

My daughter and I went here for a Mother&#39;s Day brunch. She had the buttermilk pancakes. She didn&#39;t like them, but I will say she&#39;s very picky. I tried a taste of them and they were just okay. The main reason I wanted to go here was to try the french toast with caramelized banana since the reviews on them were great. Once there, I really wanted to try the cherizo hash but didn&#39;t want a full serving since I was gonna have the french toast. They wouldn&#39;t do just a side order so I told my waitress to give me the full order and along with the french toast and that I would just box up half of the hash to take home. She said okay and took our orders.When the orders arrived I only received the hash, but figured the french toast was coming. Well, it never came. I asked about it and she said okay I&#39;ll bring it so I asked for the box for the hash, which I only took  a couple bites of. Again, the french toast never came. I kept waiting. Then, the waitress brings me the check! The check didn&#39;t have the french toast on it. I just said forget it, paid, and left. I am totally disappointed since the french toast was my main reason for going. Now, I will say that the cherizo hash was very good and I will give this place a second try. I&#39;m just not sure where the communication broke down."

Delicious cocktail!I was ready to order a sandwich off the regular menu, then our waitress pointed out a special. House-smoked duck, lettuce, tomato-peach conserve, pickled onion, and lemon aioli on a rosemary roll. WHAT!!! Everything about that sandwich sounded amazing. I couldn&#39;t resist, so I ordered it... and it tasted as good as it sounded. I loved the savory flavor of the duck, lightened by the flavors of the conserve, onion, and aioli, and complimented by the herbs in the bread. Would recommend if this was ever on the menu again.My boyfriend and I sat on the barstools facing the windows. Perfect for people-watching. Well, house-watching since there&#39;s not many pedestrians. More importantly there were outlets to charge our phones while waiting for our food and drinks.

Unfortunately, I was dismayed to find that they had taken it off the menu! That pretty much sealed the deal right then and there, ruining my experience. I bitterly settled on the Rib Eye, which I regretted immediately upon first view. The minuscule portion was certainly not worth the $13 price tag, and the meat wasn&#39;t even hot; lukewarm would describe it more accurately. The fried onion rings dominated the taste of the SLIDER, while I couldn&#39;t even taste the chimichurri (the only reason I settled on this sandwich in the first place).

It always makes me laugh when places in the US are all proudly &#34;Est. 2015!&#34; when most places in Europe opened in 1600 or someshitlikethat. But, I get it, I&#39;m not in Europe, and I digress.What this place is, is a great little neighborhood joint! It seems a bit out of the way (this is good!) and as yet undiscovered. This won&#39;t last long, as it is in oh-so-hipster-fabulous Logan Square. Get in there now, I guess.The back patio is very nice, and chill. Another bar is being constructed, which will add tables as well. They&#39;re going to need them.The menu is pretty simple - sandwiches, salads, wraps, apps, but each thing looked like a gem. We got the Cheese Curd appetizer, because 2 of the 4 of us are authentic Cheeseheads, and the other two are willing participants in that sort of nonsense. Cheese curd appetizer appropriately cheesy and gooey. A big hit.For my sandwich, I got the Reuben, and my companion got the Croque Madame. Both were great! My Reuben was a good size, and very flavorful. It could have had more sauerkraut, but there is never enough sauerkraut for this Kraut. The addition of pickles was a successful one. The Croque Madame was tasty as well. Both sandwiches were $11 each, which is pretty standard for this area. The chips that come with the sandwich were DELICIOUS. Salt n&#39; vinegar goodness, I LOVED them. The spicy chips were tasty as well.Cocktails. Good beer selection, the beer lovers in our party were fans of their picks. I went for the Bourbon Mule which was a delicious drink. Not badly priced at $9 here in Hipsterville. The Strawberry Rhubarb Daisy was very refreshing, and had a stalk of Rhubarb stuck in it. No one speaks of Rhubarb, and I believe more people should. Very tasty summer drink.I love how this place is integrated into the neighborhood, and looks like it&#39;s been there a long time. Will definitely come back in summer for the patio, and in colder months to enjoy the nicely designed barroom. Unpretentious vibe, with a friendly, attentive, efficient staff. Great place!"

Well-curated selection of beers. Creative list of easy-drinking cocktails. Fun appetizer options. Sweet and sassy staff. Fried foods might need just a little bit more tweaking - cheese curds batter reminded me just a little too much of corn dog in boring fried shell texture, there wasn&#39;t much flavor going on despite the fried basil, and the exteriors of the whole belly clams were just a touch on the wet/greasy side. I appreciated the opportunity to eat some fresh-tasting fried whole bellies in Chicago, but I wish the kitchen had removed some of the innards of my batard so that the sandwich eating experience was more cohesive. Tequila-lime milkshake was a pleasing end to this meal."

They&#39;re very friendly but the pacing was weird. Its not too offensive since it is a little sandwich shop with a bar. We weren&#39;t upset but we did notice. It was pretty empty when we arrived for an early dinner on a week night. There were a few people at the bar. We took a seat and ordered a couple of draft cocktails. You would think that would be quick and easy but we waited a long time for those drinks! Like a really long time. I had the Pimm&#39;s Cup which was lovely. Just an herbaceous, light, summery drink. My boyfriend tried the ruby negroni which was also refreshing.After we ordered some sandwiches we had some time to hang. I could see that my boyfriend&#39;s croque madame was made right away and sat on the counter, waiting, for a bit. That was weird. I had the special fried chicken &amp; biscuit sandwich.When looking at the menu you think the prices are great, but then you get your sandwich and see how small it is you think, the prices are terrible, but then as you eat you think that this is just enough food. So I don&#39;t know. Its not crazy expensive but you&#39;re not taking food home either.I wish I would have seen/read the full description of that chicken sandwich because it was drenched in hot sauce. I am a wimp when it comes to heat. I got the gravy on the side so my boyfriend could try it, and he loved it, but I wish I had 86&#39;d the sauce altogether. It was painful. The chicken thigh was great. Very delicious but small. It was served on a small biscuit, not sandwich sized, which I thought was odd. This is a knife &amp; fork kind of sandwich. As it was the biscuit wasn&#39;t awesome so no biggie that there wasn&#39;t more of it.My boyfriend&#39;s sandwich was delicious. He loved it.We tried the spicy chips and the vinegar chips. They are both amazing. There were a few plain chips that snuck into my batch that were kind of sad. Definitely in need of seasoning and/or dip. But I would order those chips if they offered dip as a starter. They were perfectly cooked.I would definitely come back here for a casual hang. Its not quick but the delicious food and draft cocktails made you not care."

I have been here twice now. It has been pretty amazing both times. I especially like their bloody mary and my favorite sandwich is the Short Rib.// Reuben - This sandwich comes out warm with a ton of flavor. A good amount of corned beef and it is done well. Muenster cheese, russian dressing  and bread and butter pickles. Its a slammmm dunk!// Chicken Salad  Sandwich - this sandwich is cold and it pretty interesting. It wasn&#39;t my favorite but I did enjoy the oddness of the sour grape jam. It added a nice fruity taste to the chicken salad.// Short Rib Sandwich - This sandwich is delicioussssss and is my current favorite. Comes out with tons of meat. I really enjoyed the crunchiness of the fried shallot. I am a sucker for crunchy in my sandwich.// Bloody Mary - about 12 oz but it is yummy. Not a whole lot of garnishes but has a spicy rimmed garnish. I would recommend it.I forgot the prices but everything is pretty reasonable. about 8-14 $ per item. It has a really nice indoor decor and the staff is very nice. Food always comes out hot and quick."

Loved everything about it, the bread, shmear, meat, jesus lord in heaven this is my church. Such nice presentation also.Tomato bisque - tasty, tangy, hot and with sprinkles of cheese on topMilkshake - my kids drank this all up with gusto, I even watched the bartender make sure he got a good dollop of whipped cream on top.BBQ sandwich - one of the 4 ladies i was with got this and it was so great.They use mismatched plates which makes me feel like I am in someones house, I love it. They have a ton of great beer on tap, I had a Revolution Brew, I will for sure be back, hopefully this place brings more of these kinds of restaurants to this hood. I even saw some old school neighborhood guy sit at the counter drink a coffee and order a sandwich to go, that is great. So many kids there also!

I had the mac and cheese, which was on special and a little bit overly soupy. The biggest trouble was it took us nearly two hours to get our food (in spite of not being overly crowded), which was frustrating.However, because we were staying nearby we went back for a nightcap later, and the service was awesome. Our server that night was attentive, genuinely friendly, competent, and delightful.

A lot of people like this place and I was excited, expecting more of something like the local deli near my childhood neighborhood. Me and my boyfriend popped in a few days ago to check it out on our date night. It&#39;s really aesthetically cute and the space is great, if not a little small and cozy on the inside. I did not get a chance to check out the patio. Inside, tables are close together, spaced awkwardly and it was kinda loud with the group next to us.I ordered the Italian, and my boyfriend got the Ribeye Sandwich. He ordered a beer and I got a root beer float. I have to say, it was a bad call on my part that I would ever buy a $7 root beer float. There was hardly any root beer and some places will give you the bottle but not here. Maybe their soda is on tap? My boyfriends sandwich was something like $13 and mine was $10. I knew what I was paying going into it, but for what we got, ---two sandwiches and two drinks, it ended up being about $45. I guess you pay for the ambiance?? I must have been spoiled growing up in other Chicago neighborhoods where you could get a really good deli sandwich, chips and a pop for $5-8 total.The staff was super nice, the food was good but I was expecting something interesting, different than what I would usually go to for a deli at that price point. I could not believe that we had to both throw down $20 for a sandwich and a drink, and that we had a server bring the food. Just a weird/expensive concept. I don&#39;t know if I have it in me or my wallet to make another trip."

Now I don&#39;t live quite as close and Wyler Road occupies this space. I paid a visit to the new joint to check it out.Good vibe when you come inside. It&#39;s a little strange to find a hip place like this on such a residential corner, but I suppose that&#39;s the neighborhood nowadays. They have a decent beer list and some draft cocktails. The menu is relatively small, which is actually nice, and everything sounded good. I decided on the short rib sandwich which is topped with fried shallots and bleu cheese. Flavor was great, you definitely get the short rib flavor from the bone. So much different that a regular shredded beef sandwich. Price was more reasonable than I expected, sandwich and chips or salad will run you $10-12."

It had maybe three tiny pieces of salad lettuce that looked more like shreds, tiny bacon pieces and a tomato slice. Their hot sauce was killer, but way too much on the sandwich it was overpowering.

Sandwiches range between $7-13 and come with chips or salad. They have great beers on tap, and a cozy Wisconsin cabin vibe. I recommended the Reuben sandwich!

Starting to see why people aren&#39;t fans of gentrification and this place is why. It&#39;s a deli with a bar. Had a greasy sandwich with greasy chips and a beer my wife had the same. Go to a typical deli that&#39;s maybe $30.00 here it&#39;s 50 because they use artisanal mayo and it&#39;s served on a brioche ... Would be nice if local restaurants would stop over hyping/charging for food.Service was fine. Don&#39;t sit at the bar near the kitchen. Just annoying chef yelling at his underlings the whole time. Another poor choice by the owner. Why is the kitchen in the open at all?This is working class neighborhood. Where are the non-Mexican restaurants to reflect that?

Thanks to all the great reviews we went with the potato balls and cheese curds which were excellent and travelled really well, although it may be because we&#39;re in Logan Square.  The only somewhat flop for us was the short rib sandwich,  I was hoping for a juicier sandwich but it came on a large French baguette and the meat to bread ratio was not great leaving every bite with too much bread.  The short rib was flavorful bit a little on the dry side and the Bleu cheese was very minimal. I was hoping for more of a sauce but instead had crumbles.  The house made chips were tasty and all the side sauces that came with the apps were excellent! I think we&#39;re going to have to go into the restaurant next time for the full effect and to give some other sandwiches a go."

It&#39;s in west Logan so it might be largely undiscovered, and therefore its cool value is amplified. It fits  the bougie status quo with craft beers, cocktails and pedestrian fare plus lots of beards and skinny jeans. However it is different because it is not all white. This is a refreshing change in a city that has a history of redlining , racial housing covenants and resulting segregation.Being a person who has worked in the service industry... Service is SLOW! am not one of the &#34;in&#34; crowd so sometimes when I visit I wait for a while to be asked if I want to order.

With seating both indoors and outdoors, I opted to belly up to the bar inside so I could watch the sandwiches being created in the open kitchen.The service was attentive but relaxed. You are at liberty to graze through a sandwich at your leisure.With 21 sandwiches on the menu, divided between cold and hot, it took some time to make a decision. While I was mulling over the sandwich list, I ordered cheese curds, which arrive with fried basil and some of the best homemade ranch dressing to have ever met my lips.Cold sandwiches include a chicken salad with fried chicken skin, chimichuri, and sour grape jam on wheat, a turkey with aioli and spinach and a spicy tofu with grilled avocado, pea shoots and hot sauce. The hot sandwiches include Wyler&#39;s version of a Philly cheesesteak with veal heart, a rib eye with onion rings, chimichurri, au jus on cocktail rye, and a reuben with buttered pickles in place of sauerkraut. The sandwiches range from $7 - $14 and come with a side of homemade chips or a side salad.There are several beers on tap to choose from, along with cocktails like old-fashioneds and wine.Wyler Road is very chill and relaxing. It&#39;s a place to come, sit, enjoy a drink and sandwich. And the sandwiches are good. I tried the reuben, one of my top 3 favorite sandwiches and despite the bread being buttered just a bit too much, I loved it.Go to Wyler and Sandwich, it&#39;s worth it."

In this case it might be the difference between &#34;good&#34; and &#34;great.&#34; Maybe I&#39;m being persnickety, but I think the drinks lacked a certain freshness and somehow watching someone dump a 9 dollar cocktail out of a spigot (opposed to a carefully handcrafted cocktail) leaves something to be desired.For an appetizer we got the potato balls which were sinfully good and should probably be illegal. For our main course, we ordered the Smoked Salmon and the Italian with Salt and Vinegar chips. The sandwiches were delicious, fresh, and awesome portion for price. Everything came out fresh and fast.The bartenders were super courteous, attentive, and made great recommendations. The space is clean, open, but still cozy and inviting. We went on a Sunday around nine p.m., so it was relaxing and not at all crowded.I realize the vibe is &#34;Sandwich Joint,&#34; but for a place with a full service bar, I think Wyler Road would benefit from adding some fresher/healthier alternatives and expanding the appetizer menu. The appetizers, by the way, are listed as &#34;sides&#34; which was kind of confusing.Overall, the place is doing what it&#39;s doing really well, but there&#39;s nothing super extraordinary about it. I don&#39;t really mean that negatively, because the next time I&#39;m looking for a relaxed lunch spot to have a sandwich and a beer, I&#39;m totally there."

I actually went to the frig to grab some mayo because I needed some flavor and I wasn&#39;t about to throw food away that cost me $10.

It lacked something, but I&#39;m not sure what. It tasted okay, but just needed something. It was kind of bland and tasteless.My wife shared a bite of her sandwich with me and it was nasty. When I think of etouffee, I think of spicy or cajun. This was more like a hoagie bread that had some mushroom, onions and gravy with melted cheese. Nothing etouffee or cajun about it. There were some tomatoes inside, but I swear they tasted canned.The watermelon drink was delicious, cold and strong.

Great bartender, great food.All around I loved it. The last two times however were horrible. Second time , I sat at the bar., this was during the week for lunch. There was one other person at the bar. The bartender was on her phone and really too bothered to even come give me a water. After about 6 minutes she finally came over. I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich because there was a great picture of it on Yelp. When it came out , there was barely one thin layer of salmon. ( The picture had about 3) When I asked about it she shrugged her shoulders and ignored me. When I pressed this issue she went in the back. Her response was&#34; the chef says salmon is really expensive right now&#34; Really? This was a $11 sandwich!. After complaining again the manager finally came over. He was really rude, didnt say he was sorry, didnt ask me if I wanted to try something else. Just said give him his money back and walked away!After being coaxed by a friend to try it again, I went back. Ordered the short rib sandwich and an Oberon beer. the $7 Oberon came out in a glass that i&#39;m sure wasn&#39;t even 12 ounces. I&#39;m guessing 8. Whatever. Then the sandwich came out. Half the $13 sandwich was fat. It was dry and fatty and disgusting. I had to dissect it and take the piles of fat out. Our waitress was very nice, but I will never go back and waste my money again.There are too many better places to go!"

On our first visit to Wyler Road, we were underwhelmed. Opening jitters, and all that. But I must honestly say that they&#39;ve improved greatly.Our second visit to Wyler Road (post &#39;reboot&#39;) was exceptional. The organization of the restaurant and staff have improved greatly. Service was exceptional. Elisa, our waitress, was easily one of the most attentive restaurant professionals we&#39;ve had the pleasure of meeting in quite some time. They&#39;ve also developed more of a &#39;team&#39; mentality where it seems as if everybody is helping each other out to serve, clear tables, etc. Whomever reorganized the front-of-house staff deserves major kudos for getting everybody on the same page and acting like a well-oiled machine.The cuisine has also improved since our first visit. The kitchen staff seems to have worked out their kinks well. Food came out quickly. We shared a bowl of the soup, cheese curds, and the &#39;Croque Madame&#39; sandwich which were all well executed, presented, and priced.One of the great things about Wyler Road is their selection of &#39;draft cocktails.&#39; This is to be expected given their ownership, but I&#39;ve found at other restaurants that these can be hit-or-miss. Here though all of the selections hit the spot. We finished with their signature &#39;boozy floats&#39;. If you still have room, these are a nice desert option.Wyler Road&#39;s chef, Forster Sorensen, came out to greet us. He is a credit to the profession. Humble, seeking constant improvement, and visionary: we believe that Forster is well on the way to making this a true destination experience with a casual, after-work, let-loose kinda vibe.Ever so close to a 5 star. Homemade chips that came with the excellent sandwich could have used a bit more time to make them crispier (still, they are very good). The dessert selection could use some work. And the opportunity to get even more &#39;Wisconsiny&#39; is most definitely there with perhaps some seasonal specials and smuggled New Glarus brewery selections for in-the-know regulars (hint, hint). These would tip the scale for me. Let&#39;s just call it 4 and 1/2. We are looking forward to going back, but you should go for the 1st time. You won&#39;t be disappointed."

For the most part I strictly stick with the smoked salmon sandwich, but the last time I was there I ordered the Clambelly sans bacon and it was magnificent. Their draft cocktails are delicious and very potent. My fiancé sticks to beef primarily and swears by the Reuben. I could probably eat here every weekend."

Now its over priced sandwiches. I went to Wyler Road for the first time last night. First off its like walking into an Ikea catalog. SOOO HIP. The music was loud and the lights were super bright. We were led to out table pretty quickly which is always a good thing. We were given WAY more than enough time to look over the menu. To be honest there were a lot of things that sounded amazing. My friends and i had a hard time deciding what to get. We chose to start with the cheese curds which were honestly pretty good. they were by far the best part of our meal.We ordered the Clam belly sandwich which honestly tasted like rancid fish. Nothing worse than balls of deep fried rubber that taste like old tuna salad. Huge disappointment. My friend was to shy to say they didn&#39;t like it so they got a box to go and even tried to leave it on the table. lol. it was so disgusting that we didn&#39;t even want to take it home. The rib eye was also a huge mess. The flavorless, doughy onion rings did nothing to help the gristle aka rib eye. I just can&#39;t imagine thinking its acceptable to charge those prices for that quality of food.I will admit they can make a decent drink. A little too sweet for my taste but i suppose it could have been worse.Tip: Avoid the spicy chips.Someone either has a heavy hand or you need to evaluate your premixed spice selection. There is no  way anyone likes those things they way they are. Greasy  potatoes covered in old bay? barf."

I was excited about this place as it&#39;s right by my house and looked like a good place to sit and do some work and drink a beer. It needs a lot of work, however, to be anything worth visiting again.We stopped in on Sunday for a sandwich and a beer. I ordered the cheese curds as I&#39;d heard they were really good--but they were out. Instead I got a grilled cheese: beer cheese, caramelized onion, and tomato. It sounded great, but the result was kind of disgusting. OK, really disgusting. It was like two pieces of warm, wet bread covered with Cheez Whiz that had been mixed with onions, with slices of cold tomato. The bread was warm and the filling was icy cold and watery. I think what they did was heat the bread and then pack it full of some sort of pre-mixed onion and cheese batter, then slap cold tomato on it...I don&#39;t think they actually heat the whole thing together (which is kind of what a grilled cheese IS, but okay) and it was pretty nasty. The bread was so soggy that it fell apart in the middle when I picked up half of the sandwich...a whole chunk of it just kind of slipped out of the middle of the slice and slapped the plate before I could take a bite. The bite I did take, from the frozen center of the sandwich that made a Hot Pocket look like fine dining, was so unsatisfying I gave up entirely and just ate the salad it came with.Two stars because he ordered a Reuben and it was really good. Pretty good beer list, and nice atmosphere. However, it seemed a bit smoky in there, and about an hour after we left I realized that we both smelled really strongly of fryer, like we&#39;d just worked a shift a McDonald&#39;s. So yeah, hanging out with my computer doing work is out, because I don&#39;t want to have to shower again after I leave. Two stars because I think if you can find a spot on the patio in the fresh air, and only order a salad and a beer, you&#39;ll probably be ok. I&#39;m going to wait a while for them to get the food and the exhaust fans worked out, and I&#39;ll try again, because it would really be too bad to have lost the Brown Sack and for its replacement to be just a big slice of wet bread."

The interior is warm and understated, with subdued colors, soft lighting, and a long bar to cozy up to. They have hot and cold sandwich offerings and some excellent beer selections.

The sandwich porn they posted with the review really wowed me, so I immediately posted a link to the facebook profile of my friend Katt, and she was all about it. Later at night I showed it to my pal Nicholas, and he was all about it as well. So, I wrangled the group together, and we made plans to visit on Saturday afternoon.On Saturday, we left Katt&#39;s house at about 2pm, picked Nicholas up from his block, and made the trip from Bridgeport up to Logan Square. We ended up parking over in front of my ex-girlfriend&#39;s ex-apartment, and walked over to the restaurant. Upon entering, we saw many tables, a large bar, and a few people of varying ages were eating. We were offered a table, but then Nicholas had the idea to sit at the bar. So, we all went to the bar, sat down, and were handed menus. All three of us immediately began going over the drinks, and made our first round selections. Katt ordered an Old Fashioned, I ordered a Bourbon Mule, and Nicholas ordered a Manhattan. When the drinks arrived, we all had a sip, passed them around each other, shared our opinions, and quickly began drinking our own drinks. All three drinks were both tasty, with an adequate amount of alcohol for our south side bodies.Following that, we ordered our sandwiches. I ordered the Rib Eye sandwich, Katt ordered the BLT (off menu), and Nicholas ordered the short rib sandwich. Each of us were given the option of salad or chips. Nicholas and I went with salt &amp; pepper chips, Katt went with the spicy chips. We also ordered a set of cheese curds.The cheese curds were the first to come out. I have never been fond of the term &#34;chese curd&#34;, but Katt convinced me to try them. I tried one, and was pleasantly surprised by how tasty it was. Following that, I ate many more, as did Nicholas and Katt. The real highlight of the cheese curds was the dipping sauce they make. I believe it was home made ranch. I&#39;ve been turned off by home made ranch in the past, mainly the homemade ranch of Skylark, as it&#39;s way too watery. The ranch of Wyler Road however was pretty much fuckin&#39; perfect.A little while later, the sandwiches came out. My rib eye sandwich had a big ass stack of onion rings topping the meat, a standard hamburger-style bun, and an inch or two of rib meat at the bottom. I had to pick off some of the onion rings, because the sandwich was a little too tall to fit into my mouth. I left a few onion rings on there to get the full effect of the sandwich. Looking to my right, Katt&#39;s sandwich looked fuckin&#39; incredible. It had an egg on top of the sandwich, followed by this amazing mess of meat, cheese, and seasonings. Katt passed me her sandwich and I took a bite, then I passed it to Nicholas and he took a bite, and then I passed the sandwich back to Katt. Nicholas then passed me his sandwich, and I took a bite of that, and then Katt had a bite of his sandwich. I then started eating my sandwich before realizing that I hadn&#39;t offered any sandwich to either of them. So, I passed the sandwich over to Katt who took a bite, and Nicholas took a bite of my sandwich as well.All three sandwiches were fuckin&#39; amazing. I would have to say that Katt&#39;s blt was the best of them all, but that&#39;s kind of like ranking angels. We all plowed through all of our sandwiches &amp; drinks, and were then ready for more booze.I ended up ordering a boozeed up rootbeer float, Katt ordered this double rum drink, and Nicholas ordered a can of his favorite beer - Coors. I got my drink, and I was a little surprised by how big &amp; extravagant it was. This time around, we didn&#39;t share our drinks. I don&#39;t know why, we just didn&#39;t. I also had decided that I couldn&#39;t just eat one sandwich while I was here. So, I ordered a grilled cheese.The grilled cheese was amazing looking. It had 3 pieces of toast, with the top layer being both bacon &amp; I think cheddar, and the bottom layer being muenster. Thankfully, they had cut it in half, as I was already starting to feel a little full. However, because I am an addict I decided to try powering through it. The sandwich was amazingly good. While it was difficult to get it into my body, the taste was just too good to pass up. I managed to get about 90% of it into my body before I had to stop. I was just too full.Katt and Nicholas had returned during my attempt at eating the grilled cheese sandwich. Katt finished her drink, and had ordered a coors herself. Nicholas was still finishing his. I wanted to order a coors so I could drink more, but we had already closed out our bill. For the three of us eating a total of 4 sandwiches, 1 appetizer, 4 cocktails, and 2 beers, the total came out to about $100. Reading wyler road&#39;s facebook page, it seems that they have regular drink specials. We&#39;re gonna have to come back in a week or two to enjoy some more cost-effective dining, however I will say that wyler road is completely worth the money we paid that day."

This is my third time here and the first two were pretty decent, so I figured I would be in for a bit of a disappointment.It&#39;s a pretty small dining area, but they do try to squeeze in as many tables as they can so be prepared to wiggle around especially when it is packed.We ordered our usual fare of dishes from seafood (clams, oysters, and lobster), meat dishes(chicken and beef), and a variety of vegetables.Our first dish that came out was the clams and it seemed like they made 2 of those dishes at once and split them for us and another table and it looked like the other table was the winner in that one.  Other than that the food came out quick the rice was alright but not as good as some other resturants.  The bill came out at a pretty reasonable price as well. The 3.5 stars really was for dishes being smaller than I had remembered and the long wait we had even though we had reservations.I would come back though for some decent fare."

The only problem I had was that when we called to reserve for 14 guest they try to squeeze all of us in one round table. They eventually gave us an extra table which was odd bc it was square table with a round table. SIGH, this is how it is in Chinatown. Customer service is weird.Anyhow, we ordered the Dinner set for family of ten included 2 lobsters, whole crispy chicken and I love the Pi Pa Tofu. It also included a whole sole fish, and we also added dishes to the meal. We had beef chow fun noodles, beef and Chinese broccoli and we also ate chicken with bitter melon so much food! Their crispy chicken was excellent very juicy beautifully done. We had three rice casserole dishes and it was really delicious. I wish they had more room for bigger 14 people.

I get it with the cilantro/jalapeño/soy oil that they give with other seafood dishes. The soy sauce here is especially good because they make it themselves. It&#39;s not too salty and has a bit of sweetness to it.Long ago they had a late night menu where dishes could be ordered in a smaller size for a special price. This was before the renovations and new decor. However they now offer small and large sizes for most dishes and I prefer it this way because then I am not relegated to coming here only after 10pm lol.I have liked everything I ate here. The only reason for one less star is that when they are very busy and packed I feel the quality of the food goes down a bit.

We had to wait about half an hour to get seated so next time we will definitely make a reservation since this place gets packed at dinner time. We put in our order for the pork and salted fish casserole while we were waiting for a table so they could start that since it takes about 30 minutes to cook. We had the salt and pepper baby octopus, steamed scallops with ginger and vermicelli, double lobster special, and the eggplant casserole. Everything was delicious as usual. They also brought out a complimentary red bean tapioca soup at the end. A seafood dinner for a party of 4 for only 85 bucks. Awesome deal!"

The reason for four stars is not the food, it is the fact that our order was forgotten about for 40 minutes and waitress had to take our order again so we waited a long time for food and were not comped for that on the bill at all.All in all, decent prices and amazing food."

I&#39;ve been here twice. I really like the food. I can honestly say that it&#39;s very good food at super cheap prices. The place is really small (like sardines squished together type small) the cleanliness is fine. The service sucks. I feel for them because the food is so good that the place is forever packed.

We are frequent visitors at Golden Bull. The food is extremely delicious and have extremely great value. Their service is very good and tried to take care of every customer&#39;s needs. The only setback is that the output of food is a little too fast for me. They can slow it down for a little bit so i can catch up with the delights of their cooking. I highly encourage to come to this restaurant but it has some limited seating so you have to reserve early to get a seat. i definitely would come back.Some of my favorites are: Shrimp, Sweet and succulent; Sauteed Fish Fillet, experiencing the bones and the meat with completely different textures; Pea Sprouts with Garlic; literally melts in your mouth; and finally the Fried fish with salt and pepper; tender meat on the inside and crispy skin on the outside."

The Golden Bull Restaurant is a tiny, reasonably decorated place. The menu is quite expansive and does have a little but of everything. An appealing factor is that they have set menus for x-number of people, which is more than enough to share. A few qualms I have about the place is that there is only street/meter parking out. You can find additional parking in the lot by where the train tracks are. You have to ask for ice water. It&#39;s assumed you will have hot tea with your meal. Service of preparing the food is also slow, even though I know it is fresh and made to order, I would like some speediness to my food. If you are a traditionalist and are looking for the stone pot sticky rice, place that order as soon as you walk in because it takes 40 minutes to prep/cook this dish of deliciousness. If you want the hand shredded chicken, also place that order in the minute you walk in because they literally hand shred half a chicken for that dish and it will take 30 minutes to prep and season the dish. We had ordered the dinner for 3, which came with 3 beef &amp; barley soups to start, we decided with the beef with Chinese broccoli, stir fry lobster, and instead of the sweet and sour pork, we went with the spiced salt and pepper pork.Beef &amp; barley soup: clear beef broth, barley beans, carrots, and little chunks of beef. It wasn&#39;t overly salty, but had a delicate flavor to it.Beef with Chinese broccoli: Beef is pretty standard, wasn&#39;t overly impress with the quality of the meat or the flavoring of it. Did enjoy the heaping helping of leafy Chinese broccoli, and stem. We did pick out all of the veggies in this dish.Stir fry lobster: This was my favorite dish. The lobster was sweet, juicy, and tender.  A bit on the small side, but a solid piece of shellfish. The sauce that the lobster was cooked in was decadent in flavor. It was rich and creamy due to the fact that I think cornstarch was added as a thickener. The sauce had egg and pork in it. So if you&#39;re a non-pork eater, I would check with the server if they can make it without it, otherwise, it is just delicious and a must order. Just keep in mind that you have to work for your meal here.Spiced salt &amp; pepper pork: I love this dish. It&#39;s battered with lightly and seasoned very well. It is &#34;deep fried&#34; in the wok, and the meat is tender and juicy. They garnish this this with some sauteed jalapenos.Hand shredded chicken: We got this dish last. Like after we killed our first 3 dishes, this one came out last. We were already full. I&#39;m not sure if it was because I was full I would this dish to be overly salty in some parts, and under seasoned in other parts. But I think I will have to give this dish another chance the next time I visit.Taro &amp; tapioca dessert soup: Kind of bland and flavorless goop. I&#39;ve had this at other establishments and it was amazing. Here, not so much. Maybe it was an off day.Overall experience, food, service, cleanliness, etc is a 3 star. I wasn&#39;t WOW&#39;d the food was good, but just took way too long."

I read the top rated reviews and Golden Bull stood out for a few reasons: the traditional complementary hot tea and pork broth soup, the old style Chinatown exterior but modern interior, and of course, the food ratings.My wife and I are not &#34;foodies&#34; but we certainly appreciate variety and uniqueness. Definitely were not going to go to Chinatown and have Beef and Broccoli or Kung Pao Chicken...and wanted the kids to have an eating experience.Ordered five dishes and amazingly, one came out first (salt and pepper soft-shell crab) and then the other four came out.The crab was the best I&#39;ve ever had...crunchy and spicy. Even my wife who does not eat seafood tried it and said it was good. The kids of course loved it but might have been a bit hot for them with the jalapeno garnish.Then the Mandarin Pork Chops, French Steaks, Boneless Chicken with Black Mushroom casserole, and Farmer&#39;s Chicken arrived.The Farmer&#39;s Chicken is a cold dish....the meat of the chicken is shredded and left on top of the carcass. The seasoning was incredible...we noted vinegar and cilantro in the mix. My favorite.Mandarin Pork Chops were meaty in a sweet sour sauce. A bit tricky to pick up with chopsticks so you better be pretty good with them!French Steaks were cubes of steak with a honey sauce. My wife&#39;s favorite.The Chicken casserole was served in a pot with a medley of Chinese vegetables and was the kids&#39; favorite.There were so many other dishes I would have liked to try but just can&#39;t eat that much food!I&#39;d consider food for four and leftovers for $60 plus tip to be a bargain!We did find some free on street parking in the traditional area of the neighborhood and walked two blocks.About the only negative I can think of is no dessert menu...but we walked the area and found some bakeries that were open late afternoon and picked up a few treats."

The place was empty except for one person eating at a table (this should have been my first warning). There was no hostess, waiter, or any type of employee to be seen when i walked in. After nearly a minute of waiting, i got up to leave when the hostess/waitress finally emerged from the kitchen and noticed me.I ordered the crab rangoon and chicken chow mein. The rangoons were just ok - the wontons were very oily and the filling had virtually no crab flavor. They then brought me the wrong entree. After waiting for them to make me anther meal, i finally got the worst chow mein I&#39;ve ever had. It was awful. The noodles were stringy and crunchy and there was hardly any chicken to be found in the massive pile of uncooked noodles. The sauce lacked any distinct flavors other than salt. I couldn&#39;t eat more than a few bites before giving up even though I was very hungry. Very disappointing.Tl;dr inattentive service, messed up orders, terrible to ok food."

Our group of 5 got to choose our seats as we pulled together 2 tables to sit together. We got set up with some tea, but did have to ask for water. We also got recommended the farmers chicken dish, which we substituted for the tofu dish in the 6 dish special on the menu. This came with the ginger fried lobster, salt and pepper shrimp, shrimp and scallops stir-fry, whole steamed fish, and sweet and sour pork. Everything was pretty tasty. I think I could have done without the sweet and sour pork, but I really enjoyed the salt and pepper shrimp. All the meat and seafood items were cooked to the right temperature where it wasn&#39;t under or overcooked. The food was very flavorful without being overpowering or more on the salty side.

The dishes looked good but the Salt and Pepper Rib was dry and nothing but bones. We had two dishes of Twin Lobsters and one dish was fresh and the other was not. The Oysters were not big like they claimed to be. The bill came to a few dollars shy of $200. The owner offered to take 10% off if we paid cash.

This was almost a 4 star review but due to the poor management of kitchen orders they lost a star. We first tried to come to this restaurant without a reservation, big mistake. This place is booked up and small so if you walk up you will be turned away. We made reservations for the following week during the saturday before Mother&#39;s day. People love this restaurant because the prices are low and you get a lot of dishes for the pre-fixe menu. We ordered the 10 person meal which includedPork bone soup with veggies- not filled very well, soup was good and clearJalapeno fried shrimp- rather small dish, I guess that is why the prices are so low. Otherwise cooked well with the perfect zingCold plate appetizer- another one that is puny in size and had a assortment of low end cold cuts i.e. pig ears instead of having the more expensive items such as roast duck or bbq pork. There was the traditional jelly fish, 1000 spice beef, and additional cut of porkTwin lobster- cooked perfectly, no complaintsFried seafood/shrimp balls- not sure what was inside but it was tasty with the sweet and sour sauceChicken slices with broccoli- cooked well, the chicken was tender but marinated with corn starchVeggies- chinese broccoli, fresh nothing wrong with this dish with oyster sauce overSteamed flounder- I use to love this fish, but now i prefer meatier white fish. This was fresh, lots of roe in the fish thoughSweet and sour pork- cooked well, not overdoneSeafood medley- cheap with a few scattered scallops, veggies and etc. Goes wellCrispy chicken and shrimp chips- not sure how they cook this so well. This has been raved about by tourist from HK. I think this made up for some of the weaker dish.All this for about 130 dollar. So the negatives, mainly the way our meal was served. Somehow no one understands the concept of bringing out the appetizer dish first and phasing the other dishes. Instead everything came at once. By the time I was eating the lobster it was cold and wasted. We told the serve to slow down the pace but the food just kept on coming. This is becoming more and more of a problem going out to eat in chinatown. How can you enjoy your meal when there is not even enough room on the table for the food. 2 thumbs down for your mismanagement. Otw some of the dishes had there own flaw, but for 130 dollars to feed 10 people you can&#39;t go wrong I guess.Pro- lower cost, amazing chicken dish, lobster!Con- terrible management of dinner orders, if you don&#39;t have reservation they will send you awayHidden deal- Pre-fixe family dinner menu is the best bargain!"

The Hong Sue tofu included shiitake and overcooked napa, and was fairly bland. I did appreciate that they had small and large options for almost everything on the menu, and found that the small version of my tofu dish was just right.My partner loved the beef tongue, but thought the portion was small for the price.

Most places such as Triple Crown, Three Happiness, Lee Wing Wah,  and many more are dastardly dirty and such a discouragement to return to even though the food is delicious. Golden Bull however trumps them on food at even more affordable prices and are not skimping out at all on taste.The staff is RESPECTFUL AND COURTEOUS. I cannot stress how grateful and true this statement is. Attending most Chinese restaurants in the Chinatown area, the waiting staff is not fluent in English and get heavily flustered and visibly annoyed when the patrons ask for requests (more napkins, x-amount of cups of ice water all around, forks and knives please, etc.)This place is attentive to everyones needs and graciously accommodates.FOOD:- affordably priced!!!-never lacking in flavor- HUGE PORTIONS (enough to feed 3-4 ppl comfortably)- AUTHENTICI was so impressed with the food. I was expecting to see either really Americanized &#34;Chinese&#34; food and food that was just slopped together, but presentation (which is rare in Chinese restaurants) and taste were definitely met.The chef accidentally misprepared one of our dishes and after bringing it up with management, they were sincerely apologetic and re-prepared the dish and also removed it from our bill! TALK ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE. They truly know how to take care of customers (especially since we were a party of 10 ordering over 10 dishes)Overall, I will be going here again and await my next return."

Tried a variety of dishes (Beef Kow, Sweet &amp; Sour Pork and Combo Fried Rice) which were pretty unexciting, though very fresh tasting.  I would only grade it as passable.  Maybe we should have ordered some seafood items, as most of what was being served at the surrounding tables was crab, shrimp, oysters, and the like- and it all looked very good. Sometimes it just goes that way.  I may stop by again and try something more &#34;exciting&#34;.  The Americanized Chinese choices were only average."

It was crispy but it lacked the tang from the vinegar. I thought I was eating crispy candy. The pork was partly fat and I was pretty displeased by it. The lamb stew casserole that also included some parsley and beancurd lacked the lamb taste. I tasted the oyster sauce that it was made with more than the lamb flavor. The bowl of rice I had the texture of leftover because it was dried, which made it hard. I didn&#39;t finish the food.food: 2 they preserved the crispiness of the pork chops but it lacked the slightly sour flavor. Lamb had no lamb flavor.Atmosphere: typical restaurant with booths and tables. Pretty quiet but was loud when there are toddlers around. The toddlers kept kicking the booth footing. 2Service: 4 waitress was nice, wore white dress shirt and black vest. She had strong body odor....Price: I honestly felt the food tasted pretty bad for what I was charged. The pork was a good 10 dollars while the lamb casserole was 12 dollars. Prices are average. 2Decor: 2 average restaurant with some paintings/ photo hanging around. For the table setting, booths did not have a covering and there were obvious signs of use from the stains. Chairs seemed pretty old. I guess it can contribute to the family feel? I love booth seats but was dismayed the back rest wobbled excessively.I don&#39;t think I will come back again. I came here since my friend recommended the mandarin pork chop that I have craved for, but I am quite disappointed."

The Chinese broccoli with chicken was butchered - over chopped and over cooked. The pork in Peking sauce is a cornerstone of Cantonese cuisine, yet Golden Bull&#39;s version totally massacred it - treated the dish like it was Sweet &amp; Sour Pork.

Golden Bull far exceeded our expectations!The atmosphere leaves you without much to look at, but with food like this, you won&#39;t feel like you&#39;re missing anything. Our server was a middle-aged Chinese woman with a friendly and attentive attitude. While we experienced a bit of a language barrier, it didn&#39;t keep us from ordering what we wanted.The meal started with amazing complementary tea! From there, we split a plate of veggie fried rice. We both agreed it was the best we remembered ever enjoying. Loaded with fresh veggies and fried and seasoned delicately, so as not to get crusty and salty. I ordered scallops with veggies -- definitely the best sea scallops I&#39;ve ever had for $6.99. Tender, plump, and so fresh tasting...melt in your mouth seafood here, people. The garlic sauce complemented the dish so well. I can almost still taste it 4 days later (yes, I have brushed). My fiancee ordered tofu with veggies. The tofu was prepared better than I&#39;ve seen at most places. Tender and creamy, with a crunchy exterior. Best of all, it was some of the freshest tasting tofu I&#39;ve ever had!In terms of food quality, Golden Bull was outstanding. And this meal was $18 + tip!

Been here forever and we&#39;ve never dropped in...just was never on the radar.Was a little nervous this morning when we dropped in for lunch on Saturday at about 12:30 p.m. and the place was empty (we almost thought it was closed). But we took the leap and had a great meal.Place seems very freshly renovated with new furnishings, though one might say it still looks some what plain in a grey/black/white color scheme (some chairs are yellow though!).So what did we get? We got a small portion of the surf clams with vermicelli and cilantro, the shredded farmer&#39;s chicken, chives with fish cake and dried tofu aiming off the top of their specials. All very good dishes (though I think we missed the tofu in the chives dish, but there was plenty of fish cake to compensate). They do provide flexibility in portion sizes (small, large, etc) - we went with the large for the chives dish and half chicken - so that gives you flexibility on budget and whether you want some leftovers for home (and a better deal).Thrown in, a house soup starter too, decent rice and tea. Experienced staff person handled everything at the front of the house though admittedly while we were there it was only two tables total (maybe this is more a dinner spot and everyone was somewhere hip - and less tasty - or having dim sum.)I&#39;m assuming because we were there for lunch that dessert soup wasn&#39;t offered. Validated parking really tops it off.Two &#34;large&#34; size entrees plus surf clams for two = $30 and taking home half of each of our entrees to boot."

The other 2 dishes were big disappointments.  I ordered the Schezwan chicken because I like spicy food.  The dish was not spicy at all and the chicken was really slimy.  It didn&#39;t taste too bad.  The worst dish was the seafood chow mein.  It was really heavy and the flavors not all that great.  Good thing it was all really cheap.The inside definitely reminds me of most of the Chinese restaurants I&#39;ve been to with the same decorations.  The walls seem to ooze the same familiar scent (which I didn&#39;t mind).  The tables and chairs looks like they have been there for 20 years but they were still very solid.  It was pretty clean inside and quite when we went."

I discovered this place thanks to some work colleagues of mine I thought their subs looked so good I just had to sneak a peak of where they got them. I&#39;m so glad they left their subs in the fridge so I could find out where they got them from. After trying to figure out when I was going to get over there to taste a sub I finally got an opportunity to go during my lunch break today. I couldn&#39;t decide between the vinny and the Italian. I asked the lady at the counter and she recommended the vinny. So glad I went with her suggestion. The sun was so fresh and full of flavor. The sesame seed bun kind of scared me but it made the sandwich unique and added another layer of flavor. Will definitely recommend this place to my office for catered lunches.

The taste was absolutely perfect with just the right amount of seasoning to them. Had me wishing for more for days.

They&#39;ve got fresh Damatos bread slightly underbaked for the better, perfectly cured meats, spicy Giardiniera, and fresh fixens that put the finishing one of the most simple savory sandwiches.Try the Italian with a side of potato salad, talk to Darlene, and I defy you to not be in love with this place."

I have been driving by Vinnie&#39;s for years and stopping by Bari&#39;s for all my sandwiches. I won&#39;t be driving by much any longer. From the moment you walk in, you get that unique neighborhood treatment that immediately created a bind between homely local joint and dedicated loyal customer.  Treatment that to be honest is not part if the Bari experience at all. The lady running the place could not have been nicer. It&#39;s &#34;hon&#34; this, hon that from when you walk in to when you leave. I felt like I was buying a sandwich from my favorite Aunt&#39;s sandwich shop. She explains the menu perfectly, in detail and in a way that really helps. They cater and deliver. I got the Vinnie&#39;s Special and it was humongous, loaded, fresh,delicious. Had the sandwich been have as good as it was, I still would have been going back because how well I was treated there but the truth is, the food matches the 5 start treatment. I cannot recommend Vinnie&#39;s enough and it&#39;s why I took the time to write this. This is the type of place we as customers need to frequent and support to help keep these special local neighborhood joints in business for as long as possible. Especially when this food service so thoroughly deserve it!"

The owners seem to take a lot of pride in the place, and it shows.

The bread is so good that even pro-choice and pro-life advocates could agree on it. The selection of meat and cheeses are what I&#39;ve grown to love about this classic sandwich. Pungent Provolone cheese and my favorite varietals of Italian cold cuts.I should have been more adventurous with my veggie toppings, but I thought it best to stick with their version for my first time. Which consists of traditional lettuce, tomato, onion, and girdinara (if requested). But they didn&#39;t give me that eye opening enjoyment I usually get from these sammy&#39;s.  They had things like eggplant (roasted or spreadable?), olives, roasted red peppers, artichokes, pesto mayo, and sun dried tomato. Defiantly recommend loading your sandwich up with all of this instead of what they do, maybe skip olives for some girdinara. DAMN! NOW I WANNA GO BACK!Great chip selection, daily specials, good looking soup (from eyeballing a friends), all backed up with quick, efficent, and motherly service make Vinnies a definite sandwich lover must."

I also added in some roasted red peppers to it mostly because roasted red peppers are awesome. It probably took barely around 5-6 minutes for me to get my sub after placing the order. It came faster than I even expected.The sandwich itself was spot on and really good. I know its not hard to do a good roast beef+cheddar, but this was really damn good from first bite.

The french bread is light and airy rather than dense and hearty, which I was fine with but my dining companion found unsatisfactory. We split the 12&#34; vinnie&#39;s special which was obviously plenty for two people. I really like krakus ham and between that and the bread, it really brought back memories of childhood. I thought their oil and hot peppers were excellent, and the lettuce and tomato were quite good.

The continental was just your basics - two eggs, two sausages, potatoes, and your choice of bread (he went with pretzel). The pretzel bread was good.

We went to Cafe Vienna for breakfast on Sunday morning. It is a very small place but the menu looked good, and thankfully we only had to wait a few minutes. It took another 20 minutes for the waitress to come, but it was busy so we let it slide. I ordered the continental, which is basically just eggs and toast with a side. Pretty basic. My boyfriend ordered the raspberry crepes, which also came with toast. They brought our toast out 5 minutes later. We then sat and waited for our food. At least 3 parties came in after us with 2 or more people, and they were all served before us. Finally, after about 30 minutes, our food came out. The waitress set my plate on the table and there was a giant oiled-up ball of paper sitting on my plate. When I showed this to the waitress, she did not seem to care at all and just took the plate. No, I&#39;m Sorry, or anything of the sort. 5 minutes later, my plate came out. I asked them to remake the eggs, because who knows what else got stuck in my food if they missed a giant wad of paper. I was surprised it only took 5 minutes and was sure it wasn&#39;t remade because it was no cold. I asked the waitress about this, to which she responded, &#34;well I don&#39;t know what you want me to do. The kitchen said they remade it. I can maybe get you a discount.&#34; Clearly she did not want to help me at all. And a discount! I was LIVID. And still, not one shred of apology or remorse for the disgusting issue from earlier! I told her I was not paying for this food and they it needed to be taken off the bill.Aside from all this, my boyfriend&#39;s crepes were awful. they were hard and cold and the raspberry was basically the same jam you get from those little packets on every table.So she takes the bill and I see her at the register literally staring and pointing at me while discussing something with someone, who I can only assume was the manager. Did the manager come and apologize or say ANYTHING to me about that wad of paper? NO.It took another 20 minutes to get our bill...and another 20 after that for her to run our card. Of course by this time everyone who had come in about 30 minutes after us was already leaving.I have never been so disgusted or insulted in my life. I will NEVER go here again."

I wish I saved room for it, but will definitely come back.Since I wanted something savory and filling I went for what seemed popular at this spot, breakfast sandwich!

In theory having German/Austrian classic is a nice variation on the normal brunch offering. The first time I had the white sausage with the large pretzel and I was very happy the dish. The second time, I had pancakes which were actually excellent. Other times I&#39;ve taken out croissants and cakes which were definitely subpar. The croissant was meh but the Black Forest cake was downright bad. I&#39;m pretty sure they used fake whipped cream and the sponge was flavorless.Both times I ate in, the service was poor. I can forgive getting mixed up and being slow or not being cheerful but all 3 at the same time makes for an unpleasant experience.

The cranberry bread I took home was a hit at the office in the burbs the next day and I wish I&#39;d bought another loaf!If you live in the area or are just passing by, this is definitely a place to put on your list of places to go to."

It is an Austrian cafe that sells every kind of breakfast item imaginable. From Eggs Benedict to Crepes to homemade soups to Schnitzel...they have it all! What I love about this place is how fresh and homemade everything is. Their potato soup knocked my socks off! The hot chocolate is also a MUST. They also serve their own freshly squeezed orange juice. Be sure to pick up some pastries and bread to-go before you leave, too!With this place, you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re in the big city. It gives the area a small-town feel. I love it. The restaurant itself is on the smaller side, but it&#39;s still very cozy and warm inside. I flock to this place when the weather is bad and I don&#39;t want to walk very far. Great location and great food! Do yourself a favor and come here for breakfast!"

I certainly had never until i came across the glorious discovery at Cafe Vienna. The pretzel croissant has the soft texture of a croissant but the exterior is dark brown like a pretzel. You can choose however many items from a selection of veggies, eggs, cheese, and meat to put into the croissant. To top it off, the combo comes with a coffee (free refills), all for ONLY $7.99. It&#39;s a great portion. Where else can you find a deal like that in the city? They have outdoor seating, but there were only 3 tables. The inside is kinda cramped, but people eat quickly so the wait isn&#39;t too long. Bf got the Fiesta Skillet, also super delish. We tried the apple pie, but it was nothing special. Too many apples and not enough crust. I&#39;m all about the crust! It normally comes with vanilla ice-cream, but they ran out....and substituted with whip cream, like that&#39;s not going to make a difference...Warning: no bathroom, but they were super nice to let me use their kitchen sink to wash my greasy hands. Greasy hands is a major pet peeve of mine...so that really made my day by not having to look for a bathroom at another place. THANK YOU, Cafe Vienna! Brownie points for being considerate to your customers."

The place is quite small and was packed, understandably, when my friends and I walked in. However, we got a table in less than 10 minutes. I ordered the croissant sandwich (with the pretzel croissant) which was GINORMOUS. You get to pick four additions to the scrambled eggs, and for the price of this dish, it was so worth it. Our waiter offered us a tea since I opted to not have any coffee. You probably have never had butter truffle tea, but omg it was perfect. You&#39;d think it&#39;d be a strange savory/salty taste, but actually it was incredibly aromatic. Service was fine and friendly.

Very light and lots of berries. I wasnt the biggest fan of the chorizo but it would have been perfect for winter. They also have a really good sunflower seed bread- i might go back just for that.the ambience is nice, very like a cafe with dark wood furniture. You can be sure to meet a more international crowd here, I heard a couple of new languages as I was waiting to be served. There was a lot of space available, they do have outside seating as well, so you wont be waiting in line. I might come back to try dessert.

I will say, we were really tired and really hungry. We stopped at one place and left after waiting 20 minutes because we didn&#39;t get seated. We went to Cafe Vienna as it wasn&#39;t so busy. We were sat pretty quickly but it was 15 minutes before getting coffee and another 20 minutes before getting the food. I actually raised my hand like a school boy to get service for more coffee.A couple next to us had ordered there food ahead of time for takeout but then at in the restaurant. That was smart!

Gotta say though, a little disappointed.Came by with my husband on a Saturday at 930a and was easily able to get a table in the small restaurant (by 945a the seats were gone). Wanted to try the croissant sandwich, so chose some veggies and cheese on the butter croissant and got it with coffee for $8 (my husband did the same but tried the pretzel croissant).While the butter croissant was large and fairly fluffy, the eggs were so greasy it was very unappetizing. I wanted it to be healthier, thinking this is a Vienna-like café, but instead the food still tasted very American diner-ish.I&#39;d like to try some of their breads or bakery items at some point, but the little gnats flying around make me question how clean this place is (as well as all the crumbs and food lying on the ground)."

Only to find out that our 2 hour dining experience was not worth the wait. First, we waited outside for 30 minutes (which I reassured our out of town friends it&#39;s &#34;definitely worth the wait&#34; after smelling the smells and confirming its solid Yelp status). Our party of four &#34;table&#34; was seated at 4 bar seats that faced outside. We figured &#34;we&#39;re so hungry, it&#39;s fine. We will eat quick and head out.&#34; But no. We placed our order after taking about 10 minutes to decide. 25 minutes later, two of us received our toast. Because we were so hungry, we scarfed that down. 15 minutes later they said our food would be out in a few minutes. Then, 10 minutes later, they tried to give us our check. My friend naturally said &#34;the check?! We haven&#39;t even received our food!&#34; 30 minutes after that we finally got our food. Once delivered, one of the servers said &#34;make sure to save room for dessert!&#34; Which we hopefully were thinking &#34;maybe they&#39;ll comp dessert based on the poor experience/customer service. That&#39;d be nice.&#34; Nope. One meal was supposed to be served with coffee, that never happened. One meal was supposed to be served with a bag of chips. After asking twice for the bag of chips, it arrived after we had all finalized our meals. Also, all the scrambled eggs were overlooked (browned and dry). The best part of it all was that they never apologized, acknowledged or comped any part of our meal, let alone offered any goodie for free. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING!! Never plan to go back."

I had never been but a friend suggested it (we usually go to my favorite S&amp; G Diner for breakfast and, for me, that is tough to beat). It was so disappointed. The toast came about 10 minutes before our eggs and so, of course, it was cold when our egg dishes arrived. My omelet was very big and looked nice but it was quite dry. And the potatoes I ordered extra crispy were not (but they were OK). I ended up eating only about half my omelet and potatoes and half a piece of quite boring - and cold -  rye toast. For $10, I expected more. Sorry. Back to S and G for me, always dependable and yummy!"

The fruit on top was fresh and the perfect compliment to the waffles.

And then I manage to devour whatever I order as my breakfast - because their food is also that good. My favorite is their Crossaint Sandwich, which you can get with your pick of ingredients. Not only is their croissant buttery and delicious; but they also give you what is basically a full omelette in the croissant. It&#39;s a lot of food, but it&#39;s so good, I usually eat the whole thing.  Their pastries are also on point. Again, taste of Europe - with their tiramisu, napoleon cake, black forest, and thier struedels.I love this place and always will."

I got the Construction which was composed of two eggs, 2 pancakes, potatoes, and sausage. I tried the toasted cranberry walnut bread and I was impress very tasty! Not to sweet and perfectly toasted.  I didn&#39;t really enjoy the pancakes I only ate half of them. They tasted heavy with a cakeish flavor. I didn&#39;t really care for them. The French Toast was good quiet enjoyable and not soggy.  Potatoes were very fresh. As for the apple pork sausage it was okay. This is a small neighborhood cafe. Nice little mom and pops restaurant. The pastries did look amazing, but I didn&#39;t have space in my belly to devour any. I do feel the menu is very long it does make me wonder how fresh the ingredients are. Looking straight to the corner a couple of feet away from my table i could see all the dirty dishes. This is something I did not like. In addition, the fridge was close to the dirty bins and the floor seemed dirty from my view. I understand that they probably don&#39;t have enough space, but they should consider moving the dirty bins out of sight. The tables seem very worn out and wobbly. Overall, if I was around the neighborhood I would go again and give the dessert a sweet bite."

There was already a line when I arrived and unlike most places where they take your name, you line up and then take the next open table. Thankfully after a few minutes, we were asked if we would like to sit outside which ended our wait. The weather was still nice enough for that.Tons of options for brunch on the menu. In addition to eggs, pancakes, and sandwiches, they have a full line of pastries and coffees. Thank goodness I did not reach the counter or else I would have left with a few donuts. Ordered the Belgian Waffle with fresh fruit and it was excellent. Light, airy, and sweet (thanks for the berries and bananas), it was perfect and exactly what I wanted. Had a fresh squeezed orange juice with it and it tasted just like they picked the oranges off a tree in the back.Only four stars because it felt like at times that we were forgotten outside. Server was very nice but a tad slow. I&#39;d still definitely go back."

There is a nice place to sit outside and they have great people watching seats inside. Perfect European-style pastries. I&#39;m raving so much about these because Americans get this particular style of pastries wrong or &#34;normal&#34; bakeries do not sell them. Just like central Europe! Yum!"

The first time, was to pick up pastries to-go. Their pastries are amazing and very inexpensive. I picked up four different things for about $8. The second time, was dine-in breakfast. We went on a Sunday at 10am so the brunch rush had started. We waited about 15minutes for a table of two. However, the pastry and dessert box provided us with plenty to look at to pass the time. I had the croissant breakfast sandwich special and it did not disappoint. They offer a pretzel croissant which is flaky but holds up better than they average croissant. For $7.99 I was able to get enough food for two meals and a hot tea (which are all loose leaf). My only complaint was the service. The restaurant was very busy and it seemed that they did not have enough servers for a Sunday morning. We waited a while for our refills on our beverages and while the waitress was nice, she handed us the checks for three different groups sitting at the bar and asked us to divvy them up to everyone. The food is great but expect to wait a bit on a busy weekend."

I usually get cheese, onions, spinach, and green peppers.  It basically ends up being kind of like an omelette that they put between two sides of a buttery, flakey, amazing croissant.

I got the fiesta skillet, and that was really tasty. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised to see sriracha hot sauce here as opposed to chulula or tobasco sauce. The raspberry packzi was delicious. I would definitely save room for sweets here. I love that there is so many options from the menu, but at the same time so hard to decide on what to choose from. I believe they are known for their croissant breakfast sandwich where it gets filled with eggs, meats and veggies of your choice along with a side of potatoes. I want to come back and try this.

You sit yourself and hope someone notices that you are sitting at a table. If not then you will not get served. I&#39;ve left several times after not receiving any service. When you do receive service, I suggest you ask for everything all at once, then when the food shows up ask for the bill. If not, you will be forgotten. This place really needs a better system for service. The bus boy does more of the wait service than the actual waiter/waitress! I mostly give him the tip since he&#39;s awesome.Good luck."

They make their own bread, and how many places these days actually do that. The bread is phenomenal, and the carrot spread they give with it is a perfect balance of sweet, creamy, and crunchy.Everything I have eaten has been delicious. Lentil soup I great on a cold day. Chicken doner sandwich has huge chunks of tender juicy chicken that has been roasting for probably forever. The BEST thing is the pide. It&#39;s like a 100000 times better version of a pizza. Super thin crust and stuffed with lamb and cheese. A must try."

There&#39;s a lot of love, talent, and years of experience in this food. The ingredients are fresh, the spices are a symphony without becoming overbearing. The homemade bread is so good, you will feel a profound pity for the gluten-intolerant.Be adventurous with the menu, I&#39;m still working my way through it, and with each experience I become more of a believer. The service and hospitality of the staff is really warm, and it&#39;s a place you feel comfortable and attended to - not rushed in and out. Turkish people take meals leisurely.The doner is amazing. For those unfamiliar it&#39;s a Turkish gyro. If you like meat, if you on a paleo diet, if you wanna avoid carbs, this place has lots of great options if you can avoid that bread."

I ordered Zizi&#39;s favorite wrap and the portion size is quite tremendous. While it was satisfying and I liked the meat, it fell quite short of what I had in Turkey (look up Durumzade - a shrine should be made for that restaurant). It was savory but I wished there was more vegetables and flavor inside the wrap.The fries are average and could have used more seasoning.Still, it&#39;s a nice environment and it would be a great place for a quick lunch.

The chicken was spiced tastily in the wraps, and the chicken salad was okay.  It was just spring mix from Kroger, nothing special.  But they did cook the chicken when we placed our order.It appears to be a neighborhood favorite place, there were a lot of post-exercise young moms having lunch here."

The bread is also remarkable and is the best tool for soaking up the delicious carrot spread.I have had the chicken kebab, chicken doner kebab, the kofte wrap--all meals that I would definitely order again. The portions are hearty and the food is always super flavorful! I really loved the fresh french fries and the seasoned bulgur!The prices are affordable and the restaurant is BYOB.

Complimentary carrot appetizer and homemade bread. The carrot dish is a cold shaved carrot salad with non-acidic dressing. I couldn&#39;t figure out what the carrot dish was but it was great especially when eaten with the bread. I ordered Zizi&#39;s kale salad with a side of chicken. The salad was made up of chopped kale, garbanzo beans, pickled beets and portobello mushroom and tossed in a red wine vinaigrette. The salad was fresh and crisp and the chicken had a ton of flavor. My only complaint was the dressing was a tad too acidic for me. Nonetheless I finished the entire salad. My friends ordered a variety of dishes and they all enjoyed their dishes and complimented the taste and flavor.Overall, nice place for casual meal and to catchup with friends. The entire meal took nearly two hours and we never felt rushed. We had about 7 people in our party and even though they couldn&#39;t provide individual checks they allowed us to pay individually at the register.

I&#39;ll bring others with me so I can try other things on the menu, particularly the lahmacun. But really is the doner on that wonderful bread that lures me back. Lastly, the wait staff was attentive and really nice, and that&#39;s always a huge plus."

The storefront on Sheffield is unassuming but the restaurant is actually quite spacious and we were staffed by a kindly young woman who dealt with our indecision with good grace. We eventually got the starter combo platter - an impressive array of textures and flavors - and the Iskender platter which I was a little disappointed by - the lamb and beef was good but not as lively in either flavor or texture as I would have hoped for from something supposedly freshly grilled.

It&#39;s always available right when I walk in to pay and the salad is one of the best I&#39;ve had. The croutons are absolutely amazing, dunno if they&#39;re tossed with garlic, parmesan, or what, but they&#39;re superb. The caesar dressing is homemade and it&#39;s fantastic, definitely distinguishes itself from most other dressings.But the highlight - the chicken. Whoever thought of taking chicken doner and putting it on a caesar salad was a genius...a mad genius. It&#39;s superb. I could eat that chicken forever.I&#39;ve also had their kebab plates which were very good. Pretty much got the sample platter the first time that had all their meats  - the chicken, doner, meatball, kebabs, and even salmon. Everything was very good. Sizable portion as well so I took maybe 1/3 of it home. I&#39;d definitely get it again. Some of the doner was pretty greasy, but that&#39;s the only complaint and it&#39;s a minor one.The bread deserves a mention as well, not entirely sure what the bread is, it&#39;s like a pita but stuffed and more fluffy on the inside. It&#39;s great and the hummus they have pairs with it perfectly.Highly recommend Zizis"

The bread was also good.But fundamentally this is a grab-a-bite place (or a pickup-and-take-home place).

They happily accommodated my party of eight and also were happy to ring us up separately. Since the food is Turkish, the menu is a bit different that your standard Middle Eastern place. I love their Begendi (ask for it, because for some reason they don&#39;t call it that on the menu, though that&#39;s the way it&#39;s listed on GrubHub) - chicken or beef on a bed of eggplant dip, with Turkish bread. They also serve Pide, which is like a thin, flat calzone (although without the tomato sauce). The one with cheese and sucuk (a kind of hard sausage) tastes a lot like a pepperoni pizza. Cigar Borek, fried filo dough tubes filled with feta cheese, are also excellent.I&#39;m only giving them three stars, though, because they claimed that they could give me a decaf latte, and there was no way it could have been decaf, because I was wide awake ALL NIGHT! That really messes a person up, so only three stars for them. If you don&#39;t need to worry about caffeine, consider this a four-star review."

And I saw the owner greet many by name or personally greet newcomers. If you dine in you choose your own seats. We saw many people come in for pick-up.We were served this carrot dip with bread when we sat down. Not sure what was in it but it was not to our taste. The bread as other reviewers said was delicious.Food:Ordered the combo platterI would order this again loved trying all the different types of foods. We really enjoyed the ezme.FalafelI wouldn&#39;t order this again it was too mushy in the middle but did have a nice crunch.Chicken Döner KebabWe were undecided about the rice or couscous and our waitress was awesome and did half of each! :) The meat was a nice combo of white and dark meat and everything on the plate with it was cooked well and wasn&#39;t oily.Overall, we&#39;d eat here again as it wasn&#39;t busy, the staff was friendly and food was decent (and not oily). Points off for Falafel and bathrooms.Baklava with tea (highly recommend getting with tea to balance out the sweet baklava). Not as flaky as we&#39;d have liked but the honey flavor with the chocolate swirl on the plate was perfect."

I got the hummus and the doner platter with extra yogurt sauce and hot sauce. The hummus was really good! Kind of wish it came with more veggies so I&#39;ll order extra veggies next time! The doner platter was so good! The meat was tender and spiced well. It comes with a lot of rice and the bread that came with was HUGE. The bread was great, chewy and great to scoop up the meat as well as the hummus. The yogurt and hot sauce were my favorite part!The only complain I have is that I ordered too much food :) but i guess that balances out the price of everything.Additionally, the estimated delivery time was 45-60 minutes and it arrived within 20 minutes. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes mediterranean food. I also recommend the hot sauce. I love spicy food and i&#39;d say it was a medium spice level."

The service can be a little bit slower than you want sometimes. BUT, the food is worth it, very delicious, always fresh. I often get the feta salad with chicken and the chicken is seasoned and cooked perfectly. I&#39;d also recommend the carrot dip. The owners and staff are always super friendly. The owner has frequently given me little free extras such as a portion of flan or hot tea or the soup of the day. I think because he wants me to try new things. You can tell he cares about the business and the happiness of his customers. I highly recommend Zizi&#39;s for a casual lunch or dinner."

I thought I was coming for a simple lamb kebab and a bowl of rice. I walk out of here with an addiction and a complex.There were times when I couldn&#39;t even take bites, not because I was full but because I just wanted to stare at my food and think about everything it was doing to my life -- I needed answers.Each bite made me feel as if I were flying, riding the lamb kebab around like it was my little unicorn horse and the only thing that could unhorse me was another lamb kebab riding another lamb kebab, armed with a javelin made out of more lamb kebab. The ultimate jousting weapon.But what&#39;s this? The kebab plate comes with some kind of magic zucchini saucer? I need to eat this saucer? what if I just rode it to space instead, rode it through the night and maybe fought my other self atop those crazy lamb kebabs, bending time and reality to my rule like the puppet master i was born to be.As tempting as that sounds, just eating the saucer is even better than that. I don&#39;t need to fly anywhere unless that other planet is filled with these silly saucer. Maybe the planet could be made out of them, maybe then space travel would be worth the investment.The bread comes out strong and thick, like a clay discus. It&#39;s fitting because I often think of myself as an olympic athlete, one specializing in joust. The bread goes well with the rice, the meat, the vegetables, the yogurt sauce...but most of all, the bread goes well with my face. Yeah, that&#39;s right. Yogurt sauce covered bread is tasty, but it&#39;s even tastier if it goes directly into my face. No questions asked, yet all answers given.I&#39;ve been up for hours just thinking about it. I don&#39;t want to sleep, if I try to sleep I might realize that I was already asleep and that this whole meal was a dream, which would make more sense than it actually being real......all for less than $20."

We ordered delivery and our food seemed to come so fast, within 30 minutes which is great for a Saturday night.We started with the lahmacun. We loved the spices on it. Then we got the kofte platter and chicken doner kabab to split, one with rice and one with couscous. The kofte were fantastic! The flavor was spot on and reminded me of my grandmas kefte. The couscous was very tasty with an almost sweet tomato taste and small zucchini slices. I kept going back for more. We both really enjoyed the chicken. It had a great crispy flavor and paired great with the rice. The vegetables on the side were also wonderful. Zucchini, potatoes, sweet potatoes and tomatoes. They were so tender and very flavorful!Everything was wonderful and we will definitely order again/venture in to the actual restaurant. So excited about this great find!!"

It&#39;s an unassuming, family-run hole in the wall serving up extremely flavorful food that reminds me of döner places I stumbled upon during a short stay in Munich.First off, the complimentary bread has been served warm, fluffy, and pleasantly crunchy on the outside every time. Typically I&#39;m not one to fill up on bread baskets, but Zizi&#39;s makes that very hard, it&#39;s terrific.Smoked eggplant salad ($7) was indeed very smoky, and the silky texture made it perfect with the bread.Carrot spread ($4.75), which Zizi sometimes serves us on the house, is packed with garlic and yogurt, pretty addictive with the warm bread as well.Lahmajun ($4.50) flatbread was large and filling, with just enough lemon flavor, the ground beef was very strongly seasoned.Lamb adana ($15) was extremely flavorful with a big hit of cumin and pepper flavor. Mild couscous and yogurt are a great choice for the strong flavors of the lamb.Iskender ($16) is one of my favorite plates of food in Chicago, and is really the dish that made Zizi&#39;s a 5-star for me. It&#39;s heaps of shaved döner sitting on an equally huge amount of their amazing bread, cut up into chunks. The slightly sweet and spicy tomato sauce and yogurt/walnut butter mix on the side are refreshing for the heaviness of the dish. It&#39;s enormous, but I finish it every time.On our visits dining in, Zizi and one waitress were pretty much taking care of the entire restaurant. They were working very hard, but when it gets busy, service may not be the most attentive.I&#39;d keep coming back to Zizi&#39;s just for the iskender, but the other things I&#39;ve tried more than merit a visit as well. It&#39;s incredibly well priced and tops the places I tried in Munich as well as a lot of döner shops I experienced in Istanbul."

It&#39;s always good to get the opinion of someone from the heartland of the cuisine, I always say. She said she liked eggplant; so she would choose the Bosphorus platter: grilled meatballs and eggplant ratatouille baked in the oven with mozzarella on top. Mama would be proud that I ate the ratatouille, given that her ratatouille and her hard-earned, meticulous Julia Child masterpieces were wasted on me when I was young.Turns out that the server was Russian; so her recommendation came from a much different ethnic heritage. More fool me. Nevertheless, the dish was delectable: well-seasoned beef, delicious eggplant, and an un-American amount of cheese--just enough, without turning it into an extra-cheese thin crust pizza.The decor looks a little like a cross between a sandwich/gyro place and a cozy restaurant. I like being able to see the kitchen where they&#39;re cooking, but it looks a bit like a take-out counter. The dining room is simple, but nice, and even had small flowers on the tables.We had a dessert of Kazandibi, described as a Turkish flan. It had a white, gelatin consistency and seemed to be broiled or otherwise flamed on the top. It was very tasty, and it actually tasted a bit like s&#39;mores, much to the delight of my tongue. Now I could give proper ethnic advice from the heartland about a good s&#39;more.They took reservations, which was nice, except that the place was only about half-filled on a Saturday night. I hope that their business is good on other days and at lunch, because the place is a gem."

I went for lunch and ordered the Turkish feta salad with chicken. It was a huge salad but I had no problems finishing it. The salad was fresh and light but super filling. I didn&#39;t mind paying extra for the chicken because they give you a large amount. I could probably eat the salad every day, to be honest.Dine in if you can, because then you get free homemade bread and the carrot spread. It was so difficult to not eat the entire bread basket by myself because it was SO DANG GOOD. The woman working at the register (I&#39;m assuming Zizi&#39;s wife? I don&#39;t know) told me they make it twice daily. I&#39;ve never had anything like the carrot spread and it was also fantastic. I ended up eating it with a fork because I was trying to resist the bread. Spoiler alert: I ate the entire bread basket. Worth it.I left feeling full and energized.

The owner brought us a complimentary Turkish Flan since he overheard we were going to write a well deserved great review on Yelp.

Not only is it convenient to where I live (and arguably super convenient and worth it for anyone who may get to the Brown line - as it&#39;s less than 5 minutes from the Diversey stop), but it&#39;s also delicious and BYOB. In the summer, there are a couple of outdoor tables, and I&#39;ve never had to wait for a spot in the dining room. I recommend ordering the combo appetizer that comes with grape leaves, hummus, and a variety of salad/dips to eat with their fresh, homemade bread that everyone appropriately raves about on here. I don&#39;t love their hummus, but I think everything else is so very flavorful that more than makes up for and maybe even complements it it. My boyfriend loves the eggplant spread that is very very smoky. If you&#39;re dining in, you may get a complimentary carrot spread appetizer with that warm bread. The spread is a bit garlicky and very fresh.For the main meal, I recommend the Zizi&#39;s Favorite Pizmahmagun Wrap with lamb or, if you&#39;re wanting vegetarian, the Eggplant Tower is very good. Of course the kebab or doner sandwiches are classically great too, and you can see into the kitchen area where they cook the meat rotisserie style and prepare everything before you. I&#39;ve seen criticism of the fries, but I like the skin on fries and think they are seasoned fine. Really, I&#39;ve enjoyed everything I&#39;ve tried at Zizi&#39;s but find myself going back to the favorite wrap. Join me in my quest to bring everyone to Zizi&#39;s, and you will not be disappointed."

It&#39;s a lamb doner kebab and heavenly homemade Turkish bread covered with yogurt, garlic, and tomato sauce, Easily two meals, but as mentioned is tough to get your taste buds to quit so if you can&#39;t show restraint then you may want to stick with a sandwich or a wrap.The place works as a casual date spot cause it&#39;s BYOB or if you just want to pick up a quick lunch on your own it&#39;s great as well since there&#39;s a really attractive Turkish server to talk to.Overall an amazing experience!"

They don&#39;t skimp on the chicken which by the way, was fairly moist and had good flavor by itself. I absolutely adored the sandwich bread - not sure what it&#39;s called but it&#39;s yummy! Two meals in one for sure.Would have been 5 stars if not for the fries which I was not a fan of. They were much too soggy. It MAY have been because I had mine after a ten minute walk but even with that, it was still overly soft. *Edit: I came back and had the fries in the restaurant this time. It was not as soggy but still softer than I&#39;d like. Good seasoning though.The dolma is fairly standard. I wouldn&#39;t say that it&#39;s particularly special. The first time I tried their falafel, it was also average, then on the next visit, I had it again after learning they had changed the recipe a bit. Sigh, it came out worse this time - the inside was much too soft for my liking! Go back to before please!There was also kind of a long wait for our food even though there was no one in front of us in line - be prepared as this is not as fast as your typical mediterranean speediness. If you have time, I highly recommend dining in. They bring you their amaaaaazing homemade bread with carrot spread. SCRUMPTIOUS, mouth watering delicious. Best complimentary bread + spread I&#39;ve ever had!"

I have tried soooo many different places but the way they prepared it wasn&#39;t the same! Some people even lied to me when i called prior to going to their restaurant. They were oh so sure that their Doner would be better! At some point i even gave up due to all the BS i have tasted! So a few days ago i have had a craving for a Doner but didn&#39;t want to be disappointed and pissed off (FYI i take my food very seriously) and didn&#39;t know where i should turn! I use to just Google &#34;German Style Doner&#34; and would call those places but this time i used this head of mine and used Yelp (which I should have done a long time ago). So my search for Doner &#34;Zizi&#39;s Cafe&#34; came up. I took a peek at the pictures and almost had a heart attack. I thought i was going into cardiac arrest but i caught myself before!I called the restaurant and asked him not to BS me and that i will be very pissed if i showed up and this Doner was not what i was asking for. He assured me and said &#34;If its not like the one in Germany; your meal if free. So i showed up and man was i surprised. They were real Turkish (as in it was 100% Turkish owned and ran). They knew exactly what i was looking for. Come to find out Zizi speaks German and i think he use to live in Germany.My Doner came up ASAP! Wait was less than 10 minutes, Now when it comes to a Doner its all about the bread and the sauce. ZIZZI GOT IT RIGHT!! He came through with his promise and served me my Doner the way i LOVE IT. It was perfect and i was VERY VERY VERY PLEASED. This place is a definitely must go for some great Turkish food and more! His food really took me back to Germany and reminded me of all the good times i have had as a kid.Zizzi came and checked on me a few times and made sure that i was pleased with my food. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GERMAN STYLE DONER THIS PLACE HAS IT!!Thank you and i will return with FRIENDS"

Very addicting!Falafel: 3.5/5 -- Your typical falafel, certainly full of flavor and served with yogurt. Did not find anything too special about this one.Iskender: 3/5 -- Now this is where I left disappointed. I love meat (I can eat pork/beef straight up for hours at Korean BBQ&#39;s), but I found this dish very underwhelming. The flavors from the tomato sauce unsatisfying. Personally didn&#39;t find the döner and the underlying bread to go together too well and was disappointed that the peppers and the walnut better were not a larger part of the meal.Baklava: 3.5/5 -- Zizi&#39;s Cafe did a decent job with this famous dessert; it was crispy, warm, rich, and had a good balance of honey and nuts.I liked the owner, but I found the service very inattentive. It was hilarious how the owner mockingly looked down on my friend when she ordered a chicken kebab (too typical and ordinary for the owner, I guess)."

Really tasty, better than your average chicken shawarma or mediterranean wrap. Lots of flavor and extremely juicy, at the same time not super greasy and drenched in miscellaneous white sauce. Also came with fresh french fries made with real potatoes, not your previously frozen rolled-up Mcdonald&#39;s fried potato mush.This place is a sit-down place, and not at all like what I imagined. If you&#39;re looking for a fast-service place where you place your order at the counter and get it by the time you&#39;re at the other end of the counter, this is not it.

(Okay, tonight it was more &#34;warm&#34; than hot, but it&#39;s also -8 outside.) Both times I&#39;ve had the chicken doner sandwich which is delicious with the blend of meat seasonings and yogurt sauce. And the bread...oh man, the bread. I don&#39;t know why or how, but it is so good that I ordered extra this time. If I had to find a fault, I&#39;d say that the sandwiches are messy and hard to eat because of the size and cut of the bread. Making them pita style with fillings jammed inside might mean less time cleaning up spills and more time snarfing down the deliciousness...but that&#39;s about the only fault I can find with what I&#39;ve ordered.

We just finished our meals and I think it was the quietest meal of our lives. We both thoroughly enjoyed every tasty bit of our food. I am blown away especially since we ordered delivery.I ordered lamb kabobs and my husband ordered the Lamb Shish Begendi Platter. Both of our lamb was cooked and seasoned perfect. My husband&#39;s dish was lamb over couscous with an eggplant puree with cheese and veggies... DELISH! I almost took over his dish when I had a bite. Mine was lamb over seasoned white rice. The rice was seriously the best rice I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s almost like white powdery fluffy snow but rice consistency. It was the perfect moisture, not sticky, and def not mushy. So good!Our plates came with this bread that is to die for. It&#39;s a mix between pita and sourdough like bread. Really enjoyable. Over all this has got to be by far the best Mediterranean food I&#39;ve had in the city so far. I will be back for sure, and I&#39;m bringing company."

Zizi was a cook in his native Turkey and I believe for a time in Italy, more recently at Turquoise, and now has his own place.The atmosphere as my dining companion put it &#34;is nonexistent.&#34; We were willing to overlook that for some grub.Very interesting service nice to the point of being almost cloying. However, he has a lot of personality, is sincere, and informative.It&#39;s BYOB.We started with the famous complimentary bread with carrot yogurt garlic spread. Everyone raves about this bread and I&#39;m wondering why. My partner and I both weren&#39;t impressed.Zizi showed him his fresh fish so he ordered the Mediterranean Sea Bass Special which is chargrilled whole and comes with rice and salad. Zizi deboned the fish at the table with a knife and fork rather expertly. Ha! Z made sure to take out some of the better bits for me insisting I try. The fish was very good and flavorful; my partner said it was some of the best he&#39;s had for a while. He also enjoyed the salad which was by his admission simple, but had great dressing.I had the chicken shish platter with cous cous. For some reason it was plated with a portion of cous cous, some white long grain rice, a couple of grilled zucchini slices, three small toast disks, and yogurt sauce. The grilled chicken was good but as Zizi said himself to my companion &#34;it&#39;s grilled chicken.&#34; then they both shrugged. The yogurt sauce was great, very fresh and not overly seasoned. The cous cous and rice were a disappointment. I really like more inventive and playful cous cous recipes.As a surprise Z brought dessert. Like the whole Sea Bass I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s on the menu. It was a generous piece of custard pie that was rich in texture but delicately flavored of vanilla. Very similar to a creme brûlée and served with fresh strawberries. We both really liked it.We were really impressed with the welcoming warm service and quality. However, it&#39;s worth mentioning the bill for our two entrees was $37.95. I would still return to try more of the fascinating menu and get that hospitality."

At the beginning of the meal, our server greeted us and gave everyone a taste of prosecco to make a toast with. We actually ended up buying a bottle of the prosecco given which was the Prosecco di Veneto Doc. A good neutral prosecco that was neither too sweet or too dry.The pictures are of my meal which was the burrata e prosciutto con pomodori secchi as an appetizer and the salmone con lenticchie e spinaci as a main entree. The burrata e prosciutto con pomodori secchi was absolutely delicious. The mozzarella was VERY creamy and thick. Paired with the acidity from the balsamic reduction and cured tomatoes and the saltiness from the prosciutto, the dish was very balanced and I will dream about it until I come back to Chicago for more. The salmone con lenticchie e spinaci was cooked perfect to medium as I requested. Very buttery and scrumptious. The lentils were a nice texture compliment to the buttery fish. Not overly seasoned. My only critique is the lack of baby spinach in the dish. I was expecting a normal vegetable side portion and it ended up being around 4 pieces of cooked spinach.I also had the house-made gelato (not pictured)which tasted like a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch cereal with whole milk.The items that my friends had:-Affettati Misti: typical meat and cheese platter except the quality of the cheese was phenomenal.-Gnocchi al Gorgonzola: If you love gnocchi, get this for sure. The gnocchi was perfectly cooked, with a beautiful harmony of buttery, cheesy goodness and toasted walnuts that give you the crunch component that your mouth will be looking for.-Zuppa Di Pesce: probably my least favorite thing out of everything we ordered. Seafood was slightly overcooked and higher salt level.-Melanzane Griglia e Forno: I personally did not try this dish, but my friend who did ate it all VERY quickly. Safe to say she loved it.- Tiramisu: **note: we ordered torta di cioccolato but were given the tiramisu. After failed attempts to get our server, we just ate the tiramisu. In the end it worked out because we loved it. Far better than the gelato I ordered.Service: Service wasn&#39;t terrible but it wasn&#39;t the greatest service I had. The individual who was refilling waters was more attentive than our actual server. I rarely ever tip under 20% but we did tip our server less for these reasons.-If you order a bottle, they keep it at the bar for you instead of your table which is fine. But the lack of checking in on our table left glasses empty for a while and some glasses being filled while ignoring other&#39;s low level glasses.-The server&#39;s attitude wasn&#39;t the nicest. As if being in a group of younger adults made it seem like we couldn&#39;t afford to eat there.-Lastly, she couldn&#39;t split the check. She said the system didn&#39;t allow splitting individual items as in 1/2 to one and 1/2 another which is absolutely fine. We didn&#39;t need to split items, just the dinner menu. Instead of understanding us, she gave us the check with a pen to calculate amounts ourselves. I wouldn&#39;t have really cared if she was more understanding about it instead of coming off as being extremely rude.That aside, the food was very good and worth a try!"

It was a Wednesday night and pretty busy but we were seated right on time to our 7pm reservation. And then nothing. We were chatting and lost track of time a little bit but when our stomachs started growling we noticed we had been sitting here for about 20 minutes without a server coming to check if we wanted drinks other than water or wanted to order anything to eat. We guess it was because two of our foursome were no shows so we shrugged it off and asked the water guy (who actually had been diligently been refilling our waters) to please send our server because we were ready to order. Another 10 minutes go by and nothing. At this point I&#39;m ready to leave but my dinner partner wanted to try the menu so instead I walk up to the hostess and tell her we have not seen a server for a solid 30mins. She was very apologetic. Our replacement server was pleasant but rather indifferent, she did her job and that was about it. We were comped two lambruscos which we didn&#39;t get the option of choosing, my friend would&#39;ve probably preferred the free dessert for home we were initially offered since she doesn&#39;t drink alcohol. To top it off there was a mix up in the receipts and we almost had to pay for the drinks we did not even order! Luckily the server noticed before we had to address the issue.

So coming here was just all too fitting. Stopped in last night what was only supposed to be one glass with a friend but after seeing everyone&#39;s plates, I had to try dinner! Let me tell you, I did not regret a single bite. I ordered the scallops which were perfectly made. A few glasses of their different prosecco and had the company of an amazing bartender. He was attentive, funny and helpful. I ordered dinner a little late and instead of saying no the kitchen is closed, he went back to ask the chef if he&#39;d make an exception. He did not need to do that, but I&#39;m happy he did! The place is intimate and feels very Italian, which it is. Finally, we were leaving with happy tastebuds and the chef caught us on our way out to ask how my scallops were, and introduced himself. That is service you don&#39;t see very often in Chicago lately. Absolutely loved everything, I&#39;ll be back soon!"

When you sit down, you are greeted with a small taste of prosecco, which I really appreciated. The food itself was tasty but in my opinion, overpriced ($23 for my pasta course).Although the flavors and presentation were nice, I was slightly upset by the service. I made the reservation for our wedding anniversary, which I mentioned upon booking the reservation. Although I shouldn&#39;t have expected anything, I did think maybe the restaurant would congratulate us or offer a dessert treat, although nothing about the anniversary was mentioned.Overall, good food and wine, nice atmosphere, maybe not the best for anniversaries/birthdays if you want special treatment."

The ambiance is really nice coupled with great Hearty Italian meals that gives you the satisfaction like no other food! I am giving this place 1 less start because their lobster bisque was bad. You can tell the difference when you eat here between home made pasta goodness vs the usual Italian you get other places. Except the soup all other food was great.

My boyfriend arranged to have dinner here to celebrate Valentine&#39;s Day (Feb 13 instead bc of the snowstorm on the 14th) The ambience is quite romantic. Candlelit dinner with a red rose placed on each table.The service I have no complaints! The staff made my boyfriend and I feel comfortable and welcomed!As soon as we were seated we received a complimentary proseccoWe ordered the crab cakes first and I loved it! My boyfriend felt it needed a bit more flavor though but I enjoyed it.For dinner:My boyfriend ordered Spaghetti alla diavola which he could not stop talking about even when we arrived home.I ordered the Rigatoni Norcina. Sadly the first plate the rigatoni was a bit on the hard side. I couldn&#39;t force myself to eat it (I don&#39;t like sending dishes back to the kitchen) so I ended up sending it back. Our waiter was apologetic and said my meal will come just like I wanted it. He was right! The rigatoni was cooked and the sauce tasted even better!I will love to come here again. It&#39;s very romantic.The only downside is that the tables are too close to one another. A bit more space so I can&#39;t overhear the next party conversation.

One star is pretty harsh, but for a $120+ dinner where most of the food was inedible, it seems to fit.I picked this place because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews on Yelp, but either they&#39;ve had some major changes here (new chef?) recently or a seriously off night.We were sat in an almost empty room which filled to about half full while we were there. Our server introduced himself as &#34;Ricardo&#34; but the name on the check was &#34;Jose&#34;. He wasn&#39;t actually around for most of the meal anyway. There was a nice student from El Salvador who actually brought and cleared all our food, but unfortunately he wasn&#39;t able to answer any questions or actually resolve any issues.We wanted to share multiple items so ordered four in total: a salad, a special appetizer with burrata and nectarines, a gnocchi dish and a risotto dish. The salad came first and was OK--some interesting ingredients (strips of beet, shaved fennel), but nothing exceptional. The burrata wasn&#39;t as creamy as I was expecting--more like regular mozzarella and about 1/3 of the nectarines served with it were overripe to the point of being rotten (should never have put on the plate). The dish was also missing an entire component--the sauce.The pasta dishes however, made us really regret our choice. The risotto was Kraft mac &amp; cheese yellow and had the consistency of Elmer&#39;s glue. It was overly salted, yet lacking in any other flavor, and the accompanying shrimp were cooked to a rubbery toughness. The gnocchi was completely inedible. They actually bore no resemblance to any gnocchi I&#39;ve ever seen before--small, brown glutinous plugs of dough spread over a plate with an overly rich and one-note gorgonzola sauce. I took one bite and couldn&#39;t bring myself to take another. We sent the gnocchi back because it was so blatantly inedible and only ate about 1/4 of the risotto each. Both dishes seemed like they had been sitting for a good amount of time before they were delivered.No manager or chef came over to talk to us and the absentee server only showed up again to try and sell us dessert. We passed.So, we walked out of there $120 poorer (which included a bottle of their least expensive, house Prosecco at around $40) and with the least satisfying &#34;fine dining&#34; Italian meal I&#39;ve ever had sitting heavily in our stomachs."

Overall, it was average. I wouldn&#39;t dread going back, but there are just way too many better Italian restaurants out there....LOCATION/DECOR. It&#39;s cute, clean &amp; has a decent amount of parking nearby.SERVICE.  I&#39;m conflicted. The service wasn&#39;t bad. The waiters were all quite friendly to some degree.  They were all just... really clumsy. One waiter dropped a wine glass by my friend, another waiter was shaky as he was pouring water into my glass, and another waiter spilled my friend&#39;s glass of Prosecco on her (they did give her another glass though).  Now, if the restaurant was packed and they were all really busy...perhaps this would have made a little more sense.  However, we arrived at 5:30pm and there was literally one other occupied table.FOOD. We were all served a glass of Prosecco.  The eggplant spread for the bread was good.  The butternut squash soup of the day and Granchio e Riso (Risotto crab cakes) were the best parts of the entire dinner.  However, the entrees were just too salty. The risotto di Manzo, Saltimbocca di Vitello, &amp; Rigatoni alla Norcina were all too salty.  Especially the veal.  A forkful of my friend&#39;s veal entree made me chug half a glass of water.  Their tiramisu and their gelato (my friend chose a flavor that was similar to Nutella) were decent."

Helpful staff, solid knowledge of the menu, fast, and efficient. However, you go to eat, so all of this only gets you so far, it&#39;s all about the food and it was, meh. Tagliatelle Bolognese, let&#39;s face it, is one of the easiest dishes to make and it was salty. The spaghetti Diablo with shrimp promised to be spicy, it wasn&#39;t, at all. Then we ordered, off the menu, an adffogato... For $12! A scoop of ice cream and a single shot expresso for $12... Really? That was the issue. The food was ok, but for the prices charged. Nope!"

Yet, we were offered a small table with two chairs away from the window.  It was not a good table and it was too small for the lunch we planned to eat and the wine my husband intended to order.  The choice of table for us was a bit perplexing.  Our table was changed on my husband&#39;s request to the window table with four chairs but he should not have had to ask them to do that given the entire restaurant (with the exception of one table) was empty, and it was 2:30 pm in the afternoon at the end of their lunch service.Despite the rather cold and flat reception that we received upon our arrival to the restaurant we were happy with our new table and hungry.  My husband proceeded to order an expensive bottle of wine which took an inordinate and unreasonable amount of time to reach our table, our waiter then proceeded to delay taking our order; served our food in a painfully slow manner; neglected to keep our wine glasses filled and left us sitting for most of our lunch waiting for more wine and fighting stabbing hunger pains.  At the same time he hovered and doted shamelessly and continuously over the table next to us (the only other diners in the restaurant), who from a quick assessment did not appear to warrant the imbalanced attention.When our food finally arrived, it was grossly underwhelming; our cavatelli pasta with sausage and rapini had one piece of rapini and 1/2 a sausage link in the entire dish; and the eggplant parmesan tasted like pure salt with burned cheese covering mushy eggplant; while the grilled octopus was smothered and drowning in balsamic vinegar.  If it was not for my handsome and fun husband and the delicious bottle of Ornellia that we shared, it would have been a rather dismal lunch."

They also had some private spaces that looked very elegant and intimate though we weren&#39;t sitting there.Food was pretty tasty and we liked all the dishes that we got (see accompanying pictures).Dessert - they didn&#39;t have an affogatto on the menu (ice cream/gelato w a shot of espresso) but kindly made one for us when we requested one.Service - for some reason it felt like it took awhile for them to get us anything drink related. Our wine came out at almost the same time as the food. And we waited awhile for the affogatto but other than no major complaints!They have outdoor seating and the restaurant is close to the bustling streets of River north but not in the midst.

We were seated promptly and the place was quite nice and elegant. It was only a quarter occupied when we went.It took awhile before we all had our complimentary glass of Prosecco, which worried me as this was one of the main reasons I suggested the place. We did receive it and made a nice toast to the bride to be.They were well staffed in numbers, as we saw many staff people walk around, but I guess quality is so-so. We all read the menus to death and our waiter comes over and lets us know that we must order as their kitchen will be closing soon. Well, we let him know that we&#39;ve been ready, but was never asked in this rather long period of time. Some of the girls ordered drinks first and were still waiting on them, while some others got theirs, so it was all inconsistent. I was just put off that they made it seem like we were just taking our time when they were the ones not executing proper service. Our waiter was nice enough, just clearly not outstanding.All of our food did come out an appropriate time. I get the special risotto that had prosciutto in it. It was yummy and was pleased to see decent satisfying portions for a more upscale place. Friend&#39;s lamb chops were good as well. While food was all quite good, it did not knock my socks off.Waters were never refilled and I had to ask about it towards the end. We were able to pay with multiple cards and they executed that well so that was relieving...this should be the case for any place, but it&#39;s sad that I almost want to give them a plus because of it.Overall, place was good, but was expecting more from this high-end Italian place. There are definitely better experiences to be had. The complimentary Prosecco is a nice touch though."

Our waiter Gaetano was really good. I loved that he was born in Italy and spoke fluent Italian. He was able to speak to our non-English speaking guest, which was impressive. The staff was really on top of it. I would give 5 stars for what they did. The bus boy was very attentive and kept the whole table in order.So you&#39;re probably wondering about the two stars. I was completely unimpressed with my dinner entree. I ordered the SPAGHETTI FRUTTI di MARE  which was $24.  The dish consisted of Spaghetti, bottleneck clams, mussels, shrimp, mahi mahi, calamari, a scallop, white wine, garlic, extra virgin olive oil &amp; chili flake. I asked Gaetano if my dish was spicy. He said, &#34;No!&#34; He was probably thinking I didn&#39;t like spice. I told him to make it extra spicy. He told me not to worry that the chef was Mexican. I then told him to tell the chef to hurt me with heat.Fast forward to my dish arriving. It was not even close to being spicy. The Pasta was completely tasteless and not served hot. I understand we had 11 entrees hitting the table and they all can&#39;t be hot but mine surely was sitting a while at the pass. The white wine, garlic &amp; olive oil sauce was completely void. I actually had to attempt to fix it at the table myself. There was a bowl of red pepper chili flake at the table which I used to add to my pasta and a bottle of Olive oil that I generously poured over my pasta. It tasted better but I had to fix it myself and I shouldn&#39;t have to do that for a plate of pasta that costs $24. Also the mahi mahi was so over cooked it was icky and the clams had some sand particles which is a huge pet peeve of mine. The mussels and shrimp were amazing. Oh and the calamari consisted of one single tiny ring of squid. It was like Where&#39;s Waldo with squid.If I could go back in time, I wish I could have ordered anything else off the menu except what I ordered. I have no idea how I could have selected the worse possible dish on such an impressive menu. I was really letdown.I&#39;m not sure how everyone else&#39;s dishes tasted. I was able to taste my wives pepper crusted ahi and it was good. After tasting her dish I really knew I had the bad dish on the table. My little one had the risotto and I could tell she wasn&#39;t that impressed. When we make it at home she can&#39;t stop eating it. Her only comment was that it was too salty. In fact, when I told her we were going to wrap it up, she didn&#39;t even want to take it home. And my little one loves good food. She did tell me that if she could write a review she would go 2 stars. I&#39;m going to have to agree with her.Now there were a few bright spots. The pistachio ice creme was delicious and it is the only reason I would come back here. Pistachio is one of my favorite flavors and I can usually only find it in Italy, so I was excited to see it on the menu here. Also the Lemoncello was very good too. I hear that it was house made. I would order that again. I really didn&#39;t like the chocolate cake. It had a deep taste of real chocolate which I do not like.The room is fancy. There are some great little rooms for intimate private dinning. The bar is beautiful. The whole area is very elegant. I can not say a bad thing about the space.Would I come back to eat here? Probably not. Based off of my dish this place is over priced for what you get. I would have expected the most amazing pasta dish for $24 but instead I was given a dish that was tasteless, bland &amp; uninspired. I had such high hopes walking in here and I walked out completely dissatisfied. This place puts on a good show but the food is not part of it."

It is crowded on the weekends and will only get more popular with all the residential construction on Wells. Their wine list has a wide variety of bottles of varying prices.  At the same time, this is very much a $$$ menu. Our server had a thick accent and provided genuine recommendations. We tried the Caprese to start, probably my favorite part of the night. The tomatoes were incredibly fresh and cheese was creamy. We also ordered a tomato based soup which was delicious but incredibly rich. I think rich is a common theme here. The Orchette I ordered was also incredibly rich. I still managed to clear the whole plate, so I guess that says something about the food. The meat dishes looked incredible, something to try on the next visit."

Back then, we actually lived in the city, so it would have been quite convenience. However, my husband had a chip on his shoulder about going to the restaurant, saying he already knew what it would be like. so, for years, we did not go. At long last (and of course, now that we live in the suburbs), I convinced him to go for dinner at Prosecco. I am happy to report we both had a fantastic meal.From the outside, Prosecco has a lovely patio area. While it was too chilly for us to dine outside in April, it looked like it would be a great spot to grab lunch in warmer months. Inside, the restaurant does have an old-school Italian feel to it. The lights are low, the walls are a bit darker, and there are lots of fake flowers and Italian paintings on the wall. We were very lucky to be seated in the back room, under the skylight, which really brightened up our table. If given the opportunity, I would definitely request to sit there again.The food was fantastic. We started with a burrata special that included an amazing tomato jam. I&#39;m not normally a fan of burrata, but I could not give enough of the appetizer. We also share the tuna tartare, which was equally fabulous. It tasted very fresh and light, just as a good tartare should. Afterwards, I had the mushroom orecchiette. For a mushroom fanatic, the dish was simply amazing. It included with delicious cream sauce that was absolutely the perfect texture and flavor. My husband tried to replicate it one week later, but even with his fantastic cooking skills, it could not compare to the dish I had at Prosecco.I would definitely return to this restaurant, and have no hesitation in recommending it either."

It has mouth watering food, the great Italian service, great wine selection-recommendation. The server recommends well. They have spicy italian (didnt know italian could be spicy) food which is very suited to our palette.Eventhough we like the place we are one star away from loving it - one reason is our server forgot to pass one of our food order and he seemed ok about it, saying good you seem to be full anyway . Another reason is we are still to find any memorable dish, a dish which has blown us away.May be next time the rating will be 5 but for now its 4."

We had a tough time choosing because so many dishes looked interesting and delish, I have no doubt they are and will be back to try them! The ambiance, again, was so warm and inviting, good crowd, not to crowded but a good fun vibe going on. I think it would be great for a big group &amp; at the same time could be a great romantic date night destination as well.

The service on the other hand was more of a 2 star.My wife and I like to take our time when dining out. We usually order an app then order our entrees a bit later so that the food doesn&#39;t come out all at once. When we asked the server this, he refused stating that all food MUST be ordered at the same time, a demand of the chef because they are too busy. If a first impression is telling us how we&#39;re going to dine, I&#39;d much rather spend my money elsewhere. Second, each table get a complimentary glass of Prosecco. It&#39;s a nice touch until the waiter knocks yours over while showing you the specials and does not offer to refill it. Third it took 3 attempts and 3 promises to get olive oil and balsamic to dip our bread in. I get it you are busy, but don&#39;t promise us, then forget about it.This place could be so much more, but for the money I&#39;d rather go somewhere where the experience is what is remembered, not the service failures."

You didn&#39;t know this 30 minutes ago!!!?  Not waiting.The salmon, which I included a picture of, was horribly bland and not filling! A huge fail!The pork chop, which they recommended butterfly cut or it would have taken 30 minutes longer, was just ok. The sauce was flavorful, but nothing about it made me say wow. It was basically drowned in the sauce. So the meat and potatoes were just a soggy mess when served. Plating/Presentation=horribleThe flour less chocolate cake was mediocre. There was an apple something dessert that was actually very flavorful. It had some orange zest and flavors that added some punch."

But I was definitely proven wrong! I was here for my birthday and had a wonderful time. We had a reservation, and were seated right away. Our server was very knowledgeable in regards to the wine selection. He suggested the perfect wine after finding out what we preferred in a drink,which was great. I ordered the Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare, which was a variety of fresh seafood on a bed of pasta. Although I&#39;m picky when it comes to the quality of seafood, it was divine. And the portion size was perfect.The noise level is average, but still nice to have a conversation with the person you&#39;re dining with. The restaurant definitely has a romantic air to it,so I recommend it for a special occasion,(especially if you&#39;re looking for an affordable place). The only thing I didn&#39;t enjoy was a a nosy old man who was seated next to me,as he kept looking over at our table every 10 seconds! Lol.I will definitely be coming back."

We went on a very cold evening, as it was steps away from home and we were with my bf&#39;s Mom, who isn&#39;t great with the sub-20 temperatures. We were able to get reservations for 3 on a Friday night a few days in advance.Immediately, I felt welcomed by the friendly hostess and coat-check attendant, and whisked into the comfortable and warm back room of the restaurant. We were treated to a complimentary glass of the restaurant&#39;s namesake sparkling beverage, and we learned about the specials for that evening, of which there were many.We split a caprese salad (special) that was nothing special, but perfectly done in its simplicity.  My bf got a steak (special) that he raved about, and his Mom had a sautéed fish (also on special, but I think it might have been tilapia)? They prepared it without salt according to her wishes, but it was still wonderfully seared to a nice crust and had great flavor.  I had a couple of tastes and it was my favorite item of the evening (and I am typically underwhelmed by white fish).I asked the waitress for pasta recommendations, and opted for the special over the frutti de mare on the menu. I honestly can&#39;t recall what I had (!!), but recall finding it pretty tasty, if (apparently) unmemorable.Prices were not out of the ordinary given the portion size, ingredient quality, and restaurant location, but I&#39;d say this is more of a semi-special occasion place than a random spot to stop on a Tuesday night.  That said, I do look forward to going back, perhaps in the summer."

She made it seem like we snuck in, like some hooligans, off the street. We legit didn&#39;t know. Plus there were ppl there drinking at the bar and they weren&#39;t told to get the hell out.

The part that was really a surprise is that for how fancy and nice it was, it was definitely reasonably priced.First they greet you with a complimentary half glass of champagne. We ordered the charcuterie plate (Affettati Misti) and some cocktails to start and it was delicious.  We ordered the truffle pasta (Orecchiette Tartufate) and the rack of lamb (Costoletta D&#39; Agnello) for the meal. Now here is the only reason I docked this place one star. I am a huge meat person and can definitely tell when the meat has been under seasoned. The lamb was recommended as one of their dishes they are known for so I had some high expectations and unfortunately seemed just short a sprinkle of salt and was not crusted as well. But to be fair, literally just a slight shake of the salt on it made all the difference...still delicious. The truffle pasta = AMAZING!! This is also another dish they are known for and I would order this again all day everyday. I found it to be more lovable than the chops (same as my boyfriend who also loves his meat). For desserts, we orders the pistachio gelato and the tiramisu...can&#39;t go wrong with either. We had noted on the reservation that it was a birthday dinner and they brought out a candle on the dessert...simple touch but was nice they actually paid attention to it.Overall it was definitely a worth it experience. Next time I go I may give the lamb another chance on that maybe it was just a one time thing. I may mention that it came slightly underseasoned and not well crusted last time I was here, but I may not.  Either way, should give this place a shot!!"

I went with my girlfriend and her Grandma on a Friday night.My first impression was that the place was not very crowded for Friday dinner. It was awesome to get a free small glass of prosecco to start the meal. The food was great for all three parties, but our service was bad. The waitress constantly skipped our table to serve others. We ordered tea with dessert, and it was brought out with a spoon but no sugar or honey. When asked if they had honey, they checked the back and said we were &#34;in luck&#34;. I don&#39;t know, but it seems reasonable that a $8 tea would come with honey rather than that being a bonus. Maybe the waitress just didn&#39;t click with us. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back for the high cost of mediocre service that came off as being rude.We got pasta, pork chops, and seafood. All were great dishes. The soup was pretty bland for a $9 bowl."

We had the first reservation at 11:30 AM and of course no one else was there when we arrived. The decor does remind one of the European dining establishment. It has soothing looks and high ceilings but it still did not seem loud even as we were leaving and there was more of a crowd.They serve about a shot&#39;s worth of Prosecco when you first arrive to wet your whistle and tease you. It&#39;s a nice touch we were not expecting. The warm bread offered gratis was good enough however it needed a little salt or a little more crunch - it was lacking a certain something. The small diced vegetable medley that was served with it was nice and was probably a caponata although it lacked eggplant flavor and we cannot be sure exactly what it was since no one described it to us.The offerings for restaurant week are about five dollar value versus purchasing off of the à la carte menu.  The crab and risotto cakes were moist insside with a little crispness and quite small - if I had paid $10 for them I would not have been happy.The $10 lobster and avocado salad was served in the avocado shell and had a very tasty avocado oil dressing and was a good value for the portion size.The Pollo Valdostana was good but also needed something, maybe a little salt or little more sweetness or a little better quality prosciutto. It was however a very nice size portion which we were expecting to be cut down in size for restaurant week.The mashed potatoes served with the chicken were very light and fluffy although once again I have to say it was lacking a little bit of flavor.One of us in the group ordered the truffle orrechietti and they were definitely laden with truffle flavor. Avoid that dish if you&#39;re on the fence about truffles. you get hit over the head with that flavor!The dessert portions were also quite generous. The tiramisu was easily 4 x 5&#34; or larger. The gelato was a banana fudge version and it was disappointing that we could not choose from other gelato options that they had available especially because the restaurant week menu just said gelato and did not specify a particular flavor.The espresso and cappuccino&#39;s are a little strangely priced. A single shot of espresso is three dollars and a large cappuccino is four.  The espresso I requested was a ristretto and although it had very good flavor the cup was not warm and therefore the coffee was not hot enough.Because of all of these minor details and the missing flavor elements I could not give it four stars but I would give it a solid 3 1/2 if I could. We may return and try other options a la carte."

Water was poured for us and we bread was brought to our table within the first five minutes.  Over ten minutes later out server finally showed up.  He poured us each a small glass of prosecco, explaining everyone starts off the meal with a toast.  It was a nice touch, but it went downhill from there.He said he would be back shortly to take our order and then disappeared.  And when I say disappeared, I mean he did not come back to take our order for at least another 10-15 minutes.  Our server came back and we ordered our meals.  My friend ordered the pork chops, which we were told would take a little longer to cook.  Our server offered to have the pork chop butterflied and said it would take cook time from 35 minutes to maybe 20.  My friend also asked for more bread and some olive oil (the bread was brought out with some spread thing) and he said no problem.  15 minutes later my friend had to wave down our server to ask for the bread.  Again.  He again, said no problem like he didn&#39;t remember she had already asked him for it.Our food arrived and it was good.  Not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but not the worst.  My friend like her meal and my rigatoni and was good.  Our server eventually came back and we asked for our leftover food to be boxed up and for a dessert menu.  He brought our food back in the same bag, which was just weird.  My friend ordered the tiramisu and I ordered the apple crisp.  My friend said the tiramisu was really good, but my apple crisp was kind of bland and lukewarm.  The cinnamon gelato that came with it was good though.Around the time we were finishing up dessert, we started noticing a really weird odor.  I&#39;m not sure what it was, but it smelled like bad breath and seemed to be coming from a hallway which led to an elevator which I assume was to a private dining room.  The smell was overwhelming but we were stuck because our server was MIA and we still didn&#39;t have our check.  We were eventually able to pay and escape the stench.We arrived at 7:15 and didn&#39;t leave until after 9:00 and all we ordered were entrees and dessert.  No appetizers, no cocktails, and no reason it should have taken nearly two hours for dinner, especially when it wasn&#39;t even busy when we arrived.  The two women who sat down at the table next to us 30 minutes after we were seated were having dessert about the same time as we were, so I don&#39;t know if the service we had was abnormal.  Overall, the food was ok, the service was lacking, and I don&#39;t plan on going back."

The bar service between check-in and seating completely hinges on crowd/open seats. If able to sit - good. If not - nuisance.Server was great (Tracey 2-below???), knowledgeable and down-to-earth, great Tuscan Chardonnay recommendation. Mussels for an appetizer were 4+stars. Unfortunately, nothing else I&#39;ve ever had here was as good. The only other item that was legitimate 4-star flavor&amp;texture was the cavatelli (saffron-shrimp sauce), which I did not order on this visit.This place is good, I&#39;ll probably be back within 5-7 mo&#39;s, but I&#39;m not counting the hours.

It was amazingly creamy, the port soaked pears were tender and it had pistachios with a cherry glaze - to die for!!!(2) My main course I ordered the Orecchiette Tartufate which had disc-shaped pasta, wild mushrooms, asparagus, sun-dried tomatoes, black truffle cream, shaved Grana Padano, and white truffle oil. It was absolutely delicious!!!!!!!(3) Finally I had tiramisu for dessert which was equally delicious as everything else. I should note, they change their desserts nightly so when I went back I was hoping to try the banana Nutella gelato but they no longer had it!My only complaint would be that the second time I came back with a date, we had a reservation but it was so packed that we had almost a 20 minute wait past out reservation time. They were very apologetic about it and gave us an extra free glass of prosecco which was nice but we already had a late reservation so by the time we were seated we were starving!I would definitely go back!!!"

I had the buratta,  pappardelle with wild boar, and the veal, all of which were fantastic.The service was spot on - knowing exactly when to reappear to take a drink order, fill water, check in with us without being obstrusive.  The restaurant is well-staffed and every server we interacted with was great.The dining room is set up to feel like you are in a tuscan residential (albeit oversized) kitchen with an open window to the actual kitchen, and a countertop with cabinets along one wall.  Clever.Be sure to get a glass of the house made limoncello.  Delicious!"

Who wouldn&#39;t love a place that greets you with a little toast of bubbly (Prosecco of course)? It&#39;s the kind of place you can go for a delicious quick lunch, or for a romantic dinner-date. They also have a cute little private room towards the back which is perfect for an intimate dinner with a few friends!"

My cousin had the Orechheitte Tartufate, the restaurant&#39;s signature dish, and I had their Gnochhi ai Gorgonzola.  The Tartufate was a disc-shaped pasta, 3 halved mushrooms, asparagus, &#39;sun-dried tomato,&#39; black truffle cream, two shaved Grana Padano, and a drizzle of white truffle oil.  You can definitely tell that they didn&#39;t skimp out on the truffle, but it was quite overwhelming!  It wasn&#39;t as rich as I thought it was going to be, and the taste of it seemed somewhat off.  The gnocchi, on the other hand, was okay, and it was rich in taste.  For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake that was more dark chocolate-based and on the dry side.   The apple pastry tart was okay as well, which came with their &#39;homemade&#39; ice cream that was a little too sweet (vanilla).  I&#39;m glad I was able to check this place out!+free parking off of Wells"

We took advantage of the beautiful weather and sat outside, I definitely recommend this if you come by when the weather is nice. Their patio is quaint and makes for a lovely dinner. Our waiter was attentive and helpful throughout the meal, but his first great move was recommending the burrata and fig appetizer. This was so delicious and came in a large portion. We also split a couple meat and cheese platters which were fantastic, this is great to share with a group. My boyfriend and I split the beet salad, which was very tasty and fresh, but kind of unnecessary if you&#39;re ordering appetizers.We all ordered different items and everyone was happy with their choices. Some of the items at our table included the filet, rigatoni, scallops, and beef short rib risotto, which was a special. I had the cavatelli and was thrilled with my choice. This homemade pasta came with shrimp, asparagus, peppers, and a very pleasant safron broth. The shrimp were plentiful and the portion of the dish was large. We ordered a few things for dessert and tried the chocolate gelato which was fantastic. Overall, a very classy and delicious Italian dining experience, perfect for a special occasion!"

My wife and I shared apps and meals.  Two stand outs were the Buratta, peaches with a cherry sauce and our entrée fish special Escolar. We are not familiar with Italian wines so our waiter did a great job helping us select the perfect bottle and it seemed to be priced reasonable.  Chef Marc even made a few visits to our table to ensure we were having wonderful dinning experience.

We  all ordered it and it did not disappoint. I make something similar at home all the time (but just using salt and balsamic vinegar). The one here is def fancier.They also give a glass of Prosecco to toast.For a meal I had the Orecchiette Tartufate which appeared to be a crowd favorite. I enjoyed that as well.My drink was Vespa. I am pretty lightweight with drinks but this def put me under after a few sips.I would recommend and like to try again when I return to Chicago.

Its server super chilled so there&#39;s almost a thin layer of ice on the top when served.  Yummy.  If my memory servers me right, I had 2 of these (but who knows...lol)Next was a struggle to select just ONE of the many fantastic sounding appetizers.  Again, trying to go with something unique I went with the Lumache alla Romano.  What&#39;s that, you ask?  Well check out picture #30 but I&#39;ll tell you - it&#39;s jumbo snails (maybe not so &#39;jumbo&#39; but definitely good sized!), prosciutto di parma, vecchia ramagna brandy and a garlic cream reduction.  Everything was balanced really well - nothing over powering and so delicious.When it came time to select a single entree because again, too many that sounded wonderful to have to only choose just one, the waiter kindly suggested getting an extra entree to share as a separate course between the appetizer and mains.  Well yea! Now we&#39;re talkin&#39;!So for our mid-course, we all went with one of their signature dishes which is the Orecchiette Tartufate (pic #31).  This consists of orecchiette with wild mushrooms, asparagus, sun-dried tomatoes, black truffle cream (kill me now...), shaved grana padano and of course, drizzled with white truffle oil.  Again, expertly balanced so no one item overpowered the rest of the dish.  Really REALLY good!Finally, after much discussion and deep, DEEP, contemplation, I settled on my main dish which was the Capesante fon Prosecco e Vaniglia (pic #32).  At this point, I&#39;m going with anything that has the word &#34;Prosecco&#34; in it because not only do I enjoy Prosecco, it&#39;s gotta be special and so far everything has been fantastic so doubtful this would be a bad choice. I was 100% correct - this dish was 4 large, diver-caught scallops, spinach, shitake mushroom, diced Roma tomatoes and severed with a vanilla &amp; Prosecco reduction.  The vanilla gave the sauce a slight sweet taste to it that actually worked well.  The scallops were perfectly seared. Oh my god I&#39;ve made myself hungry again...lolAfter all of that, we did peek at the dessert menu which if you are into desserts (which usually I&#39;m not) did look like a nice selection and from the few I saw passing by to other tables, looked delicious as well.  However, after the meal - and maybe a few cocktails - I was completely satisfied and opted out of the dessert.Even with all the drinks and the mid-course entree, the bill was surprisingly reasonable for  4 people.  And most importantly, worth every penny.  When you get excellent service (which was appropriate in terms of checking, but not intrusive in any way), beautiful venue and high quality food that was well prepared, you don&#39;t mind paying for it because it&#39;s worth it.I&#39;m not one to normally give out 5 stars, but I really couldn&#39;t find anything wrong with this place or even slightly &#34;off&#34; so I&#39;m going with 5 and I believe it&#39;s well deserved.  A great place to go for any reason from a business function to a romantic 1:1 evening.  You will not be disappointed!"

Thursday night not too busy so one would assume the service would be top notch. Wrong!We sat at the bar as we didn&#39;t fancy a romantic sit down meal we were only there for nibbles and fizz. The bartender came over to us grunted something like hello and went and stood at the other side of the bar completely ignoring us for the remainder of the time we were there. My friend and I are prosecco lovers, the more the better, so I was told that as soon as you sit you are offered a  glass of this beautiful fizz  free of charge, well this did not happen in our case and maybe they don&#39;t do this at the bar which I don&#39;t mind but at least bring us over a glass of water.... SOMETHING.After about 15 minutes with still no drinks we managed to get the attention of the bar back who was really sweet, he was not supposed to take the orders so he just passed along our bottle order to the horrible bartender. He said that she must take our food order so the grumpy woman came over for the second time and snorted something incomprehensible.The food was average at best with a  long black hair in the carpaccio and the service was just terrible. To boot she had added a bottle of wine to our bill, when we told her it was incorrect she just grabbed the bill without hardly speaking a word and changed it.So unless you can get served by the very friendly bar back don&#39;t bother going to this place.

From the hostess at the door, to the busboy, everyone was on point-a perfect balance of helpful, friendly, and professional.And may I mention the food and drinks? The house prosecco was delicious, and the desserts were just lovely (we even got a little bread and spread even though we just ordered dessert).

We didnt mind at all since we&#39;d secured bar seating, but this was definitely appreciated.  We were seated adjacent to the chef&#39;s kitchen where the food made its way out of the kitchen and onto the tables of hungry guests; loud/fast-paced/exciting -- was like dinner and a show! (Not the spot for you if you&#39;re going for intimate/romantic).Food was great; I had the shrimp cavatelli, and my husband had a salad and created a pasta/spicy marinara dish. Wine was plentiful &amp; we had 2 glasses each -- a little pricy, but what do you expect?  Loved the complimentary prosecco toast - we were celebrating our 5-year anniv, so this was such great touch!  For dessert, we debated over tiramisu or cheesecake; at the strong recommendation of our waitress, went w/ the ricotta cheesecake: AMAZING.Only negative: when we done, a server (not our waitress) came to clear our plates. We asked for boxes since we each had about half of our entrees left.  the server took both plates &amp; stacked them and our other plates on top of them -- guess he didn&#39;t hear/understand us. This was a definite bummer since we were both looking fwd to those leftovers :("

It was about 9 o&#39;clock and not to many people in the restaurant at that time... We ordered and was given water to drink.  There was lipstick on the rim of my glass so I asked for another glass of water.  After receiving her food and starting to eat I took one of the sushi rolls from my fiancé,  I noticed a long piece of hair in my sushi.  It wasn&#39;t a human hair that was brown or anything like that, it was some sort of white fiber here like animals hair.  We&#39;re several long pieces of it in the sushi roll.  I had maybe four pieces left of my role and my fiancé had majority of his hairy roll left.  Needless to say we were done with dinner at that point.  I explained to the server that was hair in the sushi roll and I showed her...she offered to remake it we didn&#39;t want to eat there anymore.   She went on to argue with me that it wasn&#39;t a human hair I couldn&#39;t believe she was actually having this conversation, it was not supposed to be in the food point blank.  It&#39;s not a good look to argue with your customer about something that is clearly your fault, apologize and make restitution.We were charged the full price of my order as well as his  and though we could not finish our meal.  That&#39;s just bad business. We paid our bill and quickly left.We will never return... Please check your silverware your glasses to make sure they&#39;re clean properly and check your  sushi roll to make sure there&#39;s no animal hair inside of it if you choose to eat here.  Best of luck to you."

It&#39;s kind of strange they have sushi, along with a plethora of other non-Japanese regular-American-style cafe/diner items.Either way, I had salmon, tamago and quail egg nigiri - all of which tasted fresh and were delicious. They have many unique rolls, many of which have a Chicago or Hyde Park tie in in the name which is fun. Rolling was pretty messy, loose and cuts were not smooth but despite a not so elegant plating and construction, the flavor was still there.I had a wine flight of 3 reds for $8.50 which is about the same as a glass of wine - so why not try some variety!? &#39;Twas a fun thing to try some new wines.Service was attentive and very prompt....bordering on stalkerish. Our server was standing about 10&#39; away because I guess we were taking too long to decide what we wanted to order. Also, while I was still eating, came to clear things for us. It wasn&#39;t anything horrible, server was very nice, just made us feel rushed a bit.Prices weren&#39;t bad, food was good and I&#39;m sure a fabulous option for students nearby.

As a North Sider (yayyyyy Cubs!) I&#39;ve been scared of the Southside since I was a kid. My parents instilled a fear on me about the Southside (and many other things) that I couldn&#39;t shake off. If you don&#39;t count Downtown Chi-town as the south, the only other parts of the Southside I ever witness, being in Chicago for 30+ years is the occasional free White Sox game at US Cellular Field, and Chinatown. Any street that contained numbers ie. 1st, 2nd, etc, was bad news for this timid Chinese guy.But boy, was I wrong! The &#34;hidden&#34; gem of Hyde Park is really nice! This place, located not to far from the University of Chicago, offers a wide-variety of food. They have american soups, sandwiches, pizza (!) and....... sushi.I had a couple of their rolls:Chicago Fire -- Tuna, fresh salmon, super white tuna, avocado, jalapeno, cilantroDrunken Tiger -- Crab, avocado, cucumber roll topped with shrimp and mango tobiko sauceand Tamago / Sweet egg omelet makiAll where very delicious, the rolls had 6-8 pieces and I was somewhat full. They had wine flights too. The service was really good and prompt.BATHROOM REVIEW: Located near the back, adjacent to the waiting station, the bathroom is a single-person bathroom, consisting of a urinal and toilet. The urinal was somewhat high-up, definitely not for the average Asian guy&#39;s height (5&#39;9&#34;) like me, but I managed. The toilet was pretty clean and they had those push-straight-down paper towel dispensers. There was plenty of hand soap and overall the bathroom was clean indeed. Sit or squat? Sit!!"

Sashimi was super THIN cut... was not impressed.The steak sandwich came with a choice of side (veggie chips, fruit, or berries). I got the berries and it was literally 3 raspberries, 1 chopped up strawberry, and 6 blueberries in a bowl. The steak sandwich was very flavorful, and quite light. My friend got the veggie chips in a bowl, and it was literally less than a handful. Pretty meager portions if you ask me...The sushi rolls are not my type. They&#39;re kind of expensive for what you get... you could get much better rolls for the same price at other Chicago restaurants.Service is very slow, even when the restaurant doesn&#39;t look that busy. It took ages before someone even came to take our order, and then again when we were waiting for our food. I saw much sashimi just sitting on the counter for 15 minutes, since it seemed they wanted to bring it over with the rest of our food."

For gluten free in Hyde Park, they are A-OK in my book!First of all, the menu is AMAZING for gluten free options. They have everything from gluten free pizza to bruschetta and sandwiches. I opted for the chicken pesto sandwich, and it was great! The bread was toasted, which masked the fact that it was gluten free, and the pesto, artichoke, tomato, and chicken combined to make a warm sandwich that is BY FAR the best I&#39;ve had in all my gluten free days. My one complaint was that the sandwich was a little oily - as I tried to eat it, oil was dripping all over me! Afterwards, I felt the oil kind of sit in my stomach in that &#34;I&#39;m so stuffed and feel sort of ill&#34; way, but I don&#39;t think that was enough of a negative to not come back for another. Also, each sandwich came with a side of berries, fruit, or chips. The berries were a nice, healthy complement to a tasty sandwich, and they were so fresh!For gluten free in Hyde Park (and anyone visiting the University of Chicago Celiac Center!) I would definitely recommend stopping here to check out the gluten free sandwiches."

If I want to have a late lunch or take out, I will definitely stop by there.What makes me hesitant in bringing some of my friends along with me to Sit Down?1) Inconsistent service- Although the owner is very friendly and helpful, most of the staff neglect the customers&#39; needs, including refilling water and getting the orders correctly.2) Packed at night- Unless you make reservations in advance, do not bring your friends here in the evening. The place is packed, and the wait is brutally long.Sit Down, you are still in the competition, but please improve your service; otherwise, you will be out sooner or later."

Where do people eat in Hyde Park?! Where can I actually get a good meal (not a &#34;good for Hyde Park&#34; meal)?Thankfully now I have a good option.First, I love the concept. Pizza, sandwiches, sushi and salads all in one place? Perfect--everyone can find something they like here.Second, no complaints on the food. I had the blue apple salad (followed Yelpers&#39; suggestion) and the feisty flamingo roll. I&#39;m not typically into bleu cheese and fruit in my salad (yeah, I know), but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. In fact, I&#39;m wishing I was close enough to grab one of these salads today for lunch. The sushi was good (not amazing), and my dining companions&#39; rolls looked very tasty.I hate being people who do this, but our table of five ended up splitting the check (each of us threw down our credit cards), and the wait staff had no problem with it. It&#39;s always nice when they don&#39;t make a big deal about it.The place is really casual and low-key, so not necessarily good for a nice night out. They serve soft drinks from bottles, which I&#39;m not a fan of because it means no free refills.Overall, great meal, and I&#39;ll be back when I&#39;m in the &#39;hood."

What I will say is that the food is of a much higher quality than that Shinju and its menu is much more expansive. From soups to mozzarella sandwiches to sushi and such, it offers a little bit for everyone.I order the tuna roll and a spider roll and both were pretty good. They weren&#39;t anywhere near the best sushi I have ever had, but were at least made much better than Shinju, With that said though, they were way over priced and I spent $14 on a dinner that I wasn&#39;t even too full from.The food is good and service is fine and it is also BYOB with a corking fee. I just think that it could be a bit cheaper because a lot of the food like the sandwiches and pizza are not that great."

And don&#39;t get me started with the fact that the service is worthy of being presented at a seminar.

The sushi is very average, slightly better than what you would find at a grocery store. Salads, pizzas, and sandwiches,too, are average. While I am not crazy about the fact that they have a menu that features sushi as well as American/Italian style options (since I think its better to do one thing well than two things jus OK), its pretty good when you want to go out with friends who can&#39;t agree on what they want to eat, or who are a little afraid of sushi.But all in all, this is just an average quality restaurant, and nothing to write home about."

They make an effort with plating and quality of fish is the best in Hyde Park, although not particularly outstanding.Overall, mediocre sashimi/sushi in a pretty casual atmosphere.

You&#39;d expect it to be super authentic as a sushi bar, but it seems pretty westernized. They also serve sandwiches and pizza. I&#39;m pretty fond of their food, but I&#39;ve only really had their sushi.They have a decently sized sushi menu with affordable prices. I&#39;ve had most of the house maki, especially the spicy options and I can say they are all delicious. My favorite is the Super Crunchy, but the Spicy Crab and the Chicago Fire are also excellent choices. The sushi is delivered within minutes of ordering, which is basically what I expect whenever I order sushi. The prices for the more exciting options are about $9-14 but all the more traditional sushi options are less than $5. The serving size is quite good.In addition to the sushi, I&#39;ve tried the miso soup is pretty good and pepper bruchetta. The miso soup hit the spot but it could be better. The pepper brushetta on the other hand is absolutely delicious. The give a lot of topping for the amount of bread you get. Highly recommend that as an appetizer.If you&#39;re a UChicago student, make sure to identify yourself. You get a 10% discount that Student Government worked hard to secure.

I consistently crave the Blue Apple and Old World salads, as well as the Chicken Pesto sandwich (add some spicy mayo to it... just trust me.) The Super Crunchy roll and prosciutto pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil are also ridiculous.Also, don&#39;t miss the roasted red pepper bruschetta and shrimp and rice appetizer. I&#39;ve long tried to replicate both in my own kitchen, but they&#39;ll never be as good as Sal&#39;s recipes.On that note, the owners and managers of this restaurant are basically the nicest people you could ever meet, and they&#39;ll do anything and everything to make sure you leave the place completely satisfied.A final note: The prices here are extremely reasonable. Anyone who says it&#39;s &#34;overpriced&#34; is either a) a cheap-ass, b) too broke to be going out for dinner and c) unconcerned with quality.

But, they seem to do it very well. Unlike Shinju that is down the street, they have a bar...which always makes a place a plus in my book. As most people who know me will tell you, I&#39;m all about the alcohol. Not in a drunky way, but just a &#39;loving my drank&#39; way.Anyway, I haven&#39;t done anything but get sushi here.

Cocktails are nice and strong and there&#39;s a reasonably priced wine menu.Never have to wait for a table (maybe on a Saturday night?). Service is always friendly. Rarely (but occasionally) slow. The bus boys are always on top of the water and taking away dirty plates. The owner is nice and obviously really cares about doing a good job. (And he&#39;s a south-sider.)My only suggestion would be to dim the lights. Maybe some candles on the table for dinner. The bright atmosphere at night makes if feel more like a lunchtime venue, and less like a place for a date (though we do still go here for dates!).Give the menu a chance -- there&#39;s a lot on it, so you need to explore to find your faves."

They didn&#39;t have lemonade which forced me to order soda.2.) the glass for my water was dirty(quite disgusting)3.) the soda came in a small bottle, not much for what I was paying for4.) I ordered a type of sushi I thought the waitress understood but didn&#39;t so when I didn&#39;t enjoy it I got charged for it.Horrible in my opinion. Usually if you aren&#39;t a satisfied customer you don&#39;t get charged for it. Never will they get my money again. The sit down is a pure RIP OFF"

But ALAS!! real sushi does not include cream cheese...so i asked them not to have that in thereI got the super crunchy...forgot what I ordered as I was eating, because it was neither super nor crunchy...it was ooookkkk. Also got the spicy tuna, ppfff....I have had much much better.

At least not any recognizable fish and certainly not what was advertised. I seriously thought I&#39;d gotten the wrong dish. I was too embarrassed to say anything (I was with someone who I&#39;d convinced to come down to HP because we have good restaurants! And it&#39;s fun!

He ordered the Hyde Park (salmon, asparagus, green onions, cream cheese, tempura fried topped w/ sweet soy sauce), which was on him, because, really, cream cheese??, but he admitted later tasted like canned fish.

Both of us thought the sandwiches were too small only tasted okay. The vegetable was definitely the better of the two, but Cheesie&#39;s definitely does the caprese better and bigger. You also only get a tiny side of either chips or fruit. For $8 per snadwich before tax, we did not think we got nearly enough food, especially when compared to other sandwich places, and both of us left hungry.

Meat, peppers, cheese and onion *drools* wrapped in a crispy deep fried tortilla. It comes with sour cream, fries and lettuce. The sour cream is perfect to cut through all the richness in that sandwhich. It also comes with lemonade and they have different flavours to pick from. The portion is huge I couldn&#39;t finish all the food by myself. Overall great concept, executed well. The only reason I didn&#39;t give this place 5 stars is because the fries suck I didn&#39;t even eat them and they could clean the place up a bit. Windex the widows and stuff.

I also think it adds character paying for your meal through the bullet proof glass, the police car parked in front, and the beautiful blue lights that adorn the neighborhood. Okay I&#39;ll stop...  :)Now onto the food...reasonably priced! I ordered the gyro, but they were out so had to go with the chicken gyro combo instead. Pretty decent sandwich and I like the lemon pepper on the fries. My friend ordered the 10 piece wings. He said they were greasy, but delicious! My favorite part is you get to pick between like 10 flavors of lemonade to go with your combo meal (taste like a slushy) I chose the piña colada and OMG delicious!!
