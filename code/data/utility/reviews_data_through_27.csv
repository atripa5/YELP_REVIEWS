The house specialty is seafood, specifically gargantuan king crab legs.  These are no joke.  We got three orders of those and one order of massive fried shrimp.  No one left hungry.Eat inside or outside on their patio.Good selection of libations but be warned of 2 things- the inside is an absolute dive ( OK with me) and they take cash only.  Since the bills can be fairly steep this is important to know.If you need a seafood fix in an absolute no frills environment check this spot out!"

Parking is tough and it&#39;s pay to park if you end up getting lucky. It&#39;s buried in the corner and way underneath like a garden apartment. It&#39;s small so when it gets packed it can be pretty crowded.Service was okay. What I like most is they have great deals on pitchers and they give you huge pitchers of beer.It&#39;s cash only and it can be over 100.00 if you&#39;re eating with another party and you&#39;re getting crab legs. Can&#39;t do separate checks/split in half. The crab legs were good but not much meat. It does taste fresh and is quality I just hate doing so much work for hardly any crab meat.They give you a plate of legs, fries and comes with a lollipop. Pretty random, I can do without the lolli.If you&#39;re a fan of seafood and vintage you should make it your life&#39;s mission to at least try it once. It&#39;s pretty old school and has been around since the 70s-very cool ambiance."

We waited more than 30 mins before the food was served... While we checked with the server about food, he was really impatient and rude.However, I have to admit that the food was worth the waiting. But my recommendation is that skip the combo and just order the king crab legs. Because although the crab meat taste really good, snow crab has really thin legs and the meat you get from it is not worth the effort of taking the meat out of it...Will come back to try the oyster. Hopefully we will get better service next time.btw, it&#39;s CASH ONLY..."

The restaurant itself is pretty small, but the seafood is as fresh as it can get.I was here the first time I visited Chicago. Slightly disappointed after trying some steak (at a different restaurant) that is supposed to be so good in Chi-town, we decided to indulge in some king crab and snow crab special here. The crab legs slip right out of the shell (fresh-alert!) and the melted butter makes everything perfect. Tried the crab cakes and fried fish baskets as well, but if you&#39;re on a budget, I would recommend skipping those and going straight for the fresh seafood.This place had such a good impression on me that when I visited the University of Notre Dame a year later, I just had to drive back to Chicago from Indiana to eat at the Half Shell. Didn&#39;t disappoint the second time around--I&#39;ll be back!The atmosphere is super laid-back with dim lights and loud customers at the bar. Wouldn&#39;t recommend for a large meeting group because it can get pretty loud in there, but great for casual meals."

Oh sorry dude,didnt know it was bring your baby to work day ,sorry for intruding on your father /baby bonding time GTFOH !!The Crab legs were delicious ,I cant deny that . But I just cant see myself coming here again based on the crappy service and treatment of customersNeedless to say my boyfriend and I ended up getting into a fight with each other on the way out because we somehow felt the need to take our anger out on someone and he was especially pissed  that he spent that much for such shitty service and was still nice enough to tip."

SO, just go to the Chase ATM at the Walgreens around the corner.Half Shell is a rare gem of a spot in Lincoln Park/Lakeview that serves up fresh seafood without breaking the bank. My friend and I showed up at Saturday opening time at exactly noon but saw none of the outside tables were set up so we killed time around the nearby stores until 12:15. We grew impatient and walked into the bar where they told us that outside dining wasn&#39;t available yet. It was a beauuutiful day in Chicago, but we were hungry so we opted to sit in rather gloomy interior of Half Shell. (Couple minutes later they started offering patio seating, boo). I think if we had sat outside, my review would have been a 5 star, but the ambiance inside was depressing at the hour we went.But obviously, you come to Half Shell for the seafood, so let me break it down for you: AH-maxing.Six Blue Point Oysters for $8.70 - not the meatiest, but fresh and a great appetizerClam Chowder - hearty and hit the spot! Would definitely order againSnow and King Crab Special for $32 - comes with fries, random veggies and toastThe crab legs were top-knotch quality and when paired with their butter sauce...magical! My roommate and I were rolling our eyes in utter satisfactionAll this food was more than enough to split for two hungry girls and we had no complaints (minus no outside seating)! We are definitely Half Shell fans and I would recommend this to anyone in Chicago who wants delicious, fresh seafood without having to pay the $$$ price that usually accompanies it."

Everything he (server) brought to our table he SLAMMED on the table and disappeared for long periods of time. Even when it was time to pay the bill he act like he didn&#39;t see us trying to get his attention. He turned around and walked away as if he was a guest there. My mom&#39;s friend ordered crab cakes and they were so burned that the taste of crab wasn&#39;t there. My aunts perch was burned and didn&#39;t have much fish out of it and her fries were literally soaking in grease! This place was so unpleasant and unfriendly!!! They should be ashamed of the food they serve and service they give! I wish I could report this to higher authority

A colleague and I asked a cabbie to take us to some chain crab shack, probably near the Pier. He looked at us in an odd manner and then said, &#34;Let me take you somewhere for some REAL seafood. If you don&#39;t like it, I&#39;ll take you somewhere else for free.&#34; He dropped us off in front of this teeny little basement bar, where we went in and proceeded to have the best crab of our lives.I couldn&#39;t remember the name or address of this nondescript little joint, so it took me many years to find it again. Once the internet was popular, I came to yelp, did a quick search, and I knew I had the right place instantly. My husband had been listening to me reminisce for years, and once I brought him, he knew why. The seafood couldn&#39;t be more fresh unless it was right off the boat. It&#39;s delicious, the price is quite reasonable, and the fare is equal to any coastal place we&#39;ve been. No frills, no muss, no fuss...just darn good food."

I walked in of course it is a dive bar I understand, but in was chuckling as I was walking in because of how disgusting jt looked. It&#39;s in a rly fine neighborhood and it&#39;s just ratchet. Appears like a stripclib... We walked in to perhaps the owners managers whoever, idk but they were playing poker... Very standoffish. Made a comment about giving me a menu for to go... The restaurant was literally empty. I understand it&#39;s a Thursday evening but fish bar was nearly full. This place was dead. With poker playing benchmen standing guard. Walked right out n went to portillos in downers grove.Go to any grocery store in the suburbs. King crab by the pound fr 30$. Guaranteed freshest you&#39;ll get.

Unfortunately if you want a diverse selection of seafood, this may not be the place for you.This place is basically located in what seems to be a former garden unit of a building. Pretty much a dive bar with seating off to the left as you enter. I was waiting on my buddy and the guy behind the bar was pretty funny as he told me to take my hat off as I entered (there is actually a sign that tells you to as well). He was pretty cool in entertaining everyone who walked in. Once my buddy showed up we got a seat and the server was as cool as the guy behind the bar as he was full of jokes.The menu is quite strange as everything seems to be bunched together and weird to follow. We didn&#39;t see a lot that was of interest except all the crab specials but we knew we would be drinking later and crab legs wouldn&#39;t be enough. We got some appetizers until we figured out what we wanted to go with in terms of entrees. We got the fried shrimp and calamari...the shrimp was decent and the calamari was damn good. We kept looking at the menu and didn&#39;t see anything we liked so we trekked it up to Glenn&#39;s Diner on Montrose for a more robust seafood menu.

This was one of the worst meals I have ever had.Fried squid appetizer: no salt at all. Isn&#39;t one of the main points of frying to hit the freshly fried items with salt as soon as they are taken out of the fryer? These were so unbelievably bland. Some really really really chewy pieces too (aka not fresh). The sauces that came with it were not any good eitherFried catfish filet: soooo much breading I was taking the breading off. The pictures on here look like the dishes have very light breaking but that was not the case. Also no salt at all!! The plate had 2 pieces of toast on it, a tomato, a hot pickle because the fries were dumped on top of it (yuck), and a lollipop, all covered in fries. Not sure the point of all the bread, I didn&#39;t eat any of it and it was half burnt half soggy. Was I supposed to use it to make a catfish sandwich? I&#39;m not sure. The pickle was nasty because it was hot from the fries. The dish felt kind of dirty with a wrapped lollipop also hidden under the fries, just felt weird. The fries again had no salt at all and I would much rather have McDonald&#39;s fries than this. Every aspect was horrible.The fried perch - same overall dish structure (lollipop, hot pickle, useless burnt and soggy bread, unsalted and tasteless fries) but the perch was slightly better in terms of less breading.Would never ever recommend this place!"

Their outside patio is super cute, but that said, there was no open space for the 4 of us, so we went downstairs to get inside and saw several open tables.The bartender, an older gentleman yelled asking us how many and told us to &#34;sit in the corner.&#34; Not very pleasant, but almost funny. Our waiter, another older gentleman with little concern for us asked us what we wanted to drink and quickly walked away once he realized we didn&#39;t yet know.Around this time we noticed it was a CASH ONLY place. My husband left to get cash from the Walgreens down the street since there was an ATM sign in the bar but we couldn&#39;t actually find it.My husband and I split the lobster bisque (too pureed for a bisque in my opinion and mostly cream rather than lobster) and split the cold steamed jumbo shrimps and cold King Crab Legs. Both were so amazingly fresh I had to keep reminding myself we were in Chicago. I&#39;ve had seafood on both coasts of the US and this was some of the best. It&#39;s almost unreal. The shrimp was amazingly meatful, which means a lot coming from me since I get picky about shrimp. I would go back in a heartbeat.My friend ordered the fried catfish which came with fries and it looks fantastically done. He and his girlfriend also ordered some oysters, and while I&#39;m not an oyster fan, they said they were fresh and fantastic as well.Definitely somewhere you&#39;d want to go if you&#39;re a seafood fanatic. Just don&#39;t expect to be treated like royalty, the staff is a fun experience!"

Maybe because it&#39;s king crab season in winter or maybe it&#39;s my love of the  tiny, dive bar feel with Christmas lights and all, but just the thought of hot steaming king crab legs in the dead of winter makes me smile.We went last night and the food consistently exceeds expectations. I stick to the steamed king crab, although Ive really enjoyed the oysters. The fried calamari isn&#39;t my favorite, only because I prefer the light tempura batter for squid, but the fried shrimp is a thumbs up.For first timers, don&#39;t be shy and head straight to the bar and ask for a table. If you don&#39;t, no one is coming to you - its a legit crab-slingin joint.As for the drinks (and the only reason for 4 stars) is the lack of wine. They have plenty of beers and every liquor you could imagine but I love wine (and love wine with seafood), so only wish they&#39;d stock some mediocre wines - the 2 choices of Woodbridge and Coastal are rough.Regardless, we are loyal and consistent diners of half shell!"

The host (who may have been the owner) was extremely friendly. However, the service is the reason Nookie&#39;s gets 2 stars.In town wth my family, the server is no where to be found close to 10 mins after being seated. Thankfully the bus boy could tell we were agitated and felt bad so he came over to ask us for drink orders and fill waters. Minutes later, he could tell we were still searching for our waiter so he came over and asked if we had been helped yet. When we said no, you could tell he was embarrassed and searched for the server.The server comes over, as if he were agitated he was being asked to do his job, and says &#34;what will you have today?&#34; Perhaps an acceptance that you&#39;re busy and running slightly behind and an apology would help defuse. The remainder of the brunch, he&#39;s short, and overall unfriendly. As we walk out, he walks past us, makes eye contact and you would think this would be a good time to thank us for coming in. Ha, you knew that wasn&#39;t coming. Silence instead.Of course I mentioned it to the owner as we walked out. I told him, I understand places get busy and perhaps you&#39;re short staffed; however, this is NOT the type of service you would ever want to hold your own business accountable to.

We had stopped by here on Sunday just past noon and the place was bumpin&#39;! We had to hang out for 20 minutes or so for a table of two but no biggie as the hanger didn&#39;t quite hit in yet.Once seated, I ordered their huevos con chorizo which consisted of scrambled eggs, Mexican chorizo sausage, potatoes, &amp; chihuahua cheese and served with a side of rice, beans, and flour tortillas. I think the biggest disappointment was the chorizo which was pretty unrecognizable as chorizo to be honest. Sort of just tasted like deconstructed sausage and was pretty bland overall. Eggs were cooked well as were as the potatoes and I ended up constructing two mini breakfast burritos with the tortillas. But overall still kind of meh.I think the biggest attraction for this place is the fact they are a diner that is BYOB. Just about every other table or so had a bottle of champagne popped and another table even brought a full handle of grey goose and an arsenal of mixers. Those guys knew what&#39;s up! Other than that the food wasn&#39;t very good in my opinion, and there were at least a dozen fruit flies buzzing around our table which kind of made me lose my appetite.Anyways, hard to say I&#39;ll be back on this one. &#39;Til next time!"

Most of the time I feel like I can make a pretty good breakfast at home, for half the price, and without the wait. But today was different. After a 5k in Lincoln Park, a friend offered to treat and I suggested walking over to Nookies. A little before 10 o&#39;clock, we only had to wait 5 minutes to be seated at a table for 2. I was actually surprised to find the place is bigger than it looks and has 3 different rooms, able to accommodate groups of all sizes. I also noticed lots of kids and families, along with younger people enjoying (byoc) mimosas - a good crowd mix overall.So after settling in with our coffee (I mean, first thing&#39;s first!), we perused the myriad of menu options and decided to split 2 dishes: the combo crepes and the artichoke frittata with hash browns. Both were super delicious. I especially loved the strawberry and sweet cheese flavors for the crepes. And the frittata with hash browns was a really decent serving size for your money.

Base boards were caked with debris, there were cob webs around the lights, floors needed vacuumed and shampooed.Food... let&#39;s see...The chicken noodle soup was hot and tasted okay but was out of a can. My husband said his salad tasted like an old fridge. We both ordered the maple smoked chicken, with mashed potatoes and veggies. The food was VERY plentiful and very hot. However, the gravy on the potatoes sort of tasted like dog food, but the potatoes were good. The steamed veggies were good. The chicken was kind of dry and had not the best flavor. In all, it is comparable to any other standard diner food. I will probably not be back, because when we go to chicgao, we typically like a bit tastier food.Ps.. the prices were a tad on the high side. 16 dollars for each chicken dinner. But that&#39;s chicgao, I guess."

None of it was bad but there wasn&#39;t anything remarkable or memorable about the food. It is BYOB so we did enjoy making our mimosas once we got a carafe of OJ.The main motivations I&#39;d consider for visiting Nookies in Old Town:-Location (quaint neighborhood)-BYOB (can&#39;t knock BYOBs!)-Minimal to no wait time for Saturday morning brunch (strolled in at 11AM)-Friendly staffThe missing component is food that knocks your socks off!

We were starving so we shared an appetizer of the winter sampler special (Pancakes, Lemon bread, and something else....see pic below). All of them were sweet and delicious.

But, it was jammed with 20+ minute waits both days - not bad.  But . . .Both days we weren&#39;t offered our first coffee refill until we were almost done eating; and weren&#39;t offered a second refill at all.The Mexican skillet with chorizo was very homogeneous and tasted like and had the consistency of processed factory food almost like baby food.  It all seemed squeezed out of a Kirkland bag and microwaved. Yuk.But we gave it a second shot the next day and ordered  Eggs Benedict - by far the worst we&#39;ve ever had.  The Hollandaise sauce on the menu was replaced by a disgusting lemon sauce (on Eggs Benedict!).  Sweet/sour rather than savory sauce on poached eggs??  We had to bathe it in hot sauce to choke it down.  The eggs were not at all tasty, and a little soggy.  The Canadian bacon had barely touched a pan - seemed like it was dropped onto the English muffin straight out of a cold package.  The English muffin too was so lightly toasted it seemed dropped onto the plate from the package.  All of it looked and tasted like it was assembled from packages rather than home cooked.  No care at all was given to making this meal, and it was unpleasant to eat.  That&#39;s a disgrace in any event, but at an average ticket of $20 per person, it&#39;s also a crime.  Just plain gross."

We had a 12 o&#39;clock reservation and our party of 15 arrived on time. When you make a reservation there&#39;s an expectation that your table will be ready when you arrive but we still ended up waiting nearly 45 minutes to be seated. That&#39;s unacceptable in my opinion. What&#39;s the point of even making a reservation if you&#39;re still going to have to wait anyway?We finally got seated and had to wait another 15 minutes or so for menus. We were seated at two different tables that were adjacent to each other. However we weren&#39;t served at the same rate of speed. One table had finished eating their food before the other table had even been served!! Luckily everyone was good natured about it and went with the flow.I ordered pancakes, bacon and eggs. There was a special for about  $9 but the server rang everything al a carte which ended up being more expensive. I was annoyed but I didn&#39;t complain. There were too many of us even bother with it.The service was ok. Our waiter was efficient but he was like a robot. He wasn&#39;t personable at all. He took the orders, dropped off the food and that was it. He never came back to check on us or anything.The food was ok. The pancakes were overcooked so they were dry and tough to cut. The eggs and bacon were edible but nothing special. Overall, I just wasn&#39;t impressed. Even still I&#39;d be inclined to give the place another shot. The location is convenient and the environment is cozy enough.Even though everyone in the group was unimpressed by the lackluster service we still tipped the waiter well over 20%.

What can I say I had such a delightful experience this afternoon for brunch. This was my first visit but I heard many nice things about Nookies. I was surprised to find out how large the place actually was since it looks small from the outside. I love the small diner vibe and it seems like this is a family business which I always love about a place because you can feel that lovin&#39; energy when you&#39;re there and it definitely reflects on the service and food. I ordered the Spring sampler special (pancake, french toast, and a some other sweet bread), it was fantastic! My boyfriend ordered the Paris benedict (broiche, bacon, asparagus, egg, and a gruyere gravy) - phenomenal. This meal may have been one of my best brunch experiences ever.I have to note that the service was really great. The host(s) were incredibly sweet and accommodating. My boyfriend dropped me off at the front so I could put our name down while he looked for parking and the host was kind enough to just let me know that as soon as my bf walked in he would have our table ready, I was surprised to even find out that there was no wait!

The front looks like a more traditional American diner from a time long gone, with the U shaped seating around a main &#34;bar&#34; and stools for seating.  There is also regular tables stretching into a back room. We were seated at a table.I think one of the main rules of thumb for any customer at any establishment (at least for me) is to judge the place by the cleanliness of the bathroom... Dirty bathroom.... most likely dirty kitchen - maybe poor food handling on top of it.  If staff can&#39;t keep the bathroom decent why would they have the discipline to maintain a quality kitchen?  The bathroom at Nookies was a mess. There was garbage on the floors, the soap taken out of the dispenser and placed on the sink, water running for no apparent reason, and unappealing toilets. The handle was broken and would not flush.  Does this make you want to then go into their dining room and eat their food?Nookies serves up breakfast and lunch. Hubs ordered the Belgian waffle, I ordered the Frisco grilled chicken sandwich with cottage fries.  It was not served the way it was described on the menu.  It is supposed to be served with Romaine, it was served with iceburg. Not only that, but it was served with the large white &#34;stalk&#34; of the iceburg, not the actual lettuce.  It was plain, boring, and I could have made a far superior sandwich at home.  The Belgian waffle was so basic, nothing special at all. If I can make it better at home I feel I&#39;ve wasted my money going to a restaurant for it.Next up.... the diners next to us waved our shared waiter over, and whispered something in his ear. Naturally I was intrigued. I paid attention to their table and watched as the waiter casually walked over to a wall the diner was pointing to, and proceeded to smash a roach.  He then stated &#34;oh those ones aren&#39;t as bad as the others I&#39;ve seen.&#34;Appetite lost completely."

There was a long line of folks waiting which was a good sign the food was worthy of the wait. Twenty minutes after checking in we were seated and were eating ten minutes later. I ordered the special, a Mexican chicken stew with white beans and chilis topped with poached eggs - very hearty and delicious. My daughter enjoyed her pecan waffle and side of fruit and devoured the whole thing. Service was very friendly and efficient from welcoming us at the door to settling our bill.

Loved this place! 5 stars from me, 4 from the husband.We walked up and I loved it from the start. Very cute and has a nice patio area; we knew it was gonna be good because of the amount of people standing around outside waiting for tables. We figured we would be out there waiting for awhile- but it was only 10-15 minutes, just as the host had said.We were seated inside. The place has such a great diner feel- but different because its a bit more classy. Our waitress was super friendly and kind, and took great care of us!Thanks to other Yelp reviews, we got the fresh squeezed orange juice... it was SO GOOD. We are from Florida and recently moved here to Chicago. THIS is the stuff Floridians live for. It was perfect. We also enjoyed watching the juicing machine. They were putting whole oranges in, peel and all, and juice came pouring out. Intriguing.I ordered the Chili-Avocado fritatta with hash browns. It was phenomenal and such a huge portion, I barely finished half. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan on the hash- kinda tasteless and needed quite a bit off pepper. I didn&#39;t eat much of it. The fritatta though. Oh. My. Word. I wanna eat that for breakfast every morning. Just as the waitress described it- a bed of eggs with chili, all this awesome melted cheese, and avocado. Yum.My husband had the Bistro burger. Bleu cheese and carmelized onions on a 1/4 lb beef patty. He really liked it, although it wasn&#39;t exactly cooked how he had asked. He asked for medium, and it came out almost well done. Not a huge deal, and he was starving and just wanted to eat, haha. Overall he said it was a pretty good burger.One thing that my husband would like me to add is that he was so sad he didn&#39;t order the huge stuffed french toast stuff we saw come out of the kitchen soo many times. Seriously, he is very remorseful.We will definitely be back to Nookies (can I just mention how much I love that name?! so cute) and we will have to try the french toast :)"

I would probably give it 3.5 stars if that was an option because it wasn&#39;t bad (I would go back) but it also wasn&#39;t anything exceptional either--it&#39;s just a standard brunch/American spot.My boyfriend and I split the tuna melt and an omelet. The tuna melt was pretty good (classic tuna on an english muffin with melted american cheese), but nothing that I couldn&#39;t make easily at home. The omelet was great: huge, veggie-stuffed and super cheesy, but again, nothing different than any other omelet I&#39;ve had at a brunch place. With our orders, we also got a side of onion rings (yummy but greasy) and hash-browns (eh, only okay, I&#39;ve had better).One particularly frustrating/bizarre thing about our meal was that the tuna melt comes with a side of chicken &amp; rice soup, but we are vegetarian. We told the waiter that we can&#39;t eat meat and asked to sub it for a side salad or a different side instead, but the waiter told us: &#34;no, we can&#39;t do that because the soup is just complimentary.&#34; Seriously, what&#39;s up with that?

The pork ones are my favorite- shoutout to Pedro, who is in charge of the tacos and also mans the grill! If you ask really nicely, maybe Frank (sandwich/ salad master) will make you shrimp tacos that are absolutely divine. :)My other favorites include the blackened chicken sandwich, Jamaican jerk chicken on pita (with the most amazing homemade mango/ pineapple chutney), and the tommy boy sandwich (roast beef panini with some sort of secret sauce). The salads here are also huge and will leave you feeling good about yourself, until you spot the freshly baked peanut butter cookies (2 for $1).... How can anybody turn away?The people working here at the Refectory are so incredibly kind and they truly care about making delicious food with a focus on locally sourced produce.

The tacos are prewrapped and placed in warming bins according to the meat contents. Each taco is $2 and there&#39;s a condiment bar with all the fixin&#39;s. Pico and guacamole are extra (but worth the 35 cents, or whatever it was) and can be found near the cashier. For a prewrapped taco, they were pretty decent. All the tacos are corn tortilla so the later you are getting one the more likely you&#39;ll get a soggy yet dry taco. So get there early for the best results!Like all the other reviews have mentioned, everything is homemade and all the produce is fresh.They had homemade pumpkin bread ice cream sandwiches, how could I resist? I got one to go and it was still in great shape after my 15 min walk home. Once again, for being made hours ahead of time, it was pretty tasty.Other than tacos on Tuesdays, they have specials all week. The menu is posted near the condiment station. They also have sandwiches, salads, and burgers.For a simple, fast, and fresh lunch, give it a go!"

The food was pretty good - I had a caesar salad with salmon. However, the value for the money was not great. The caesar salad was $12, and the salmon was $11. The salmon was approximately 3 ounces; sadly, for $11 I was hoping for more.Service was attentive, but assumptive too. My dining companion had about half a salad left over, and it was whisked away to the trash before we could even grab the busser to let him know that she wanted it wrapped. We weren&#39;t consulted as to how we wanted to split the check, the server just assumed it was evenly (which was what we wanted, but my companion did have a more expensive entree so it would&#39;ve been nice to have been asked). The dining room ambiance was good for lunch, but our server spoke very quietly and was hard to hear over the din of conversation.I&#39;ll be back to try again, given the location and the quality of the food."

For starters we got the shrimp cocktail.  They usually are one 1/2 pound shrimp per order.  They were out unfortunately so we ended up getting 4 quarter pound shrimp instead.  They were very good however.  They had denser feel than other regular shrimp and definitely a lobstery taste. Very good.  They make their own cocktail sauce also, delish!  My husband got a salad and I went for the the decadent French Onion soup.  It was amazing.  so cheesy, sweet onions, a good size piece of bread.For dinner, I ordered the Prime Rib Medium, and he ordered the ribeye medium.  This was the part I was a little disappointed in.  They were out of my prime rib except for an end cut which I was told was medium to medium well.  Unfortunately it was well done.  It was tough and I was bummed about that. I would have sent it back however it was the only piece in the house and I didn&#39;t want to cause an issue.  The accompaniments of horseradishes were super good.  Hubby&#39;s ribeye was more medium rare than medium, but the flavor was really good.  We probably should have sent it back but we were having a good time so we didn&#39;t.  Our sides were mashed potatoes with horseradish, they were good but lacked horseradish flavor.  The mac and cheese was decadent for sure.  Really good.For dessert you have to try the S&#39;mores. out comes a chocolate  sphere.  They pour this super hot chocolate sauce on it and the sphere melts giving way to the toasted marshmallow and homemade graham layered with brownie and ice cream.  It is sooooo good. You HAVE to try that if you come here.  It&#39;s a special item."

Haven&#39;t seen that before and it was pretty delish... Paired with sides of whipped potatoes (amazing- next time I&#39;m not sharing) and brussel sprouts (only miss for me, flavor was muted and skippable)Somehow found room for dessert and shared the creme brûlée, which was super smooth and definitely one to reorder...Lost star because the seating was really awkward - was there for girls night out and we were seated in a really shallow side booth where the two of us were basically side by side looking out at the table in front of us and so had to turn in our seats to talk to each other.  Even worse was that everyone walking by kept bumping into the table due to the spacing.  It got annoying pretty quickly especially when our drinks kept nearly spilling over...

The first I cooked myself, so really you can&#39;t compare. The potatoes were cheesy and delicious, and the thick bits of bacon made every last brussel scrumptious.After that we were pretty stuffed, so we skipped on dessert, but decided that we must return another time for more of everything.Thanks for being so accommodating, the great food and terrific service."

Attentive service, with experienced severs that took the time to go over their menu and make suggestions, they explained the concept of their restaurant, which steaks were dry aged, and that they&#39;re natural and all prime, humanely raised, never exposed to hormones, pesticides or antibiotics. You can read more on it from their website.We started with a sharable chopped salad, which the kitchen will gladly divide for two, they even recommend it for two, so don&#39;t be shy and have them plate it that way. For my main I had the petite filet with a peppercorn crust, this is not for you if you only like a little pepper, this packs a full pepper taste that will flavor the steak as you chew, it definitely is a marriage of flavors. Roasted brussel sprouts with bacon, as a side, also perfect. Dessert was worth every calorie, my tequila lime creation alone would bring me back, tart, sweet, light and chilled, yes and more for me please.A great dining experience, from the service, food and the company that told me where and when to show up for dinner.

After perusing Yelp for awhile, we found that P&amp;P offers on one of those chocolate balls that you pour more chocolate on and it melts away, then there&#39;s MORE dessert inside! YUP! Like those little moves you scroll past on FB or IG, but in real life!So basically, we spent the evening running around drinking and eating, knowing P&amp;P would be our last stop for dessert...and drinks of course!It was late when the taxi dropped us off, we were slightly worried we&#39;d gotten there too late. However, once we walked in we were greeted by the Hostess. She said we still had time and we asked to sit in the bar area. There were more patrons, hidden back in their dining area.We got down to business, asking for the dessert and drink menus. That&#39;s all we were there for. The name of the fun interactive dessert does not do it justice, it&#39;s call the &#39;Tableside Smores&#39;.  That name sounds so boring, BUT the dessert interaction is nothing of the sorts. To be fair, the experience of the dessert was actually better than the taste of the actual dessert. It was okay, but it wasn&#39;t amazing. But I&#39;d pay to watch that chocolate sauce melt the choco bomb any time!The dessert that killed the game was actually the Peanut Butter &amp; Whipped Milk Chocolate Pie. It. Was. Amazing! Seriously, if I wasn&#39;t sharing with four other people, I would have killed that thing myself. The lovely PB flavor, with a very light chocolate flavor was the perfect blend. Also, the crust was delicious and a crunchy compliment to the dessert. There were little balls of goodness sprinkled on top and they added textural goodness to the dessert. This dessert is amazing and if you don&#39;t order it, then you failed me miserably!A dessert expereince you don&#39;t want to miss!"

The second time around was an amazing experience with delectable food all around!I want to give huge thanks to Ken for reaching out to me and making sure we had a wonderful experience this time! We most certainly did. Not many restaurants will demonstrate that level of customer service.We started off with a plate of four bread rolls that were served with butter that had a hint of lemon flavor. They were so good that I wanted to finish all the rolls. However, my boyfriend stopped me from stuffing the last roll into my mouth and warned that we had plenty of food coming. I&#39;m glad he did because I became full 1/10 of the way for the main entree and couldn&#39;t even get to dessert!We had a huge seafood appetizer platter that came with oysters, crab legs, lobster, and two MASSIVE shrimps (almost like these shrimps completely devoured five other shrimps each!!). The seafood were all very fresh and went well with the dipping sauces provided, which were cocktail sauce, mustard, vinaigrette, and horseradish sauce.Next, we each had the clam chowder soup. This is hands down probably one of the best clam chowder soups you&#39;ll have in Chicago. It wasn&#39;t too salty or creamy and had chunks of clams in it. They don&#39;t skimp on the clams like other restaurants!For our main entree, we had the rib eye steak. This was the most marbled cut of steak on the menu, so don&#39;t order it if you want a lean steak. I loved the rib eye steak because it was so flavorful, cooked to perfection, came with a giant bulb of garlic, and is top grade without added hormones. Very succulent!For the sides, we ordered the cauliflower and brussel sprouts. Both were delicious and charred just the right amount. The cauliflower is actually purple and in its original state. The restaurant tries to use vegetables in their natural state (a.k.a. non-GMO). Love, love, love.By the time we got to the steak and sides, we were both already full and sitting there struggling to finish our food. I immediately regretted wearing a form-fitting dress at that point. We ended up taking the steaks and sides to go.I really wish we could have tried dessert, but our stomachs just wouldn&#39;t allow it. Instead, we opted for espresso and tea. I got the chamomile tea, which was a nice finishing touch to the meal.As for the service, Brandy (our server) and Tommy were both wonderful and exceeded expectations. Brandy made great suggestions for us when it came to ordering and checked on us at the right times throughout the night. Tommy checked on us multiple times to make sure we were doing okay or needed anything.I highly recommend going to this restaurant!"

Even though the weather was less than ideal...the service, drinks, food and dessert were all on point. A solid 4 stars for Prime &amp; Provisions! I&#39;ll be going back for sure.ServiceFrom the moment we walked in we were greeted with smiles, hellos and head nods of acknowledgement. Our server David L was friendly, provided great recommendations and made sure we were well taken care of. (5 stars)DrinksThe drinks were strong and delicious. Maybe I&#39;ve become a lightweight, but after my first drink I was already feeling buzzed. That means the bartender understands that when someone is paying $14 for a drink, he/she wants to know there is booze in that glass! We had The Last Word and Prime Southside and had to order a second round they were so good. (4 stars)FoodEverything we ate we loved...except for the Mac &amp; Cheese. (4 stars for the entire meal)* Thick-Cut Bacon: Very good, especially with the dark chocolate sauce. However, I would have liked more meat and less fat. (4 stars)* French Onion Soup: I mean how can you go wrong with this?! It was really good, however, I wish they chucks of bread would have been smaller. It was a little awkward trying to fit the almost palm of your hand size bread in your mouth when it&#39;s been sitting in hot soup. (3.5 stars)* Pork Chop: So flavorful, so juicy, so good! (5 stars)* Broiled Wild Salmon: Definitely a must try if you aren&#39;t up for steak. (5 stars)* Decadent Mac &amp; Cheese: Just OK. Didn&#39;t think it was worth the $12. (3 stars)* French Fries: We love fries so we had to get these as one of our sides and they were beyond delicious. Plus they gave us so much we took half of them home. (5 stars)* Onion Rings: I&#39;m not a fan of onion rings so yeah. However, they were huge and we got seven of them so not bad for $9 dollars. The bae loved them and gave them (4 stars).Dessert* Table side Smores: It&#39;s pretty cool to see the chocolate ball dissolve into the Smores goodness. Even though we were both stuffed, we made room for this dessert and I&#39;m glad we did. (4 stars)Oh and they only bring you bread service if you ask for it. The bread and the butter get two thumbs up so definitely request this...it&#39;s free so why not?!"

Chicago Restaurant Week is maybe my favorite &#34;holiday&#34; in the first half of the year.  If you plan properly, you can find some amazing deals at some of Chicago&#39;s best restaurants...and me, I&#39;m a consummate planner!!!Right after reservations opened up, I snagged a lunch spot here because I have read enough reviews and seen enough food porn pics to know this was a menu not to be missed.  My expectations were met, if not exceeded this afternoon.  Everything we ordered was as good as it looked and sounded.  My friend and I, being two smart ladies with a genuine fear of ordering remorse, decided to try two of the sandwiches and go half on both.  Our initial choices were the Dry-Aged Prime Burger and the Prime Rib Dip Sandwich.  Unfortunately, they were out of the Prime Rib Dip for the day so we &#34;settled&#34; on the Lobster Club and by settled I of course mean ended up with the most heavenly and divine surf and turf lunch extravaganza ever.The Burger was a really really really good burger.  It ranks up there on my list of favorites.  The lobster club was heavy on the lobster light on the fluff.  The sandwiches were both substantial and we both left with to go bags for later.  We probably didn&#39;t NEED to order the Brussels Sprouts but any time a restaurant lists sides in a section called Escorts I&#39;m gonna go ahead and pay them some attention lest I suffer the diners remorse that I&#39;m sure Julia Roberts would classify as a BIG MISTAKE.  They were fantastic.We looked at the dessert menu but really only so that we could say no and feel like we made A healthy decision while at lunch.  Overall, the food was fantastic.  I wish we could have tried the Prime Rib Dip but that&#39;s our fault for waiting until 1:15pm for lunch.  Our server, Josh, was also exceptional.  He was attentive and informative and could handle the world&#39;s largest pepper mill without breaking a sweat."

The bacon appetizer with dark chocolate is out of this world. Amazing service.We had the porterhouse for 2 people.had way too much butter for my taste ,but was very yummiii.The Brussels sprouts were amazing, I could have had that for dinner alone.I love that they give you a little seasoned salt with lavender to add to your steak, nice touch.It&#39;s was my birthday celebration and the waiter sent a cylinder chocolate thing to the table and he poured hot chocolate sauce over , which melted everything , whatever that was, boy was amazing !!!"

Saw the rave reviews and just stopped here for lunch with my girlfriend. The place is pretty huge and seems like a place where business ppl go for a good lunch.They had pretty awesome free rolls with a wicked garlic butter type spread. The rolls are really stuffing, so don&#39;t let this ruin your appetite. I ordered the Wedge Salad because it mentioned thick cut bacon and avocado, was definitely a top salad. I never eat salads and I finished more than half, so that speaks a lot. My gf got the New England Clam Chowder and she said it was the best clam chowder she&#39;s had.For the second course - I wanted to get the fried chicken, but last second I decided to switch to the Dry-Aged Prime Burger. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium and it was pretty good. I was underwhelmed for some reason, I don&#39;t think the cheese did much for me. Typically a sharp cheddar is perfect for burgers, but I think this was American cheese... Disappointing, but the rest of the burger was awesome. My gf got the Lobster Club but she was too full to finish. I thought it was awesome, but I don&#39;t think she likes this type of food since she travels a lot.I probably wouldn&#39;t come back here if I was paying, just because I&#39;d rather go to an ethnic place for a similar price. They have unique dishes and a broad menu, so you have enough choices to pick your brain with. I just can&#39;t give it a 5 stars because I wasn&#39;t amazed by the experience, service, or food."

We were a group of 5 visiting Chicago for the weekend from NYC and are used to excellent food and service as New Yorkers. Prime and Provisions BLEW our minds! We shared the bacon, wedge salad and tartar and all were outrageously good. The Bacon LITERALLY melted in our mouths, the salad was perfectly seasoned and the tartar rivaled any I have ever had (which is a lot since I am a fan). I shared the porterhouse with a friend which was perfectly presented on a 400 degree plate! The sides were fantastic as well. We finished the night with after dinner drinks and cigars for the boys on the outside terrace. All 5 of us agreed that the $150 each was WELL worth it!Cannot wait to come back! This New Yorker approves!"

The waiters we&#39;re super attentive and came by all the time to answer questions and recommend different dishes. Each of us ordered a meat dish and a salmon dish. We all ordered different sides to share since we couldn&#39;t decide on one each. The main dishes were alright. The meat wasn&#39;t spectacular given all the hype. I was expecting a fantastic cut or some delicious looking steak, but they all tasted the same as any regular restaurant. The salmon was good, can&#39;t really go wrong with fish. The desert was this chocolate ball which melted using syrup. The presentation was beautiful and it tasted good too. I definitely expected more for the amount of money we spent. I didn&#39;t love it or hate it. This ended up being just a check mark of the famous Chicago restaurants to go to."

I gotta say, it was not what I was expecting and the food was mediocre at best.  I go to a lot of steak restaurants and I will not be rushing back here anytime soon.  I&#39;ll break it down.Service:  Great, no complaints.  Attentive and always aroundAtmosphere:  Could care less if it&#39;s trendy, i&#39;m here for good food.Food:  Most of the appetizers were good, not much to complain about there.  However, my steak just has absolutely ZERO flavor.  They messed up my order and I had to send it back 2 times.  Plus...I ordered the Kansas City cut steak, they actually cut it up for you (I guess they are trying to present it in a nice way, no thanks)  But they pre-cut it, and when they did that all the juice in the steak poured out probably onto a cutting board, and it was NOT on the plate that the steak arrived on.  There was NO juice on my almost $70 steak, totally tasteless and expensive.  I will say after the troubles with the steak, they did comp it, so they did correct that.I was there that evening with about 6 other guys, and they all agreed for the price we paid, we should have left feeling &#39;what an amazing meal&#39;.  But what was actually said was...&#39;over-priced, no flavor and won&#39;t be going back anytime soon.&#39;  We all agreed.Sometimes I think it&#39;s best to go to some of these old-school style steakhouses that have been doing the same thing for years and are successful at it.2 stars because service was good."

Water came quickly thereafter and the waiter asked if we had been to the restaurant before. This was our first time and our experience for lunch was pretty good.Service 4/5Wait staff continuously made sure water levels were full, asked how our meal was periodically and also if we needed anything. I noticed later on that our waiter did not walk through the menu with us or announce specials as they did with a much larger 10 top next to us. hmm..Food 4/5I haven&#39;t tried enough dishes here to fully round out the review since this was my first time but I really enjoyed the chopped salad (would order again just for that HUGE piece of bacon). I had the lobster club and my husband had the prime rib dip. Both were excellent portion sizes that came with a side of fries. I liked both the entrees but was not exactly blown away by the flavor combinations. I&#39;d really like to try dinner and some other entrees to decide if the food here is a 4 or a 5.VenueBeautiful tufted seats. This place is great for business lunches and nice dinner. Too bad they are not open on weekends for lunch but that&#39;s pretty standard for a loop based establishment.Overall I really enjoyed my meal and experience here and would come back to try more food."

So I can&#39;t complain that much, but I made a reservation on Friday for Saturday, and the only times available were 5 or 930 pm, definitely could have walked in and got a table at 6 or so, so that kind of messed up my schedule (but I&#39;ll overlook that for now)!!The atmosphere is pretty nice, sometimes you&#39;ll go to steakhouses and it&#39;ll be too dark or too loud. Here they face the river and have a nice big window with curtains that cover half way up. We got seated at a nice booth, which comfortably fits four, but was perfect since there were only two of us.Our waiter was exceptional, very attentive and on point. I would say the kitchen speed was average or on par with others.The food: 1) we started with 1/2 dozen east / west coast oysters, I couldn&#39;t tell the difference, not much of an oysters. They didn&#39;t have any kind of fishy / sea taste so that was good, I mean they were good period coming from a non oyster eater, but they were kind of tiny (~$20); 2) we got some bread which was like a pretzel roll with the butter being like some type of potato salad tasting spread (not so tasty in my opinion) (free); 3) fiancé got the dry aged bond in ribeye medium rare (~$65). It was amazing perfectly cooked, seared, and had some good pieces of fat to go with it, maybe a little too much far on this piece, but really good overall; 4) I got the Chilean sea bass which had a nice glaze on it, again perfectly cooked, moist and flaky. Really good and maybe your best value (~$35); 5) we went ahead and got the Mac and cheese and the waiter convinced us to get bacon it, pretty good but I think I realized all Mac and cheese at steakhouses are kind of overrated, not just here, but places who do lobster mac or any kind, I think are just pretty good, nothing special (~$16); 6) finally barely saved room for the table side s&#39;more. This is one of the things they are famous for, it definitely looks better than it tastes, and the presentation is really cool, but not enough ice cream and I don&#39;t love the smoky flavor that they recreate to simulate the campfire feel. Good to get for social media purposes, but I would try another dessert if I ever came again (~$12); 7) drinks: she got a glass of wine (~$13) and I got a Coke (~$3) fountain, free refills!! I mean a big bet peeve is when you go to some steakhouses and they give you one of those small cute cans or bottles at $4.50 a piece and don&#39;t come with refills. It&#39;s like damn 8oz Coke for $4.59 is not enough!!! So kudos for the refills on cokes!!Overall great experience and worth coming if you want to step out from the various chain steakhouses."

I sit by the bar and Ryan and Brenda always take good care of me. Their cocktail selection (specifically the Hemingway Daiquiri) is amazing as well as their food. They have an extensive wine list (seriously it&#39;s like 3 pages long). Their French fries are amazing. I came here with my friend before for dinner on a Monday night and we both split the Kansas City Strip with mashed potatoes and mushrooms on the side. The banana cream pie cake was very delicious. I enjoy coming since the ambiance is great and the staff is very welcoming. If you&#39;re a big whiskey drinker, I suggest coming here. They make the best old fashions."

I brought my boyfriend here for his 30th birthday, since he has been wanting to try it out and we needed a special occasion to justify this steakhouse splurge!Drinks:  They have a very extensive wine list. The bottles range from $49 to $2750, which made me extremely paranoid that I would accidentally order one of the thousand dollar bottles. Obviously, I ordered the $49 bottle and it was delicious! After dinner, I ordered the Prime Southside, which was delicious combination of gin and egg whites!First Course:  We started off with the House-Flared Thick-Cut Bacon. It&#39;s a very thick cut of pork belly with a sweet maple glaze and it&#39;s served over a thin layer of dark chocolate. It&#39;s a perfect combination of salty and sweet!Second course:  The Lump Crab Caesar Salad was a great palate cleanser before another course of meat. There was a healthy portion of crab and our server had it pre-split for us to share.Main course:  Petite Filet = everything a steak should ever be! It was absolutely perfectly cooked and seasoned. We had a side of Bearnaise sauce, which wasn&#39;t necessary, but was a great burst of flavor for the occasional bite. We ordered the horseradish crusted mashed potatoes, which were incredible and now I believe that all potatoes should always be served this way!Service:  Joseph P made this special occasion even more special with his awesome service! He was informative attentive and even surprised us with a complimentary (and delicious) peanut butter cake! Our courses were perfectly timed and all of his recommendations were spot on!No complaints!

Huge chunks of lobster throughout the dish.  Excellent way to start to the meal.  Our 2nd course was the Lump Crab Caesar salad which was big enough for two people.  Again, credit to Brandy as she pointed out we didn&#39;t need 2 salads and it was best to share.  Nice chunks of crab throughout the salad.  Absolutely didn&#39;t disappoint.Our main entrees were the lamb chops and Boar pork chop.   The lamb chops were delicious itself but the sauce was a little overpowering (and sweet).  We had to add a little spice (thank God for A1) to balance it out. But it was extremely tender.The boar pork chop was phenomenal.  FA-NOM-MEN-NAL!!!  Extremely tender and juicy. Cooked to perfection and the apple chutney and sauce was an excellent compliment to it.  And it&#39;s huge.  Once you factor in the previous courses, I was stuffed.  We ordered mac n cheese, baked stuffed potato and Brussels sprouts to go with it.   The potato itself is a meal.  Was a little too much for my liking but the mac n cheese and sprouts were delicious.Prime and Provisions doesn&#39;t disappoint.  Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful.  Thanks again Ken and Brandy for going above and beyond.  You definitely earned a fan.  Till next time."

On my previous visit the service was in impeccable, but my food experience wasn&#39;t the best. I think it had more to do with the circumstances of the event I was at than a reflection on the quality of food at the restaurant.Showing their excellent customer service I was reached out to by Ken the general manager and his genuine concern for my experience made me want to come back and try them one more time. All I can say is yum yum YUM! My friend and I were here for nearly 3 hours feasting on delicious food. Previously I had only been to the upstairs event space and the bar area. We were seated in the dining area and it&#39;s absolutely fancy, but not stuffy. Some people were dressed up while others were in jeans and I felt totally at home and comfortable. As I mention previously the service here has always been great. Kyle did a wonderful  job explaining the menu to us and checking on us throughout the night.I know you&#39;re interested in the food....so here we goAPPETIZER:Thick Cut of Bacon, Black Pepper, Maple Syrup and Dark Chocolate - OMG this was delicious!!!! It&#39;s one of their bestsellers and almost everyone orders it. The Brown Sugar makes it crisp on the outside and gives it a nice glaze. I want this for breakfast every morning!!SALAD:Lump Crab Caesar Salad - Yum! I like they weren&#39;t stingy with the crab and just the right amount of dressing. I highly recommend!MAIN ENTRÉE:Ribeye - I had the Ribeye cooked Medium well and it was. The temperature was perfect. It could have used a little more seasoning, but that&#39;s my personal preference. All around though it was a great piece of meat.Alaskan King Crab Legs - OMG OMG my friend had these and they were pure delight!! She ordered the bigger size order. Otherwise I don&#39;t think she would of shared with me. We requested they come cracked already so we could just dig in. So fresh and so tasty!!!SIDES:Charred Brussel Sprouts - Garlicky and scrumptious! I love Brussel sprouts and these did not disappoint.Bruleed Sweet Potato - I have never tasted anything like this. I love it was bruleed!I It gave it a crispy outer texture and inside the potato was sweet and mushy (not too mushy - perfect). You must make sure you top it with the Cajeta Butter. It totally altered the taste in a VERY VERY good way. Such a winning combination.DESSERT:Peanut Butter and Whipped Milk Chocolate Pie - I&#39;ll admit it was good, but probably not my favorite item. I prefer cakes and bread puddings versus creamy pies. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the crust. Next time I&#39;ll try something different. If you&#39;re a peanut butter fan I totally would recommend it.Drinks were good, but nothing special. Pretty much on par with other drinks in the loop/ rivernorth area. I had the RUM Daiquiri.This place is pricey and I would totally go back for a special occasion. I work in the area and will frequent the bar side for lunch and after work. Totally recommend for a good time and quality food experience.  Also I noted it&#39;s in a great location for a work event or a client dinner."

I highly recommend reservation which i scored a last minute dinner for 2 on early Saturday night. Business casual wear would be prefer for I was quite underdressed with my leggings and sweatshirt. Classic dining room with medium noise level. Service was attentive and humorous. Overall, there is a good variety of entree from meat to seafood that is suitable for everyone. To my surprise, the seafood is just as deliciously fresh as the dry aged steak! The price tag may seem steep, but the portion is quite generous and there is quality to your meal!The restaurant has it&#39;s own dry aging area inside in the backroom where the steak are all organic, grassfed, and dry aged. The flavor of the meat was deep and well aged.Seafood tower - We ordered the essential tower $65 which is suitable for 2 people. It came with 4 fresh golden Alaskan king crab leg which was indeed FRESH!!! 6 oysters (east and west coast), 2 Colossal shrimp (cooked to perfection that is still crispy and is almost the size of my feminine palm). For Chicago standard, this seafood tower was fresh and delicious. It comes with freshly made horseradish :)House cut bacon - For $14 for a slice of bacon that is one inch in height and about 6 inches length. It was cut into 6 pieces. It was quite lean for a bacon with smoky flavor drizzled with maple. Bottomline, it was amazing! Will definitely order this again!Prime rib - Limited availability because only 2 rib roast is made each day. I decided to opt in for prime rib since my hub is getting the ribeye. The price tag was $70, BUT it was a generous portion of 40+ ounces of pure meat! Not bad, for this platter of meat. It was juicy and tender. As compared to Lawry&#39;s, prime and provision&#39;s seasoning is more flavorful.The rib eye was about 22 oz for $60 served on a white plate that is 600degrees. We had it ordered medium rare and the platter slowly heats the meat. The smoky roasted flavor hits the palate right on spot!Must request for the house complimentary monkey bread served with house butter.We had plentiful of leftovers that was still succulent and delicious the following day.  Lastly, we ordered the banana cream pie which was served as a 4 inch mini pie. The banana flavor was plentiful, but it wasn&#39;t too sweet.Overall, I&#39;m glad to have prime and provision joining as part of the Chicago steak house scene. It was a delicious meal."

So, that was really nice to have a big booth to ourselves!Secondly.. This place goes above and beyond with their service. I seriously think we had about 2 general managers come to our table to make sure everything was going smoothly.Our waiter Shawn was awesome!!!! Explained everything in great detail.As for the cocktails, food and dessert it all had a perfect touch! The old fashioned and Paloma were very good.As for appetizers .. we ordered the oysters, lump blue crab &amp; Lobster cake. You can&#39;t go wrong with these options! The cake was delicious!!Lastly, For dinner had the dry-aged bone-in Ribeye... This steak had a lot of flavor! I highly recommend it! As for the side I had the brûleed sweet potato which was so different than your typical sweet potatoes. This side is quite tasty!Dessert.. Was the chocolate cake!

Main course was NY strip which was pretty good and for dessert we had banana cream pie (pretty good.)Where this place excelled was the service. Our waiter seriously stood about ten feet from our table most of the night. The general manager (Ken) came over to check on us multiple times and Tommy (the cigar aficionado) came by and told us that the restaurant not only sells cigars but has an outdoor section where we can smoke them. This made me extremely happy because I love cigars and scotch; and while you can still find a few places who sell cigars in Chicago, very few will let you smoke one on the premises.Once we finished our meal, they set us up outside with ashtrays, cigars, and our drink of choice. I&#39;m a sucker for good service because I go to alot off restaurants and know for certain it&#39;s hard to find people who give a damn. So kudos to prime and provisions. It&#39;s not cheap, but I&#39;ll be back for sure!"

Low and behold I get a message offering an opportunity to try P&amp;P again, this time to get the type of experience a $200 meal would command. I&#39;m glad I did, as it was considerably better than the first.The starters included crab and lobster cake and lump crab Caesar salad. My date and I were fighting over the scraps for both. The crab cake came with what I believe was a Bearnaise sauce the salad was lightly dressed but satisfying. Even the monkey bread was better somehow.For entrees I had the prime rib and my guest was talked into a tenderloin steak (up from a burger). The prime rib had to be a good 32oz of beef and even though she dislikes steak, she enjoyed the tenderloin. Along with the jus and horseradish sauce the finishing salt actually worked this time and explodes on your palate.To end off the night we got the smore dessert and Apple Pie a la Mode. These have been talked about ad nauseam so I will only confirm the delicious-nous of the dessert. To put it simple, we were both uncomfortably full to the point i hate to unbutton my pants yet we still forced it down out throats, and we both hate chocolate.My earlier beefs still hold true. The chicken was still terrible so I would avoid, and the bacon is a little overrated, but if you choose smartly you&#39;ll enjoy your meal. This is now one of my regulars (when I can expense it of course)"

My girlfriends and I decided to go out one night for dinner and i suggested Prime &amp; Provisions. This place is sexy, classy, sophisticated and just an amazing dinner spot.When we got there, they treated us nice and we were seated right away. I am not going to get too much into service because it just expected to be top notch at this place. My favorite item on the menu is the bacon and the Kansas city!!! I have never tasted a steak like the Kansas that they serve at this place. I have tasted many, many, mannnnnyyyy STEAKS but nothing has impressed me like this one. i am starving as i am writing this!!! This steak is really something to fantasize about.All in all this place always gets my approval and if you happen to go there ask for Corrie, she&#39;s the best and will definitely take care of you."

For the record, we had a later reservation at 7 PM. But, we were starving &amp; moved our reservation earlier. LolUpon entering we were greeted with the friendly hostesses. We were promptly seated &amp; our waiter was excellent! He took our drink orders &amp; they were brought out right away. He also explained the menu to us and made several recommendations, many we ended up ordering. He brought us pretzel rolls with a delicious lemon/chive spread that I almost devoured until my boyfriend kept reminding me that we ordered a lot of food already (only one roll survived). The decor is nice, similar to Mastro&#39;s but more &#34;hip&#34; &amp; modern.first course: traditional tartare &amp; potato gaufrettesthis was recommended to us by our waiter. it was absolutely delicious! it&#39;s topped with a raw quail egg that the waiter mixes in table side. the gaufrettes honestly looked like a fancy ruffle chip lol, but I&#39;d eat a bag of those over boring old Ruffles any day. great flavor! the tuna and guafrettes really compliment each other with the raw of the tuna &amp; crunchy, lightly salty gaufrette. every bite I was able to get a little bit of everything &amp; I enjoy food like that. we ate the whole thing. I prefer this tartare over Mastro&#39;s. i highly recommend it!second course: lump crab caesaralso recommended to us by the waiter. your typical caesar salad with lumps of crab. they don&#39;t skimp on the crab either. very refreshing and overall good flavor. I would order it again.steak: dry-aged bone-in ribeyemy boyfriend and I decided to share this, but at this point I was already full. damn you delicious pretzel bread. our waiter served us our steak &amp; side. great flavor &amp; tender! it comes with a roasted garlic bulb, &amp; their house rub. we ordered a medium rare, but our steak seemed more on the rare side &amp; cold by the time we had eaten it, which explains the lack of one star. the rub, I didn&#39;t care much for. it seemed a bit too salty for my liking. if it came a bit warmer i would have enjoyed it much better. I&#39;m going to have to say Mastro&#39;s still does the steak better, with RPM coming in a close second.side: properly whipped potatoescreamy, parmesany, yummy. the potatoes are indeed properly whipped. good texture, light horseradish flavor.dessert: table side smoking s&#39;moresone of the main reasons I wanted to dine here. :P beautifully crafted dessert! it was delicious! if only all s&#39;mores tasted like this! a chocolate dome filled with the s&#39;mores &amp; smoke that&#39;s melted with a hot chocolate sauce. inside are thick graham cracker crust pieces, a brownie, vanilla ice cream, &amp; huge marshmallow dollop. my boyfriend barely likes desserts and finished this one clean. lots and lots of chocolate so we didn&#39;t eat the shell. and nothing bothers me more than an uneven dessert to ice cream ratio, but there was enough ice cream for every bite! please get this. you won&#39;t be disappointed. I don&#39;t care how full you are. I was full after the second course, but there&#39;s always room for dessert!overall dining experience was excellent. attentive staff &amp; delicious food. my water and wine glass were never empty. prices weren&#39;t as bad as I expected. our overall bill was about $170, sharing a steak &amp; leftovers to take home. We don&#39;t eat lightly either. We enjoy eating, but we left full &amp; satisfied. I will be back to try another (hopefully warmer) steak, the seafood platter &amp; the HUGE shrimp at a busier time to see if their service is just as great."

The service was pleasant, the decor gorgeous, and the food exactly where it needed to be. My only gripe is that the side portions were much smaller than I was expecting. I suppose I&#39;m just conditioned to expect large side portions at steakhouses. We didn&#39;t finish them anyway. A memorable meal to start a memorable evening."

My second visit to Prime &amp; Provisions was the beginning of that time.  It was one of the best decisions I have made since moving here because I have found myself a winner. This place picked itself up by its bootstraps and got back on track for this guy.The starters:  The starts this go round were all amazing.  You must get the thick-cut bacon.  Also, there is no question the fried chicken must must must make an appearance on the table then, in your face. Trust me. Its delicious. Follow that with a wedge salad. I believe we got these the first time and wished we would have had room this time...because it got real and by real, I mean stuffed with amazingness.  We followed the other starters with tuna tartar which they mix with a quail egg at the table...which is classy, kickass and fantastically tasty. The lobster grab cake was also a hit and we polished it off with smiles on our faces.The drinks.  The wine list has all sorts of options ranging from low to baller. We got into a bottle or three and they did not disappoint.  Also, if you are a martini fan, I highly recommend an extra dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives.  These suckers would be a starter at other places, they are that good!The mains.  This time around I got the sirloin and from the first tasty bite I was all in and then some.  So so good.  A couple friends of ours went with the Porterhouse for 2 and crushed it from the word go. It comes out sizzling on a 500 degree plate and its top-tier.  These two people like to talk and we didnt hear a peep out of them once the steak hit the table.  Fans each.  The final round outs were a couple of petite filets that our lady friends enjoyed.Sides.  We gave our wonderful server (more on him later) carte blanche to work his side ordering magic.  He did really well.  We tried to mushrooms again and they were better than last time. We went with asparagus and they were great.  I believe there was a potato dish on the table but I was so full at this point I dont really remember. Is there a better statement than that?Dessert. Went with the deconstructed Smore. Not sure if that what its called but daaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn gina, that thing was goood.Service. Let me tell you something about our server Frankie. This dude brought the thunder.  Im talking about rolling up to the table with a smile that was infectious.  We were ready for a kickass meal and this hombre delivered...pun intended.  Quick with a recommendation, a joke, a tip on what not to order and even a compliment on my outfit. Sheeeeet man, you know how to make a brother enjoy himself.  Straight fire.  If you have a chance to sit with him he will bring that 9.5 to a 12.5.  Legit."

My ribeye was cooked perfectly.  We finished with s&#39;mores and unbelievably good banana cream pie (I don&#39;t even really love banana cream pie and I couldn&#39;t stop eating it.).  Also service was impeccable (thanks Stephanie and Craig).

The food is all amazing! Try the shrimp cocktail - it will blow your mind - the shrimp are massive!!  I figured that since they were so large they would be tasteless, but not so. Their steaks definitely rival any other steakhouse in Chicago. There&#39;s an abundant selection of wines and their cocktails are inventive and tasty. Best of all is the service everyone was friendly, attentive and helpful but never hovering. Special thanks to our waiter Mike D - he was the best! He offered great suggestions, had an amazing attitude, and really added to the experience. Will definitely be back!"

The atmosphere seemed more like an after work spot where dinner business took place not at all a great &#39;date&#39; place. The server was friendly but since the restaurant was only a quarter full it became painfully obvious that that server uses the same exact &#39;shtick&#39; at all of his table.Now to the food which was disappointing at best:The house-flared thick-cut bacon, with black pepper and maple syrup and dark chocolate was lackluster. The bacon was almost jerky texture and without good flavor. The syrup and chocolate did nothing to redeem it. We didn&#39;t finish it.The cucumber avocado soup was excellent. It tasted just like summer!We tried the obnoxiously large prime rib ordered medium rare but it was served rare.  Sadly, it really was a dreadful piece of meat. It was without flavor and took the horseradish, aux jus or the lavender/pepper/salt mixture to make it palatable. Plus, it was tough. It was not like cutting butter. After a few bites I decided to save the calories and quit eating it.We also ordered the bone-in ribeye cooked to medium rare. It was much, much better than the prime rib but it was only good. It&#39;s easy to make a fantastic ribeye and P&amp;P failed.The brussel sprouts were fantastic...so long as you didn&#39;t eat the pieces of overcooked bacon.The substantial baked potato with Hook&#39;s aged cheddar, crème fraiche and thick-cut bacon was more akin to loaded potato skins and I mean LOADED potato skins. While all the components (sans bacon) were good, the dish was unnecessarily over the top. A traditional HUGE baked potato with some toppings would have been so much better.We  also ordered a (delicious) dirty martini, an okay old fashion and a couple of beers. We were too full and didn&#39;t have dessert.  The price for this lackluster meal including tip was over $300. Skip P&amp;P in favor of your favorite steakhouse or your favorite butcher shop and your own grill, you&#39;ll be glad you did."

The brussel sprouts and fried chicken were awesome. The staff and in particular, the bartenders are fast, friendly and personable. All that aside, the menu is a mess. The meat (steaks and chops) are either too expensive or too big (designed to share). There&#39;s nothing for the person who just wants a larger than normal steak for his/herself. It&#39;s as if they decided hey, we&#39;re going to go really big to standout and people will share. One of the biggest problems with that philosophy is that steak is personal. Some people like it rare. Some want it medium. Some want a crust. Others, want it clean. When you have Chicago Cut right across the street with a more manageable and accessible menu, it&#39;s tough to recommend Prime &amp; Provisions. If they adjust and rightsize their menu, this place can be a winner.UPDATE: on yet another visit to Prime, the wife and I split the porterhouse. I need to revise my earlier statement about portion size and price. The porterhouse is a steal for 2. We met Ken, the GM, who listened to our feedback on the menu and in a genuine way, made it clear, we gave him something to think about. We also tried the bacon on this visit and it&#39;s a must have."

The shellfish tower is fantastic and worth every penny.  I have never had more crisp, sweet lobster and the shrimp were ENORMOUS. Our table ordered the steak for 2, halibut special with corn soukatash, the filet mignon, crab salad split 4 ways, and a side of broccoli.  Let me first state that I am a huge skeptic when it comes to steakhouse steaks.  Because they  seem to always under-season the steak.  But P&amp;P does it right; they cooked it to perfection and the seasoning was on point.  The crab salad was DELICIOUS and I immediately thought what a perfect lunch option.For dessert, we had the caramel milk chocolate cake and the tequila infused limecake.  GET THE LIMECAKE, IT CHANGED MY LIFE.Overall, this place is a fine-dining experience with excellent quality of food.  They definitely have a talented team of people both inside the kitchen and out on the floor.  Will definitely be back for more!"

Kyle was attentive and helpful when we asked him any questions.  We really wanted to taste the lump blue crab lobster cake for our first course.  We had the wedge salad for the second course.  I did order the petite steak again (just right for me).  Our sides were roasted purple cauliflower and the mac and cheese with lobster.  Unbelievably delicious! The portions are perfect because it&#39;s just enough to get full if you are sharing your meal with someone. You don&#39;t want leftover food that goes to waste.  The portions are perfect!My favorite drink here is the Paloma.For dessert Kyle recommended the Banana pie and the Smores chocolate desert.  We ended up ordering the Banana pie and the creme brûlée. We were so full at that point I just had a bite of the Banana pie but it was absolutely delicious.On the night we were there we saw Ana Belaval from Channel 9 WGN morning news which was pretty cool!From the instagram photos I know that the &#34;Shameless&#34; crew dined here a few months ago!  Wish I would have been there that night!Rai, the manager was walking around and making sure everyone was having a great time.  On this Saturday night it was a Full House.  I did not see one empty table so make sure you make your reservations.This is a great place to celebrate a birthday or special occasion.  You really get the red carpet treatment here.Thanks to Ken and Rai making sure we had a great time and taking such good care of us.   Special thanks to Kyle, I cannot wait to go back and try some new dishes on the menu and I hope he is there on the night we visit."

Prime &amp; Provisions is a traditional chicago steakhouse with an emphasis on all natural meat. Their menu is what you would expect and so are the prices. The portions are reasonable, especially the salads. The Prime Chop was exactly what I wanted and didn&#39;t disappoint. I wish I had gotten a little more meat for the add-on cost but the quality more than made up for it. They don&#39;t skimp on the butter or cream in really anything. The sides were incredibly rich, so much so, that you really only need a couple bites to satisfy your cravings. I could&#39;t justify spending so much of my own money on a meal here but it is great for expense accounts. I hope to be back for dinner soon."

From the hostesses to the bartenders, the waiters and waitresses, the barbacks and bussers, up to the management, this place was nothing short of amazing... and this was before we even ordered and ate!I surprised my girlfriend here for her 30th birthday, as she is in chicago for business for a few days. Once Morgan, the hostess, called to confirm my reservation while i was still home in nj, and learned of my story and my plans for the surprise, everybody came together and was in on it, knew who i was, and wanted to somehow be a part of the special evening. Which they were in a huge way, and i thank them all sincerely. Our waiter (im sorry i forgot his name!) Was beyond professional and very efficient in recommending  specific dishes and describing the menus selections in detail (to a tee). Not to mention, hes from jersey, so he was already good in my book! (Knowaddamean?!)The food was beyond delicious. We had lobster and crab lump cake for our 1st course, crispy Caesar salad w lobster meat and kale for our 2nd course and the porterhouse for two as our 3rd course with bacon mac and cheese and creamed spinach as our sides. Delicious! Steak melts in your mouth with each bite. Salad was superb along with the lobster/crab cake and our sides.Folks at P&amp;P, i thank you for such a wonderful experience and in helping me set up the surprise. Keep doing great by your customers, and delivering unmatched service. Impressed and definitely recommended.. all the best-terence &amp; rose"

We had reservations at 5:00pm (early bird because we&#39;re old...haha jk the BF made reservations a bit too late) walked in and checked in. We were told our table was being set up and we walked towards the bar and sat down. We were quickly served by the bartender, the BF ordered a Stella while I had a Shirley Temple. Not too long after we got our drinks, the hostess came up to us and let us know our table was ready. First, we had to close out our tab at the bar before going towards the dining area (apparently they two don&#39;t link up). We were seated in a booth in the very back of the restaurant (YAY for the booth). Anyway, our server came and was very knowledgeable and friendly. He let us know a little bit about the history of the restaurant and the owner and the chef. Gave us a brief rundown of the items on the menu and what he recommended. Then he let us have a little time to look over the menu.We decided to order:-Lobster &amp; Avocado, Asparagus, Sauce Louie - $21 (sauce louie is very much like a thousand island)-Slow-Roasted Bone-in Prime Rib - $69-Dry-Aged Bone-in Ribeye - $68-Sauteed Broccoli - $11After we ordered we were given the rolls...YUM so delicious pretzel rolls with some type of schmear SOOOO GOOD. Then the Lobster &amp; Avodcado appetizer which was pretty good. We had asked for all the sauces on the side just in case we didn&#39;t like them. Overall really good!Then came out our main dishes (prime rib for me) and the broccoli. Let&#39;s just say the broccoli was nothing special - nothing to rave about, but...it was healthy! My prime-rib was juicy and tender everything a prime-rib should be. The creamy horseradish was great too...just thinking about that meal makes me hungry. The BF&#39;s Ribeye was pretty good too it just looked a bit charred (chicago style?).Anyway after dinner...we asked for the dessert menu and we both were pretty full but we ordered one scoop of mint &amp; chip ice cream and that was pretty darn good. The BF was &#34;FULL&#34; but he ate basically half of it.Would I come back? YES! For sure...hopefully next time around I&#39;ll get an adult beverage or two...HAHAHA :)"

Perhaps because they are pretty new too, it was also very easy to get a reservation.The decor was very elegant but not over the top, so we didn&#39;t feel self conscious wearing jeans. If you are more of the dress up type, you won&#39;t feel out of place either.Drinks:- Paloma - very classic girly drink that&#39;s my go-to, but their version is slightly more watered down than my favorite one (from the Gilt Bar)- Vodka Gimlet - this wasn&#39;t even on the menu, but they were very accommodating to make it for us and it was perfect!First Course:- Tuna tartare - served with potato chips and mixed in with a raw quail egg. Good hints of citrus.- Lobster Avocado - there were actually giant chunks of lobster in there! I&#39;m not a big fan of how it&#39;s served with giant chunks of leaves though. It didn&#39;t feel like it was meant for me to use my hands and make a lettuce wrap, but it was also otherwise awkward to eat the dish...Second Course:- Wedge salad - they were very nice to split it into two plates for us. This is really a perfect salad with fresh leaves, creamy sauce, zests of flavor from blue cheese and some decadence from thick cut bacon. I wish I could just casually get this salad for lunch all the time!Third Course:The steaks!!- Slow Roasted Bone-In Prime Rib - this slab of meat is very impressive. It&#39;s about 3 inches thick and bigger than my face!!! I have attached a photo of it with my fist for size reference. Sadly size is one of its only good qualities. The meat was hard to chew and not well marbled at all (more like one side of it was all fat with the rest lean).- Barrel Cut Filet Mignon - much much smaller compared to the prime rib, but also a much better quality piece of meat.Sides:- Wild mushrooms - high quality mushrooms, but wayyyyy too salty- Sautéed spinach - not your average cooked to mush spinach. These still held their shape and integrity!- French fries - I couldn&#39;t resist, but def regret it. There&#39;s no magic in these fries and I certainly didn&#39;t have precious stomach space for them....Dessert:I wish we had any room for dessert after all of the above!! We did get a delicious vintage port wine, which tasted like a honey prune in liquid form.Overall I really enjoyed the experience! The servers were also very intuitive and took care of us wonderfully. However I don&#39;t plan on returning any time soon as it is definitely very expensive and I&#39;m sad that their prime rib wasn&#39;t perfect in spite of their name....P.S. We didn&#39;t get any, but I also really like how they served cigars."

They let the ingredients be true to themselves. I liked how they have creative salads that went beyond throwing leafy greens on a plate with a cheese &amp; dried fruit.  They created salads that celebrate the wholesome goodness of the vegetables. They are modern interpretations of classic salads. The Prime Rib sandwich and the blackened fish sandwich were phenomenal with the proper amount of seasoning and punchy flavor. The seafood towers are just pure gluttony at its finest. You can revel in their freshness. I appreciate the thoughtfulness and effort they have taken to make sure the experience overall as well as on a personal detailed level are consistent and outstanding."

Porter house, Prime Rib, Boar Chop, Mac n Cheese, Brussel Sprouts, Spinach, Chocolate Bacon (never deny yourself life&#39;s most amazing delicacies), and amazing drinks!

I watched several staff members walk right by and no one stepped in to tidy up the table.Banana cream pie was delicious!DJ spinning in the bar starting at 9 was a bit early. 11pm would be more appropriate. Kind of loud and clubby. Dare I say tacky?!?No major qualms overall, a bit too modern and trendy for a steakhouse in my book.  I&#39;d go back but likely to the bar."

The decor is okay, nothing out of this world amazing except for a few really cool taller booths with fancy light fixtures. I came in and asked for a nice table and we got a booth, a regular booth so I guess that&#39;s what is considered a nice. Upon arrival I asked to use the washroom and the hostess directed me upstairs so the 2 times I needed to use the bathroom I kept going upstairs assuming that&#39;s the only bathroom I have when it turns out they had one downstairs. Annoying.I told the hostess and the server that it&#39;s my bday, just because that&#39;s one day a year when a girl needs to feel special. Lunch didn&#39;t feel special, it was loud and very business like since it is in the loop so maybe dinner would have felt more special. Our server was nice so they get a star there. Now onto the important stuff, the food. I left soooo unimpressed and I&#39;ve been to most of the high end steak houses around Chicago. We started off with the talked about fried chicken appetizer, it was very eh, didn&#39;t care for the Rosemary, I don&#39;t think it added anything special to the dish and the maple syrup was weird. The actual chicken was overly breaded and pricey for what you get so I wouldn&#39;t order it again. For the entrees I knew I wanted to indulge so I was torn between the lobster club and the talked about burger so we decided to get both. I did enjoy the lobster club, wish there was a little more lobster and a little less bread so maybe serving it on a brioche bun would have been better, but it was tasty and the best thing we had there so they get another star for that. Now the burger, I didn&#39;t love it. I asked for it medium well it was more on the well done side and it wasn&#39;t moist at all, but yet the bread was super soggy so having head some of chicagos best like Kumas and Au Cheval this one just didn&#39;t do it.Then I was super excited for their smores dessert because I&#39;ve been waiting for it since I&#39;ve seen pictures for it and I saw that people get like a happy anniversary bar or birthday bar with it which would have been very nice considering it is my bday. Well no bar came, no candle came, nada. Just the dessert which left me extremely disappointed. It tasted char like throughout and there was ice cream on the bottom of the thing. Okay last time I checked smores are ooey and gooey and warm. Everything was cold from the ice cream to the stale graham crackers to even the marshmallow puff. Wow, such a bummer. Although it was pretty it just did not do it for me.I thought this place was going to be a 5 star experience but we left disappointed by almost every part of our meal minus the lobster club. I do not think I will be back since it was just not for me and I loveeee smores. It is one of my all time favorite desserts but it has never ever been served cold yet burnt at the same time."

The fat just melts in your mouth. I can eat these all day, I swear.The bread (free) was good.. Warm mini pretzel buns with some kind of butter.For the main course, I ordered the petit-cut filet mignon($39), medium rare. I think my order got swapped with my gf who got medium well, but I still thought it was excellent.For sides we ordered the whipped potatoes($14) and lobster mac&amp;cheese($12+). Hands down, thee best sides in the whole entire universe. Both went so well with the steak. TIP: mix in the roasted garlic that comes with your steak into the potatoes, you won&#39;t regret it.For wine, we had Foxen pinot noir($89).

Way to go...Let&#39;s jump right in:THE GOOD:Bacon: Lives up to the hype. Juicy, THICK, and delicious.Old Fashioned: Perfectly crafted, using crystal clear ice, topped with two delicious Maraschino cherries. Bravo!THE BAD:Seating: Reservations made for two at 9PM on a Thursday. We arrive nearly on time (9:03), told that it will be 10 minutes. 15 minutes later we are seated. The lack of a heartfelt apology was slightly disconcerting but forgivable.Waiter: Ability execute correctly on orders was severely lacking.-Took three requests to get bread and most amazingly on the last request he said &#34;oh, I thought it came out and you ate it already&#34;-Tried to remove my friend&#39;s drink before it was finished after a polite scolding the waiter was terrified to try to remove the empty glass again and so it sat on the table for the next hour, through desert.Food: Ordered the Ribeye, medium rare. Warned by waiter that it might be a bit rare as they aim to finish the cooking on the searing plate, a great sign, normally. Once the Ribeye arrived my doubts of his warning appeared and the first cut confirmed my fear; medium well, bordering on well done.CONCLUSION:At $150/person one would expect nearly flawless service and perfectly prepared food; not a haphazard attempt at service with an overcooked steak.If you must come, sit at the bar, get the bacon and an old fashion, go home happy."

Came here hearing this is place is the bees knees, along with reading the reviews and I really wanted to give it a try. My coworkers have been here and think it&#39;s amazing, but only for lunch. Tonight I came for dinner with my fiancé and went into it with the upmost expectation for the food and service to be amazing. I left thinking the service was pretty good but the food was middle grade. The flavors are good but the attention to detail is lacking. My steak, which I ordered medium rare came medium well and the sweet potatoes we&#39;re not flavorful which was upsetting because it&#39;s one of those places where you shouldn&#39;t need seasoning; but they did. The sommelier came to my table and I told him I wanted a bottle under $100 and he tried telling me the $95 bottle and the $97 bottle were the best which instantly made me loose trust in his recommendations.For the price point this place is disappointing. I grade steak house than a Bavettes or even guilt bar which are both actually cheaper for higher quality. This place is more expensive then some of my favorite steakhouses in Chicago and why?I ordered a bottle of overpriced wine - example I have prisoner in my wine cabinet at home and I paid $37 for it. Here it&#39;s $99 which is outrageous.  My fiancé had a Paloma and she&#39;s said it was good but not strong and super watered down which we read in previous reviews.I have been to better choice steakhouse like Sullivan&#39;s but you get what you pay for, what made me upset about this place is it&#39;s not worth the money. I have no problem spending money on a nice restaurant but my $336 I spent tonight would have been better spent at Bavettes where I would have left with a smile on my face texting my friends and family about how amazing it was and it would have been cheaper as well. I don&#39;t know why this place has such amazing yelp reviews but it is mediocre at best."

From the amazing 5 star service to the quality and presentation of the food, our experience here last weekend was perfect! The 6 of us were there celebrating my birthday as well as my girlfriend&#39;s. We only waited about 10 mins at the bar before our table was ready. LOVE the decor here- old school steakhouse mixed with with a bit of modern and even some animal print. Our server, Darren, was awesome (ask for him!) He never made us feel rushed, explained EVERYTHING, and had a real sense of humor (no dry &amp; boring steakhouse atmosphere here!) Besides a few bottles of wine, we all shared one of the seafood towers (I believe it was the middle one out of the 3 sizes). Good size for 6 people. We also shared the bacon app and two different salads. That bacon was like no other bacon I&#39;ve ever had- you gotta get it! And I def recommend the crab kale salad. For my main I did the petite filet, and hubby did the bone-in filet. Both cooked perfectly. Love how P &amp; P gets the outside of the steaks a little crispy and crunchy, while keeping it a perfect medium rare inside. We all shared the sides of cauliflower and potatoes. Also very good. For dessert you MUST get the s&#39;mores!Bathrooms were upstairs- kind of a pain in the butt, esp when your 4 bottles deep in wine and have to stumble up and down the stairs. Bathroom is interesting- playing what seems like loud crazy German music? After dinner we went to the bar for one more cocktail and closed the place down.Thanks P&amp;P and Darren for such an amazing experience! Will hopefully be back soon!"

Yeah, it&#39;s overpriced (but not terribly so, by Loop standards), pretentious and douchey.  In fact, it&#39;s probably *the* douchiest place in the entire Loop that is not a rooftop hotel bar. And as to pretension, holy fuck, where do I even start? How about with the menu, called a &#34;Bill of Fare,&#34; and typeset like it was a 19th century Supreme Court opinion. It notes that sandwiches are &#34;Graciously Accompanied by Hand-Cut Fries&#34; (capitalization as in original). If hand-cut fries graciously accompanying your cheeseburger aren&#39;t your thing, you can select from a variety of other sides, which are called &#34;ESCORTS&#34; here. I shit you fucking not.But ... it&#39;s all in good fun. The menu, for all its affectation, actually made me smile. More importantly, the servers and front house staff are friendly and entirely free of attitude, the seating is generous and has space that allows for private conversation, and the food is really good.

The chocolate sauce was offputting. Our server was not friendly and he acted like he didn&#39;t even want to deal with our table. When we said the bacon was different and disappointing, he didn&#39;t really even respond. We also noticed that the crowd here on Saturdays is very interesting. It seems like a lot of &#34;working&#34; girls, if you know what I mean. The French onion soup was decent, but not worth the trip here."

It was very good and fancy with the grilled endive.  For the main course, I had a perfectly cooked tender petite filet which they served with roasted garlic.  Yum yum yum!  The cheeky named escorts (sides) were also great.  I tried the roasted Brussels sprouts and horseradish mashed potatoes.  The chocolate cake was ok. I would save my calories for the dense delicious monkey bread in the beginning of the meal and skip dessert!"

Um, I would like this strained please!  He comes back a few minutes later with the drink strained, but by that time it was SO watered down all I tasted was water.To his credit, when I ask for the drink to be remade, he happily complied and it did show up in a cocktail glass as requested at that time.  I suppose if he only asked at the start how I would like my drink all of this could have been avoided.Now, to the food.  We all ordered steak, and sides, and salads, and everything.  The tomato and onion salad was surprisingly delicious, so was the super thick cut bacon appetizer.  You can tell that they have good BTU in the back too because the ribeyes came out really well seared on the outside.However, the steaks were overly fatty, and even under the high BTU (or because of the high BTU), the fats didn&#39;t get a chance to render away as the cook time was limited (we ordered rare + and medium rare).  So, every other bite of my steak was essentially chucks of inedible fat.To add some insult... the meat wasn&#39;t seasoned well so I had to add salt too.With all the amazing options in Chicago, probably won&#39;t be revisiting any time soon."

I&#39;m not going to give them a bad rating, because it was not bad, it&#39;s just not 5 stars. There are several reasons they only get a 4.1st, nothing felt authentic or original. This restaurant is market driven rather than chef driven. That means they just try to reproduce what popular or hot. If the server has to say in his canned speech that they take their own spin on a chicago steak house, then they don&#39;t.2nd - the food was quality, but it did not have the finesse you&#39;d expect at this price point. All menu items are at the highest price you&#39;ll find, so I expect more finesse.3rd - Steaks - highest price point but under seasoned, seriously? Served on a 500 degree plate. Not better than regular steak places.

We were seated right after they adjusted the number of chairs for us. We all opted for the pre-fixe menu, and I got the New England Clam Chowder and the Lobster BLT club. Both were fantastic and very filling. Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t able to substitute the fries for something else. Our waiters were very nice and polite, but slightly off while forgetting a refill order after having asked if she wanted one. Our food came out quick considering the large size of our party. The birthday girl got the burger and seemed pretty happy as well. The prices were reasonable, but I have to hold out on my verdict because I didn&#39;t really get any steak. The bacon was pretty good though."

THE BLT- best bacon I have ever had. And I have had a lot of bacon. It was so thick, cooked perfectly and just the right amount of fat.4. The shrimp cocktail- the shrimp were huge and delicious. They were also $75.00/each. I didn&#39;t ask the price and it said &#34;market price,&#34; but this was higher than I expected.5. I have tried steak, salmon, and the sea bass- all were delicious. The sweet potato that came with was HUGE and came with a delicious cinnamon butter.Solid steakhouse in a city full of them. It&#39;s lunch is a little TOO pricey, but that my only complaint.

She got something fruity.  Both great.For dessert,  we got the smores.  This was a little show all in itself.  This came out in a big chocolate ball which the waiter proceeded to melt by pouring hot chocolate over.  (We made several references about this looking like a dinosaur egg hatching as it started to crack and fall apart)  Once again,  amazing dish.  This was an  absolutely perfect end to the meal!I highly recommend eating here.   You won&#39;t be disappointed"

Oysters are some of the best I have had in the city, but one thing you cannot leave without eating is the lobster avocado......drooling...Thank me later on that recommendation..

This is a place where you get what you pay for and they go above and beyond to prove it. I loved the small touches of an amuse-bouche and a &#34;starter&#34; cocktail. We were also celebrating our engagement and they went out of their way to make the evening special for us.The couple next to us ordered the I don&#39;t give a f*@k and, while tempting, we decided to go à la carte. My fiancé had the bone-in cowgirl, which was delicious. I had the classic steak frites and really thought it was the best dish of the night. If you&#39;re not looking to go overboard on $$$ it&#39;s a perfect option. We shared some sides and it may sound crazy but my favorite was the classic wedge salad. It&#39;s done perfectly and the bacon literally melts in your mouth.

I ordered a pasta which came out.... literally colder than room temperature.  And the edges were shriveled as though it had been under a (apparently not very effective) heater for a while.  Probably because they wanted to bring out all the food at exactly the same time.  Also, my pasta was only $20 on the menu but they made it sort of inconvenient to split the bill any other way besides splitting it evenly between everyone so I ended up paying $120.  Because the steaks understandably were quite a bit more expensive.   Even so- $120... For a plate of cold anglotti pasta and 1/8 a bottle of wine.  Pasta was also oversalted.  I dunno my fault I guess for allowing the waitress to sway everyone into just splitting the bill.  You don&#39;t want to seem like the cheap one, you know? But I purposely ordered the cheapest item on the menu and no cocktail, no side item and no dessert for a reason... as the only person at the table with a single income I found it annoying that it worked out this way.One good thing was the extensive wine list!  This had an excellent variety of low, mid range and expensive options and the waitstaff were very knowledgeable about this.  So I&#39;ll bump it up to 3 stars for this reason."

I felt so fortunate when I was able to nab a 7:00 resi on a Saturday night. Everything was excellent and it just kept getting better.Sarah was our server and she was wonderful as was our Somm whose name is escaping me because he did his job so well. The menu is playful and fun, as is the vibe here in general. For an upscale spot, it&#39;s really relaxed and convivial. Loved how they come to the table with a welcoming martini, they call the Amuse Booze.The food is perfect. It has been a long time since I&#39;ve had surf and turf and it was great to satisfy that craving here. BF had the 28 day aged rib eye and it blew our minds. Portions are huge! The wine list is excellent and the Somm who can&#39;t be named was very helpful in finding us a couple of great bottles at a price point that didn&#39;t break the bank.This was a special occasion spot for us, even though we were only celebrating just being on vacation! The restaurant is beautiful with sexy lighting and ambiance. Also filled with beautiful people, which makes for entertaining people watching.You want to come here hungry and ready to eat.

Service, wasn&#39;t impressed.3 of us walked into the restaurant and were &#34;greeted&#34; by the &#34;host&#34;. With attitude she told us to go upstairs, I questioned were our table was and she simply said &#34;go to the elevator and take it to the 3rd floor&#34;. This being the first time dining there, I wasn&#39;t sure why I was going to the third floor. We make our way upstairs to meet another friend at the bar and I ask the other &#34;host&#34; to seat us. He said we can&#39;t be seated without our entire party. I mentioned that they were a couple minutes away and most of our are there, he then said &#34;I&#39;m getting your table ready&#34;. Let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;s 9pm, and there are plenty of empty tables. We clearly had 8:45 reservations so our table should be ready. Magically when all 6 of us were present our table finally finished...Once seated, our waitress came around and placed a mini martini glass next to each of us. She pour us all a drink. She explained that they let to set the scene before dinner begins! Loved this concept! The martini was great! I&#39;d compare it to a stormy night at wildfire, my favorite!Once menus were handed out, she then brought crackers, salted butter, and radishes.We determined we wanted to get dishes we can share.The first items brought out were king crab salad (amazing), grilled shrimp served on a baguette (amazing), and grilled octopus (amazing). I wish we were informed that there were only 4 shrimps, knowing here are 6 of us. We made it work. All the dishes had great flavor and paired well together.Next we created our own seafood tower. It consisted of a pound of king crab legs, scallops, and 2 orders of shrimp. The crab was amazing! It melted in your mouth! Great quality selections! The shrimp was still fully shelled. When dining at a high end restaurant, I wouldn&#39;t imagine needing to start cleaning shrimp that&#39;s drenched in sauce, not a fan of such an experience.Lastly they brought out the steak, fries, and Brussels sprouts. All items were served to perfection!Several cocktails and a sweet tooth later, my girlfriends decided to try to sundae cart. It&#39;s a great concept. You order as many ice cream balls as you&#39;d like and they bring a ton of sides for you to top it with. Anything from Carmel sauce, to nuts, to fruit; another love!The atmosphere was very bit my cup of tea. I prefer to be in a more lively setting, this seemed more business dining.Overall, I loved my dining experience. The &#34;hosts&#34; need to learn customer service skills. I wouldn&#39;t mind coming back and trying other items on the menu."

The higher the expectations the greater the observations. We came early and our table was waiting.To begin with, the space is beautiful, elegant and sexy. Going upstairs you feel like you are entering a private club. There are real candles burning everywhere.You sit and are greeted by a house martini pour. Up until this point this was a 5 plus star event. The two additional martinis we ordered were excellent, kudos to the bartender.Now comes the purpose of the visit, the meal. I was not excited by the menu, as unique as the place was, the menu is not inspiring. Maybe my age is showing, with too many restaurants under my belt. The pros we are, we put together our meal.Steak tartare. Pretty good, a little heavy handed on capers for me, but babes liked it a lot.King crab salad. Babes like her share, I did not like my portion of this $28 salad. It was goopy and over acidic with citrus dressing to the extent that I could not taste the crab. Now I&#39;m thinking the kitchen is not as talented as the designer.Next up, t-bone. The bubble has burst. The steak came cooked as ordered, medium rare. But it was not a great steak. It was obviously not prime meat, as one would have expected, and over lean. So, bummer.We ordered the loaded potato, and whoever contrived this needs to immediately be traded to Outback Steakhouse where he belongs. It was a waste of money and calories.We skipped dessert. Babes said she had Dove bars in the fridge and the dog was waiting. I asked her how her dinner was and she mirrored my feeling, glad we came, nice to see what the hype was about, won&#39;t go back.As I was leaving, walking through the Viagra Triangle to our car, I looked at the happy diners at Gibsons and I thought how much better the food was there, and at Hugo&#39;s and Del Friscos. Oh well. BTW, Bavettes is still the gold standard."

Although it is a steakhouse in a city of steakhouses, the experience here is quite different. Servers are much more engaged with their guests, and there are many freebies and extras involved in each meal.For example, before you&#39;ve even started, there are chips and dip, watermelon radishes with salt, parmesan crisps, and even an &#34;amuse booze&#34; cocktail of vermouth and grapefruit. Crusty bread and butter come next. We were starting to worry we&#39;d be full before the first course arrived.An extensive wine list has a range of offerings at moderate prices but includes a page of under $50 bargains.We opted for the &#34;I don&#39;t give a f*@k&#34; tasting menu because it let us sample much of the menu. It&#39;s a bargain at $145. These were the courses:Seafood platter, not chilled, but rather roasted, featuring lobster, shrimp, scallops, and clams. The was served in a pool of butter which was later used for a tableside preparation of pasta.Beet and watercress salad.Rosemary fries with Hollandaise and aioli.Meatballs with garlic cheese toast.Bone in ribeye steak served with ricotta agnolotti, roasted squash, and mashed potatoes.Ice cream sundae tower with three kinds of ice cream and 12 toppings to choose from.We enjoyed the experience, and particularly our server. I can&#39;t say there were really any home runs, and the steak was definitely not the highlight, as it wasn&#39;t particularly tender. Overall it was a very rich menu, with little respite from heavily buttered dishes. The best items were the dip, the mashed potatoes, and the sundae.Despite the large size of the room, noise levels were surprisingly pleasant (until a large drunk party was seated next to us) and the background music track is particularly chill.If you are looking for a steakhouse-type experience that is a little out of the ordinary, it&#39;s worth checking out."

Sides were mac and cheese with bacon, and asparagus both equally delicious. Ended with cappuccinos and coconut cream pie. Definitely found my new favorite steak house."

It&#39;s not the best place in the city to get a steak, but overall it&#39;s a quality restaurant.*DecorThe top floor of Maple &amp; Ash is beautiful. A round of applause to the team who decorated this place. (5 stars)*ServiceOur waiter Mason has a personality made for interacting with people on a continuous basis. He gave us great recommendations on drinks and food options that were spot on (4 stars)*FoodThe meatballs were good, but not a must try. (3.5 stars)The salmon tartare was really good and I loved the chips that came with it. (4 stars)The &#34;Volcano&#34; consist of short rib beef bourguignon with bone marrow and a smoked beef pie crust. It looks cool and my dining companion loved it. (5 stars)The New York Strip Steak was cooked exactly how I asked and was very juicy and flavorful. No tough or chewy parts thankfully. However, it wasn&#39;t the best steak I&#39;ve had in Chicago...just good. (3.5 stars)The Baked &amp; Loaded side dish is made with raclette cheese, short ribs, bacon, truffle and fried onions. We enjoyed this side...I mean who doesn&#39;t like anything that has bacon in/on it?! (4 stars)The Mac &amp; Cheese was beyond amazing. Highly recommend getting this cheesy side. (5 stars)*DessertIn theory the Sundae Tower sounded amazing to us, but then we realized you get a boat load of toppings to put on 3 scoops of ice cream. Maybe I&#39;m just an ice cream freak, but I would have at least liked each scoop to be in a different bowl so I could have tried different topping options based on the ice cream flavor. (3.5 stars)"

We valeted($15), hopped out and were pleasantly greeted/sent upstairs to the main dining area. The decor here is amazeballs! Dark, earthy tones with dim cove lighting everywhere. I really dig the feel of this place. Well done.To start, we were given a complimentary mini cocktails which was very refreshing. Warm bread soon followed, as we perused the menu. Without further ado -Food:Soft shell crab - 4.5/5. Delicious. Just wish there were more of it.King crab salad - 3.5/5. Not bad. Just nothing spectacular. Simply good.Mac n cheese - 3.5/5 - pretty good but I have had better.Surf n turf - 4/5 - would have been perfect had my filet not been overcooked, but delicious nonetheless. Perfectly seasoned and balanced.The simple move cocktail - 4/5Chocolate Bombe - 3/5. Im a huge chocolate fan but this didn&#39;t do it for me. My friends liked it. Was a bit too sweet and too much going on for my fancy.Overall, though,  this was a nice evening out and I would definitely come back!"

The atmosphere definitely makes the experience better. Although it was a little dark for eating. We ordered a few salads, sea food, and steak dish to share. The crab and shrimp salad was amazing! The complimentary martini they give you in the beginning is super fresh and not too heavy. It was made from vodka, mint, and grapefruit juice. We ordered the desert tower where we made our own sundaes. The presentation of every dish was beautiful. All around great experience."

WOW.  I&#39;ve eaten at dozens of top steakhouses all around the country.  This place is definitely in the top 5 when it comes to food, ambiance, and service.  My first night in Chicago, the uber driver highly recommended this place. Then I heard about it again the next day from a different source.  When I first walked in I didn&#39;t realize there was a bar on the first level and the restaurant is upstairs. I grabbed a drink at the first level bar and made my way up the elevator. When walking into the main restaurant, I was impressed with the elegant and classy environment.  It felt upscale, modern, and sexy.  They were able to accommodate our table for two that night as a walk in.Our server was magnificent.  He started the experience by saying &#39;here there are two things we love, eating and drinking&#39;.   I thought &#39;what a coincidence,  I do too!&#39; He started us off with a freshly shaken complimentary cocktail that was really refreshing as an aperitif.Things I ordered: king crab salad, surf and turf, and baked loaded potatoes.The king crab salad..... I want to eat this everyday. Literally everyday. It was hands down one of the best salads I&#39;ve ever had. Generous portions of crab with a lovely vinaigrette on fresh greens.Surf and turf.....quality cut of meat and perfectly prepared lobster. Absolutely delectable.  I was beyond stuffed and I did not want to stop eating.Baked loaded mashed potatoes..... Their version comes with layers of short rib.... You heard right... Short rib in potatoes....topped with fried onion strings... Creamy.  Luscious. Win.Best meal I had in Chicago."

Nice bar on the main floor (there is a lounge menu) and friendly waiters. You walk to the far back of the bar to an elevator which takes you to the 3rd floor restaurant. The space is beautiful. Handsome and feminine (candles &amp; flowy fabric) so everyone feels comfy. Great people watching on a Thursday night.We started out with a pink cocktail (vodka, grapefruit &amp; basil). Delicious! Also a small plate of tiny radishes with ... butter (that was different). Cocktails and radishes were on the house. My gal pal and I started out with 2 appetizers to share - the shrimp de jonghe and the octopus. Shrimp was a good-sized order and very tasty. Buttery and the right amount of garlic. The cut up octopus with little potatoes and veggies seemed overcooked and too chewy. We shared a cowgirl rib-eye (good sized) done medium rare, which was perfect. The creamed spinach at $10 seemed small and was just average. We each had 2 glasses of wine and no coffee or dessert. Prices are high but not unexpected. The upstairs bar seems very cool with lots of sofas and comfy chairs. Friends told me this place was THE BOMB. But I&#39;d say it will be a while before I go again."

We were seated immediately in a packed room of people dressed to their best. The room was impeccable. I wish I had some time to spend at the bar on the restaurant level. The people watching from the table was good but from the bar it was most certainly better.The only comment regarding the food is this.  There are a lot of wonderful items on the menu and the sommelier knows his stuff.  I sat down with three of my friends, all males. We all were in the mood for a meat.  We all wanted wine. We wanted the best the restaurant offered but it was our first time and we didn&#39;t know where to begin. The waiter was cordial and he knew that we may be over our head and offered his best suggestions. As he walked away I realized he forgot to explain what was written very subtly on one line in the middle of the menu: I don&#39;t give a f@#$It was so strange I stopped the waiter.  He came back and told us it was the restaurants tasting menu.  There are two rules 1. Don&#39;t be picky and don&#39;t complain.  The chefs make a 5 course meal of their choosing of the best the restaurant offers.After a quick table discussion about what our goals of the evening were we agreed.  The restaurant was able to accommodate a food allergy.  As the food came out we knew were were outmatched and overwhelmed.  The value was remarkable. From the seafood tower  to the tomahawk steak, each round was exciting and delightful. Each course came with 3 or 4 different options to try, enough for all of us to have more than enough. By course three our table of four grown men were ready to quit.  The fifth round was an ice cream tower. I never saw anything like it.We had two bottles of wine with the tasting menu, with tip we were just under a grand. We knew what we were getting into and it was ok. It was worth it."

This is sexy, beautiful, and classy restaurant in Chicago and if you are looking to dine in the Gold Coast area and have a good piece of Steak, vibe, and a crazy sundae treat you can&#39;t pass up- come here. Bring a romantic date, make reservations as much ahead of time as you can, or do a nice and intimate group dinner. Forget STK, Gilt Bar, or Fig and Olive- this restaurant exceeds all of that.Came in with reservations at 6:30 on a Saturday night and went with my girlfriend. 2-3 hostesses are standing right as soon as you enter and if you have reservations you take an elevator up. Otherwise- you can hang out in the speak easy style bar on the first floor. As soon as you exit off the elevators you see a beautiful lounge chairs and seats with people enjoying their glasses of wine and cocktails while possibly waiting for their reservation or just hanging out. The dinning rooms, the views of the kitchen, to the dim light settings, to the music that has this jazzy electronic feel, gets you very excited to dine. If I were to come back- I would definitely request to sit in the middle of the atrium and you will need to book at least 4 people or more to sit there.Our waiter was awesome. Patient, charismatic, and professional- this steak house was nice to have a bit of &#39;friendly&#39; feel that came along with excellent service. We took time looking and picking from an excellent cocktail list. I chose the &#39;Pirate&#39; one and it was great to have a cocktail where you can taste the amount of alcohol in it but it had the sweetness from the Plum making it a nice slow drink that lasted till the end of 3 entrees. We also got a &#39;tasting&#39; of a martini that they give complimentary and it was a nice and different touch. You get marinated olives and radishes on the table, along with two warm pieces of bread.We ordered:-Shrimp: Large pieces marinated lightly, with flaky and fresh breadcrumbs.-Filet Mignon (6 oz) to share, with bernaise sauce: Charred perfectly, tender, juicy, perfect-Loaded Potatoes: Short Rib, with truffle, and potatoes, and a side worth it.-Sundae BAR: 19 bucks, 4 bucks for an extra bowl. Homemade ice cream- very soft serve, not to sweet, perfect creaminess- accompanied toppings such as bananas, caramel and chocolate sauce, chocolate sprinkles, berries, and so much more. Just check out the picture!LOVED all the presentation of the dishes- from the little jars, to the personalized plates. It&#39;s like a steak house amped up to its own personality and dishes you can&#39;t find anywhere else. Maple and Ash is one of a kind and I can&#39;t wait to return."

My colleague and both thought the food was mediocre and overpriced for the quality, portion and presentation and we both eat out at these kinds of business/steak places a lot for work.Our Grilled Cheese looked and tasted like two pieces of toasted Wonder Bread with thin layer s of American Cheese inside. The French Onion Soup looked good and tasted Ok but in my opinion was watery compared to some of the delicious French Onion soups served at the numerous French bistros in our area. The Chicken parmesan was not good at all. It looked like McDonald&#39;s sesame quarter pounder bun with a chicken breast and a dab of red sauce.M&amp;A is new to the neighborhood and in fairness I&#39;ve yet to try the main dining room, which I still plan to do though the lunch experience can be off putting. There are some great restaurants in the neighborhood and M&amp;A needs to have their A game going at all times as you know the other best in class places do.The lunch spot is a nice addition to the neighborhood, they just need to get it right, which I&#39;m sure they will do."

This is more a fun, trendy, higher end place to have very good food with a group of friends, the bigger the better.Just like every other restaurant catering to similar demographics, the service is so/so, the restaurant is gorgeous, the place is packed, and you need a reservation or you probably won&#39;t be very happy. I would put this on caliber with stk or fig and olive. But this is leading the pack right nowLoved the cowgirl steak and king crab salad. I could eat that salad every day.  The seafood platter is served warm...nice change. Everyone&#39;s  favorite item was the dinner rolls. Idk if it&#39;s because I stay away from carbs, but to die for. And the ricotta agnolotti was on point if you&#39;re into that whole cheese pasta thing.They have a nice bar area but I wouldn&#39;t recommend going unless it&#39;s early or late bc its packed.

Well first of all, I have been many times and still have only been downstairs bar area and the patio which is the more casual side. My stops here are not usually planned and upstairs is more fine dining. I have never had trouble finding a seat immediately upon arrival which is fantastic!BAR SERVICE: Sitting at the bar is great, usually I end up in surrounded by great company; if not the bartenders have been very attentive and engaging but not overbearing. Great service by the girls at the bar tables, even when it gets packed.PATIO: service has been awkward several times- starting from the hostess to the servers. Sometimes... The jokes and the hovering are to much, felt rushed. My last experience was a good one, service was fun and not to intrusive.FOOD: there are a few things I have tried but since my first visit, the one thing that I crave that keeps me coming back that never disappoints and is for sure the Downstairs Burger!! I am so upset I forgot to get a pic of this masterpiece, but that is only because I couldn&#39;t wait to sink my teeth in! Yep, you heard it right - the cheeseburger! All the hype of Maple and Ash and I am giving 5 stars and big thumbs up to chef Danny Grant for the burger. It is the perfect amount of bun and meat ratio, cheese Pickles onion and dijonnaise.. It&#39;s a double Patty so tender and delish!I had the tomato bisque to start that was fantastic as well, and the ambiance, decor and all things are pretty at Maple and Ash.When I finally make it upstairs, I will do another review- if the steak is half as good as the burger... I will be in love!"

You get an eclectic mix of people: ladies in their LBDs and pumps, (older) men in suits, (relatively) younger women in dress shorts and pumps, and the random tourists who didn&#39;t know what to expect and showed up in a polo shirt and shorts.I arrived before my gf and sat at the more casual bar on the first floor and ordered a drink while waiting. It was relatively quiet though definitely not a reflection of the bustling fine dining room upstairs. The cocktail I got was made of Scotch and had a really nice smokeyness to it. Good sign for what&#39;s to come.When my gf arrived, we took the elevator upstairs and checked in with the hostess for our reservation. We were early for our reservation on purpose as we wanted to get pre-dinner drinks at the bar/lounge area. There was a private event going on at one corner, but we lucked out and managed to find a table at the bar area. The bar are was quite full at about 9pm. Comfy green velvet chairs! Lots of people watching opportunities!!About 15 mins past our reso time, the hostess came to get us. I thought they forgot about us and I was getting hungry! We walked past the kitchen (hunger pangs already kicking in)...and got seated in the dining room. I put in an order for a second cocktail (an old fashioned this time round, which was solid, by the way), and shortly after that we were served the complimentary mini fruity martini. The complimentary radishes was also a very nice touch and I really enjoyed munching on those.Bone-in Filet mignon:Was quite blown away by this, really. The inside was perfectly medium rare while the outside crust had a nice subtle-but-obvious-enough crustiness when biting/chewing into it.Steak tartare:Solid all round though I&#39;d prefer if there were a little less capers.Soft shell crab:Truly enjoyed this as well.Whipped potato and creamed spinach:Comfort food executed very well.Cream puffs:We were too full for our own good but still wanted to try dessert. Oh goodness, it was indulgent and we could only have half of it. So good though.Definitely a good choice for a beautiful night out, dress and food wise."

We then got a plate of complimentary radishes with sea salt and butter.  The radishes were crispy and a great palate cleanser.To start off our meal, we had tasty prime beef meatballs that paired perfectly with garlic bread and came with juicy tomato sauce. As entrees, I got the ricotta agnolotti with truffle and trumpet mushrooms.  The agnolotti melted in my mouth was the perfect portion size for something not too heavy.  My boyfriend had the surf &amp; turf, which came with a half lobster, 6 oz. filet mignon and truffle potatoes.  The meat was all cooked perfectly and very filling.We ended the night with the sundae service, which gave us each three scoops of ice cream (1 chocolate, 1 vanilla, and 1 strawberry) and all the toppings we could want!  The toppings included hot fudge, caramel sauce, sprinkles, oreos, macadamia nuts, and many more!  It brought back childhood memories with every bite!Overall, great service, great food, and unique twist on a steakhouse!"

We said what we liked, and he said he&#39;d bring us something. He later showed up with two different drinks, which we appreciated, as we could each try something different. Though, he never explained what they were or what was in them. (He was in training.)They gave everyone an apertif as an amuse bouche--a very light martini, which was nice.We had already game-planned our order, and were ready quickly. We got:radishes and butter (on the house): such a delicious, small bitewedge salad: one of the best I&#39;ve had!salmon tartare: also delicious, served with house-made creme fraichesmaller version of the roasted seafood tower: I&#39;m a seafood tower freak and have had almost every one in the city! When I saw that M&amp;A serves theirs wood-roasted, with garlic butter, I was super excited. My wife and I both thought it was DELICIOUS and plentiful. We usually &#34;go big or go home,&#34; and almost ordered the larger version, but I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t. This easily could have fed 4 people, and we were stuffed afterwards. The oysters weren&#39;t our favorite, but everything else, especially the clams and crab, were amazing.loaded potato: By the time we were done with the seafood tower, we were so full, that we ate only a bite of our entrees and took the rest to go. This potato dish is very different than you might expect. It&#39;s a bowl of mashed potatoes, topped with cheese, onions, and a truffle jus. Super decadent! Though, it was a bit too rich for my taste, and I like rich. The cheese was very thick and created a nearly impenetrable crust over the potatoes. Very tough to eat.broccolini: standard side of greens, but godaged ribeye: DELICIOUS! perfectly cooked, smokey wood flavor, tender, seasoned appropriatelybone marrow topper: what else could you want to top meat with--but more meat stuffs?! really goodkey lime pavlova: light, refreshing, and very yummychocolate cake: not the almost-too-dark-and-dense chocolate cake you&#39;d usually see on fine dining menus--fluffy, chocolatey, and served with ice cream on topIf we had a larger group, we definitely would have ordered the ice cream sundae.While pricey, we got a lot of food for the money we spent, and it was a delicious, satisfying, and romantic meal. Would go back for sure!"

Service was on point and friendly staff all through the night.Started with the charred octopus which is good to share and shrimp jonghe.Split the 28 day rib eye with asparagus and pommes frites as sides. Nice place to celebrate but meat could be better- ( more tender )
maple-and-ash-chicago,Birdie H.,XxjKDI0CNxCbrwRQShjNHw,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,2,1240,bruVRg8DmuCG96Ks42XLJw,4.0,2016-08-26,"Sad about rating Maple &amp; Ash 2 stars as I was so beyond excited to eat here and waited a long time to do so.First off, my mom had purchased a generous gift card online last Christmas for my husband and me to dine here. She paid for the gift card but never received anything in the mail. No problem, she called and a manager told her it would be fine and they have the info in the system. She called two weeks before our reservation to confirm and the same manager questioned her and didn&#39;t remember any of their previous conversation for a few minutes before finding the paperwork and verifying the info was in the system. Needless to say, there were still problems by the end of our dinner with being able to comp the amount and then comping the incorrect amount.Upon entering, the ambiance is hip and the loud music makes the fancy dining room more friendly and casual. It&#39;s a cool juxtaposition.We ordered drinks and sipped on the complimentary martinis while we waited - delish.When offered an omakase option on the menu, the hubs and I always take it. What can be better than the chef choosing all your dinner items for you? At Maple &amp; Ash, selecting it yourself can be better. At $145 per person we expected a little more than basically steak and salad. And we expected the courses to come out in a logical manner. Oh, and when I told the waiter &#34;no oysters or clams please&#34; - as the absolute ONLY request we had - we expected that he would respect that, not laugh. Yes, he laughed. Then our seafood tray came out and half of it was filled with oysters and clams. We are both allergic, coincidentally. So there&#39;s now 1. wasted food and 2. distrust between patron and server. Not a good start.We sipped on our drinks (wishing they were food) for about 30 minutes until, alas, our wedge salad, meatballs and french fries all came out at the same time. ...? Salad, meatballs and french fries. Clearly there was some stuff going on in the kitchen, but c&#39;mon. What a weird combination to have to eat all of those things before one of the hot items goes cold. The salad course usually comes out first by itself, giving you time to digest before diving into a meat course and its side. The wedge was super tasty, but unfortunately we remember the weird way it came out before remembering the way it tasted.After the saladmeatballfrenchfry course we received our bread and butter. Also an untimely delivery for bread and butter but hey, it&#39;s bread and butter. I&#39;ll eat it.Then came the steak and mashed potatoes and asparagus. The steak was cooked well and very flavorful. The asparagus was tasty and the mashed potatoes were good, but now we&#39;ve eaten french fries and mashed potatoes in the same meal. Idk I keep getting confused.Ahhh dessert time! The sundae bar was adorable and fun and delicious. Basically giving the 2 stars for this unique and tasty presentation.Sadly though, I later learned that both my mom AND husband had each individually requested a little something special at the end of the meal for our anniversary. Not that this was completely necessary but in addition to all the other incidences it made us feel worse. 10 years is a big anniversary and it was our first date night out since having our first baby. Special times. It was sweet of each of them to make the effort, just sorry that M&amp;A didn&#39;t come through on their thoughtful gestures.All in all, we would have faired better if we chose our own food (which would have kept our expectations at a more reasonable level for what we would have gotten). And if the portions were a little smaller we would have been able to try more of everything we received  (a lot of food went to waste). Seemed like each table who chose the &#34;I don&#39;t give a f$%^&#34; option all got the same exact thing - not dishes unique to their tastes or, ehem, allergies.Perhaps it was an off night in the restaurant and kitchen, but too many issues hindered our ability to remember more of the actual food experience."

Yes, one that compares to Au Cheval. Seems like many restaurants that serve burgers are trying to emulate Au Cheval, don&#39;t you think? I have no problem with that!They call their&#39;s the Downstairs Burger and it has 2 griddled patties, cheddar cheese, pickles, red onion, dijonnaise &amp; fries. Fries were soggy and the dijonnaise had very little dijon but I&#39;m not going to nitpick"

You can probably snag a spot in the bar/lounge if you have a small enough party so worth coming in for a drink even without a reservation. Everyone is dressed to impressed so don&#39;t plan on showing up after work. Favorites were the seafood baller tower and the agnolotti with shaved truffles. Perfectly cooked steaks too. It is pricey but worth every penny!

However, the front of house management also did everything they could to apologize and make up for it.Also in their defense, Scott Disck was dining at the same time as me with what appeared to be a table of 16. So, that explains that.But anyways, back to Maple &amp; Ash. The restaurant has an old Hollywood speakeasy feel, guiding guests up the elevators to a hidden, highly dimmed gem. From the old wick candles to the velvet chairs, it&#39;s timeless feel really adds to the experience.They&#39;re extremely generous with their amuse offerings, including a specialty cocktail. The menu is primarily steak and seafood options, though there are small plates and pastas to share. The meatballs and pastas are good, though nothing incredible, and the asparagus is pretty flavorful. Everything was quite delicious, but even 24 hours later there&#39;s no real standouts from it, which is the difference between a good meal and a great one. EXCEPT, the dessert--the presentation was at its finest through the art of melted molded chocolate and a crisp sugar tower.But then again: places like this is all about the atmosphere and experience, and there is no shortage of that. Thank you to the management who apologized for the obscene lack of timelessness on his waiting staff, it was greatly appreciated and acknowledged."

Usually it&#39;s only when it&#39;s a 5 or a 1 - but I think Maple &amp; Ash deserves some kudos for last night. Initially, I was disappointed as our reservation was at 7:45 and we didn&#39;t get seated until 8:15 - what&#39;s the point of having a reservation if it&#39;s 30 minutes late, right? That being said, our waiter and service were both exceptional. Super fun, nice guy, with great recommendations.We ordered the meatballs as an app (amaze-balls - ha ha, get it?) and they were delish. My friend ordered french onion soup and it was literally the best I&#39;ve ever had - unreal. I probably should have ordered my own considering I was using my spoon across the table like a starving white trash 4 year old. But whatevs.I ordered the bass as an entree and unfortunately it was new to the menu and came out overcooked - twice - but the manager and waiter were both super apologetic and comped it for me, and also brought out 2 extra desserts and complimentary champagne as well for my birthday (side note, my friend ordered it, and it came out perfect. maybe bass doesn&#39;t like me. who knows). It&#39;s a newer restaurant and it was a newer dish on the menu, so although I wish it was cooked properly - the service and &#34;make-ups&#34; if you will, totally made it worth the while. Coconut cream pie - holy cow. Chocolate bomb brownie brittle banana caramel thingie - holy cow again. Blueberry cone ice cream whip cream something or other - just stop it. Desserts and everything except my entree were off the charts. Would totally go back again just for that, and for the service. Great place!!!"

Started with a perfect vodka martini at the bar because we got there super early. Then moved to our table where Daniel and his team took wonderful care of us. He very funny, personable and absolutely went above and beyond, we never felt rushed or unattended on the contrary it was the sense of being the only table although he had a full section.Once seated you don&#39;t just get the typical bread and butter, but a few sliced radishes and delicious butter/herb and a mini vodka martini. We started with the salmon tartar and prawns, so fresh and delicious. Then we had the surf and turf,  the filet mignon was very tender and perfectly cooked, the lobster was just the right size, again cooked perfectly. Ended with the coconut creme pie, had to force myself not to inhale it all!Can&#39;t wait to go back!"

Everyone was dressed in classy formal attire. The first floor had a bar area with a louder ambience. The lighting was fairly dim, music was playing &amp; everyone was chatting away with excitement.To get to the second floor you have to access the elevators in the back. Once the elevators opened there was a formal set up for you to drop off your coat. Then you proceed to your right to be attended to by the host or hostess.We had a reservation at 8pm on a Saturday for four people. Two of us got there at 8pm &amp; we were told to wait at the second floor lounge for 20ish minutes for the table or until our party came, etc. We went by the lounge area, which in a sense had a more formal tone to it, when compared to the first floor. In the lounge there was a full service bar, soft volumed DJ, windows facing the formal dining room and some cozy couches for seating.Our wait time luckily got cut in half and we were seated by the Host &amp; one of the Owners.Everyone at the table gets their own sample of a martini, which was a nice touch (even though I do not drink alcohol).The dining room spelled class all over it. The dim lighting made it more intimate. It definitely is a great place to entertain a good group or special someone.Our waiter was very kind, polite, welcoming and knowledgable of the menu.From what I can remember, we ordered:-Prime beef meatballs-Shrimp de Jongh-Tenderloin steak tartare-&amp; some amazing truffle pasta thing!-6oz filet mignon - medium well&amp; some other fish and steak entries.Everything was del-lish &amp; perfectly cooked.I love how this new restaurant has its own unique vibe and ambience separate from it&#39;s local competitors: Tavern, Gibsons &amp; Carmines.Definitely recommend!!"

The table was on the southern most wall. The problem was in the fact the couples on either side of us were seated in an &#34;L&#34;, so they were facing us. It was difficult not to make constant eye contact with them. The table felt like a communal table, which is fine in a casual atmosphere, not for an intimate dinner.We could not get out of there fast enough, so we only ordered a minimum amount of food and left ASAP. Also, we don&#39;t plan to return, which is a shame, because we frequent a steakhouse in River North/Gold Coast about every 7-10 days.The very next night the two of us went to Bavette&#39;s and had a wonderful booth in their downstairs dining room. We lingered &amp; spent a romantic evening together. Bavette&#39;s benefited from our tab of $300 &amp; our wonderful server Ben was left with $60. Win/win/win."

I went here for my birthday a few weeks ago, and had a really pleasant experience. My all-time favorite restaurant is Babette&#39;s, so it&#39;s often hard for me not to compare every other restaurant to my experience at Bavettes.When we first walked into the downstairs, we were greeted by host #1 and a more casual dining room. We were directed to go toward the back to take the elevator up to the main dining room. There we met host #2 who led us to our table. The decor is beautiful! It&#39;s definitely dark up there, but it ads to the sexy ambiance. We were greeted with a complimentary mini table-side martini, which was a cute touch. Our server was very knowledgeable about the whole menu, answering our questions throughout.For starters, my boyfriend ordered the French onion soup, and I got the shrimp cocktail. Both were tasty (though I believe the shrimp at Bavette&#39;s was a bit fresher-tasting). For dinner, I ordered the surf &amp; turf and my boyfriend got the bone-in ribeye. We also ordered a side of mac and cheese. For dessert, we got the chocolate cake. Everything was good, and i have no complaints. But still... there&#39;s just something about Bavette&#39;s. Overall, I can&#39;t say Maple &amp; Ash is bad, because it isn&#39;t. I think it&#39;s definitely worth a try, if not for the atmosphere and service alone!"

And then came RPM Steak, C Chicago (primarily seafood but whatever, it fits the bill) Prime &amp; Provisions, STK, and who knows what other swanky downtown spot I&#39;m forgetting. I make it a point to check each of these places out during their first week, if not pre-opening. And they&#39;re great. But I feel like they&#39;re more of places to see-and-be-seen. Maple &amp; Ash is that... And so much more.I visited Maple &amp; Ash on Thursday evening of their Friends &amp; Family Preview Week. The business is independent (as far as I know) and not part of any restaurant group, which made me extra excited. The interior is beautiful. The wood-fired ovens are tucked away yet visible from the center of the dining room. While it&#39;s a bit strange that you have to take an elevator from the entryway bar/lounge (which is already stunning yet unfinished the day we arrived) to the upstairs dining room and second bar (which has a slightly different feel but is equally beautiful), it&#39;s a smooth transition... And sort of makes it feel like it&#39;s two complementary spots in one seemingly effortless combination.Like with any preview week, there were hiccups in the service. We got a couple incorrect dishes. Appropriate discounts were given and genuine apologies were made. No big deal. Servers were gracious, attentive, knowledgeable. Management was mingling and it looked like they made an effort to meet with every dining party. Very appreciated.The food was remarkable. Even the classic welcome cocktail and complimentary turnips, olives, cheese, and bread were delicious. Crispy lamb ribs - yum. The only things I didn&#39;t love were the ceviche (eh, it was good but average compared to everything else) and brussel sprouts (too soy-y and salty). Bone-in filet was perfect (but the plating was kind of sloppy/ugly) and one of the best steaks I&#39;ve ever eaten in city. Potatoes were simple but phenomenal. Fantastic wine list.Best part? They have a 4 AM/5 AM (Saturday) license. So much yes.Without a double, this place tops all of the other steakhouses in the city. You guys killed it. I can&#39;t wait to be back."

When I matched into my dream residency program, I decided to celebrate a la steak once again and try out the hot and trendy Maple and Ash.First things first, this place is beautiful. There is no denying that you&#39;ll feel like you must be doing something right in your life and that you&#39;re a super star.  It&#39;d be great for those who want a romantic dinner or a trendy group dining experience. It&#39;s intimate and cozy without feeling too romantic or stuffy.  For that alone, you can somewhat justify the hefty price tag.However, when it comes to the food that&#39;s where there&#39;s a disconnect.Food:- shrimp - this was actually really great. they were all big and juicy. paired well with the sauces. set the standard for the night...- creamed spinach - good, pretty standard though.- roasted chicken - it was neither great or bad.- ribeye - sadly, this is where i was most disappointed. we asked for medium rare and it was overcooked and just tasted tough.- grilled salmon - i&#39;ve been loving salmon but for whatever reason, it just wasn&#39;t hitting the spot at the restaurant. perhaps a little too overcooked and dryall in all, I think this restaurant sets you up for a big let down given it is such a beautiful space and Chicago is known for great steakhouses.  I honestly don&#39;t have a good recollection of the experience and it was mostly because it wasn&#39;t memorable.  Although I love to have an excuse to boug out for an evening, for such a big milestone in my life AND a very big pricetag I do have to admit I was pretty disappointed with the experience.  I&#39;m torn between 2 and 3 stars but since I did appreciate the ambiance and decor, I&#39;ll round up to 3."

I had high expectations and Maple &amp; Ash did not disappoint!  We came straight from work so had an early bird reservation @ 5:30. The space upstairs is just stunning.  Also loved the complimentary martini &amp; radishes with butter to start - such a unique touch.For starters we got oysters (hands down the best mignonette any of us have ever had!), the salmon tartare and the meatballs.  Everything was really fresh and delicious.I ordered my standby NY Strip - the cut I get everywhere so it serves as a good comparison between the Chicago steakhouses.  It was cooked to perfection.  My dining companions got the surf &amp; turf and the bone in cowgirl.  When I come back, I&#39;m getting the cowgirl steak - it was phenomenal.  Maple &amp; Ash focuses on a smoky flavor for their steaks which really came through and distinguishes them from competitors.On the side we ordered mushrooms, which were to die for, especially with the black truffle service we got!  We also got the artichokes which I would not recommend at all - they tasted canned.Dessert came and even though we were stuffed we all agreed we could try a bite (or 5) of the coconut cream pie.  It was more than enough to share - the slice must have been 12 inches long!I will say that our service was attentive and friendly, however I felt like we were rushed.  Maybe it&#39;s different when you dine early - they must not expect you to stay very long but I felt the pacing of our meal was off.  There were runners there with our entrees before we finished our apps, and even then my plate felt hot like it was sitting under a heat lamp for awhile.  We also had started with cocktails and ordered a bottle of wine that we specified we would like with dinner, and they brought it before our apps.  Not a big deal, but it takes up extra space at the table.As we were wrapping up our meal, it got really crowded.  The bar was almost like a nightclub it was so packed!  But a great energy and like many places in the Gold Coast, great people watching."

My husband and I went on a Sunday night , and it was still packed. Our servers were very friendly. We loved the great selections of wines under $50. We ordered the lamb ribs, aged ribeye, surf and turf, Oscar crab, wild mushrooms, and onion rings. We loved their starter muses of olives, cheddar cheese, fresh radish, and their signature martini. I&#39;ve never had radish served by itself, but they were so fresh and crisp. Their Maple and Ash martini was delicious. Their warm sour dough bread was very good too.The lamb ribs were so tasty. The surf and turf was nicely prepared. The aged ribeye was okay, nothing special, but not bad. The wild mushrooms were good too. The onion rings were a little over fried though. Overall, we had a great time enjoying the live music and good food."

This was odd because 1) that&#39;s basically his only role and 2) there were 3 other employees hovering around who also saw us and did not acknowledge our presence either. We were standing there for a few minutes before the host finally greeted us.  This just left a weird taste in my mouth and probably tainted the whole experience a bit.I enjoyed the small bites on the table. The olives were delicious. We ordered the grilled octopus, surf and turf with filet mignon and lobster, and the steak frites. Unfortunately, every singly item was a bit overcooked and excessively salty. We had a 10:30 p.m. reservation so maybe the kitchen staff was tired or less attentive by that time? The steaks were ordered medium and were definitely served medium-well which is kind of inexcusable for a steak house in Chicago. I didn&#39;t want to send it back because it was around 11:00 p.m. or so at that time and I didn&#39;t feel like waiting around for another dish. The octopus was also a bit rubbery-- a few too many minutes on the grill. I really love salt and salty foods, but this was wayyy too much even for me. The cuts of meat were nice, but they were not prepared properly. I definitely was not in the mood to try the desert after those entrees.In terms of the ambiance, it&#39;s a beautiful space but it was really too loud for a dinner place. The lounge vibe poured over into the dining experience in a way that just doesn&#39;t work. As I was sitting at the table, I realized it was 11 p.m. on a Friday night and I was trying to have a nice dinner with my boyfriend in the same space and time other people were ordering shots and partying. Even though we were in the main dining room, there was no true separation of the two experiences. I personally don&#39;t feel that is the best kind of environment to enjoy a steak.Overall, this place is overrated and they seem to have bought into their own hype. I think people only think this place is cool because they THINK they are so supposed to think it&#39;s cool."

Ambiance is fantastic: super swanky and chic. We were seated at a table in the main dining room and I made a comment to the hostess about how I envied the gigantic candelabra centerpiece at the next table. Without hesitating, she took away our single candle and replaced it with this EPIC candelabra. That set the tone for the rest of the night, which was pure fabulousness.The food and drinks are amazing here. Yes, it&#39;s pricy, but you get what you pay for. I loved that the night started off with a complimentary round of mini-cocktails for the table, along with radish and olive small plates (so good!). Our server was super friendly and knowledgeable. Food was heaven. I sampled a ton of dishes, but highlights included the salmon tartare, the meatball starter, and the market salad. I had one of the off-menu steaks for my entree and it was outstanding: so tender and juicy, and well worth the almost $80 price tag. The loaded potato side was awesome, as was the au gratin potato side. So good! For dessert, our table shared the caramel apple tart and the cream puffs. Both were very unique and delicious.I love Maple &amp; Ash. I think that for a Chicago steakhouse, it gives you a good value for your money. I actually expected our bill to be much higher than it was. The only negative was the bus service: I felt like they were way too quick to clear the table. A few times, they took plates away before we&#39;d even finished eating, and they didn&#39;t bother to ask us if we were done. I understand the need to flip the table as quickly as possible from the restaurant owner&#39;s perspective (BTW, we met him: he&#39;s so nice!), but it could be toned down a bit.Overall, this is the new place to be in the Gold Coast. I will become a regular for sure."

It was good and a little more interesting than the typically wedge. I love the crispy glazed bacon and onion rings that were added to the salad.  I had the Filet Mignon cooked medium rare, I would probably get it rare next time, because there were portion of the steak that I thought were a little overcooked.  My husband had the New York Strip cooked medium.  He loved his preparation.  We shared the asparagus, which was okay.  We had the Baked and Loaded potato that was lacking to say the least.  They have a very diverse wine list that is sure to please at every price point. We had a bottle of Pinot Noir that was very good and priced right at $60.  My husband had an old fashioned cocktail that was okay.There are steakhouses with better food, but atmosphere and food combine makes this restaurant a must go once or a few times depending on what you are looking for...Patio is opening this summer!"

The ambiance is lush and swank--a wonderful contrast to the typical steakhouse, with it&#39;s heavy atmosphere. My favorite part of the night was the beginning. My girlfriends and I were being seated at a table with a simple, silver candlestick, but right beside a much larger table with a large candelabra. I said something about coming back with a bigger group so we could sit there, and one of my friends commented as well. After seating us, the hostess walked off and returned with the candelabra that had been at the wait station. Blonde hostess with the furry jacket, you made our night. I really had us giggling and delighted from moment one.The service continued to be really excellent, starting with a nice greeting and a refreshing complimentary round of mini-martinis. The food and drinks were wonderful as well. As a table, we ordered a market salad, salmon tartar, meatballs, the grilled salmon entree, the agnolotti, and a $70 off menu steak. All delivered, but I will say the ladies who enjoyed the steak were truly wowed by it. We also shared a number of excellent sides, included the loaded potatoes, au gratin potatoes, and broccolini (which was my personal fave, though the au gratin was also creamy and delicious). We finished it off with &#34;cream puffs.&#34; I ordered these thinking of my grandmothers and expecting something more traditional, but the pastry chef reinvented the cream puff and made it her own.It was a perfect puff filled with an amazing raspberry sorbet and covered in a pistachio sauce. Every bite was amazing.This is a spendy restaurant, but not overly so, and I felt everything I had was worth the price tag. My friends all agreed.The only things that could use improvement are the sound (it&#39;s very loud and there aren&#39;t any measures to absorb the sound at all) and the bussing. The bussers were very quick to clear things, at times things we were still working on. I don&#39;t want to feel rushed. Aside from that, it was a great experience, and let&#39;s face it: the candelabra business in the beginning made up for that to some extent. But knock it off going forward.I will surely be back and happily bring other friends to experience a great meal and wonderful atmosphere here!"

Immediately upon sitting at our table, we were greeted by a super friendly waiter, complimentary drink, and snacks on the table! Radishes with butter (tastier than it sounds), and crunchy flat bread. A perfect way to tide the group over as drink orders were taken. The aesthetic of this place is awesome - dimly lit with a rustic melting candle at the center of the table. High ceilings, elegant yet trendy hanging lighting. Really pretty. I dined with my parents, my sister, and her boyfriend. It was definitely a young crowd in the restaurant and the volume tended to get pretty loud, but it totally went with the vibe of the restaurant and didn&#39;t bother us at all.I ate the Blue Crab salad to start. It was absolutely delicious. Super light with fresh crab, avocado, and grapefruit. They top it off with some fried onions. Our waiter mentioned that the crab was supreme and he was so right.For an entree, my mom and I shared the Bone-In Ribeye. It was cooked to absolute perfection. We paired it with the au poivre sauce, and it came in a personal little copper pot on the side. I don&#39;t eat steak too often but kind of wish I had my own 22oz steak to devour. My dad opted for the Halibut and the rest of the table was pretty bitter because he never gave us a taste - he liked it so much. My sister and her bf had Steak Frites - I didn&#39;t get a taste of that either. Long story short: everyone was beyond satisfied.We had mushrooms, broccolini, and mac n cheese on the side to share. The broccolini was my favorite (a seasonal option, I believe).As if the food could get better, our waiter (still doing a great job) recommended we have the Chocolate Banana Bulleit Bomb. Oh my god. Absolutely unreal. We shared it for the table (all 5 of us absolutely attacked it after the waiter poured hot caramel sauce over a chocolate shell to reveal the goodies underneath). One of the best things I&#39;ve put in my mouth.Overall, really amazing experience. We&#39;ve dined at a LOT of places in Chicago and this goes down as one of the top three experiences - food + ambiance + service. We were there for probably 2.5-3 hours and loved every minute of it."

We are two small people. More than enough extremely delicious food. Steak was perfection and mashed potatoes that were out of this world. Also had the mushrooms that were alright but I would not order them again.Dessert, the sundae bar. It was as if that placed a dream in front if me and I was worried I would wake from this dream before I finished!Service was terrific. Jennifer was right on task.

Maple &amp; Ash is on point.Hubs and I got came during their soft opening and were very impressed. Downstairs is the bar area... when you come in you are escorted to the elevator which takes you to the 2nd floor dining room.  The dining room is beautiful.  The seating, the decor, the chandeliers... so perfect.  The dinner was candlelit- which was a nice intimate touch- perhaps make the candle sticks shorter though to avoid a bad situation lol.Their menu is so cute and fun to read lol. We started with the smoked foie gras, which was great with the strawberry preserves.  The bone in filet mignon was delicious!! I would skip the roasted bone marrow- it was a disappointment if you&#39;re a huge bone marrow fan like myself :(  You must get the baked and loaded potato. It is a must. It not only has cheese and all that good stuff in it, but also braised beef, oh and topped with black truffles. YAS.Can&#39;t wait to come back and try everything else!!"

M&amp;A really impressed me a made me a return diner with a combination of service, food, and decor.Service - The real differentiator to me. Everyone that worked here was genuinely gracious, knowledgeable, and excited to serve you. From the hostess, to the cocktail waitress, to the waiter and the maître d&#39;. Our waiter Antor was truly exceptional. He expertly guided us through the menu and made great recommendations including a reasonable priced pinot noir from their varied yet sometimes pricey wine list.Food - Other reviewers dogged their steaks. I thought my petite filet was delicious. Very tender and full of flavor. A standout was the Baked &amp; Loaded potato, a creative and delectable take of a twice baked potato that rises to a new level with pork belly and shallots. Friends had the lamb chops, once again tender and the right amount of lamb flavor without going gamey. Creamed spinach - simple dish exquisitely prepare. fresh spinach that was complimented but not overpowered by the dairy.Decor - elegant and memorable. I am stealing a couple decorating ideas for my dining room.Kudo&#39;s to the bar staff - The night started out with a complementary cocktail. Can&#39;t beat an Amuse Booze.

I prefer the latter. This is the best steak I&#39;ve had in recent memory. Flawlessly seared, seasoned and cooked to a perfect medium rare. The complimentary amuse bouche and sample cocktails were a nice touch. Seafood Tower was impressive with a varied selection of char grilled indulgence.  I highly recommend for special occasions or to impress that special someone. Pricey, but worth every C-note."

We made a reservation for three at 6pm on a Friday evening.  Upon arrival we were impressed with the decor and atmosphere.We ordered several dishes to share: foie gras pate, scallops, salmon tartare, cowgirl steak, the volcano, and sautéed broccolini.Foie gras pate had good flavor but it was not as good as seared foie gras.  Scallops were cooked perfectly. Salmon tartare lacked some seasoning.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare.   The volcano was rich and flavorful. Sautéed broccolini was very tasty.  For the dessert,  we had a macaroon with vanilla ice cream and it was so delicious without being very sweet.Our server was very knowledgeable and attentive.  We had a great time."

When I arrived, I was confused about whether I could sit Downstairs or upstairs...because you see, the steakhouse is only upstairs...but there is also a wait for the upstairs which left us with sitting downstairs. So, we ordered a drink and starting looking at the menu. Unfortunately, there was a electric fire in the alley and the lights went off and we had to leave. The owners were nice enough not to charge for our drinks and it was not their fault. I was also impressed how they handled the chaos. When we went outside the whole area was smokey. We plan to come back when we can find mutual time. I will update my rating based on the food at that time."

I&#39;m a Chicago native who follows all the trendy, new restaurants. I now live in NY and of all the amazing Chicago restaurants I chose Maple and Ash to dine at with my limited time home.First impressions:- Decor and ambience were outstanding- Greeted at the door, directed to the elevator to take us to the dining area and I love that they communicated from downstairs that we were on our way up.- We were seated promptly- Really nice touch with the complimentary drink once we were seatedThe rest was downhill. Our waitress was terrible, inauthentic and not attentive. She didn&#39;t take our drink orders and when she did take the order, our drinks did not come for at least 20 min. They finally brought out a drink and forgot mine. No apology or offer to get that round. The wine guy came over at the beginning and we never saw him again. Meanwhile the table next to us was being courted by the owner and chef with caviar bumps and a full spread of desserts so they aren&#39;t completely frugal.The octopus shared plate was phenomenal. The steak tartare was mediocre. Market salad nothing special.We ordered the halibut as a main and it was tasty but cold. The meatballs were also cold. Our waitress was unaware of this because she never came over to ask how the food was.Earlier in the night the waitress asked if we werecelebrating anything. We told her it was my birthday and when it came time for dessert she gave us the menu but by that point I was ready to get out of there. I was surprised that they didn&#39;t spontaneously bring any dessert and wondered why even ask the question at the beginning. It was nice to see the table next to us get served every dessert on the menu complimentary.Good thing at the end of the day it&#39;s just food..."

Even if you are not a steak lover, they have plenty of delicious options and everything on their menu was executed top-notch! I almost said &#34;well done&#34;, but I don&#39;t want to give you the wrong idea, the meat was fabulous!We enjoyed outstanding east coast oysters, salmon and steak tartars, shrimp cocktail (usually too boring of a dish for me) was out of this world! Than we all got our perfect steaks (for meat enthusiasts I must mention, they do have the bone-in-fillet!!!) with world winning roasted brussels sprouts and whipped potatoes... one of us ordered the short-rib with bone marrow pot pie (delish!!!) Dessert was also on par and fabulously presented (see pictures!)WINEI must add that they have an outstanding wine list with a ton of options at a good range of prices and a great by-the-glass variety. I am sad that I forgot the name of their sommelier (he was working on Friday night (Jan 15) - he was excellent! The Gruner and Chateauneuf Du Pape he suggested both stole my heart! He even allowed us to taste his by-the glass suggestion (which I always appreciate!)ATMOSPHEREIts a grand looking plush space that screams &#34;luxury&#34; and therefore attracts the most beautiful people.SERVICEAbsolutely impeccable! We took out my dear friends for a special occasion and they made it a VIP experience. The entire staff was fantastic***One suggestion for the management:I would cut out the initial greeting-monologue the waiter does. I understand the intention behind this, but it sounds rehearsed and it cheapens otherwise high-end experience. In my opinion this element belongs at Weber Grill :) Please note that our waiter was very good!"

We were seated promptly in a nice spot with tall ceilings. Service struggled from that point.One server arrived with menus to tell us about specials and then seemingly disappeared. Another server eventually came by to tell us about specials. A little awkward. We instead ordered.Four of five meals were placed. No news about the last meal so we waited and waited. Eventually an apology with no real explanation. Probably happens routinely. The restaurant eventually delivered and then comped the missing meal. A manager apologized and was attentive for the remainder.Steaks and seafood were good, though forgettable, and  the steep prices aren&#39;t justified given the amateurish service.Epilogue 1/25: the owner of Maple and Ash, Brian, phoned as well as replying to the review. To his credit, it&#39;s clear that he&#39;s sincere and determined to offer good service. We would happily return for another meal as Brian fixes the flaws we experienced."

My friend and I were finally able to try Maple and Ash on a random Tuesday night. Like other reviewers stated, this place is pretty hopping. Even with a reservation we waited about 10 minutes,  but that&#39;s no big deal because the cocktails were delish.When we were seated, they started off by providing a cocktail tasting, cheese, fresh olives, and radishes with butter. These were all quite tasty.For appetizers, we had the meatballs with garlic bread and the wedge salad. The garlic bread was probably some of the best I have ever had, considering this isn&#39;t even an Italian restaurant. The meatballs were good too! If you are a bleu cheese and bacon fan, the wedge salad is up your alley!  The bacon is thick cut and so juicy. We also shared a seafood platter. This was probably some of the best lobster and crab I have ever had. Is it weird that I found the crab to be reminiscent of tandoori chicken??Finally, the steak was cooked perfectly. One bite makes you just sit back in pure enjoyment. My only critique is that the mashed potatoes were good,  but maybe a bit too buttery.Oh and how can I forget the service?? The servers were friendly and helpful. It is also evident that the chefs truly care about making this place successful. I will definitely be back."

They were delicious! I would go back again just for them. Literally outstanding. The one thing about this restaurant was it was so hot inside. It was a really cold day and I know they were trying to keep the restaurant warm. I would just make sure not to wear a heavy sweater.

We opted for the downstairs, laid-back bar vibe and upscale take on pub-ish food where one could get a steak while another a burger, and so on and so forth.But immediately I knew we might be in for an uphill service battle when I came back from the restroom and our server had already taken drink orders while I was away. This is a classy joint, right? I mean, it&#39;s not McDonalds. My party alerted you I was in the restroom - why not wait a moment? Because then, I had to wait many, many moments. Which was how the rest of our night with our server - whose name I&#39;ll leave off here outta respect - would be paced out. With lots and lots of space.In fact, when I finally decided on a wine, it was the manager (I&#39;m guessing - or some other strapping fellow in a suit and tie) who saw my desperate searching eyes (for our server) and veered over to our table immediately to take my order.The space isn&#39;t enormous. I don&#39;t know why our server was so lackadaisical in the service department.The space is just like it looks on the website so I&#39;m not going to go into it. Look at the website. Voila. I love the gold touches and chandeliers. And the bar cart in the ladies room. Nice.Starters: Oysters, and burrata with prosciutto. The oysters were extremely fresh, plump and delicious. Some of the best I&#39;ve had lately. The burrata was outweighed heavily in terms of portion size by the prosciutto, which was a bummer, because I don&#39;t eat pork so I was banking on that cheese! But those who did eat the prosciutto said it was on-point. The charred tomatoes were salty and just perfect. The accompanying toasts tasty.There was also roasted tomato soup (tad salty, but the smoky flavor was outstanding due to the blue cheese, maybe?), chicken parm sandwiches (little dry), steak frites (the stand-out dish of the evening) and the downstairs burger.Drinks were outstanding - particularly the &#34;when lonesome droves cry.&#34; Try it, you won&#39;t be disappointed.But, when your plates are stacked high on your table and no one has come by to bus them - and once again the manager sees your anxious eyes, and he does - those flavors melt into annoyance. We each had 2 drinks plus 2 individual bottles of wine and the mentioned above plates/starters. Do the math, we spent a decent penny here and our server was as absent as a deadbeat dad. It was Mr. Gray Suit who took care of us - from my drink order, taking our plates away, getting our check and wishing us a good evening.Maybe they save the better servers for upstairs? I&#39;m not sure... but I had been dying to bring some clients here and now I&#39;m just not so sure.Be the judge yourself."

We arrived a few minutes early and were not seated until 8:05. That&#39;s completely unacceptable when paying the prices that they charge, not to mention the fact that they were completely non challant about making us wait. The food was very good but I expect to be done with a 7:15 reservation before 9:45 when skipping appetizers and desserts. And most restaurants of that price range would have the manager come by and apologize rather than acting annoyed when you check in every 15 minutes that they&#39;re late to seat you.On the food, we all got the bone in fillet which was very good but I was a little annoyed that had to choose between the bone in fillet and the 6 OZ. Every other steak house I&#39;ve been to offers an 8 - 10 OZ boneless which I generally prefer.To wrap it up, food was very good but would not return due to service and price of comparable restaurants. Go to Gibsons or Joes and save your time and money."

I honestly felt as if I was walking onto the set of the Great Gatsby.The meal came in four courses and everything was incredible, from the seafood tower, tartar, filet mignon, and the chocolate cake. The staff was super attentive and really funny (to the South Korean girl with the &#39;missiles&#39; you were amazing).After dinner we stayed in the bar area and our bartender, Melissa, was super fun, tentative, and was really the cherry on top of an already amazing evening.We&#39;ll definitely be back!"

Get the sundae dessert!!! It was amazing and I was the happiest person ever after that. My only issue, the hostess was so rude! Not sure why. We had a reservation for 10 and were a little early so I checked in and told her we would be at the bar. She rolled her eyes and said I&#39;m way too early? I wasn&#39;t asking for a table I was completely aware I needed to wait until 10 for a table. So I just laughed it off and went to the bar. Long story short.. We weren&#39;t seated until after 10:30. I get it, it happens. I honestly wouldn&#39;t care if the host was nicer but she was so rude I was ready to just leave. Glad I stayed because our server made up for her terrible service."

Meatballs and prawns are the perfect start.  Bone marrow is a must. Our steaks where PERFECTLY cooked and the service was beyond-on point.  Sides like the wild mushrooms and gratin are perfect for two people.  The house made ginger beer in the Moscow Mule was not for me, but The Simplest Move cocktail made up for it.Our server Mathew, was funny, engaging and coursed things out perfectly.  The whole staff from start to finish was friendly and engaging.  The hosts are on point and make you feel welcome.  This is a great example of people who have worked in the industry for years and trained/selected a top notch staff.  Kudos to the Maple &amp; Ash team.  From a chef with 17 years experience, you have earned a returned customer!If Maple &amp; Ash was picking up my daughter for prom...I would toss him the keys to my car, pat him on the back and say &#34; see ya in the morning champ!&#34;Thank you for being part of the best birthday everWill see you again soon!"

Everything about this place is superb! Incredible decor, friendly staff, and awesome atmosphere.Matt G. took great care of me at the downstairs bar. I enjoyed two drinks, a Manhattan and a Sazerac, and both were made to perfection. Don&#39;t be shy to ask for your favorite concoction even if it isn&#39;t on the menu.This is a perfect place to start your night with friends or to take a lovely date.

The space is well decorated and packed, the food is expensive but good, and it&#39;s so loud that my table of six on a recent visit could barely hear anybody that wasn&#39;t sitting directly next to them at a round table.Get the steak, get the seafood, get the lamb chops which is the largest portion of lamb chops I&#39;ve ever seen. Every appetizer we tried was very good as were the sides.  Wine list is large and has just about everything you would need. The biggest issue on my initial visit was noise and service.  Nobody wants to sit down and have the boss order a bottle of Champagne recommended by the server and then it comes out too warm. So we sit and wait for the Champagne to chill apparently and after sitting for almost 60 minutes we had been served nothing but bread, water, radishes, and olives.  Finally the Champagne came out, shortly followed by appetizers, then additional wine, entrees, sides, etc. And the food is very good, but when you&#39;re paying these prices I expect the service to be much better.It&#39;s a high priced steakhouse, not my preferred option for dining out but most Americans love an expensive steak when they go out to eat (which just seems strange because it&#39;s so easy to make a good steak at home) so as long as the economy is good I imagine Maple &amp; Ash will continue to be packed. Was it good? Yes. Do I personally expect to be back? No."

Drinks here are phenomenal, and the ambiance is trendy and fun. Perfect place to take a date or to entertain your clients.The warm oysters had a delectable sauce that I can say have been my favorite oyster dish in all of Chicago. The amuse bouche that was given was a cocktail, which is certainly different than any other restaurant I&#39;ve been to. However, instead of bread and butter they serve you radish and butter-- bleghh. I don&#39;t want to snack on radishes.I had the Volcano--a take on beef bourignon with a pie crust built to look like a volcano-- very cute. Whatever steak we had (I&#39;m not much of a steak person) was delicious, and I loved the broccolini.Service was good--- it&#39;s definitely the ambiance and feel of this place that I love the most."

maple-and-ash-chicago,Bobby B.,4DjnWrFt_m7uAkFYZiWElw,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,10,sSmYta9OET3LUVraPE4Xzg,3.0,2016-10-12,"I have decided to write this review after several poor dining experiences with Maple &amp;a Ash. Since they have opened, which my first experience was during the private invitation opening, I have had some of the worst experiences dining with them. The details that I will provide has happened each time I have gone out to eat there. To begin, I am an avid user of Open Table and will continue using Open Table to make reservations. On two separate occasion I have tried to reserve a table with Maple &amp; Ash through Open Table and have been unable to due to a notifications that the restaurant is &#34;offline&#34; and unable to accept reservations. I then have to call and make a reservation over the phone. Not the end of the world to do it this way, but I gain points using Open Table. When I have called to make reservations, the hospitality and friendliness of the hosts who answer has been below par. They don&#39;t make the customer feel excited to come in or feel appreciated for the business. And trust me, this is not a cheap restaurant. As I continue with my detailed experiences, I have now arrived at the restaurant. When I greet the hosts, again, their hospitality, friendliness, and demeanor towards me has been terrible. The way I have been treated and talked to by the hosts has been disrespectful. I am a younger male than the average aged guest at this restaurant and when I have arrived each time, the way the hosts have greeted me has been that &#34;I am not good enough or don&#39;t have money to be here&#34;. If that was the case I wouldn&#39;t dine there; multiple time. So I have arrived now at the restaurant. Each time the hosts has told me that the table is not ready for me. I understand that most times at all restaurants a table may not be ready at the exact time of the reservation. But it&#39;s completely unacceptable to make a guest wait a minimum of 40min beyond the reservation time to wait to be seated. There has never been an apologies for making me wait of saying thank you for being understanding. So I have finally been seated after waiting at least 40mins. After being seated, the waiting staff has come to me each time and has said &#34;here is a mini martini on the house for waiting&#34;. Um no. Everyone gets the mini martini. It&#39;s just part of the restaurant and how they operate to make you feel welcomed. By this point I don&#39;t feel welcomed after waiting 40mins or more to be seated. Great, thanks for the free watered down martini, that everyone gets. Okay so far this has been my experience each time I have been to Maple &amp; Ash. Now for my detailed experience from my reservation on 10/7/2016 at 8pm. Now I&#39;ve been at the table for a bit of time. The waiter came to the table and was not welcoming or the most friendliest of staff members. The way he carried himself and how he spoke with us was like he was our friend. We place our drink and appetizer order. I physically saw the waiter write down our order. The drinks arrive in a timely manner. The appetizer that was placed in front of me was not what I ordered. I ordered the octopus. What I got was a wedge salad. I told the staff this is not what I ordered. All I was told was that the salad is on the house. I stared blankly and didn&#39;t know what just happened. No one came to me to explain as to why appetizers for the table did not come out. I don&#39;t know if they forgot to put the order in or if they were out of the item. I was told nothing. By the way, the wedge salad is not that good for $16. At this point we are at strike two. Waiting for over 40mins was the first, now the appetizer I ordered never came out and there was no explanation. That&#39;s the second. The entrée order has been placed now. By the time our entrée arrived it took 55min from the time of the order to when they brought it to the table. The entrée arrives. Everything was correct. The steak was cooked well. The sides were very good. Okay so one good thing happened to far. Don&#39;t get to excited because it goes back to bad. Entrees are done. Table is cleared. The waiter comes back to the table and puts his hands on the table and leans over and asks if we would like desert. We tell him yes that we want to know what the desert options are. He explains to the table what was being offered. We ask to have a few minutes to decide on what we would like to have. After about 10min he returns to the table. Instead of asking if we decided on what we would like for desert, he hands us the check book. Again, I stare blankly and don&#39;t understand what just happened. At this point I&#39;m furious. I look at the check in confusion and see that only two glasses of wine were comped, but the wedge salad was applied to the bill. I asked the waiter to clarify the bill. He said the two glasses of wine were comped for having to wait. The salad will be comped as well for your appetizer. At this point no one has explained to me what happened with the appetizer order and the desert order we wanted to place. Still being furious, the updated bill comes and I pay it."

The spinellis ribeye melts in your mouth. Make sure to reserve a piece of it when you make your reservation. The potatoes are to die for and oysters were really fresh. Great aura and service.

The ambiance is phenomenal, think classy garden party. Brass and gold fixtures pop on walls painted burgundy and blue. The seating upstairs is plush and comfie and skylights let in natural light. Right down to the elaborate flower arrangements that adorn the rooms, this place has that fancy feeling, while the waitstaff and vibe remain down to earth.I have come for drinks on both Friday and Saturday nights and during the week for dinner. I have the &#34;Not a Cosmo&#34; which basically IS a cosmo but in a rocks glass. It&#39;s good but dangerous. Speaking from experience it&#39;s a lot stronger than it tastes!Also visited for dinner on a Wednesday night. My date and I were not that hungry so opted to go with shrimp cocktails and lobster salads. The salads were amazing and the shrimp cocktail was perfect too. I was not a big fan of the grapefruit garnish in the salad, but the lobster was awesome. With that said, I don&#39;t think the waitress was too thrilled we were sitting at her table on a Wednesday night and not ordering more food. She pretty much rolled her eyes when she heard we were passing up steaks and pricey entrees for two low-dollar salads. Fine, whatever. The plus side was our salads came out in literally two minutes flat I think. I would come again to sit outside. Maybe i will save up my money so I can order some steak next time and not piss off the waitress. Or not haha."

The ambiance and decor was incredible. Trendy, chic and spacious, with beautiful candles and candelabras on every table. The service was excellent and the staff KNEW the menu. And most importantly, the food was AMAZING--each and every dish.My companion and I decided to order the &#34;I don&#39;t give a F*** menu&#34;, which was a bit scary... It is a fixed price menu and they don&#39;t tell you what you will be eating, nor the number of courses, nor do they ask if you have allergies. (Neither of us did, so were were ready to venture into the unknown. But if you have allergies, definitely divulge this information.)Anyway, each dish that came was a surprise and perfectly cooked. By the end of the dinner, I found myself full. They definitely do not skimp on the portion sizes! Even so, I was left wanting more!Thanks Maple &amp; Ash, I will be visiting again."

Pretty much everything we had was absolutely amazing. I ordered the butter paneer and the samosas. The butter paneer came with a paratha, which they must have added after complaints that it came with nothing before. One paratha was enough to finish the bowl. It was delicious! I think I ate it within 10 minutes, I couldn&#39;t stop. The samosas were okay, I recommend going to Tahoora in Devon for that. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the sauces it came with either.Overall, great food and a good time."

No, there is no reference to Pulp Fiction. Now, on to the good stuff.Pub Royale is everything right with the world. The vibe is awesome, the beer/drink list is impressive with a quirky, yet informative train station schedule-inspired layout at the back of the bar, and the food is magnificently well executed.It&#39;s hard to choose just a couple of noshes from the descriptions (they all taste so good, for serious), so having a gameplan is key.Couple of things to get you started: hot chicken is a must try, you WILL lick the bowl of the buttered paneer if ordered, samosas are always a good choice, and their mussels are some of the best I&#39;ve had in the city (if you&#39;re into that sort of thing.)I&#39;ve always had a good time when I&#39;ve come here and have also always felt compelled to compliment the chef(s).My only reservation would be that Division Street has become kind of sports bar/bro bar central lately and it hurts me sometimes to walk through/past a multitude of people shouting at/with one another.Even still, gets a 5 all around."

We waited around like 30 min, which isn&#39;t bad at all. It was pretty busy, but it still took some time to get our servers attention to order.We ordered a Frozen Mango Lassi, Samosas, Keema Paratha, and the Mussels with Naan. Everything was seriously soooo good. I don&#39;t know if the beers we had before just heightened our tastebuds, but everything was finger licking good!The Frozen Mango Lassi is spiked with Bacardi and the drink was STRONG! Every sip had a kick so be forewarned!The Samosas were filled with visible potatoes chunks unlike the ones I&#39;ve had before where it&#39;s more of a mash, and the potsto flavor was so prominent, I loved it! The seasoning was also perfect and the sauces they came with were delicious! The green cilantro sauce was my favorite!The Keema Paratha was to me, similar to a quesadilla. The lamb was sandwiched in between two pieces of naan and was very lamb tasting which put me off at first but the yogurt sauce was the real winner here. Dipping or smearing the sauce onto the Keema Paratha took away that gamey taste. I would dip everything in that sauce, it was so good!The Mussels and Naan just sent us to heaven. The seasoning was perfect and had the right amount of kick to it that we just went silent for like 5 minutes just to keep dipping our naan into the sauce and eating. There were plenty of mussels in the dish and the sauce was phenomenal!Although we had to wait a while to get seated and to order, the food was such a game changer! Definitely give this place a try!"

It&#39;s sometimes difficult to find kickass vegan options, but this place has it!  The food is a cross between Indian fare, pub food, and British grub, so it&#39;s really interesting.  The presentation and flavors will knock your socks off - every dish that I&#39;ve had here has been fantastic.Finally: service.  Again, I&#39;ll reiterate how helpful the servers have been.  Additionally, I reserved a rather large table for my husband&#39;s birthday and they were extremely accommodating to our large group, which is of particular significance for a small and BUSY place.I&#39;m already planning my next trip back, see you there!"

An al la carte establishment? Who knows - because no one tells you! Not even the menu.If you don&#39;t know, now you know - nothing comes with what you order e.g. no rice, no naan, no nada. I would have liked some rice with my brunch main (gobi manchurian, which was delightfully spicy, crisp and full of flavor.) My wife&#39;s combination #2 said it wasn&#39;t spicy, but it definitely had way more of a kick than it should have. Garlic naan the first time around was crunchy yet soft, perfect. Second time around, not cooked as much, not as good. Samosas were perfect.I guess I&#39;m a little turned off by the pricing and what you get for it. I was also miffed that my main came out before my wife&#39;s, so we sat and waited and I asked the waitress where the other bits and bops were, to which she told me, &#34;It arrives upon completion.&#34; Didn&#39;t know that, either........just wish there was a little more explanation behind how and what to order.Waitstaff was friendly enough, if not a bit socially awkward. Whatever. About four different people waited on us so it&#39;s not like I can give kudos to one or the other. They all did their jobs just fine.Would I come back? Probably not. Living closer to Devon than Wicker negates that decision..."

We went there with moderately high expectations after seeing the positive yelp reviews! First all, we arrived at 6:30pm on a Friday night and there were a lot of open seats at the time, but we wouldn&#39;t get seated until all parties arrived, so I guess that is just the policy so we respected that.When we were ready to order food, one of our friends is gluten intolerant, and he asked the server if it was possible to have Chicken Tikka Kati Roll on rice instead.  The server said no for &#34; presentation&#34; purposes, they couldn&#39;t do it.  So, my poor friend asked if it was possible to add chicken to Palak Paneer dish. Server said again no, for presentation purposes, they couldn&#39;t do it but naan  can be substituted with rice. It makes no sense at all as to why some dishes can be substituted and some cannot.  Honestly, it sounds more like everything was pre-made in large quantity and they were junwilling to accommodate people with food allergy by making small changes or being a little creative.We ordered palak paneer with rice, which was $12, and were expecting a full entree.  Boy, it was a small dish. It was not particularly tasty either. I had to order a side of fries after the dish.  Others ordered the burger, cheese Royale, which was $14. It was tasty but it was quite small for $14 and it was not amazing.   The fries that came with the burgers were cold.  The bill for four people with 4 entrees and 6 drinks (mostly beers) came out to be about $120.  Not too expensive but definitely not cheap for a &#34;pub&#34; especially the portion size is small.It&#39;s funny because the server told us because of the &#34;presentation&#34; reasons, we couldn&#39;t add or substitute but ironically our food didn&#39;t all come out at the same time.  The people that ordered palak paneer got their food way early, and folks that ordered the burgers got them later... I mean I get it this is a pub, but since they claimed to care to about the &#34; presentation&#34; so much that they couldn&#39;t make changes,  I would think having all the food to come out at the same time would be a priority for the restaurant.The decor is very cute but it has very strange seating arrangement. There are some tight tables that can seat four.  However, if you are a party of two, then another party will be sharing a table with you.  I get the concept of siting together in a long table that can fit 10, but the table is quite small and intimate, and it&#39;s only for 4 people.  You are basically in the other party&#39;s conversation and frankly,  the people looked quite uncomfortable having to share a table for four with random folks, both emotionally and physically.  Even a couple decided to just walk away.Anyway, I am glad that I tried it out.  I would probably come here for a drink or two on the way somewhere, but I wouldn&#39;t come back here for another dinning experience."

I loved every part of my meal here.I ordered a boozy Mango Lassi - what you expect of a mango lassi mixed with Bacardi! They toss paprika on top so that gave it a kick. I loved it.My friends and I shared food, and we ordered a lot. We started off with samosas. They weren&#39;t too large, but definitely shareable. I liked that the potatoes were super mashed with the other ingredients; sometimes I find that samosa fillings fall apart. Then, we got the garlic naan, which was also pretty good. We got a Buttered Paneer dish, which was paneer in this lighter tomato sauce. It wasn&#39;t overly creamy, and perfect with naan. We also ordered the lentils and chicken tikka wrap. The wrap was a little dry, but overall seasoned very well.I&#39;m definitely coming back here to try the other drinks. This is a very unique spot!"

The place is pretty chill inside, a bit small but it works. I&#39;d avoid the tables in front since it looks more like a depart from actual restaurant seating.We ordered a ton on the menu... we got the eggplant curry, lamb dumplings, buttered paneer, chicken tikka roll and gobi manchurian. The eggplant curry was pretty bomb - it would be enough for one person, but we were splitting everything. Lamb dumplings were good but they only provided four - we bulldozed through them. Buttered paneer was pretty good as well, maybe not as good as the eggplant curry, but it seemed like paneer with a butter chicken sauce. This was probably the largest dish of them all and had tons of curry.I had half of a chicken tikka roll which was OK - I think they need to put a curry or something else inside. They had three small sides to it, a chutney, some red liquid, and a dahi/raita one as well. Overall it was average, nothing on the eggplant/butter paneer. I didn&#39;t try the gobi manchurian so I can&#39;t speak on that.I&#39;m striking one star off because the paratha with the butter paneer/tikka roll was pretty underwhelming. I don&#39;t think its Tandoor baked so it was definitely a different consistency. I know it&#39;s thinner than a naan, but I was expecting something more. Maybe I&#39;m picky, but you should have a good time here and should check it out."

Today we decided to stop by for brunch and were equally impressed. I love a good gobi manchurian and this was better than most Indian restaurants- light and crispy but still hearty and spicy. We also had the pub salad with egg. The crispy chickpeas were awesome definitely my favorite part of that.We finished with the stuffed egg paratha- it was so rich and decadent. The three things were definitely enough for two- were stuffed!I had the ice coffee which was as expected while my fiancé had the bloody maharani. That was super spicy but she enjoyed it. Another great meal!

As its name implies, the restaurant is set up like a pub with a decorative bar and interesting furnishings. The drink menu includes a very good draft beer list and lots of cocktails. I enjoyed one of their riffs on a Pimms cup. There were 4 of us and we ordered the shrimp dish, the hot chicken, the spinach and the lentil dish. Sorry I don&#39;t remember the proper names for them. Also had the deep fried califlower that resembles general tso&#39;s chicken in flavor and appearance. We loved everything. The service was remarkably good, it was unbelievable how knowledgable our server Jolene was. She seemed to know every ingredient and flavor in each dish and knew how to pair the drinks with the food. We were too stuffed for dessert, but they have a donut that looks delicious.I only wish this place was closer to us but we will make the trip back soon. We found street parking about a half block away, not bad for a Saturday night. They have some outdoor seating but it was nice sitting inside where they had the doors open to the fresh air."

It&#39;s Indian...with a twist?We headed here for brunch in a bid to avoid the long lines everywhere else. BRUNCH IN THE CHI IS AN INSTITUTION and takes training, timing, and patience. We had none of these, so we headed to a queue-free spot: Pub Royale!Indoor and outdoor seating, we nabbed a booth and settled in to some (really nicely brewed) coffee. Not a lot of coffee drink-style options (see: no iced coffee) (gentle tip: maybe expand into some iced coffee for the summer months?), but strong coffee nonetheless.The brunch menu includes some surprises like deviled shrimp with grits, and haddock kedgeree. The royale with cheese was an almost-order, but I went for the Indian hot chicken which was served with a raita (required to cool down from the spicy fried chicken), and some lime pickle. The piece of chicken was substantial, though it could have used a little green (a small side salad?) on the plate. Totally worth the $14.Also ordered was the cucumber raita &#34;salad&#34; which was a mish mash of cubed cucumber, red onion, cooling yogurt and spices. It was nice, and refreshing; simple, but in a good way, and a recommended order to offset the heat of the mains. We also tucked in to the gobi manchurian which was my favourite bite of the meal: tempura-style cauliflower with a spicy sauce, topped with some coriander and chopped nuts. A super combination. Another dish ordered (YES WE HAD A LARGE MEAL) was the peanut noodles with broad beans. Although heavy on the cumin, these noodles were an interesting mix of flavours, benefitting from a squeeze of lime over the whole shebang.Service was attentive, beer list extensive, and the range of boozy &#34;cups&#34; (cocktail options) was nice for a brunch.BRUNCH ROYALE!Yelp note: not an amazing range of mains for vegetarians."

There are a couple caveats to my rating, but overall, this place rocks. Came in on a Saturday night with the boyfriend and put our name in. While we were quoted an hour, we were seated in a half hour. It was a freezing cold, blustery night and we were seated in the front of the restaurant...at a four top...with another couple. Totally understand they&#39;re maximizing space, but be aware your date night could be shared with others. Additionally, if you visit in the winter, I would wait for a table in the back, the arctic wind kept creeping in through the front door any time it opened.Our waiter came over quickly and we ordered some drinks. I have to echo others here, I would stick with their craft beer selection and steer away from the ice-filled mixed drinks. Great craft beer selection though! For eats, the lamb dumplings and crispy cauliflower were a phenom way to start the meal. We also had the palak paneer and Indian hot chicken, which were both delicious. Serving sizes are Pub Royale are generous and the food is rich, highly recommend sharing a bunch of items to try a bit of everything. Additionally, the atmosphere was lively and bar was packed on a Saturday night. I&#39;m definitely going back in the summer to sit outside!Overall, Pub Royale is a really unique spot and awesome addition to Division. After my last experience, I probably won&#39;t have another date night here, but it would be a great place to grab drinks and some bites with a group."

When our table was ready they made us awkwardly stand around and wait for our friends to show up who were trying to find parking. As you may know, this area becomes insanely busy on weekends. I get that this is their policy, but I still felt kind of goofy standing squarely in the middle and getting in everyone&#39;s way.Once we did get seated, we put in our orders and things came out pretty quickly. They&#39;re of the small plate, everyone share variety of dishes. From least fave (which doesn&#39;t mean bad) to favorite:Lamb dumplings - Good, but I&#39;m also partial to lamb.India hot chicken - Not too spicy, but still pretty tasty.Buttered paneer - So, imagine a big bowl of the sauce butter chicken is made with, with cheese. Super savory and went great with naan.Gobi manchurian - We were all kind of shocked with this...it was like General Tso went all vegetarian and made a cauliflower dish. Sweet, crunchy, and nutty; I want more of this.Overall I really liked the food and drinks, and that night just made me want to return and try their other items. It gets a little tight since they&#39;re so popular, but you know from the scent as soon as you step in that it&#39;s going to be worth it."

They do not take reservations so we rolled the dice to see if we could get in @ 7:30 on a Thursday night. They told us that it would be a 30 minute wait which was really maybe a 15 minute wait...cool! They have the setup where they text you when your table is ready and you have 10 minutes to claim it. They secured us a hi-top in the back as the place was jam packed and it was better than squeezing into the communal hi tops as it looked like your elbows would be rubbing your neighbor the whole time.We were starving so we started out with the salted cod samosas in which I was skeptical about, but they were very good along with the malt vinegar chutney. Lots of goodies on the menu but we opted to share a couple of entrees. We got the chicken tikka kati roll which was huge. My dining companion is Indian and she even was shocked to see how big it was...was like a burrito actually. It was pretty good despite its huge stature LOL! We also go the India Hot Chicken which was mad spicy, but good and just like the kati roll, a huge portion. Due to the fact that we were full from the samosas and huge kati roll, we didnt really put that much of a dent in the hot chicken and took most of it and the naan to go.The service was meh as we got our food before we got napkins and utensils and had to pause because we needed those things to eat. I actually had to get up and go looking for someone to get napkins. Also, it would have been nice to know the size of the portions when we ordered as we probably would not have gone with one of the entrees as we were full from the first one...I guess its all good because leftovers are always good. I will chalk the meh service up to the fact that they were pretty damn busy which is a good thing for them."

English-Indian pub fare with calculated drink list; something Chicago hadn&#39;t possessed until this place opened. To begin, the drinks are spot on. One of my favorite cocktail/beer lists in the entire city of Chicago. All Pimm&#39;s Cups (tried them all) are innovative and delicious. I haven&#39;t tried the Leatherbee selections that are there now, but I can already tell you I wish they&#39;d bring back the Pimm&#39;s Cups. The spiked mango lassi is my favorite! The rotating beer list featuring hard-to-find English ales also shines.The food is good; but not great. Both takes on the samosa, lamb dumplings, and eggplant curry were great. The gobi manchurian, however, featured a sauce that seemed like it could be pulled out of a freezer, microwaved on top, and sold at Trader Joe&#39;s... I&#39;d rather eat at an authentic Indian joint with similar pricing than eat here again, to be honest. Tasting of dessert donuts pending...The glaring issue with this joint (and all Heisler joints) is the chaos associated with finding a place to sit. This arrangement is good and well at joints like Sportsman&#39;s, Queen Mary, and Lone Wolf where food is not the focal point, however at a place like Pub Royale, food takes center stage and the staff should respect that. Having to scurry around the crowded bar to pick up an open table is often chaotic in argumentative. Not to mention the fact that people routinely hover around tables that look like they are leaving. It&#39;s inconvenient to both the seated table and those waiting. It would BEHOOVE the good people here to install a host stand, hire a host, and even if you don&#39;t take reservations, let people wait on tables and call them when they&#39;re ready. It&#39;s good customer service, would add a touch of class, and remove a giant pain in the ass."

But I am sorry to say, do not believe the hype, especially if you know what good Indian food tastes like. Items we tried:1) Samosas - these were the only good things we had. Delicious chutneys and great flavor in the potato stuffing.2) Chicken Tikka &#34;Kati Roll&#34; - definitely not a kati roll. This is like a fusion between bland chicken tikka and a flour tortilla, which gets rid of the main and most delicious component of a kati roll, the parantha. One of the chicken tikka kati rolls had a huge bone inside of it. What????3) Gobi Manchurian - this should be called fried cauliflower with extra oil. Honestly not sure how this is the best item on the menu. There was at least 5 layers of oil and every bite of the gobi (cauliflower) came with a squirt of oil.4) Spicy Chicken - this had decent flavor but also came with layers of oil. Indian food can be delicious without oil, as seen by Jaipur, Gaylord, and Rangoli.5) Cucumber Raita - this was 90% cucumber and 10% thick yogurt, once again, taking out all of the yumminess in the original dish.I am sorry but I will not be coming back here. I understand that this is an Indian fusion restaurant, which is why these dishes are a lot different than the authentic cuisine, but I don&#39;t think fusion has to come with a bowl of grease or bones in kati rolls."

Pub Royale is for you.I loved the funky Polynesian theme and the giant wall of beer on tap in the back. Seriously, there is a huge screen that lists the ridiculous 26 beers on tap at any given moment.Luckily we found a table in the back, but I can imagine that seats might be extremely hard to come by on busy weekend nights. The menu has a lot of Indian themed flavors. We tried the veggie samosas, and lamb dumplings to start off. And they were solid, dumplings were pretty spicy and you definitely get the slight gameiness of the lamb. The samosas though were more than worth at only $4.I&#39;m not one to order a burger unless I&#39;m at a burger place like Edzo&#39;s but I ended up trying this one. The burger itself was decent not amazing but the fries, if I can borrow a phrase from Guy Fieri, were out of bounds!. Sometimes you get soggy fries but these were so crispy I&#39;d order a basket of them for myself and spend the rest of the night fending off the hands of my friends trying to steal them.Did I mention there are a ton of beers here?? They had two nitros on tap and I tried this limited release Belgian quad aged in a Jack Daniels barrel. I beg of you to try something you&#39;ve never had before and thank me later."

I don&#39;t understand.After eating the food and drinking their beer, I do now understand. Pub Royale is the best thing to happen to Division St. in any recent amount of time. Yes, so sad that Small Bar closed...but what an amazing place to carry on the tradition and values that Small Bar cared about. Small Bar cared about Division St. not becoming Wrigleyville and thereby having places where non-Wrigleyville-ites could enjoy food&amp;drink. Truly I have nothing at all against Wrigleyville, I just prefer to live in Wicker Park and not Wrigleyville.My favorite thing about Pub Royale is that you can make your experience what you want to make it. If you want to go have a happy hour cocktail after work, great. If you want to have a few beers and a snack before dinner, great. If you want to have a full blown dinner, great. Pub Royale is great for all types of customers and appetites. They have a great cocktail list and a large, changing, unique beer list on the back wall. Their saag paneer is one of the best things ever and husband loves the Gobi Manchurian (fried cauliflower in a sweet tangy sauce) and it makes him feel better because he is pretend eating vegetables.Love Pub Royale and am so happy Heisler is here to stay."

The beer list is huge, it&#39;s on a giant train station board, and they have a unique, quality cocktail list.We tried:-royale with cheese burger - excellent!-garlic naan - yes-samosa - simple but good-chicken tikka roll - basically spicy Indian burrito, it was ok-gobi Manchuria - fried cauliflower, too much breading-Royale cup cocktail - well balanced, refreshing"

Any place that lets me drink craft beers in sizes smaller than a full pint is already a friend of mine, and Pub Royale combines that excellent selling point with an array of cocktails and delicious British-Indian food.I would say that the Royale Cups are somewhat watered down in comparison to the full-flavored beer options, but they are probably excellent summer drinking. I believe the food menu prompted my vegetarian companion to remark that she was embarrassed by the abundance of choices. We greatly enjoyed the samosas (2 large pyramids with pitch-perfect sauces), the Gobi Manchurian (what seemed like a small head&#39;s worth of deep-fried battered cauliflower in actually spicy and sweet sauce with the nutty garnish offering a nice contrast), the garlic naan (more crusty than bready, but large and good), and the buttered paneer (aromatic and velvety sauce enveloping a few rich cubes of cheese paired with a more pleasingly substantial flat bread) for our dinner. Then we got both desserts! The doughnut was a hefty fist of yeasty bread, more morning bun than soft cake in a pool of deeply spiced caramel-tasting sauce. The Eton mess was a pretty glass of thick, buttery whipped cream interlaced with fun meringue crumbs and layered with a well-balanced apple compote.Oh, and the staff was cool too. I&#39;d come here just to drink, but I wouldn&#39;t pass up the opportunity to eat more of the food - this omnivore walked away full and happy on just vegetarian dishes but I can&#39;t wait to try the more carnivorous options."

Our server was not attentive and friendly, and our food was mediocre. I had the tikka masala Kati roll, which I&#39;ve had every time. It seemed greasier than other times, less tasteful, and where they used to give full condiment cups of the sauces they now give about one teaspoon of sauce. I had to ask for a normal serving and was charged $1.50 for it.  The interior is cool, but there are too many good restaurant in Chicago to waste time and money on a mediocre one."

And British imperialism aside, this Indian food is DANK.We ordered the gobi manchurian, garlic naan, and buttered paneer. The gobi manchurian was sweet and spicy and just crisp enough without being too greasy. The buttered paneer (more similar to a paneer tikka masala) was one of the most flavorful paneer dishes I&#39;ve ever had. For the two of us, it was JUST the right amount of food and the total bill was $26!!!!Taking off one star because they don&#39;t take reservations and we had to wait foreverrr (even though it was a random weekday night).

My husband and I stopped in on a recent weekend evening with our dog (yay for dog friendly patios) and were pleasantly surprised by Pub Royale.We weren&#39;t super hungry so decided to order drinks and just split some food. I had the traditional Pimms cup, which was done very well. Looking forward to trying some of the other iterations.Ordered a side of fries and a chicken tikka kati roll to split. The fries were perfect pub fries (you know, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside) and came with a spicy aioli, but the chicken roll is really what will have us coming back. It was SO good! The best way I can describe it is as a hipster Indian burrito. The flavors blended well together and the chicken was nice and tender. It also came with some dipping sauces, all of which were good and had various degrees of spice. The portion was quite large so splitting turned out to be a great idea. It is a little messy so I ended up eating it with a fork because I feared for my white jeans. The outdoor seating is communal and the people next to us ordered the mussels and naan, which also looked really good. Definitely looking forward to coming back and trying more of the menu!"

The samosas were good although bit salty as they were sprinkled with some course salt. You can kinda shake it off though, so it was fine. The chutneys were pretty good and tasted very fresh. The gobi Manchurian was good . However, it was pretty spicy. Only order it if you can handle pretty spicy food.

But then we saw the hostess enter an hour 45 on her iPad. We went over to fat pour for some drinks, and came back at 9:45 and still had a 20 minute wait for a table. It&#39;s a small place, new and hot so this is to be expected. What we didn&#39;t love is that we were made to feel like we&#39;re in the way, constantly being asked to move. You can&#39;t have a 2 hour wait and then make your customers feel unwelcome for waiting. Once we sat our waitress was also inattentive, we got our water refilled after the meal was over, was not asked for another round of drinks and she never got us the 2 orders of naan (although we were not charged for it either).We got drinks while we waited. The #6 was great, the perfect balance  of citrus, lightly sweet and boozy. The #4 tasted a little like cough syrup.The food was a great value, for 5 of us we got 5 dishes and shared tapas-style. We got lamb dumplings (awesome), buttered paneer (so creamy and tangy, loved the garlic naan), samosas (delish, love the dipping sauces), hot Indian chicken (juicy, great level of spice) and the chicken tikka roll (not my fave but the table loved it).Overall it&#39;s a fun place to have done great Indian food.

A unique addition to the neighborhood with it&#39;s British pub meets Indian food concept (if you&#39;ve been to London, it will be familiar).The square footage hasn&#39;t changed so it&#39;s still incredibly cramped on the inside. Seating is first come, first serve so it can be tricky if you&#39;re going with a larger group. You&#39;ve scored if you snag one of the handful of booth seating. We went on a Friday night and it was packed. You couldn&#39;t turn around without bumping into someone accidentally, but this also made for more social interaction. The guy next to me started randomly talking to a booth of two ladies behind us - easy to get your game on I guess, lol.Beer on draft list is large with an option to buy a tasting size if you didn&#39;t want to commit. The specialty Royale Cup cocktails were great and priced reasonably at $8. The fries (pommes frites style) with aioli are dangerously good in that clog your arteries type of way. I enjoyed my eggplant curry best as well as my date&#39;s whole wheat paratha from his buttered paneer dish.I miss Small Bar but can see myself as a regular at this joint as well.

There is a simple lamb filling and not much else.Salt cod samosa: A pleasant surprise. It&#39;s their take of fish and chips in a samosa? Think bits of fish mixed with mashed potatoes inside a samosa. Definitely not what I expected but it tasted alright.Gobi manchurian: A favorite dish of the night. The cauliflower and breaded and is crispy... a delight with the curry sauce! Get this!Eggplant curry: The other favorite of the night! Comes with bits of crispy rice on top which offers a nice contrast in texture. Flavors here also top notch.India hot chicken: Essentially fried chicken on top of naan.

Most tables were full but bar was completely empty. Was meeting some friends who had a great table on the edge of the restaurant with the doors open to the crowded sidewalk/patio on Division. Excellent draft selection (24) which changes frequently - even allowed to do small samples (4oz) to create your own flight.Now to the food - I had just come from a family dinner so didn&#39;t order an entree like my companions. Settled for the lamb dumplings and was not disappointed. Soft and flavorful with a beautiful chili oil and black sesame topping - could eat about 10 of them. Also shared some cauliflower. Woah. I usually don&#39;t write about (or order for that matter) vegetables but this is worth sharing. A light batter and play on General Tso&#39;s chicken turned cauliflower into my favorite veggie ATM. Hard to believe it was cauliflower - seriously. Get it. Friends I was with had the hot chicken (well breaded and came with some fresh naan to soak up all the spicy sauce leftovers) and the pub royale burger with cheese - which was described as a top 5 burger from a Chicago guy who knows his stuff. One solid patty cooked medium rare with solid seasoning and fresh buttered/toasted bun. Twice fried french fries and a flavorful big mac sauce-esque aioli brought this burger plate to the pinnacle of burger spot conversation.Overall a great dining experience. Would give it 5 stars if it were not for the service - which wasn&#39;t bad by any means but the server seemed generally inattentive. I think you need to know that going in that this place has a more laid back vibe and they will let you hang out, so maybe it was just the expectation that she would be constantly checking back in and did not that threw us off. End of the day it doesn&#39;t matter, you&#39;re not coming here for the service. A hidden gem in plain sight, ill definitely be back and bringing friends to this Indian/American inspired joint with a good cocktail list, great beer selection, and some mega tasty unique plates."

I was able to find a chocolate stout to my liking. Food-wise we started with the simosas. You only get two but they are huge so it was perfect for two people. Really tasty!After polishing that off we decided to split the chicken tikka wrap and the Indian hot chicken. The wrap is huge and stuffed with tons of delicious chicken. The hot chicken was fried and served on a large piece of naan. Portions were quite generous and everything tasted amazing! My friend and I were incredibly satisfied by the time we had cleaned off all of the plates.On top of the food, service was really friendly and prompt throughout our meal and the pub itself has a really cool ambiance between the ornate lighting and the smell of the spices and drinks.I&#39;m already planning my next trip back to bring other friends.

You will probably get better service at McDonalds.2. They will serve appetizers at the end of the meal. And the appetizer will be terrible.3. When you order naan with curries, they will bring out the naan 15 minutes before the curry is ready. It&#39;s possible they think naan is meant to be eaten alone.4.

I thought it&#39;d be to bars what the new Coldplay and Beyoncé song was to music videos. I&#39;m so glad that everything else on its street seemed either overpriced or (for lack of better words) sloppy that night, because I otherwise would have missed a GREAT bar.The place had dim lights and great servers. While I was busy scratching my head at the extensive beer list on the wall, a bartender had set up our table and was already making drinks for my girlfriend. We had some drool-worthy samosas, chai, and a few other drinks I can&#39;t remember the names of but still feel amazed by. I regret not trying the spiked mango lassi drink.Given that we were visiting Chicago, we left to see other bars and explore as much ground as possible; after 10 minutes of walking around we came back and stayed till closing. Would highly recommend."

The inside is well curated with a great beer menu in the format of a train station&#39;s departures and arrivals &#34;split-flap display&#34; board.What&#39;s also nice? The fact that you can get a 4 oz. glass to try multiple varieties of the 24 beers on tap.My girlfriend and I were able to sample a wide array of dishes. The lamb dumplings and the gobi manchurian were our favorites. Both were unusual but well-spiced and not too greasy. They contrasted well with our beers. For the entrees, the Indian Hot Chicken and the Rabbit Pie are good on their own. The Indian Hot Chicken is a drumstick and a thigh over naan accompanied by rather salty pickles (the only downfall to the experience were the pickles). The Rabbit Pie was fantastic. It&#39;s bacony, smoky, and very rich. That will be a perfect dish on a frigid winter evening instead of a spring or summer night.Finally, definitely, definitely while supplies last get one of those Pimm&#39;s cups. Man are they delicious. Laced with Letherbee Gin and fresh mint, cucumber, and ginger beer, maybe one of the best cocktails in Chicago. And at $8, very well priced.Check out Pub Royale. A really strong addition to the Division Street corridor and a nice respite from Bro-City/Sports Bar Row."

It&#39;s a fun place with a casual, unique atmosphere. Even though it was packed the service was excellent and the servers were laid back and friendly. The beer/cider/cocktail list is excellent but a bit overwhelming, so describe your taste to the server and they&#39;ll help you make the right pick. Menu is mostly Indian small plates with lots of vegetarian options. Try the fried cauliflower and the garlic naan! Really everything we tried was fantastic, can&#39;t wait to visit again soon.

I was pleasantly surprised that it was able to meet those high expectations. The food here was FANTASTIC, it&#39;s impossible to say that each dish was better than the last because everything was great, but each dish surprised and pleased in a different way. The well balanced saltiness of the cod samosas, that sweet-spicy Manchurian sauce of the cauliflower, the fluffy paratha accompanying the spicy buttered paneer. Really developed flavors, wonderful textures, and great execution. The beverage menu is adventurous and unique as well but with good pairings for this type of cuisine."

I was hangry as usual).  We found a table right away, and the server came very quickly.  Coffee for me and a bloody mary for him.  My husband ordered the special, which was a full Indian breakfast - it had lentils, pork belly, paratha, tomatoes, and...I forget what else.  But the pork belly was so good!  I ordered the chicken tikka kathi roll, which was basically an Indian burrito - and it was delicious!  I took half home to eat the next day.  We also had the chai dolce de leche donut, which was good, but I&#39;m not sure it was worth $6.  Overall though, we would definitely come back, especially because we saw people order the Hot Chicken and we got really sad and jealous.  Next time!!!"

I am kicking myself for not getting Indian food sooner in my life. The drink menu has lots of beers and good cocktails.

I have!Well, rest assured! Pub Royale has filled a much needed void: a casual, fun and trendy Indian restaurant with great cocktails!I stopped by early on a Friday evening to find this place already packed! All the tables were full, but we snagged two seats at the bar. They have these incredibly comfy red leather swivel chairs (plus 1 star) as well as super friendly bartenders who explained all the cocktails to us. You can&#39;t go wrong here-- the cocktails range between $7 and $10 and are incredibly creative with Pimms, Gin, Whiskey and various fruits etc.The full food menu is served at the bar. We started with the vegetable samosas, then went onto the butter paneer, as well as the mussels. Everything was AWESOME. I especially loved the butter paneer. Their naan is amazing-- perfect balance between crispy and soft and served piping hot.Most importantly, the atmosphere hits the nail on the head. They have fun cocktails, affordable prices, and it feels more like a bar than your traditional Indian restaurant. With Pub Royale, I finally feel like I can enjoy a meal out for Indian food without sacrificing atmosphere.Can&#39;t wait to return and try more items! Especially the gobi machurian."

The deep fried cauliflower were slightly strong but good enough.  I would order both the chicken wrap (which is like a burrito) and the fried chicken again.  The samosas stuffed with salted cod were a big hit.The beer list is diverse and strong with interesting choices  (like the imperial rice ale from 5 rabbit) and changes almost daily.  There is a lineup of Pimm&#39;s Cups and a number of radlers, beer cocktails, and limeades to choose from.  I like the option of 4 oz pours which gives me the chance to sample other options. So it&#39;s an excellent place to drink.I miss Small Bar but this is a great replacement, as well as an alternative option to the burgeoning bro scene surrounding it."

If we would&#39;ve stayed longer post-dinner, I would&#39;ve tried yet another number. :)Appetizers are a must here, and with that, I&#39;d recommend the Gobi Manchurian. It may sound a little odd, but cauliflower has never tasted so amazing!  The lamb dumplings were delicious as well and had a nice &#39;kick&#39; to them.  As far as entrees, we each tried something different and everyone was pleased.  I had the burger and it was done exactly as ordered.  I&#39;m a big burger critic, and though it didn&#39;t make my top 5 burgers of all time, it lived up to its tasty reputation.  My bf chose the chicken tikka wrap and said it was absolutely delicious.  Our friends had the hot chicken and the beef cheek.  Both are popular selections, and for good reason.This place is definitely worth your time.  Per other reviews, it is pretty consistent in its delivery.  Enjoy!!"

I love the concept of indian bar food and its definitely one of a kind in Chicago. Having grown up eating Indian food, I have definitely had my fare share and much better authentic Indian food. If that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for, this is definitely not the place for you; this is westernized Indian cuisine. The venue itself is really cute and a great summer time hangout; there&#39;s a patio outside the restaurant or you can sit inside with wide open entrances. We got the following at dinner - frozen mango lassi, indian hot chicken, the gobi manchurian, and the buttered paneer. My favorite of the dishes was the gobi manchurian - they did a great job fusing the indian flavors with a nice twist. It was the perfect mixture of sweet, spicy and savory. The hint of sesame was a great touch! Everything else i was very unimpressed by. The frozen mango lassi would have been good, however the paprika powder was way too overpowering and slightly took over the actual &#34;mango&#34; flavor of the drink, which was also far too watered down by the yogurt. The buttered paneer was not bad, however wasn&#39;t good either. It just seemed a bit bland for my taste - it was nice and creamy though. The roti paired with the buttered paneer was delicious though; nice, thin, and very soft!  My friend who ordered the indian hot chicken with a side of cucumber raita, was quite disappointed in his meal. The chicken was doused in oil and fried to the point where it overtook the taste of the actual meat.This is a really interesting concept that is quite popular in Britain. I have been to a bar with a similar concept in San Francisco, and was hoping this would be something like it, as I was quite impressed there. I am sad to say that they could do a much better job of creating a replica Anglo-Indian bar in Chicago."

Glad to see a thriving restaurant go in on Division, and especially one that&#39;s unique rather than a boring chain or bro bar.I have to say, I regularly have cravings for their buttery Naan. I&#39;ve tried a lot of the menu, but I seriously can&#39;t stay away from the basic Naan app. Also, the cauliflower? I don&#39;t know what they did to that vegetable, but it&#39;s now my new fave.Basically do yourself a favor and go here- but uhh maybe make a reservation first."

Service was friendly and good. Our waitress even poured some cider tasters for me to see which one I really wanted to order.The food was solid.  The menu isn&#39;t big but so far they execute it really well. We tried the lamb dumplings, the salt cod samosa, the fries and the gobi manchurian. My favorite was probably the dumplings and samosa.  I liked the gobi (fried cauliflower) and liked the sauce.  It was familiar and different at the same time.  That was my hubby&#39;s least favorite but he really doesn&#39;t get excited about friend veggies (I didn&#39;t mind, more for me). With the appetziers being that good, we definitely want to come back and try the heartier options.Sometimes the good is in the details- the bar stools had nice backs and are more comfortable than most.

Drinks (cocktails) weren&#39;t as strong as I thought they should be for the price and the service was definitely lacking.We had the lamb dumplings, rabbit pie, cucumber raita, salted cod samosa and the Indian hot chicken.  We received everything fairly quickly after ordering except for the rabbit pie, which took almost an hour after we finished eating our first few dishes.  We had to flag down the waitress to see what the hold up was. She said it takes awhile for the pie... Understandable until we see 2 tables who ordered after we did receive their plate and finish it before we received ours.Lamb dumplings were tasty and the cucumber raita was a nice compliment to the other dishes. The Indian hot chicken was really crunchy (almost burnt) and definitely not hot or at least not Indian hot. Drinks were a disappointment. I tried the #2 and #4 for cocktails and the mango lassi which pretty much tasted like mango sorbet...Overall, it&#39;s an okay spot and a nice addition to Division St. but not somewhere I would go out of my way for."

The menu folds up in sections where you see a slot machine of 4 different types of Pimm Cup to Squares for a menu, mostly Indian. There&#39;s even a Mango Lassi rum drink, though, it tasted of too much rum, not enough mango lassi... good try chap.We just stopped in for drinks after doing dinner, so I can&#39;t comment on food. The ambiance hasn&#39;t changed much from the former Small Bar. Liked the additional booth/bar seating to make this place more conducive for friendly chitty chatty.

Pub Royale is definitely the best new restaurant that I have been to in a very, very long time. Every single item we ordered for dinner was excellent, each with a distinct flavor profile that complemented the others. Loved those lamb dumplings. I&#39;ll dream of that paneer, well, because it is absolutely dreamy. Staff are lovely and clearly a strong team. It&#39;s fun to see what&#39;s going on in the kitchen (in a word: magic). I will be back here many, many, many times (especially now that I see they are dog friendly - yay!). I will send everyone that I know to do that too.Only two things I would change:(1) Tried the doughnut for dessert. Meh. It needs to be a bit lighter and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or perhaps a sour kind of vanilla frozen yogurt, that would help balance the doughnut and the sauce. In short, it needs some pep.(2) Get rid of those peacocks, they seem anemic, at least compared to the peacocks I&#39;ve seen wandering around my parents house. The room is delightful and those birds are a bit strange. You don&#39;t need them, really."

I want to buy the cilantro chutney in bulk and give it to my friends and family as Christmas gifts and also to shmear it on everything I eat for the next 60 days.  The music is great (60s british rock), the servers are nice and all really pretty, and your table will be bussed frequently.  I want to take everyone I know here and just watch them enjoy themselves and pat myself of the back for being a great friend."

We ordered some drinks and a few dishes, the tables are quite small we got three of the 4 dishes almost immediately to which I asked if the kitchen could slow down. We hadn&#39;t even gotten water when we had almost all of our food. Finally we got waters and another 10 minutes later the wrong drinks. It was very difficult to find the wait staff and we never had the same server twice. Again, the food was delicious but they need to course food out to give a better experience. I left with an overall bad experience even though I had good food which is a bummer."

Although the drink was tasty, the glass was 75% ice, 25% gin and fruit mixture. I finished my beverage in 4-5 drinks (literally). I&#39;m not a big drinker, but when I do have a drink or two, I want it to be tasty and strong enough for me to just have one to two at most. This drink in particular didn&#39;t do it for me at all (mostly due to the cup being full of ice).I wouldn&#39;t suggest ordering the cocktails but the beer selection looked much more reliable.From the food menu I only tried the samosas, which were really really good.

Lamb dumplings, eggplant curry, and the hot chicken - everything tasted kiiindof Indian but each was missing like those few spices that would really round it out, so you were left just kind of let down. Maybe we should&#39;ve just gone to an Indian restaurant instead. I guess this place would be perfect for someone who finds regular Indian food too intense."

Most indian fusion places I have been to have been big disappointments with bland food or menu and ingredients that neither belongs to India nor a million miles from the south-asian continent.Pub Royale is complete opposite of this. Don&#39;t get me wrong, this is not traditional indian cuisine. But their menu which includes (some of my fav) samosas, lassi cocktails, paneer, Gobi manchurian and hot indian chicken make up for non traditional indianness."

We got the lamb dumplings and salt cod samosas for appetizers. As stated by the other reviews, the lamb dumplings are amazing, especially with that hot chili oil. The salt cod samosas were a little off. The dough was more of a wonton than samosa so it didn&#39;t quite have the right texture. The filling was very cream cheese heavy so you can barely taste the cod. It tasted more like a crab Rangoon. We got the mussels w/ naan and the chicken khaki roll as entrees. The chicken khaki roll was satisfying and large. The mussels were absolutely delightful! The broth was light and airy with just the right hint of lime. The naan was thin and crispy. The mussels had a lot of flavor but were not rubbery! For dessert we got the chai donut to go. They need to work on their chai flavoring. The doghnut was more sought than I like it. The main negative is that the service is slow. When we went, it wasn&#39;t packed and there appeared to be a good number of servers overall good experience!"

When your in the mood for comforting fried chicken and sides thatll leave you breathless come to honey butter fried chicken!Ive been here once when it was extremely busy and thought id have a not so pleasant experience. Damn was i wrong! Stood patiently in line, cashier was really patient with me and didnt seem pissed at me for taking my sweet time to order. After figuring out what i wanted i ordered 4 piece of their legendary chicken, a side of mashed potatoes and mac &amp; cheese.The chicken is made to order so it took a few mins to get to my table. Which im not complaining at all about, because every second is worth the wait. When the food got to my table the chicken was piping hot and served with a side of honey corn bread and of course the legendary honey butter! Make sure you smother the chicken with that honey butter as soon as you get it so that it drenches the chicken entirely, coat every single spot you can. Biting into this incredible piece of chicken is nothing short of stellar! So moist, the juices just run down your face! Their mac and cheese was seriously the best ive ever had in my life. The corn bread was moist and sweet and a tiny bit savory. And the mashed potatoes were awesome as well.I cant stress this enough how excellent this place is. You want an amazing fried chicken dinner that you&#39;ll never forget in your life? Give this place a try because you&#39;ll never go anywhere else for fried chicken once you try it."

With many others here, I agree that the breading on the chicken does lack seasoning and you probably don&#39;t get as much as you want for the price BUT it still that good!Honestly, the service, outdoor seating, and the sides really what make this place your better than average fried chicken place. We got the 4 piece chicken with a couple of sides. The chicken was very juicy and the dollop of honey butter just added that extra flavor of sweetness. Even with the honey butter, the corn muffins were just okay, nothing to rave about here.BOTH sides, creamed corn and pimento mac and cheese, were amazing. I would almost just go back for just those two things. Also, the assortment of cane sodas, especially the Ginger Soda, was a refreshing change from your household Coke or Pepsi products you would find in your regular restaurant. Finally, the service was excellent. Not only was it quick when we came in (around 11 am on a Sunday) but the staff checked in on us to make sure we had everything we needed.Overall, I really enjoyed the chicken and the sides we had picked. It can get busy to try your best to come before the brunch rush on the weekends. I can only imagine how amazing it must be to eat here, outside, during the summertime."

We&#39;ve dined in before (order at the counter and take your number to your seat), but this time we did pick up. For both my boyfriend and I to share, we got the 4-piece chicken (two breasts, one thigh and a drumstick) which comes with 3 corn muffins for $16, and a side of Mac &amp; cheese, smashed potatoes and creamed corn, which were $4 a piece. We figured we might as well tack on some extra corn muffins as well since they were only 5 for $2. We had an a la card, so we got $10 off, and our total was $22; I can see why people think it&#39;s pricey without the a la card. HOWEVER, here&#39;s their saving grace: we could only eat about half of what we ordered, so it made for two full meals for two people.The chicken is not heavily fried, and is incredibly juicy. Spread some honey butter on it, and it perfectly compliments the slightly sweet seasoning on the chicken. The mac &amp; cheese is very rich and luscious, the smashed potatoes and chicken fat gravy was thick and tasty, and the creamed corn with Thai chili sauce was phenomenal. We liked having all of the sides to sample and share.Service is sweet and they have great time management. It&#39;s a place we would happily return to."

I had heard great things about Honey Butter from colleagues and friends but my experience left me both disappointed and perplexed. Let me start by saying that the cashier (Sebastian?) was lovely to work with. Our order was placed in a friendly, efficient and pleasant manner and the food arrived to the table quickly so customer service isn&#39;t at all an issue. But the chicken..and the actual honey butter...and the prices...and the sides? Nah. I&#39;m not sold.I&#39;m not sure they actually use any seasoning while preparing the food. The chicken was fried well and moist but there wasn&#39;t any flavor. I thought hot sauce would save it but it appears they make their hot sauce in-house which pretty much tasted like vinegar so it didn&#39;t really give me the kick chicken requires.I ordered a side of grits that were anything but. I almost went to ask if I had been served mashed potatoes by mistake but decided against it.Adding salt to everything did indeed help a little but I&#39;m young and would rather not clog my arteries at this time (...or anytime in the future).My two pieces of chicken, side of grits, and corn muffins ran me about $14. If you&#39;re in the market for something new, sure, give it a try. If you actually like fried chicken, make it at home, visit The Roost, or ask somebody&#39;s grandma for their secret recipe."

Sign me up!The reality was much more average that I expected. We went on a Saturday night and waited in a very long line (probably about 25-30 minutes), before ordering at the counter. We decided to share a 4 piece fried chicken with mashed potatoes and creamed corn. Everything tasted fine but in no way did it blow my mind. The mashed potatoes were very plain and room temperature. The chicken was greasy already, and the honey butter on top made it even more so. The creamed corn was the most interesting item we had, as they put a green Thai curry on top to add extra flavor. The free cornbread biscuits were dry and flavorless.Overall, it wasn&#39;t inedible, but we won&#39;t be back."

I cannot remembered the last time I used that much salt in a restaurant...it just was not good. They tried...I mean, it pretty much tastes like what you expected hipster fried chicken taste like.2. The hot sauce is awful. I mean it has a smoky flavor that&#39;s really unexpected and not in a good way, I&#39;m not sure why they don&#39;t just use Louisiana Hot or Tabasco like everyone else. If you&#39;re going to have anything house-made make sure it&#39;s better than store bought3. The kale slaw was ridiculously under seasoned. and a 1/3 cup portion was $4. da&#39;fuck?4. For 4 pieces of chicken and one kale slaw it cost almost $23...I wouldn&#39;t have minded if the chicken was delicious but it was mostly bad, so I found the price to be outrageous. I want my money back!5. The bathroom smelled like a urinal at a festival after a long way. it&#39;s right off the dining area so this was really unacceptable."

Lots of indoor seating, and they have a lovely patio as well. If you have kids, try to sit outside since they have a cute little play area where they can play with alphabet magnets and draw on the ground with chalk.We ordered the chicken sandwich ($7) and the chicken &amp; grits ($11) which is only available on weekends from 10 to 2 I think. Seems pricey, but remember, hospitality is included so you do not have to tip on top of your bill! The chicken sandwich was tasty and we really enjoyed the honey butter. I do wish that it came with lettuce and tomato though. The sandwich cones with nothing, so if you want sides, be sure to order them. The chicken and grits come with buffalo honey sauce and a fried egg on top. It was okay, I wouldn&#39;t order it again but if you like grits you might enjoy it.Service is super fast, and very friendly.

This chicken sandwich rivals my favorite fried chicken biscuit - Cheeky Sandwiches in NYC. Honey Butter Fried Chicken is an awesome spot. When we walked in the cashier was explaining how they don&#39;t accept gratuity because they are paid a good wage and also receive benefits. This is pretty cool in my book.The food - wow! I had to try a bit of this and a bit of that. I ordered the O.G. which was awesome. I also got a one piece side to try the chicken by itself. I got a chicken breast and it was boneless which was a nice surprise (less to mess with when eating). Loved their corn biscuits and also loved their creamed corn.My friend got the buffalo tofu sandwich and their Mac and cheese. I had a bite of the Mac and cheese and it is to die for. Overall had a great experience at HBFC and can&#39;t wait to go back (and bring more friends).

Waited in line for about 10 minutes.We ordered 4 piece of chicken and two small mashed potatoes. The total was $26. We didn&#39;t even get dinks. VERY over-priced for the portion size you get. This is barely enough food to feed two people.Moving onto the food. Last time we came the chicken was served to us lukewarm, I was hoping that was just an off day. Today, the chicken actually came out hot. BUT both the mashed potatoes and chicken gravy they&#39;re served with were stone-cold.For the $26 you charged me for this tiny meal, I at least expect hot food. Not to mention, I don&#39;t want to eat at a restaurant that doesn&#39;t care enough to keep hot food hot and cold food cold! This place is a bad case of food poisoning waiting to happen.If you want TRULY good fried chicken in Chicago, checkout Roost Carolina Kitchen or Gus&#39;s Famous Fried Chicken. Both of these places have chicken which is far superior, and they actually serve their food hot.Honey Butter Fried Chicken is completely over-rated and is definitely a no-go for any true Chicago foodies."

My two friends and I shared the 8 piece chicken with 3 sides and complimentary corn biscuits for about $50. We ordered our food at the cashier and had our food delivered to us shortly after sitting down at the patio outside.I truly enjoyed the fried chicken and adding the butter to it (albeit very unhealthy), makes the flavor much more wholesome. I also dipped the chicken in hot sauce to give it a little kick. I really liked that the chicken was not dry but super juicy and crunchy with every bite. The three sides we got were mac &amp; cheese, mashed potatoes, and cream corn. The portions are pretty small but quite filling. Nothing really stood out to me in regards to the sides and I can easily do without any of it. If I were to come back, I&#39;d probably just get the fried chicken.I really liked the patio seating, perfect for a nice summer day in Chicago. And another neat thing was the map of the world that welcomes you by the front door. It tracks where all the customers were visiting from. Cool concept!Free street parking. Good service. Juicy flavorful chicken. My poor wallet."

Finally made it to honey butter and was not disappointed. The hostess was a fun friendly guy with the most popping lip stick color! The decor was funky and best of all...the sink for customers to wash their hands. Gave me my whole life!It was the last day of August and I was told it would be the last day of their Chicken BLT  sandwich so of course had to get it. I enjoyed it. It was 3 pieces of boneless chicken strips with tomatoes, greens and a garlic aioli that I got on the side. Which I&#39;m glad I did because it was full of horseradish which I loathe but the bestie enjoyed it. Ordered the corn muffins and with the honey butter.... It was fabulous! I don&#39;t really like corn muffins/cornbread so take that for what it is. I also ordered the mashed potatoes...now be warned that they finish their potatoes with a squeeze of lemon...I didn&#39;t like it. What I did like is that one of the employees noticed and brought me some new potatoes without the squeeze of lemon. I understand that a squeeze of citrus over something fatty helps brighten it up but I didn&#39;t really think it was needed.Overall definitely an A in my book. Will be back."

Line wasn&#39;t bad at all, but no tables on patio so we sat inside. Tried the original honey butter sandwich and the &#34;OG&#34; sandwich.Chicken: The chicken was good, but the honey butter sauce is really the best part of the meal. The OG sandwich wasn&#39;t very good, just not a great flavor to it, and the original one was fine, but the bread on both was gross. Way too much bread and it&#39;s not very soft so it doesn&#39;t really go with the sandwich. I took the bread off. The chicken was good, but not as good as other reviews led me to believe - it was just okay. Portillo&#39;s chicken sandwich is WORLDs better than Honey Butter&#39;s.Mac and Cheese: The mac and cheese is atrocious. Like, so gross. It&#39;s a few noodles swimming in what tastes like spicy nacho cheese sauce. Like the kind you would get in concession stand nachos. My husband said it tasted like the &#34;MRE&#34; meals he had to eat in the army. It was the worst Mac and Cheese I have ever had in my life. Makes me want to vomit just thinking of it right now.In sum, I don&#39;t see the difference between the chicken at this place, Harolds, and KFC other than the atmosphere and that honey butter sauce (which you can make at home and put on some KFC or whatever). There are way better places to go for eat. Don&#39;t let the hipness of this place fool you otherwise."

I wish i would have went to kfc the chicken and the sides are better and cheaper. Dont waste ur time coming here u want good fried chicken go to longman and eagles or harolds chickenFried chicken: (PUT THE BUTTER ON THE CHICKEN) crunchy really crunchy but looses the texture because of the butter on top so a lil soggy because of that. It was tender but not to the point where juicy was coming out. One thing is that the actual chicken is not flavorful. My friend who hates salt was putting salt on her chicken. Not even with addin seasoning and hot sauce made it taste better. I love sweet and salty but this didnt give me the flavor profile i was expecting. The butter made the chicken taste better but since the chicken was really bland u dont really get the harmony of sweet and salty.Pimento mac and cheese: the biggest crime of mac n cheese is using american cheese. nothing ruins it more then the processed cheap funky taste of american cheese. American cheese should be illegal for how bad it tastes. The actual flavor of it was really basic. Nothing special about it picture ur typical boxed mac cheese also no bacon! N the crunch on top didnt help. U can find the best mac n cheese at kumas corner.Creamed corn: i was excited because their was curry in the dish sadly i was mistaken it was basic. U could taste a lil bit of the curry but it needed more. One issue was there was too much mint. The mint completely over powers the dish thats all u can taste. After u finish all curry parts n the mint ur left with a normal basic creamed corn.Grits: this was everybodys least favorite. It was so bland. Literally they didn&#39;t put any seasoning at all. I liked the idea of the crispy chicken skin though.Corn bread: idk why everybody talks bad about them i loved them. Their really crunchy on the top and bottom. The texture is phenomenal, it was a lil dry but not as dry as ive hadit.ithas a good corn flavor then with the butter it was to die for. The perfect combination of sweat and saltyDumb cake: this was awful i couldnt pretend to like it i threw it away. Thats where it belongs in the trash can. Just all the ingredients in it are so cheap n it literally looked like vomit."

I&#39;ve been dreaming of their food ever since, and I may just have to come back this week.The fried chicken tasted so delightful!!! As were the corn muffin, the mac&#39;n cheese (it had fried chicken pieces!!!) and the honey butter of course.This is the type of place where you come back multiple times to try the full menu.Two recommendations: the breast and thigh pieces should come with bones... they&#39;re finger licking good!

If you use the code: TRYIT10 you get 10 dollars off plus free delivery. On a Sunday around 4:00 pm we got our food by 5:00 and we live 15 minutes away from the restaurant.For an order for 2 people- we ordered TOO much but it was fine for leftovers. Didn&#39;t care for the wings but the chicken was amazing. Very juicy, and the breaded part of it was salty and just a good amount. It wasn&#39;t over greasy and the fact that the chicken is &#39;antibiotic-free, cage-free, humanely-raised chicken * non-GMO, trans-fat-free canola fryer oil * Wisconsin honey and cheese * dairy, eggs, and produce sourced from area farms&#39; (information obtained from their website) I was very happy. That&#39;s never easy to find and if you are trying to be health conscious while enjoying fried chicken- this is a guilt free way to do it.I wish I ordered the sauces- it&#39;s a must because I regretted using my ranch dressing and BBQ sauce I had in my own fridge instead of getting their house made  ones. Their biscuits are almost like their signature since it&#39;s shaped and designed small with the creamiest whipped butter you&#39;ll ever taste."

A lot of people do like it though and besides a few places, you can only go to the chain restaurants. No longer!HBFC is the place to go to get solid fried chicken that isn&#39;t as super greasy, great atmosphere, solid beer, and great sides.Here&#39;s the breakdown:1) Price - a little more expensive that Popeye&#39;s or KFC, but that&#39;s because it&#39;s freakin&#39; way better. You get what you pay for. Well cooked, fried chicken with that homemade feel to it.2) Service - You pay for your food, you pick it up, sit down and eat. There isn&#39;t really a waitstaff, just people who love working there that are approachable if you need them. And check out the patio space!!3) Food - It&#39;s awesome. Much easier on the grease (in my opinion), tastes cleaner, and the sides only add to the great tastes dancing on your tongue. Fun combos if you want it (Check out Taco Tuesdays!)If you want solid chicken and a place that has a friend&#39;s house kinda feel, check out HBFC. You won&#39;t be disappointed."

I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone and everyone.  Chances are if you know me, I have already raved about this place to you.  In the summertime, they have a gorgeous patio in the back, with outdoor globe lights strung over bench-like seating.If you gather &#39;round a table with freshly fried chicken, some sweet tea, pimento mac n&#39; cheese, and some good company... I promise you&#39;d think you&#39;ve reached fried chicken heaven.  It&#39;s one of those places where the moment you arrive, you&#39;re already brainstorming who you can bring here, because it&#39;s just that awesome.I write this review after 3 experiences dining in, and HBFC doesn&#39;t disappoint.  Their staff are friendly, and yes, the line will most likely be out the door.  You order at the cash register first, and then are given a number so that you can be seated at a table.  (You must order first before you can sit down.)  Weekends will be crowded no doubt, although I can&#39;t speak to the foot traffic Mon-Fri because I haven&#39;t been here during the week.What to order?Get the fried chicken (no-brainer!), biscuits (which come with your chicken, depending how you order), and some sides.  Their chicken wings are not too bad either; their wing glazes are Honey Buffalo or Red Chili. My favorite side is the Mac n&#39; cheese. Their mashed potatoes are pretty good, as well as their collard greens, although the greens are not always on their menu.They have a brunch menu for the weekend (&#39;wiches, mimosas, chicken &amp; toast etc.), fried chicken sandwiches, sandwich melts, coffee, and desserts from Bang Bang Pie Shop in Logan Square.For 2 people:Get the 4 piece fried chicken and a few sides.  You can choose between white/dark meat. And try the sweet tea or house made soda. They have beer, drinks, and a killer-looking Bloody Mary here on Saturday morning.If you&#39;re there for the first time, staff will recommend that you slather your chicken with the honey butter.  Personally, I like the butter only on the biscuits, but that&#39;s just my preference. When your chicken is piping hot (i.e. just arriving at your table) that&#39;s the prime time to spread the honey butter love.This is one of the places that make Chicago fabulous.  Please come here at least once in your life."

They offer up the juiciest, crispest chicken I have ever had. My favorite chicken spot in the city, and I go to whenever I can. Be prepared to leave so full you can hardly walk, and elastic pants might be a good idea.Their sides are hit and miss, but their corn bread is excellent. I&#39;m also normally not a huge soda fan, but their natural sodas are sweated with real raw sugar and tastes amazing. I usually stick to the thigh either plane or on a sandwich, as like I said earlier, the sides and other options, such as wings are not up to the same par as their famous chicken. I love it though, and a bonus is their beer selection (Gumball Head) and their patio during summer. I will be a returning customer to this place as long as I can."

It&#39;s nice to try something other than fast food chicken and see a non franchised corporation doing well as a local neighborhood eatery. HBFC is real, non processed, feel good food! Here is what we ordered:HONEY BUTTER FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH:-3 chicken strips covered in honey butter on a brioche bun.-The sandwich was plain and lacked condiments but it was still fantastic and I say this because the bun was warm and buttery. I wonder if they make their buns in house?! Chicken wasn&#39;t that crunchy but still good. Also, I asked if I could have my sandwich on a biscuit but unfortunately they only make them on the weekends. I don&#39;t know why they do that? I wish they had them everyday of the week as I hear they&#39;re great.2 PIECE &amp; 5 PIECE CORN BREAD-Came with 3 pieces.- HBFC seasons their chicken with red spices that adds a unique flavor. Although, it is not spicy. I do have to admit the chicken wasn&#39;t as crispy as I expected it to be, and I wonder if it&#39;s because it wasn&#39;t fresh or might have been sitting out for a while. Smothering the butter over the pieces of chicken in my opinion drowns out the flavor and crispy-ness of the chicken. Which is why I save the delicious honey butter for the corn muffins. I love how tiny and mouth watering they are! Popping a few in your mouth won&#39;t make you leave feeling guilting when going crazy at this carb fest! LolYou can choose to eat outside, grab a drink at their tiny, cute little bar area, or sit under an umbrella next to a lush green ivy wall in the patio.  Overall, HBFC is good and I&#39;m glad I can say that I&#39;ve finally tried it. I would walk in for 5 corn muffins alone, but I&#39;m not sure that I will be rushing back any time soon. 3 stars!"

The food is incredibly expensive for the amount you get- portions are incredibly small. The chicken tenders are dark meat (ok, but a bit unusual and not what someone ordering tenders would usually expect) and don&#39;t have an overwhelming flavor to them. The pimento mac and cheese is probably the best thing on the menu, but the amount you get in the buffalo mac for $10 is just pathetic."

Pimento Mac and cheese and corn bread. Parking is fairly easy. No lot but a lot of street parking. Might have to walk 2 minutes. Doesn&#39;t look big from the outside but it is fairly large inside.I only planned on eating half of each sandwich because I wanted to try them both. But I couldn&#39;t stop with the OG. It&#39;s was delish. I didn&#39;t put honey butter on that one though. Corn bread is pretty good but small with cute imprints of honey combs on the bottom. The pimento Mac and cheese was interesting. The side was almost too much. It&#39;s such a unique taste I couldn&#39;t eat it all but I liked it.Then I started to eat the honey butter fried chicken sandwich and I put the butter on it which they recommend. A couple bites in, it was turned off. The chicken was a dark meant like dark turkey. And was so oily. I immediately got grossed out and couldn&#39;t eat it anymore.The chicken in the OG sandwich wasn&#39;t like that. Whyyyyy? I was so excited to eat to honey butter chicken and I hated it. Read a couple other reviews so stated the same thing as much regarding the dark meat and oil. I was hoping I just got a bad batch or something. But it seems that this is the meat they use.And that&#39;s all I have to say about that.Jackée"

I would take these in an Easter basket, trick or treat bag or a heart shaped box for Valentine&#39;s day. It&#39;s that serious. Obviously they know how to cook bird and the sides are well done.

The biscuit and honey-butter was tasty but underwhelming due to the size.3. The coleslaw was...let&#39;s just say it&#39;s a HARD-PASS if I ever eat there again.Given that it is so close to work, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll give it another go.  It&#39;s likely to be a while before that happens though."

Their ingenious combination of honey butter with their crispy tender chicken is absolutely divine. You take one bite and it changes the WHOLE game.It was worth the trip and I am so glad I was able to make it out there. When I went me and a friend split 8 pieces and got the mashed potatoes, Mac and Cheese, and creamed corn as our sides. The potatoes were perfectly creamy and the creamed corn was a great balance to the whole meal. The Mac and Cheese was TRASH. We tried to eat more of it but we only got three bites in.Although they do provide sauce options I felt as though the chicken did not need it because that honey butter was already doing it tons of favors."

Heard about it and decided to check them out with my daughter. We viewed the menu &amp; I felt that the prices were pricey. 8 pieces of chicken for $30? You would think pricey menus would mean the food is to die for. I ordered the chicken strips, really wasnt strips, more like nuggets, and my daughter had the buffalo wings. Paid a little over $20. Maybe we ordered the wrong items to try but IMO didn&#39;t excite me. Tasted like chicken I could have made at home. Even the honey butter didn&#39;t excite me. Wasn&#39;t too crazy about the blue cheese and their greenish ranch dressing. My daughter had a lemonade that was too sour. She had to add water to it to calm it down. I doubt I would return."

Rub it on your biscuits, rub it on your chicken, eat it by itself, that stuff is good!We were seated on the patio but unfortunately it started to downpour so they were very accommodating in helping us figure out where to sit inside, luckily they made it happen.Unfortunately my only complaint is their grits. On the menu, it sounds so good, but in reality it was not delicious at all. It was more so just cream than grits. It almost was just like creamy milk to me. It&#39;s currently making my stomach churn. I don&#39;t recommend the grits. But everything else was not bad, chicken, biscuits- I&#39;ve had better but I love how they&#39;re mini and in the shape of honey combs, great added touch.Will I come back? Probably not. Sorry HBFC."

Why not both! I got the HBFC sandwich AND a 1 piece. Then I got a side of creamed corn.The chicken is the right amount of crisp and they are just so generous with that honey butter!

That&#39;s not how it&#39;s done here and you must obey the honey butter gods.We both dined on breakfast sammys donned with fried eggs. I had a classic while the beau tried a more fancy one. They were equally delicious! We gobbled them up in a heartbeat. For sides, we went with the pimento Mac n cheese and creamed corn. Again, fabulous. Lastly we HAD to get mini biscuits with extra honey butter. Definitely a must....soooo yummy!HBFC is legit. They have an amazingly large patio in the back too for sunny days.

If Yelp had half stars I&#39;d give this a 3.5 instead of 3. Here&#39;s why:Service: was incredible! Super super friendly and helpful with menu selection.Food: this is what it&#39;s all about, right? So the star of the show, the honey butter fried chicken, deserves all of the stars and accolades of the world. Bravo!!! So good! But here is where it started to go downhill for me. The sides :( Oh the sides. They were so disappointing and really took away from the incredible chicken. The mac n cheese had way too strong of a flavor profile. I could only handle a few bites and my 2 year old spit it out. The slaw was lacking flavor, so opposite problem of the Mac n cheese! The cornbread was small and pretty dry (which can be okay for cornbread sometimes but didn&#39;t work here). Ultimately, we left feeling a bit unsatisfied, which was a huge bummer because the chicken was so incredible. And there weren&#39;t many kid friendly selections available.Ultimately, I would go back, but only for the chicken. It&#39;s not cheap, but that chicken is oh so good. If the sides could get up to par I could see this being a regular staple in our home.Also - LOVE the fact that they pay their staff a fair living wage (and the customer doesn&#39;t have to tip).

There is a menu on the wall or a smaller menu you can look at that&#39;s a physical copy.My boyfriend had ordered the 2-piece fried chicken, the Honey Butter Fried Chicken Sandwich, and the limited-time available Spicy Chicken Sandwich they made in collaboration with Parachute.I loved the Spicy Chicken Sandwich, I really did, but I didn&#39;t love that I felt like it was way too small. The Honey Butter Fried Chicken Sandwich was also the same small size and didn&#39;t really taste that great...there was no wow factor to the sandwich that I was hoping for. I actually didn&#39;t even taste much of the honey butter part. The 2-piece fried chicken was also underwhelming and had no special taste to it and also was not nice and crunchy like we were hoping. The 2 corn muffins the 2-piece came with was tiny and kind of plain.I&#39;m so sad I wasn&#39;t in love with this place because I really wanted to be. The concept is great and the service is fantastic; just lacking a little in terms of the food. This is all of course just my humble opinion. I&#39;ll be back just because I want to try the other things on the menu but I&#39;m not exactly in a hurry."

The food was great and the pomegranate mimosa was delish!The only thing I would suggest is getting there early... It can fill up fast and parking can be a bit of an annoyance.

Perfectly crispy, and when you slather the honey butter on it it just gets better.-the schmaltz mash potatoes were my favorite! Super creamy, and the gravy was perfect.-very cute spot right on the corner.My negatives:-the chicken was ridiculously small. My little chicken breast piece plus two little cornbread muffins was grossly overpriced.-MY whole meal was just under $30, and that was with a drink.Overall, great food, cute space, but the prices vs the portion sizes is a bit ridiculous."

Great fried chicken. Cool atmosphere. Fine selection of local craft beer. AND the topper is that they pay their employees a living wage with health benefits and paid time off. And they try to buy from as many local vendors as possible. Come for the great food and drinks. Come back because it just feels great to support a great business model!

The coleslaw was pretty good.    Would I reccommend this place to my friends... meh...  I feel like you can get fried  chicken from another place and go home happier.   The honey butter concept was different.  The honey butter was definitely tasty.  But all in all... i am giving HBFC a 3 star cuz I would not be revisiting.   If I were to revisit, then I would have given them one more star.    Sorry HBFC... you are so-so"

It was so good! If your picky with chicken like I am, you do not have to worry. The chicken is all white meat, if you get the breast, with nothing funky. The batter is really crispy, light and not super greasy. We also enjoyed the mask potatoes and corn muffins. I do think it is a bit over priced but I do understand because everything is high quality. I would definetly recommend giving it a try!"

It&#39;s pricey tho if you think about it and they charge a buck fifty for a quarter size amount of BBQ sauce. Portions are rather small as far as the sides and the biscuits are delish but you are most certainly short changed. There was no line or wait on a Friday night as seating was ample. However, the employees have an attitude and I think they truly believe they are gods gift to the world bc they work in a trendy chicken shop (it&#39;s not that serious guys you work in fast food). Nothing in particular happened but you can tell these hipsters were lazy and in the wrong job. I&#39;d rather see sweet old southern woman there. I&#39;d go back for the chicken and biscuits- mashed were great too but needed salt. 3 stars for the food only"

Came here to check this off my Chicago bucket list, maybe I would have had a better experience if this place wasn&#39;t overly hyped?Walking up on a Saturday night at around 7, I called ahead of time and the hostess told me that we would have to wait at minimum 15 minutes to be seated. That&#39;s not bad for a Saturday at all. What she didn&#39;t mention, and what I didn&#39;t know until we got there, was that you have to wait in line to order your food first before being seated. That means, despite countless open tables surrounding us, we had to wait in line standing for 20 minutes to place our order before being seated. There was one guy working the register, and about 20 people standing before us. Why we couldn&#39;t be seated first and then order is beyond me.Placed our order, I got the two piece fried honey butter chicken with cornbread, kale slaw, sweet potato salad, and a rhubarb cocktail. Boyfriend got the buffalo chicken sandwich with pimento mac and cheese, and a beer.Great patio seating outside, very friendly wait staff, and the food came out in about 5 minutes after being seated. The fried chicken was some of the best I&#39;ve ever had, they tell you to spread the honey butter on it, which I&#39;d never done before, but it makes or breaks the experience if you don&#39;t. Boyfriend&#39;s sandwich was amazing, but with a leftover pool of buffalo sauce on the platter, way too much sauce. Mac and cheese was excellent, but kale slaw was beyond bland. Just basically shaved kale with a plain white sauce of some kind (not sure if mayonnaise or greek yogurt?). Sweet potatoes were excellent, but served cold, so it was a little strange. It was a sweet potato salad, so I get that potato salad is usually served cold, but even a guy we were sitting next to chirped up and agreed that it would taste better served hot.All in all good food, but not worth waiting in line for. I would come back, but after spending around 30$ on just myself for fried chicken and mediocre sides, I would order ahead and get takeout instead. Definitely extreme hit or miss with what you decide to order, I would suggest sticking to the fried chicken individual pieces or sandwiches, mac and cheese, and the creamed corn which looked good but we didn&#39;t get to try."

Seriously--have you?That&#39;s the mindset I had leaving this place. It&#39;s hard for me to hate on fried chicken. The stuff here isn&#39;t as crispy/crunchy as, say, Harold&#39;s Chicken, and it has an almost-wet rub on it that&#39;s a little spicy. Put the honey butter on it, and it melts into a lovely pseudo-sauce of sweet and spicy. That&#39;s the ticket. The little cornbread muffin-thingies are great too.The place can be busy and bustling, but the staff do a great job of making themselves available, trying to seat people, checking in, etc.It&#39;s also worth mentioning that they have a great soda fountain that includes Goose Island root beer, a ginger drink and more.I guess I get why some people may not like it, but just accept that it&#39;s different from KFC or something like that."

The chicken was very crispy and flavorful and the Mac was to die for! So the honey butter spread is super tasty.. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the crispy chicken getting super soggy with the butter, but hey.. The taste was worth it.. Salty and sweet and amazing. The 2 piece also came with 2 small corn bread. Also bomb! They have a good drink variety, i stuck to water.. (Already pretty intoxicated from a long beach day)Overall a awesome experience, the place was clean, our orders came out in less than 10 minutes...

I mean, it is butter after all but butter makes it taste good. Well, its one of their main ingredients for their food. I got the original fried chicken sandwich and I was pretty satisfied because it taste sweet in a special way but the only downfall was that they put so much butter in the burger that the moment I lifted it up to take a bite, the butter started dripping right away. As for the service, it was good. Its basically self served and you order at the counter but once you are done with your food, someone would actually come up to you and help clean away your tray."

Let me preface this review by stating that I have been dying for a vacation in the Tuscan countryside for a while now (and I&#39;m hoping to go next year!). If you are in the same boat, don&#39;t want to wait and want a bit of incredible Italian cooking, do come to A Tavola! We went here in early July when the Chicago weather is beautifully warm and perfect for eating outside. A Tavola has this gorgeous courtyard where we sat on a double date with another couple who had highly recommended this place to us. This place is known for its gnocchi and, my goodness, what fine gnocchi it really is! I have no hesitation in recommending the gnocchi to anyone who wants good, authentic pasta. My wife is a die-hard gnocchi fan and she loved it (so it MUST be good!). The gnocchi was perfectly soft and fluffy, and the browned sage butter drizzled over it was amazing!I (grudgingly) shared my Bistecca Fiorentina which is a Tuscan specialty. It is a bone-in center cut ribeye that was grilled to perfection with olive oil and salt. We had ours done medium-rare. Don&#39;t even bother ordering the bistecca if you like your meat well-done. In fact, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the server glares at you for making such a request. The bistecca is definitely to be shared between two hungry people since it is massive!I have read rave reviews of their Panna Cotta but we could not stomach a dessert after the decadence that was the main course.Our server was super polite, patient (we took ages to decide on food) and informative. She helped us with wine pairings as well, and the four of us finished off a lovely bottle of velvety Montepulciano d&#39;Abruzzo which complemented the bistecca incredibly well.Dining outside at A Tavola will transport you from 2148 W Chicago Avenue to a beautiful Tuscan hilltop with rolling vineyards and olive groves sprawling out before you as far as the eye can see. Or maybe that was just the red wine&#39;s effect!"

What delicious food can be had at A Tavola.It&#39;s pricey.It&#39;s dark &amp; romantic.It&#39;s Italian food done really well.Service is very attentive &amp; professional though they messed up our order, then charged us for their mess up.My friends and I started with a simple Caprese Salad ($10) which was enjoyable. 4 slices of tomato, 4 slices of cheese, so everyone in my group had one piece of each. Though this was fine, it could be skipped on our next trip in.We ordered each pasta on the menu and this is where a discrepency was made. Instead of being one of each of the 3 pastas, we were brought just 2 pastas with 1 bowl of one and 2 bowls of another! Not sure why they would think we&#39;d get two bowls of one type. When we asked, they said, ah yes, it&#39;s coming right out. Well the one they forgot was very al dente (aka rush order) and the extra pasta was not removed from our bill. We did not love having to pay for their mistake.That being said, the pastas were delicious.The Gnocchi ($18 or $12) with browned sage butter &amp; parmesan was my personal favorite, done really well with just the right amount of cheese with fabulously done pasta.We needed a red sauce dish of course so ordered the Tagliatelle Bolognese ($18 or $12) - a combination of ground pork and beef in a san marzano tomato sauce. I don&#39;t normally love tomato based sauce dishes but actually loved this! This was however the dish they forgot about so the noodles were a bit undercooked.My friend says Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe ($18 or $12) in the most terrible way possible with a heavy accent. Though we can&#39;t stand him saying the name of this dish, we totally could stand the dish itself.&#39;Twas traditional Roman dish with cheese &amp; pepper. Very cheesy. Very peppery. Very good.All the pastas were wonderful but the pièce de résistance of the meal was the Sangiovese Braised Beef Short Rib for $28. The meat just fell off the bone, so tender and packed full of flavor. The dish as a whole came together in perfect harmony being plated atop a bed of saffron topped with a horseradish gremolata. Every element of this dish was mind blowing and I highly recommend this pricey but well worth it entree!Between four of us &amp; splitting a bottle of wine ($46 bottle of pinot), we spent $200. Considering the bottle was $40, that really isn&#39;t too terribly bad."

(No blue cheese olives though for our martinis - boo.)Dinner was braised short ribs which were good but not great as a tad dry.  I tasted the chicken and that was great (moist and juicy to the max) as were the pasta dishes (flavorful and delicious) which I would definitely try next time, especially the gnocchi.I subtract a star for the dessert.  Rico said the flourless chocolate cake it was made fresh that day but it did not taste like it.  I thought it tasted like it was thawed out from the freezer.  We left 1/2 of it which if you knew us, almost never happens.Definitely would return for the right food selections and the great service we received.  Highly recommend."

I had the pear salad to start which was so fresh and delicious, followed by the tagliatelle which was so rich and delicious! Service is really attentive without being overbearing.

A Tavola is located inside a two-flat on Chicago Avenue, and the restaurant has about 10 tables total. It really feels as though you&#39;re eating in a friend&#39;s living room, and that&#39;s part of the charm. The atmosphere is quiet and perfect for a low key and delicious date night.Although we came during restaurant week, we decided to stick to their regular menu. Upon sitting we were given their house focaccia bread alongside some olives. The focaccia here is standout! With our server&#39;s guidance, we ordered the arugula salad and mixed roasted vegetables as starters. Both were very fresh, and the roasted vegetables were cooked to perfection. The arugula salad was served with tomatoes, parmesan, and walnuts-- a basic salad with fresh ingredients but nothing incredibly standout.The next courses are where the restaurant really shines: pastas and entrees. We opted to share two pasta dishes, the gnocchi and the tagliatelle bolognese. Both dishes were UNREAL. The gnocchi is quite easily the best, most fluffy gnocchi I&#39;ve ever had. A light dish, which is virtually unheard of when describing gnocchi. As for their tagliatelle, I think I might have liked this even more than the gnocchi if possible. Their bolognese sauce is the perfect balance between tomato-y, creamy, and sweet. Their homemade noodles make all the difference, and I would put this up there as one of my all time favorite pasta experiences. Finally, we shared the short rib with saffron risotto. The short rib was fall off the bone perfection, and the saffron rice had a creaminess that balanced the meat perfectly.I would highly recommend this to those looking for a serious Italian meal with great ambiance and a smaller price tag than some of its downtown counterparts. What a great neighborhood spot!"

Everything was good- but it wasn&#39;t great or amazing as I figured it would be at such a special establishment. I thought the ambiance would be fancier since it is a small space and sometimes hard to get reservations.We were running a little late and we called to let them know that we would be about 15 minutes later than our reservations. The woman on the phone himmed and hawed and acted like they would not be able to accommodate us because they were booked. When we got there they had a private party (gathering) in the main dining room waiting to go upstairs so we didn&#39;t have the option of sitting inside anyway! When we went outside there were plenty of tables left!The food was good but I&#39;ve had way better Authentic Italian in Chicago. They have a limited menu so my husband chose to have the veal steak which was on special. The entrees run around $30 so we figured it would be the most $10-$15 more. Well don&#39;t figure- always ask because when we got the check just his veal was $70!!!! We fine fine a lot but never have we paid so much for a cut of meat.  If it would have been the best veal ever it would have been one thing but it was very fatty.The gnocchi was ok but it was very large and it doesn&#39;t come with a lot of sauce on it so it came out dry. The Bolognese was very good.Overall a very disappointing date night so I wouldn&#39;t suggest it for dining. Way better options in Chicago."

After coming from a rowdy Cubs crowd at Fat Pour, the dim lighting and quiet murmurs perfectly set the mood for the cozier intimacy one would expect from a proper date night.  We weren&#39;t sure that we wanted a three course dinner, but the menu was too good to not splurge.We started with the roasted vegetables and mushroom plate.  The portobello soaked in balsamic vinaigrette and italian spices for 24 hrs and melted in our mouths.  The vegetables were tasty as expected, especially the giant fennel bulb.We knew we had to get the gnocchi, even though neither of us are huge gnocchi fans because of how dense and filling they are. The gnocchi here are as light as marshmallows and tasty like none I&#39;ve ever had. I also got the tagliatelle bolognese, and we both agreed that was our favorite of the night, the bf because it&#39;s what he thinks of as Italian food, and me because it reminds me of home cooked meals on Sundays with my Italian family.  I had the Lake Superior whitefish with a lemon caper reduction and my bf had the Italian chicken.  Both were wonderful and although I felt a little guilty doing so, I took half of my meal home so I could enjoy it the next day.The wines by the glass are limited but all so nice, it is obvious that there was a lot of thought put into the drink menu.If nothing else, what I&#39;ll wrap up with is this: of the three tables around us, we heard each say, at different points of them meal, &#34;this reminds me of when I was in Italy.&#34;  And I agree.  It was a meal worthy of the Tuscan countryside, or the Roman city center."

Well here it goes: the pasta Noqui was not good, the oil taste like burned, arugula salad was ok, nothing extraordinary, the pasta with ragu was actually the best, but still pretty standard..... At the end and what we expect to be great, was the bisteka fiorentina ( T bone), far from good.. It taste like gas burned, far from been the best it was actually not good. You can have amazing meat at Chicago... The good stuff was the dessert Panacota... Superb... After having one, we order a second one and the waitress told us they ran out.

She helped us pick a wine we loved. Upon ordering food, she informed us their pasta maker had broke that day and the only pasta (from the gnocchi, bolognese, and cacio e pepe) available was gnocchi, although the bolognese sauce was available with the gnocchi.We thought it was strange an Italian restaurant would only have one pasta maker anyway for situations like this, especially on a busy Saturday. We were also disappointed as two of our party were vegetarian and were looking forward to the gnocchi and cacio e pepe. Another was looking forward to the lamb read about on here but it was missing from the menu.We ended up ordering the arugula salad and gnocchi for the vegetarians, and gnocchi bolognese and the short rib for the others.The gnocchi was good, but not exceptionally so. The bolognese sauce was delicious, however. The short rib was fatty and the risotto was slightly bland. The salad had a little too much vinegar -- it burned my throat.We ordered the panna cotta for dessert and it was heavenly, definitely the best I&#39;ve had outside of Italy.Overall, we had a good experience because of the service, wine, and dessert, but I probably wouldn&#39;t go back."

It was a lot and we had to take the rest home.  I was disappointed in the Cacio e Pepe as the pasta looked and had the texture of crinkly thin ramen noodles and their version added a lot of olive oil.  The Gnocchi was flavorful.  For dessert we split the Torta di Mele Rovesciata (baked apple pastry).  It took them longer than usual to make it so the server apologized for the delay.  It was just okay, not worth the wait for it. So the cacio e pepe didn&#39;t live up to the recommendation in my opinion, but the service and ambiance made up for it."

This is not authentic Italian. I repeat not authentic Italian. I&#39;ve traveled all over Italy on numerous occasions and have had meals from our close Italian family friends.The pros it is quaint and small or I should say intimate inside. The wait staff is friendly. Has ambiance.The cons, make sure you have enough time to dine; It took us 3 hours to get a beverage order, salads and shared pasta, a shared entree a shared dessert and coffees.The salads were oily and didn&#39;t have the right balance of dressing or citrus to counter the oil. We shared a small gnocchi in sage butter, but was missing fresh sage. The veal special we ordered was ample size, meat was good, but nothing to rave. Garlic spinach was oily we had to ask for lemon to balance the flavor and the Rosemary potatoes were too crispy they were almost dry.The chocolate torte was good, tasted like the decadent brownies you can get at my pie pizza but thinner.I am truly disappointed I cannot give a better review. On top of that the bill was $160, without tip.Mia Francesca&#39;s is better and more fresh in my opinion. Had higher hopes for this cute building."

I liked that! We started off with the ever-so-famous gnocchi with brown sage butter &amp; parmesan (airy and fluffy, but a little bland, and the crispy sage leaves kind of wigged me out), and the Sangiovese braised lamb ragu with tagliatelle (which was just way too lamb-y/game-like for me). These come in smaller portions, so it&#39;s a nice size to share between two people instead of an actual &#39;entree&#39; size. For the main entrees, I had the oven roast chicken served with a savory bread pudding &amp; garlic spinach (the chicken was cooked to perfection, great to dip in a bit of salt, and the garlic spinach was fantastic; I&#39;d probably wanted an extra helping of the spinach rather than the bread pudding), and the braised beef short rib over saffron risotto topped with a raw horseradish, lemon zest, and parley gremolata (the brasied beef was alright, but a little too bland; the risotto was way too runny). For dessert, we had the panna cotta - it tasted like a thicker version of flan, with a thick texture like cream cheese, tasting like an unmeltable version of ice cream of vanilla and caramel - I really enjoyed this, even though the texture was a little odd. The prices were decent, and the restaurant itself is cute - people opted to sit out in the patio with the nice weather, but I preferred the well AC-ed dining room. The bathroom was like a freezer, and I LOVED it!  I do like the fact that they have a &#39;limited menu,&#39; in which the chef focuses on the dishes with the &#39;best ingredients.&#39; The service, the chicken dish, and the panna cotta would probably be what I would order again if I came back.

It was super delicious, and exceptionally light in the brown butter sauce with dried sage (I could&#39;ve finished two orders of it, easily).  Then we split a bone-in ribeye for two (which could have easily served three or four!). The accompanying rosemary potatoes were excellent.Panna cotta to finish was great, as was their espresso (we overhead the chef telling other customers they are the only spot in Chicago with this particular espresso, so we couldn&#39;t pass it up!)."

Having recently moved back to Chicago I have desperately been looking and this is the place.It feels like you are eating at someone&#39;s house for Sunday dinner. We went on a Saturday night and had reservations for 6:00. When we got there it was half capacity with mainly an older crowd.The servers were amazing, so friendly and just all around made you feel at home. Food came out fast after placing the order.THE FOOD! They give you focaccia bread to start which is so good and the keep it coming if you finish it. I started with the bolognese and my wife had the pear salad. Both were awesome, especially the bolognese. My wife had the chicken for her main and it was extremely good, crispy skin and tender chicken inside. I had the spare ribs with risotto, again amazing. Fall of the bone meat.If I have any complaints it would be this. The atmosphere is a little quiet I&#39;d say. Mainly older people, still a good vibe though. The other thing I would warn people who are unfamiliar with italian cuisine is that the pastas are meant to be a first course and they are small, so most likely you will get a pasta and a main. It will run you about $35-$50 for both.Food: 5Service: 5 (but i&#39;d give it at 10)Atmosphere: 4Value: 4.5Will be returning."

We loved the bolognese and short rib risotto best, though the gnocchi was tasty too. This is not a &#34;scene&#34; restaurant and it&#39;s off the beaten path for visitors to Chicago, but it&#39;s exactly the kind of place you&#39;d want to quietly celebrate good news with family members or take a date with whom you want to engage in real conversation."

It&#39;s not a deal breaker, but disappointing.  Plus, it&#39;s a benefit when other restaurants remember my notes about being gluten free for when I arrive. Keep in mind the other three in my party eat gluten.First coarse, I hear the lamb ragu was great.   I had the pear salad. It was good.Second coarse failed all of us.  Two of us had the chicken.  Both where dry and bland (I hate to say that because I love a good chicken).   In our party we also had a beef tenderloin that was ordered medium and came our rare (they comped our check, which goes back to the great service) and all you can taste on the lamb was the chargrilled outer coat.Overall, I was expecting great, and we were very disappointed.

I went only based on positive yelp reviews and was not disappointed. This place is so charming, both outside and inside. It is very un-expecting when first getting there because they really don&#39;t have a storefront so it was perfect for surprising my girlfriend. She thought we were going to some fast food Chinese place for a moment, because that was the only sign of a restaurant on the block.The place was very romantic, low lit and we were greeted and seated right away. We both shared the Pear Salad and Gnocchi to start. The salad was fresh and very tasty. The gnocchi was fresh and hand made that same day. The gnocchi melted in your mouth like butter and had such excellent flavor.I ordered the braised beef short rib with risotto and she ordered the grilled beef tenderloin. Both of these dishes were to die for. We were making so many mmmm sounds when eating. We also shared a bottle of the Belpoggio, Rosso di Motalcino 2010. This wine was excellent and paired nicely with our entire meal. Our waitress was so kind and I overheard she was responsible for ordering a tavola&#39;s wines. I asked her what are some of her favorite Italian reds and she gave me some suggestions and later wrote them down for me. We topped off our meal with an excellent dessert, Swiss flourless chocolate with cream. Absolutely delicious!I highly recommend a tavola for that special evening with that special someone. I also hear they do cooking classes and private parties in the upstairs area."

Make a reservation if you&#39;re coming on a busy night. Atmosphere is the kind you see in movies when there&#39;s a scene set in an Italian restaurant. White-cloth tables that seat four, in a room that&#39;s full but not crammed.The staff are professionals experienced in the offerings. Our server gave us an expert introduction to their menu and wine list, the kind of familiarity with the food and wine that can only come from working in a restaurant for a long time.The menu is short, varied but true to style, and suggests a specific set of courses: salad, then small pasta course, then main. And of course dessert if you like. My wife ordered just salad and pasta, then nibbled a bit at the serves-two veal our friend and I shared for our main, and we all left happy.We chose mostly house specialties for our introduction to the place. Everything from the fresh, herbed bread to the homemade dessert was excellent.For her pasta course my wife ordered the lamb, and gave me a taste. I&#39;m picky about lamb, but this was just right, only the faintest hint that distinguished it from other meats. I want to try their lamb main.Friend and I each had gnocchi as our pasta. House specialty, best I&#39;ve ever tasted, the end.The veal was also superb. Topped with prosciutto and served off-bone, on a platter with sliced potatoes topped in cheese, and a mound of oh what spinach. Perfectly cooked to just the right doneness, with garlic that&#39;s forward but not overpowering. Just excellent, I wish I could make my own spinach turn out like that.Just superb."

YIKES!You must try the gnocchi, OMG it&#39;s so delicious. And the Lamb Ragu, my husband hates lamb but loved that dish, I woke up today craving it. That being said, things go down hill from there.My husband and I stopped in on a Tuesday evening a little after 6 pm. It was my birthday and I LOVE Italian food, since a tavola is with in walking distance to our place we figured we give it a chance. When we arrived we were the only table and were told by someone that they weren&#39;t allowing people to sit on the patio because they didn&#39;t want to move them later when it got to cold. Okay, it&#39;s a Tuesday, really you can&#39;t sit us where we&#39;d like to be sat. Okay, whatever, lets move on.Our waiter is soft spoken and mumbles, so its tough to understand what he&#39;s saying sometimes and there is younger guy following him, although we have no idea why. He just stands there and stares. It&#39;s a little weird. My guess is he&#39;s training but I don&#39;t know maybe tell the table what&#39;s going on cause it was very creepy at times.The waiter explains the menu and how it&#39;s meant to be ordered which is fine by us. We order a bottle of wine and figure out what we want to eat while we wait for our wine. While the waiter is pouring the wine he takes our order and gets it mixed up a couple times, you could have just waited until you were done pouring the wine to take the order. We are still the only table.We order a lot of food, thinking leftovers will be yummy for lunch the next day. 2 salads, the gnocchi and lamb ragu and 2 entrees. The pork shank which is one of their specials that evening and the beef spare ribs. About 10 minutes after we place the order our salads arrive. Great perfect. Yummy salads, we enjoy them.We finish those and the plates are removed, at this point a couple of tables are now full and 10 minutes later our pasta comes out. They are small portion pasta and the waiter warned us so I wasn&#39;t surprised. I mean price wise it&#39;s a bit silly but they were both so good that I didn&#39;t care. We finish the pasta (which wasn&#39;t the original plan, we were going to take some of the pasta home but) they take the plates away and now we have 50 minutes to wait for our entrees. I get that they want you to relax and enjoy your meal but seriously. If the dishes are going to take that long then I suggest you tell the patrons that before they order. If I would have known I would have said screw it I&#39;ll eat more pasta.FINALLY our food comes out and my beef short ribs are swimming in a pond of brown broth. It doesn&#39;t look very appetizing seeing as the risotto is now drenched in a lot of liquid, but I try the food anyway. The beef ribs are very salty and the risotto is almost hard, like they&#39;ve some how separated into these little bricks of rice. My husband says his pork is okay but not as good at the pork I had a few days ago at a different place on the north side.SO after all that waiting, we only take a few bites of our food and then sit for 25 minutes with our plates in front of us waiting for our waiter to return. At this point there are now 8 tables and our waiter is the only one on, so he&#39;s running around like crazy. Finally he comes by to check on us and asks if we&#39;re still working. We say no and he offers a dessert menu, my husband agrees that we&#39;ll take a look. Now we&#39;re not dessert people but we usually get something to share on one of our birthday&#39;s but this time I said no. I turned down my husbands offer for an after dinner drink, espresso, dessert, all of it because I knew it would take forever to get it. We were now out of wine and again it took 20 minutes for the waiter to come back and ask if we wanted any dessert. At that point my husband handed the waiter his credit card and asked for the bill because I was over it.I really wanted to love this place. Especially after eating the gnocchi and lamb ragu but the price is high the service is slow and I just didn&#39;t feel welcomed at all. It felt very stuffy, so we&#39;ll see if we go back. There are better places in the city I just really wanted it to be GREAT since it&#39;s so close to us. Oh well."

White cloth tables, soft music playing, it&#39;s a quiet, unassuming spot for a great meal.Our waiter, Tim, was wonderful!  We weren&#39;t in a rush and he respectfully checked in with  us periodically whiled we perused the menuWe started with their &#34;famous&#34; gnocchi in brown butter with crispy sage leaves. Amazing! The kitchen split the portion onto 2 plates for us which was a very nice touch.For entree we shared the oven-roasted Branzino which was delicious.We  asked for a wine recommendation in a certain price range and we enjoyed what Tim suggested.It is a very pretty, romantic &amp; intimate spot - casual yet great for a nice date night.A do not miss!!"

They asked if we wanted to sit outside, but looked like it was going to rain, so I hesitated but he assured us he would hold a table inside just &#34;in case&#34; (nice!). patio is lovely, the table rocked a tiny (brick patio), but before we could say or even think it, the waiter was out with little plastic inserts to even the table out for us. Wine was good, dinner was great. Gnocchi was great, I had it as an entree since I am a veg, the Beef Tenderloin was huge. Service was very attentive, but not overly so. Dessert was amazing, forget the name now but it was the vanilla one. Make sure you get it!Do not hesitate to go here for a great and memorable dinner!"

So why the 3 stars?Sadly the portion/price was off. There were not a lot gnocchis for the price and the other dish we had (I forget now what it was) was also kinda small. We did also have the grilled vegetable platter app so that held us over for the night. But I guess if you are on a date and money is no object, this is pretty good.Apparently their patio gives out free money or something because while we were happily eating indoors, every party that came in asked for the patio and was disappointed when it was already full. Some even lamented they made a reservation just for the patio, but as the hostess repeatedly said, the patio is not guaranteed and first come first serve. Many a date was ruined that night, I assume.So if you are into pillowy soft gnocchis, I guess you could start here so you have a reference point. But if I ate here too often I think I&#39;d either be broke or starving."

Flavor.I accomplished two major feats this week. One - I introduced 4 native Chicagoans to a tavola - in a city of fine restaurants none of them had heard of a tavola until I recommended we dine there based upon the recommendations of my fellow yelpers. Which brings me to Two - by now we should have four new yelpers!What an amazing experience. For starters, we felt like we were entering the restauranteur&#39;s home, as the restaurant is a refurbished row house. Upon entering, we received a warm welcome and were escorted to our corner table. From there, the fine service began. Everybody was completely attentive to our needs.The menu is limited on purpose, and for good reason. Many items are grown fresh in the backyard garden, and the pasta is made on site. So where to begin? A fresh spinach salad? Salad calabrese? (I had the Calabrese - completely fresh and totally delicious). Second course is a pasta. At the recommendation of many fellow yelpers, we had the gnocchi - and the yelpers were right. Best gnocchi any of us have ever tasted. I also ordered pasta tagliatelle bolognese. We passed it around the table, and all agreed that a tavola bolognese was the best we had experienced. On to main course. I had the filet, medium rare. Seasoned with olive oil and sea salt and cooked over wood it was outstanding. It was accompanied by sauteed spinach with garlic and roasted rosemarypotatoes. A lightly breaded grouper filet was also offered off menu, and three of my companions enjoyed this wonderful dish.The dessert selection included four items, all prepared fresh in-house. Of course, we tried all four accompanied by either cappucino or port (guess which I chose) and the meal concluded with smiles all around.A tavola is definitely worth a visit. I know that when I return to Chicago I will look forward to a return visit."

This intimate, Italian restaurant serves delicious dishes mostly prepared with fresh ingredients that are grown in the garden out back. What makes this place a special one is the fact that the menu keeps changing according to the season. If you ever go there, and you should, don&#39;t forget to try the gnocchi, their specialty. You will love it for sure!The restaurant also offers a plethora of wine types, so you are free to choose according to your preferences. The atmosphere, the dim lighting and the music are perfect for a quiet evening. The gentle waiters are always ready to attend you and since there are only few tables, everyone gets what he/she needs right away.

The brown sage butter gnocchi was decent, but the sage over-powered the whole dish, I&#39;ve had better gnocchi at a handful of other restaurants. My braised beef short rib was good but exactly half of it was pure fat and bone that I could not eat. The risotto that came with it was runny and had a weird flavor to it because of the lemon zest. My dining companion liked his beef tenderloin. Good wine selection. We decided not to have dessert.A meal here can be quite expensive and I&#39;d say your money is better spent somewhere else. The menu is extremely limited and if you have a limited menu, each entree better be phenomenal, but this was not the case. Nothing tasted authentically Italian to me.Atmosphere and dress are casual. You may have trouble finding this place, it looks like a house from the outside, no sign. It is in fact a house turned into a restaurant, the small living room is basically the dining area. Just a handful of tables with slow turnover so make sure you have reservations. The place feels cozy and service was excellent but the food is what matters and sadly, A Tavola did not deliver."

A good friend was taking me for a belated birthday dinner and since we both loved A Tavola, going back was an easy sell.We didn&#39;t make a reservation, but since we arrived on the early side, we had no problem getting a table on their patio. It was a perfect evening to sit outside and enjoy a leisurely dinner.We wanted to start with wine but the wine list on our table was empty, as in the book had no pages in it. After we were finally able to flag someone down, we were given the wine list and we decided on what we wanted to order. I ordered a rosé and my friend ordered something white that she couldn&#39;t pronounce (this will be important later).Our wine arrives and we&#39;re asked about our food selections. We always share an order of gnocchi to start and I opted for the lamb special, medium rare, and my friend went with the fish of the day.Our gnocchi arrives, already split, which I always appreciate, and while it was good, it just wasn&#39;t nearly as good as I remember. Our empty plates sat there until our dinner arrives...thirty minutes later. We were never offered second glasses of wine which we would have happily drunk. Our server simply plunked our plates down and scurried off.My lamb was frightfully overcooked but since our server didn&#39;t come back to check on us (I never even saw her on the patio after that), I couldn&#39;t send it back so I just ate it because I feared it would be another half hour before a new dish was prepared and I didn&#39;t want my friend to eat alone. The other odd thing was that both of our entrees were to come with potatoes - that&#39;s potatoes, plural. What we each got was one sad little new potato (and I mean tiny), cut in half. Did potatoes suddenly get really expensive? Last time I checked, they were one of the more cheap starches (hell, I used to buy a bag of them in college and subsist on them for a week), so why so chintzy, A Tavola?After we finished our entrees my friend decided she really wanted a second glass of wine but again, finding our server was next to impossible. When she finally came out, she had to ask my friend what she ordered. My friend said &#34;The wine I couldn&#39;t pronounce earlier.&#34; The server said &#34;Oh, I&#39;ll figure it out&#34; and walked away.The server must have passed by our table at least six times in the next ten minutes but never looked our way or delivered the wine. My friend got up to go to the bathroom and our server came to me and asked if she had ordered white wine. I said &#34;yes&#34; then she ran off again.By now, my friend returned and still didn&#39;t have her wine. I would have ordered dessert to enjoy while my friend was drinking her wine but we were never asked and since the wine situation wasn&#39;t looking so promising, we decided to just find the server and tell her to cancel the wine so we could get out of there. Again, we couldn&#39;t find her so my friend got up to look for her and found her and told her to cancel the wine. The server remarked that it &#34;was on the table&#34; and my friend had to tell her that it wasn&#39;t and to just forget about it and bring our check as it was getting late.The server then brings the wine, apologizes and tells us she won&#39;t charge us for the wine. Okay, great. Since we got the wine, I decide to order dessert so I can eat it while my friend has her wine. Again, it took our server several minutes to bring the dessert menu and take my order. I finally get my panna cotta and we eat and drink in a hurry as we&#39;ve now been there 2.5 hours.Another server brings our check and asks us if we want gratis limoncello shots to make up for the long wait. It was a nice gesture but we declined as we just wanted to leave. An apology was nice, but it was kind of too late at that point (and it would have been more appropriate if it came from our own server).So all we wanted was a leisurely dinner, and by god, we got it. 2.5 hours later, we were out of there.I&#39;m hoping the bad service was just a fluke, because I really love A Tavola and prior to last night I&#39;d had nothing but good experiences there, but it may be some time before I go back and give it another try."

Well seasoned, &#34;tastes just like steak&#34;. ha. I love how everyone says that but it didLemon caper whitefish - holy smokes...they do know how to make a lemon caper sauce. Fish was cooked perfectly.Lamb bolognese: traditional and savoryBYO as well.  Now, let&#39;s get to the actual interior. It&#39;s a bit reminiscent of the early 90s. It could use some updating but the food measures up so I can ignore that aspect.  They do have good lighting which is a bonus.The building itself is inconspicuous.  It looks more like a home than a restaurant from the outside which is why I wish the inside was a bit more warm.Also, this is not a place to bring a group.  Mind you, I went on V-Day but it does seem like more of a place for couples or maybe a double date."

Small, quiet, romantic. I&#39;m pretty sure I got bonus points for even knowing about it- A Tavola is so tucked away and non-descript that it feels like you&#39;re privy to a closely guarded secret.Unfortunately, it only gets 3 stars from me. We ordered a trio of different meats, served carpaccio style, which was wonderful. I ordered the gnocchi, which had been billed as their house specialty, and he ordered the short ribs on risotto. My gnocchi was pretty undercooked and as a result- gummy. My date tried it and concurred- I still managed to eat about half of the dish, but when pressed by the waiter, (&#34;...But it&#39;s our house specialty!&#34; ) declined to send it back. (New relationship- too nervous to come off as high maintenance, which I most likely am) His short ribs were great, much more flavorful. We got a bottle of red and spent probably $160 with tip.Otherwise, while nice, and tucked away, the jazz playing via cd on an old boombox under a server&#39;s station where we were seated upstairs kept skipping/stopping, and the waiter kept having to futz with it. That kind of kills the mood. (And really- CDs? Is this 1992?) Also, I wish there were more reasonably priced wine options by the bottle. Otherwise, still a good evening."

The chef&#39;s mantra seems to be &#34;keep it simple,&#34; and that is just what he does - find really good ingredients, and cajole them carefully to make them taste as good as possible. Nothing fancy here - just  really delicious food. I can&#39;t wait to go back with a big group and order one of everything on their menu.I was lucky enough to attend a cooking demo with Chef Dan, where he whimsically taught us to make his fantastic gnocchi (literally, the best I&#39;ve ever had) with sage brown butter and tons of parmesean. I will be back to this restaurant for the gnocchi alone.He also taught a simple chicken recipe, and showed an awesome trick on trussing the legs (I&#39;ll let you go and find out for yourself.)After that, the man did something with oyster mushrooms that made them so flavorful and wonderful... it was one of the standouts on a giant table of delicious food. And they only had a tiny pat of butter!!! Amazing. (The portobellos, as often noted, are also delicious. His vinegarette/marinade recipe is delightful.)The tarte tatin that we made was great.  Chef Dan was so thorough and passionate with his instruction that I actually believe that I will be able to make this again at home.Recommend highly.

This place had been on our list for awhile after some friends recommended it. The restaurant is literally an old house and was really cute inside with a nice atmosphere.We started with a Tuscan blend wine which was delicious. The menu is designed to be a 3 course meal- first an appetizer, then a pasta course and ending with an entree.  We opted not to get any appetizers, mainly because nothing really jumped out on the menu.  For the pasta course, I ordered the gnocchi with brown butter and sage and my husband got the lamb ragu. I had high expectations for the gnocchi after reading various other yelp reviews and while I thought they were good, I have had better gnocchi elsewhere. They were super light and pillowy - so much so that my fork broke them apart when I tried to eat them. My husband&#39;s ragu was the show stealer. It was such tender braised lamb and a great sauce. Also it was a much larger portion. For our entrees I got the duck leg with garlic spinach and potatoes and my husband the braised short rib with saffron risotto. Again, his dish was by far the winner. My duck was overcooked. The middle was pink however the ends were well done and basically inedible. The spinach was the highlight of my dish. On the other hand, the braised short rib and risotto was amazing. So tender, so flavorful and the risotto was perfect. If I had ordered what my husband did, I probably would give this place 4 stars.Also our service was very slow. We were there for an hour and 45 minutes when we only ordered 2 courses. We were nursing our bottle of wine. Our server never checked on us during our entrees, which would have been nice considering my lamb was overdone.I didn&#39;t think this place was worth the money. Next time I want high quality Italian, I&#39;ll be heading to La Scarola instead."

Three stars: service was 1 star, the food was 5. So all over a 3 star place.We got there and the waiter asked if we wanted tap of bottled water. We requested tap water. He came back about 5 minutes later and asked us if we wanted bottled or tap water. OK, we were only one of two tables at this point. Bad memory?Anyhow, we ordered our food. They forgot to bring our salad, and we thought it was taking a long time.... One hour and 10 minutes after we sat down, they brought our main course. When we asked about our salads, they offered to bring them out, but at this point, we had hot food in from of us, and it was too late. Our waiter came by and made a comment &#34;oh, looks like they forgot your salad.&#34; I felt like saying, &#34;um, YOU forgot our salad.&#34; But whatever.The waiter also forgot to bring our wine that we ordered, and we had to ask for it. It arrived well after our food. While the food was fantastic, the waiter never once stopped by our table during the entire meal to see how everything was or if we needed anything. As mentioned, we had to flag another waiter down to get our waiter to get the wine.My husband had asked for a candle in my dessert (clearly NOT a big deal to me), but it arrived without. And finally, when the bill came, the salad was still on the bill. We tried to flag down our waiter, but because he was never checking on us, again, we had to get another waiter to get our waiter to ask that they remove this charge.Oh, also the 2 top we were at was like sitting on wooden boards, which it literally was.

There&#39;s just A Tavola, sitting there inhabiting a former home, with a sprawling (city standards) back patio.It&#39;s a white-table-cloth-kind-of-place (and priced accordingly, for the most part). It&#39;s nice, but you won&#39;t feel under dressed in jeans and a jacket, or even just jeans and a button-up shirt. Girls, I&#39;d leave the flip flops at home (but hey, I always think that). It&#39;s not a &#34;judgey&#34; place, but it is the kind of place you&#39;ll feel a bit proud to be at (and protective of), and thus...adorn accordingly.Typically at fancy-ish type restaurants, the food is small and perhaps unintelligible from the menu. At A Tavola you get wonderful homecooked classics with a twist, all freshly prepared and created that very night. An ever-changing menu of classic (real) Italian fare with large tender cuts of meat (I had the pork loin), fresh salads, appetizers, and fish. Great for a family dinner, out-of-towners that want a real taste of that lustrous Chicago dining scene...but aren&#39;t &#34;foodies&#34; or interested in fusion, sushi, etc.A special occasion date with salads, appetizer, bottle of wine (sangiovese), 2 entrees, dessert and a bit o&#39; bourbon for my beau + tax/tip = $175.It&#39;s not inexpensive, but it IS quality. Classy, but not gauche.The twinkly white lights and candles on the patio were icing on the (birthday dinner) cake. Sneak  out through the side alley for that kiss, ta da."

For there are no glaring neon signs, no valet stand and none of the &#34;pomp and circumstance&#34; that is usually present in a restaurant of this caliber.No. A Tavola is more like having dinner at a friend&#39;s house. A friend who grows their own lettuce for the arugula salad in the back yard. A friend who&#39;s fresh herb garden provides the added accent to many dishes. A friend who&#39;s mom must have come from the &#34;old country&#34; to be able to make food as good as this!We started with a couple of their appetizers. The portabella and shittake mushroom special was amazing. Marinated and then freshly grilled- who knew mushrooms could taste this good! And the caprese salad? The buffalo mozzarella just melted in my mouth.We then ordered two of the pasta dishes- the gnocchi (an extra large portion as my friend said he was going to take some home) and the pasta with the homemade bolognese sauce for me. Let me say right now- that there were no leftovers of either. Both were delicious!As for entrees- my friend ordered the red grouper which was the special of the day (served with caper sauce) and I had the grilled lamb with fresh spinach. These, too, were perfectly prepared and still were &#34;praise worthy&#34; the next day when I had them for leftovers.Finally ,we split the panna cotta. This rich dessert drizzled with vanilla sauce had a firm, fresh texture that made for the perfect ending to our meal.Service was outstanding. There were no missed steps and our server&#39;s recommendations were spot on. She knew her stuff.On the night we were there- there was a private party in the main dining area so we were seated upstairs. Upstairs lacks the ambiance but the food is just as good. If you are going to celebrate a special occasion- make sure you are seated on the main floor or you will miss some of the magic of what is A Tavola.Street parking is easy on this stretch of Chicago- just don&#39;t forget to pay the meter box. And there is no need to get dressed up as this place is casual yet nice.If you are looking for that special place to enjoy a night out with some great food, excellent service with an intimate ambiance, try A Tavola. It&#39;s a little bit of Italy, right here in Chicago!"

I asked for medium rare, and goddamn it, they gave me medium rare.  Perfect lamb. My boyfriend got the roasted chicken, which I wasn&#39;t impressed with, but he liked it.The best part of our meal was the ambiance - this is a seriously romantic restaurant - the type where you can lean into your lover and hold hands and whisper and giggle.Cons: The roasted chicken came with a savory bread pudding, which was way too salty and buttery and greasy - quite below par for the rest of our meal, which was delicious.  Neither of us could stomach a second bite.The service definitely needed some improvement.  We had a reservation, and yet we still had to wait twenty minutes until someone even came by to get our drink order. When the waiter finally did attend to us, he said &#34;uh, has anyone come to help your guys or taken your drink order yet?  Oh.  I guess I&#39;ll be your waiter tonight.&#34;  The service was slow for the rest of the night, too, which was fine, because who cares when the food is good?  But when the waiter did come by, he was flustered and rushed.  He also didn&#39;t check on us even once after we got our first course, or even once after we got our entrees.  To be fair, when we got our bill, they hadn&#39;t charged us for my single glass of wine, and when I pointed it out, he said &#34;because things were crazy tonight.&#34;  I appreciate it, and I&#39;m glad they were aware of the problem, but I&#39;d rather have paid for my wine and had good service.Also, as yelper Shradha pointed out, they didn&#39;t really have good vegetarian options.  We weren&#39;t vegetarian, but we were scoping out the place for future visits with my parents, who are, and I can be assured that this isn&#39;t a place to bring them.  It&#39;s 2012, and vegetarians usually love Italian food - they should try to have something to accommodate them."

A Tavola might be Chicago&#39;s most boring restaurant. Based on my diet, it is not for me and I would not return. I eat fish but not meat, and that severely limited my options here. What I could eat was, at best, unmemorable and, at worst, completely tasteless. Meat eaters might have an entirely different experience.We started with a very good grilled mushroom appetizer (one of only two appetizers I could eat, the other being a boring preparation of mixed vegetables). I then had very nice, if unremarkable, gnocchi with sage and brown butter (the only pasta on the menu I could eat). My entree was the fish of the day (again, my only choice), an unidentified whitefish served with unseasoned (?!) potatoes and broccoli. This unbelievably unimaginative preparation was high priced hospital food. Easily the most bland dish I have ever had in Chicago and possibly my life. I could not believe how tasteless and boring the dish was, especially for this price. Given that I have eaten every item I can on A Tavola&#39;s menu, there is no reason for me to return.The patio was nice and service was friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t make up for the lame menu. Again, meat eaters may have a completely different take."

We came here after learning that both Girl &amp; The Goat and Au Cheval had 2+ hour waits, and we were starving. Unfortunately, even our hunger could not disguise the quality of the food. :(+ Chocolate Goat Milk - I was really excited for this because I love goat products, but this tasted like chocolate cow milk. I felt very silly paying so much for what basically tastes like normal chocolate milk.+ Crab Dip - The dip wasn&#39;t bad flavor-wise (arguably the best thing we got here) but even though the dish was hot, the dip inside was still cold. It was definitely full of crabmeat and was tasty, but it would&#39;ve been exponentially better if it had been warm. The crackers on the side were basically Ritz crackers - very uniform and buttery. The waitress kindly offered us a second batch of crackers when she noticed that we were low, but the second batch was all super crumbly and fragile; they all broke immediately when we tried to dip them.+ All-American Burger - Their special sauce tastes remarkably like McDonald&#39;s special sauce. The resemblance to a Big Mac flavor-wise was utterly uncanny. It tastes good, but that was really strange ... unless they mean to imply that McDonald&#39;s represents &#34;All-American&#34;?+ Shrimp, Pork Belly, Zucchini and Shrimpy Noodles - Aside from the tender, tasty pork belly, this was unpalatable. I was shocked by this horrible rendition of an Asian-inspired dish (would not have gotten it if it had said that on the menu) - the noodles and veggies were drowning in ginger and soy sauce. The shrimp was overcooked and the veggies were ruined by the overpowering sauce.The crab dip was very filling, which was a good thing because I really could not make myself eat the shrimp/pork belly disaster that I got. I probably should&#39;ve stuck with something goat, so I guess that&#39;s my fault. Service was very slow.On the plus side, there is a Pokemon Gym here; I battled it and raised it several levels while waiting for our food."

We started off with a very stiff greyhound that was helpful in getting the days started.Food is creative and delicious. The shrimp and cheesy grits were very good. BF had the omelette of the day with a mushroom mole and it was very good, if not a little rich. Also had the biscuits and gravy that was excellent.Service was great.

Reservations for Little Goat were available same-day on OpenTable. Our dining experience here was A-OK. Given the hype, I was expecting better.This is a neat, stylish diner with a bakery attached. One thing I think that&#39;s cool about its design is the hidden entrance to the restrooms. The door blends in with the wall like the entrance to some secret lair in a movie. I do like the playfulness about this place from the cartoon graphics on the menu to little touches like actually printing the words &#34;Blue Plate&#34; on the blue plate special plates.We visited for dinner where the menu consisted of American breakfast foods, breads, sandwiches, soups, salads, burgers, dinner entrees, and apps/sides. Desserts included pies, cakes, shakes, and sundaes and drinks included bottled sodas like Cheerwine, spicy ginger ale, and Mexican Coke. They also have a coffee menu. Expect to spend at least $20-25 per person.It&#39;s American food, but I wouldn&#39;t consider it traditional as many of the dishes have creative twists or takes. Here&#39;s what we tried:* Reuben ($13) - smoked corned beef, kimchi, kraut, havarti, special sauce, Spence rye* Korean Burger ($14) - kimchi, bacon, egg, chi mayo, sweet roll* Shrimp &amp; Pork Belly ($21) - summer squash, &#34;shrimpy&#34; noodles* Blue Plate Special ($23) - Alaskan sockeye salmon, corn miso puree, squash, shiitake, pea tips, sun gold cherry chimichurriI love good kimchi and Little Goat&#39;s version is actually decent. However, I&#39;m not sure I liked it in the Reuben. The spicy and sour flavors of the kimchi just didn&#39;t jive with the traditional Reuben for me. The buttered and toasted bread and the quality of the corned beef was good. The sandwich was a little heavy and salty, but overall, not bad in my opinion.The Korean burger was monstrous and a sight to behold (great presentation). It was difficult and messy to eat because of how big the burger was. All of the ingredients were piled on high. I thought the beef patty was delicious and generally, this was a fine burger. Smoky, savory, and satisfying.Since I&#39;m allergic to shrimp, I delicately ate my way around the shrimp and pork belly salad. All of the veggies were fresh. This was a simple, light, and refreshing salad. Definitely healthy. The blue plate special for the night was also fresh and healthy. The sockeye salmon was rich in flavor and the vegetable medley worked well together. On the downside, it wasn&#39;t filling, but at least I know I was eating smart. I&#39;d order it again.Service was excellent. The staff is friendly, attentive, and courteous. Our orders came out in a reasonable amount of time.In the end, I think this place is probably better for breakfast, lunch, or brunch than it is for dinner. Regardless, it&#39;s still probably worth checking out."

Crispy all around and had cheese in it. I&#39;ve never had better hash browns and I don&#39;t think I will ever have better.Goat chili - I hate beans so obviously I am biased when I say I wasn&#39;t impressed, but my boyfriend loves chili and he still wasn&#39;t impressed. I think it was a little too sour. It was topped with lettuce (maybe) and sour cream. The one good thing I have to say about it is that there was a lot of meat in it.Bloody Mary - Ketel one vodka and some type of kimchi infused whatever. This was good, but I&#39;ve had better. The kimchi made this a little more sour than I would have liked and it was not spicy at all.In a Pickle - this was a tequila cocktail. My bf said it just tasted like tequila with a lot of lime.Bulls eye French toast - I hate to be the only one to dog on this, but I did not enjoy this as much as I thought I would. The French toast was soaked in the BBQ maple syrup so it was soggy and the only soggy thing I like is French fries from McDonald&#39;s. The chicken was fried nicely and the egg in the brioche was cooked perfectly.Bi bim bop - cauliflower rice, fancy bacon (what the waitress called it), a fried egg, asome other stuff. I thought this was way too sour. There were bean sprouts, pickled purple cabbage, and mushrooms in it as well. I also didn&#39;t think there was enough bacon in it to say it had bacon in it on the menu.My first two choices were sold out, so... maybe I would have been more impressed with Little Goat if I had gotten that.

We had reservations on a Saturday evening but still had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. This place stays PACKED! Service remained pretty good the entire time though. I insisted we order either a 3rd meal or an appetizer so that I could sample more of the menu. We started with their pork nachos- a HUGE portion of sweet pork and savory toppings. Messy, cheesy, and fantastic. They even traveled home pretty well. I ate the left overs 2 more times before finally giving up and throwing away the rest.For my meal, I got the Bull&#39;s Eye French Toast- fried chicken, french toast, and a hidden egg in the middle. It had strawberries and syrup too. It had so much going on but it all went together SOOOO well. I took some of that home too, but definitely ate all the good parts at the restaurant.I ordered their manhattan for my drink. It was a weird combo with the food, but they definitely make a good, stiff drink!I didn&#39;t find the prices to be too over the top, and to leave with leftovers made me extremely happy!

I love Little Goat so much! I&#39;ve been here for brunch twice, and was here on Sunday for Oktoberfest. The staff is always very sweet and the brunch experience is phenomenal. If you have a bit of a sweet tooth, the OOEY GOOEY CINNABUN is not to be missed! It is absolutely delightful to share (or consume by yourself if you&#39;re really ambitious). Also, you can&#39;t go wrong with the cocktails. The Moscow Goat was delightful. I love brunching outdoors here in the spring, summer, and fall. The staff is always super friendly and that really adds to the entire experience of being at Little Goat.I visited Little Goat for Oktoberfest on Sunday and there was a line to get to the rooftop, but the beer selection was pretty solid and I didn&#39;t mind waiting 30 minutes. I tried the Oktoberfest beer offerings from Revolution (a pilsner), Three Floyds (not sure which beer it was exactly because the Oktoberfest brew from Three Floyds had just arrived and it wasn&#39;t listed on the menu...if one of you was also at Oktoberfest and know the name, you&#39;ll have to tell me which one it was), and Urban Chestnut. I liked the Three Floyds one the best. It&#39;s all a matter of taste, but for $6 per beer, it was good to drink a whole bunch of &#39;em. :)Visit Little Goat if you haven&#39;t already, especially if you&#39;re in the city! I&#39;ll be back to try some of the other amazing dishes on their Diner menu (like the goat burgers and the supper club items). I can&#39;t wait!"

Starving and drenched in sweat from walking multiple blocks in the summer heat, Little Goat caught our eye so we decided to take a chance.I&#39;d heard of its big sister Girl &amp; The Goat (though hadn&#39;t been), but wasn&#39;t too familiar with this place. I also didn&#39;t realize reservations were so hard to come by as we simply walked in and were seated 10 minutes later. Granted, it was late afternoon on a weekday so not exactly a prime hour like brunch.Our booth was comfortable and the decor both modern and casual, yet there was a large glass window in the ceiling of the main dining room that just radiated heat. We felt like we never fully cooled off sitting underneath it, though I bet it&#39;s a cool feature in the wintertime.The first thing I noticed was that they serve breakfast all day, so immediately they get a star for that in my book. I also enjoyed their attention to detail throughout the restaurant. Their cute logo can be found on everything from the menu, to the glasses, to the napkin holders, and even on the plates.Having a separate bakery next door, there was no shortage of treats on the menu as well. Seasonal pies, cake of the day, also sundaes and some devilish sounding shakes. Particularly the horchata milkshake.We had dessert plans for later so we stayed on the savory path. My husband getting the patty melt with goat of course, and myself the grilled cheese with guanciale and smoked tomato. Our lovely waitress told us one order of fries is easily shared and she was correct. They were a bit thin for my taste and reminded me a lot of the ones from In n Out. I would have preferred them to remain in the fryer a few minutes longer too, but at least they were fresh.The sandwiches however were excellent. Crispy yet buttery soft bread, quality ingredients with tons of flavor, and heavenly melted cheese. The only complaint being from my husband who hoped the goat would&#39;ve had a more distinct taste. He said that had he not known, he would have simply thought it was beef.Next time I would love to try a breakfast plate like perhaps the sourdough pancakes, Fat Elvis waffle, crumpets with chorizo maple syrup, or their ooey gooey cinnabun."

My friend and I shared two dishes.Fish Tostadas - crisp whitefish, shallot aioli, chickpeas, onion salad and harissa vinaigretteSO delicious! The tostada and fish were crispy. The chickpeas and salad added great texture and all the flavors were well-balanced. It was a little messy and difficult to eat, but I would definitely order this again.Pork Belly Pancake - scallion pancake, house hoisin, bok choy salad, ginger maple dressingThere was so much salad on top, I couldn&#39;t find the pork belly at first. Definitely a good dish to share. I loved all the Asian flavors.Cold Brew CoffeeI was a little sad when I found out they switched roasters from Stumptown to Dark Matter, but I&#39;m glad Little Goat is supporting a local coffee roaster. The coffee was excellent and not bitter at all.Another solid meal at Little Goat!"

I stumbled across Little Goat Diner, and I just knew I had to come based on the photos and reviews.You have the choice of sitting at the counter, the communal tables, or having your own table. It would have been faster if we we went for one of the first two choices, but we decided to get our own table, and ended up waiting 30-40 minutes. We ended up being seated at a huge booth.There is both the normal menu and the special menu, and the options involve your typical brunch items with a twist, which I really enjoyed. At first, we ordered the Pork Belly Croquette off the special menu and the Corned Beef Hash. Then we thought, why not, and ordered the Bull&#39;s Eye French Toast because everyone seemed to be raving about it.-Pork Belly Croquette: Oh my gosh, this was so delicious. The croquette and the smashed avocado had a really rich flavor and a mushy texture, but it was perfectly balanced out by crunch and acidity of the pickled vegetables on top. There were also two runny eggs that normally I would feel slightly queasy about, but I didn&#39;t even mind them at all! I would totally order this again.-The Corned Beef Hash: Classic dish, but somehow so much better. I don&#39;t know, it was just somehow extra delicious. I think I would&#39;ve like a little more potato to beef balance, but hey, that&#39;s just me.-Bull&#39;s Eye French Toast: Honestly, I was a little confused by this dish. I think it&#39;s just preference, but I usually like my sweet and salty separate. I like the individual elements, but it just didn&#39;t really work for me as a whole. Still a good experience though.Overall I enjoyed myself a lot. The restaurant is beautiful, the servers are friendly, and the food is delicious. What else can you ask for? It definitely is a bit on the pricier side, but well worth it!"

We waited for 30 minutes on a Sunday night for an indoor seating - it is possible to make reservations, although it&#39;s not a long wait. I may have expected too much from the Little Goat, expecting it to be more of a twist on diner food. But I felt like the food I had there was very much like diner food and not much more :( We had the fries with cheese and goat chili ($12) and the &#34;Patty Melt&#34; with the veggie patty ($14). The fries and goat chili were good, but it didn&#39;t blow my mind. Then, the patty melt was so anti-climatic, it was literally a sandwich with a piece of cheese, the veggie burger patty and some onions inside. The veggie burger didn&#39;t taste anything special and the whole &#34;Patty Melt&#34; felt like something I could have slapped together at home in 3 minutes.Our server was really sweet, but the overall food was a disappointment. I have heard though that their brunch is good so maybe I will come back to try that - hopefully that doesn&#39;t disappoint."

If you&#39;re not feeling the vibe, walk over next door to their cafe (you can order the same menu at the bar!) and enjoy the cafe experience.The Loco Moco is delicioussss as are the sandwiches (the Los Drowned!!!) and salads. Easily a 2 meal kind of place, unless you&#39;re overly committed to finishing your plate.Take public transit or Divvy over - parking is kind of a pain."

Way wrong!A lot of people in my party ordered traditional breakfast but the menu is something you have to experience. It&#39;s Asian inspired american breakfast. Consider me floored. I got the Parathas Burrito (indian flatbread . sunny side eggs . avocado-bean salad . chili pepper sauce . sheep&#39;s milk cheddar). Changed my life! It was outside of my comfort zone but I took a chance and was thrilled. It was delicious! Make a point to give this place a try and order something that sounds good that you normally may not eat.

Sadly it&#39;s not on the menu anymore but I got the breakfast bibimbap and it did not disappoint! I loved the cauliflower &#34;rice&#34; which made this healthier. The eggs were perfectly cooked. And I highly recommend asking for the habanero hot sauce. It is very cravable!!It&#39;s hard to get healthy breakfast options that aren&#39;t just omelettes or yogurt, so I really appreciated my dish that was creative, different, and still very healthy!"

I usually come here to grab the oatmeal and a latte to go. The oatmeal definitely stands out as a little different to try (pricey but good). Make sure to ask if they have any oatmeal left (if you get there anytime after 9am) as they tend to run out quick.I also tried their turkey sandwitch to go. Also an interesting concept with tomatoes, jam, and blueberries. Again, something fun to try, but necessarily something I would order on a regular basis."

More along the lines of a beignet, served with gooseberries and maple syrup. So flavorful and delicious. The hash browns were also excellent, and a huge portion for the price.My friend and I both ordered bloody Mary&#39;s, which our server informed me are not vegan by default, but can be made vegan upon request. They were amazing-very spicy and boozy! Great coffee too. The ambience is a bit hectic (they are busy for a reason!) but the quality of the food and service are truly memorable and worth the wait.

It&#39;s more gourmet than your usual greasy spoon diner, and the prices reflect it. Service was friendly, but it felt like our food took forever to come out. As an appetizer, my group ordered the crab dip, which was served with not enough Ritz crackers. The waitress soon offered us more, but really they could have just included more.I ordered the Goat Almighty with a side of the hash browns at the suggestion of our waitress. The Goat Almighty was a hefty goat burger with braised beef and BBQ pulled pork along with jalapenos, cheddar, onion rings, and salsa verde. It&#39;s pricey at $20, but very tasty. The hash browns were shredded and cooked on the griddle with cheese, which should have tasted amazing, but ended up tasting burnt. I didn&#39;t finish them.Not much of a diner, but a decent place to grab a bite."

We were promptly seated at our reservation time on a Sunday. The service was good, although not amazing, which is what I expected at a more casual diner.I had the Almighty Goat burger, which is huge. No, really, it&#39;s humongous. As in you can&#39;t actually eat it like a burger because it won&#39;t fit in your mouth. It&#39;s delicious and will be more than enough to make you bloated, but you&#39;ll have to eat it with a fork and knife.My fiance had the Kimchi goat burger which she loved. I didn&#39;t taste it myself since I was busy with the Almighty Goat burger but she said it was very good.The other 2 at our table had the fish tostadas and Manicotti. Both were good. The fish tostadas was more food than expected. I did have a small taste of the fish and it was quite good.Overall, it&#39;s not as good as Girl and the Goat but that&#39;s to be expected and it&#39;s a good casual diner place that gives generous portions of good food at a reasonable price."

That person isn&#39;t me however, but good to know :) I was torn between the Korean Burger or Shrimp &amp; Pork Belly Noodles based on reviews I read. The server recommended the Korean Burger so that&#39;s what I went with. I avoid ordering anything spicy whenever I can but.... it was my first trip (of many I hope) to Chicago and I rarely eat goat meat... so I was sold.The burger was delicious, a little on the spicy side but I managed. Sometimes it&#39;s worth all the sweat and discomfort! I also ordered the sweet corn elotes on the side. At first I was hesitant because of the cayenne butter but figured I was all in at this point with the spice level. No problems there because I almost ate the whole side dish before I even touched my burger.I managed to save a little room for dessert and was glad I ordered the french silk pie. AMAZING!I also tried the Moscow Goat since it had grapefruit in it. A nice twist on the Moscow Mule."

She&#39;s a Top Chef Winner (Season 4), was announced as Food &amp; Wine magazine&#39;s &#34;Best New Chef&#34; (in 2011), and now runs three successful and highly acclaimed restaurants in Chicago&#39;s West Loop neighborhood. The original, Girl &amp; The Goat, was awarded &#39;Best New Restaurant&#39; by Saveur magazine. And Duck Duck Goat, a Chinese-inspired restaurant has also become a Chicago favorite. **Be sure to make reservations for those places as they book up weeks in advance. Or they also take walk-ins, so feel free to take a chance!If you&#39;re like me, and it&#39;s too late, and you&#39;re in Chicago and you didn&#39;t plan your meals at all then you should definitely pop into Little Goat Diner. The idea behind Little Goat Diner was to allow the growing bakery program from Girl &amp; The Goat to flourish and offer patrons seeking a taste of Izard an easier and more accessible option.We showed up for breakfast, we were in town for Lollapalooza- a popular music festival, and really only had breakfast and lunch to explore Chicago&#39;s food scene since we&#39;d be at the festival during dinnertime. Knowing I didn&#39;t have a shot at Izard&#39;s other restaurants, I happily took the opportunity to head to Little Goat Diner for breakfast.From the moment we showed up I was in love, the layout of the space is just delightful, bright and airy. It&#39;s refreshing to be inside, and the atmosphere puts you in a good mood. The team at Little Goat Diner was so welcoming too, answering all of our questions about what to eat on the menu. And I&#39;m glad we asked, and I&#39;m glad we listened.The menu offers very traditional breakfast items from pancakes to eggs, and also puts a little spin on it by incorporating Izard&#39;s whimsy into the dishes. We started off with some coffee, I opted for the Barista&#39;s Special. It was essentially a S&#39;mores latte, topped with a nice heap of marshmallow fluff. It tasted just like a S&#39;more and was a delicious way to begin the meal.We then were suggested to try the Blueberry Pancakes and were told we were able to order a single pancake. So we had one of those, and then a cinnamon roll. The pancake was served with a crumble on top and a buttermilk butter. The buttermilk butter is as dangerous as it sounds, but you will definitely want to spread it on top.The honest to goodness star of the meal was the &#34;This little piggy went to China&#34;. It starts with a sesame cheddar biscuit, szechuan pork sausage topped with chili garlic, chive sauce and blackberries topped with a sunny egg. It was sweet, spicy, filling, sweet, spicy, delicious! It was all we talked about after we ate there, and now looking at the pictures I am having some withdrawls. This restuarnt is so good!There are a bunch of other delicious breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu items. There&#39;s a full bar, full coffee bar, and not to forget that they serve breakfast all day. It&#39;s a perfect place to begin or end your day, and this will definitely be on my list of places to visit when I come back to Chicago!"

The &#34;szechuan&#34; should&#39;ve given it away for me. The flavor is very similar to spicy wontons.

Wayyyyy too much sesame oil... on EVERYTHING.  That&#39;s all you tasted. The BullsEye was good.  It certainly wasn&#39;t great.  The French toast was a little dry for my liking, and the crispy chicken was crispy cold.  Left half of it on the plate.Service? So-so.  Décor? Nothing striking.  I was ready to knock everything off of the table when we received our damn $60 check. Obviously people like this place--I&#39;m assuming I just went on a bad day."

What a fool! Instead I stopped in here late after dinner one night for desert.It was my own fault really, I was in Chicago for 36 hours &amp; I had a &#39;To Eat List&#39; as long as my arm, with little time to conquer it. I ran around this city like a crazy person; I ate Chicago Dogs, Deep Dish Pizza, Italian Beef... More Deep Dish. To say I felt gross is pretty much an understatement.I eventually made it to Little Goat Diner at around 9pm, I walked here from Cloud Gate on a mission, being a huge fan of Chef Stephanie Izard from her season of Top Chef. What a gorgeous restaurant! High ceilings, clean lines &amp; an open kitchen, it&#39;s simply stunning.At 9pm it was heaving with groups of people. As we made our way to our booth in the back corner, I rubber-necked &amp; marvelled at how delicious all the food looked. It&#39;s such an awful shame I wasn&#39;t hungry.As a result my friend &amp; I ordered sensibly opting for a S&#39;more inspired desert to share &amp; a Blueberry Pie Milkshake with crumbled pieces of pie throughout.What we had was glorious, such beautiful &amp; inspired comfort food. I&#39;ll absolutely be back next time I&#39;m in town to give this place the attention it deserves. This place is one of the best."

Came in for brunch, had a little wait so grabbed coffee next door at little goat bread and was seated shortly after... During this time, the coffee lid had popped off twice spilling really hot coffee so when we sat down I asked for a mug that I could pour my coffee into.  The waiter grabs my cup and walks off with it and reappears several minutes later with two coffee mugs with black coffee (note my friend didn&#39;t order coffee and I really just wanted the full cup of coffee I had just bought in a mug).  He sets the mugs in front of us and walks off.... So several minutes later when he walks by again I ask for milk and sugar and he&#39;s like fine but there&#39;s sugar right in front of you and before I can clarify that I wanted the fake stuff he walked away again.  Came back again several minutes later with the milk and I asked him for the truvia which took another few minutes to grab a couple packets of sugar... Rinse and repeat this several minute long fiasco for a second time with coffee refills, during which time he told me he heard me ask for milk (even though he walked by several times and never bothered to drop it off). Basically I had cold coffee with breakfast with a side of major attitude, and messing with coffee in the morning is like messing with alcohol during happy hour, it&#39;s just not done.  If he hadn&#39;t been so dismissive and a little nicer I probably would have given him a pass since I&#39;ve been on the other side of the counter and understand the breakfast rush, but he seriously put a damper on my Saturday morning.Moving on to the food, had a really good omelette of the day with eggplant and scallions (and I don&#39;t even like  omelettes...) Topped with fried onions that were a surprisingly yummy contrast in texture.  Would have been nice to know that it doesn&#39;t come with anything (i.e. toast) but wasn&#39;t about to wait another 10 min for the waiter to walk by again to order some...Overall, food was good (not surprising as I really like most of Izard&#39;s places), but waiter sucked... Will say the hostesses were nice enough and the reason the stars stayed at 3 and not lower..."

I&#39;ve been to Girl &amp; The Goat twice and while I&#39;ve enjoyed coffee at Little Goat, I haven&#39;t had the chance to physically eat at the diner.This review is mostly for their catering group, and I&#39;d like to imagine their bombtastic food is also served in some shape or form at the diner. I&#39;ve provided pics of each one, so you have a template of what to get in house.Here&#39;s a few of the things they served: turkey sliders, chips with different dipping sauces (pictured is pimento), potato salad (the BEST I&#39;ve had), flatbread and the super amazing tuna tostada type dish!I personally adored how their goat logo is very well represented in their dish cards and what not. The service is outstanding and you can definitely tell Steph&#39;s magic touch in each dish. Now off I go to try Duck Duck Goat at some point and hit the trifecta!"

We got here pretty early, thank goodness we didn&#39;t have to wait.I really liked the look and feel of this &#34;diner&#34;. For some reason, the first thing I noticed was it looked super clean.  There was a photo booth  right next to the entrance and also in the back they had a bar and a little shop. It was pretty cute.We got seated quickly since we were there early. They were able to accommodate a table for 6. All of us ordered from the &#34;Cereal Killers&#34; section of the menu. For some reason, I wanted to order something I usually don&#39;t, something they wouldn&#39;t have in San Diego. And then I saw it staring at me, &#34;The little pig went to China&#34;. I was hesitant to order it since I was hungry and was already thinking if I didn&#39;t like it, I&#39;d end up starving. Luckily my husband offered to share and/or trade food if needed lol.So this section right here is dedicated to the Little Pig Went To China plate. It was definitely different. Not bad, not great, just different. This dish consisted of a sesame cheddar biscuit with Szechuan pork sausage, sunny side up eggs, chili garlic chive sauce poured all over and gooseberries. Definitely didn&#39;t taste like a typical breakfast dish. May possibly be better for lunch. The biscuit was good, the sausage was full of flavor, the sauce wasn&#39;t bad either. I just felt that it all didn&#39;t go together well. The gooseberries were nice and sweet too. Overall the dish has a very strong Asian influence to it. All the flavors were there and were actually good, just not together for me. Would I order it again? Probably not. It&#39;s more of a one time dish for me.My husband ordered the Bulls Eye French Toast. The presentation to this was cute. You got two pieces of sweet onion brioche with the middle caved in each having an egg in it, then covered by some chicken and drenched in a BBQ maple syrup. The dish itself was tasty, however the chicken was somewhat dry.Overall I found this diner interesting. I would love to come back and try other things on their menu. Hope to see you soon Little Goat Diner!"

First of all, as some previous reviews have mentioned, I think &#34;diner&#34; is a bit of a misnomer. Although the interior looks like the traditional American diner, the Little Goat is far from being a local greasy spoon. In terms of price and food, they are clearly aiming for a higher quality market. The place is popular- we had a thirty minute wait for a table after arriving (although this was a lot better than the 3 1/2 hours we were quoted down the road).When we eventually got seated, the three of us ordered burgers, beers, and some fries to share. The food was decent, but not exceptional, and none of us left feeling quite as satisfied as we had hoped. It was also slightly more expensive than I had expected, but as I already suggested, this may just be because I was under the impression it was a typical diner, which it isn&#39;t.Overall, I think the Little Goat Diner is probably worth a visit, as long as you know what to expect. The popularity of the place is very clear, so it&#39;s probably worth everyone visiting to form their own opinion."

Gigantic plate, pickled onion, sliced jalapeño gives it a balanced flavor. Super delish!Pork belly scallion pancake: a tadddd but too salty, but workable, you have to eat everything together. The slaw on top was quite refreshing. I recommend it.Smoked beef and hashed brown: wonderfully flavored hash, goes well with the beef. It was not mind blowing, but a classic.Kimchi goat burger: the patty is super salty! The bread, egg helps a little. But the kimchi is also really salty! Quite a downer."

Yes - quite the bold statement but this place just rocked at everything they did in what is ultimately an upmarket diner but is understandably very busy for a reason - and this burger really was amazing!I just went for the standard American classic so who knows what level the unique ones like the kimchi one delivers at but this was towering over my plate like a skyscraper in downtown and was super packed with lovely salad and pickles, whilst the artisan baked bread roll encasing it was the real star of the show in taste and keeping the awesomeness all together.I&#39;ve never eaten a burger I couldn&#39;t finish (unless it tasted awful...) and I wasn&#39;t going to be beaten here although I think I did go a  bit too heavy on the tasty fries to begin with...be warned - everything is so filling!Overall pure excellence and the whole menu looks fantastic - definitely I&#39;ll be back next time I visit Chi-town!"

Flavorful with maple syrup, strawberries, and cooked well. I wasn&#39;t expecting the Bulls eye to be sunny side up eyes in the actual bread. It was interesting since I usually overlook my eggs.

The eggs were perfectly cooked, and the vinegar sauce that&#39;s swimming around the bowl is so dope. Oh! And the blackberries are a nice touch...not only are they a pretty garnish, but they&#39;re delicious and add a little bit of a tangy twist to the dish.My hubby ordered the French toast with fried chicken.

We had a late Friday bunch reservation with the place still buzzing full of happy customers. Our waitress, Joan, reminded me so much of Anna Kendrick; her smile lit up her whole face. She mentioned people have told her she resembles Julianne Moore. She stopped by our table at the right times asking if we needed anything else and made sure our glasses were full.Big portions! Prices aren&#39;t bad either. Tempura mashed potatoes! By golly this was my favorite thing to eat here and it&#39;s a side dish! Crunchy fried exterior and those clumpy potatoes resembling a mashed banana texture ... accompanied by an Asian slaw underneath. Two long slabs of sweet fat Elvis waffles, nice and crisp except for the parts smothered in maple syrup, crumbled bacon pieces, whipped peanut butter made the dish! Nothing can beat fresh banana slices on waffles. Only $13. I tried a bite of the Went to China: biscuit topped with chorizo, a fried egg, and blackberry sauce-- the flavor mix was spot on. Omelette of the day was Spring Thing with lots of spinach, crisp French onions on top. Didn&#39;t get to try any but my friend left the plate clean.So many restaurants with &#34;goat&#34; in their names in this area! I&#39;d definitely recommend this place to newcomers. Staff is friendly, portions are bigger than expected, and it&#39;s a good way to become immersed in Chicago culture by people watching.If I return one day, I&#39;ll get their notable bullseye French toast with strawberries &amp; fried chicken pieces.

I want to go back and try more things, but I don&#39;t know that I can not order this when it&#39;s right freaking there.The fiance got shrimp and grits, which I didn&#39;t try, but which promptly disappeared. Must&#39;ve been good.When it came time to order dessert, I couldn&#39;t help myself. I ordered the cheez-its and strawberry sundae concoction, while I wondered who in their right mind would order such a thing. Another solid decision.A guy sitting across from us ordered a burger that was no joke, 7 inches tall. And he ate the whole damn thing.Make a reservation. Or don&#39;t. But get the hell over here and eat. And if you don&#39;t make a reservation, then don&#39;t bitch about waiting. The place is good. It&#39;s popular. You know this. Don&#39;t be an idiot."

I came here for breakfast. However, you don&#39;t have to come during breakfast to try their breakfast food. They serve breakfast all day. So wake up late and wander in at around 3 PM to eat their breakfast.They have some creative dishes for their breakfast. One of the ones that intrigued me was the &#34;This Little Piggy Went to China.&#34; It&#39;s basically a biscuit, eggs, and sausage with Sichuan flavoring.I tried it and it was great. I loved the chili garlic chive sauce. It was nice and spicy. The biscuit, eggs, and sausages were done well too.The Fat Elvis Waffles is a great option if you want something more traditional. The bacon maple syrup was decadent and good. How can you go wrong with bacon and maple syrup?For lunch, I tried their Reuben. I liked it with the kimchi. Being Korean, I love adding kimchi to salty meats like Corned Beef. I think it&#39;s better than using sauerkraut. The bread and meat were excellent as well.The Chickpea salad was good. It was a salad. But it looked like they added some falafels in it, along with fresh chickpeas. I thought that was a nice touch. I don&#39;t know if they were falafels, but it looked and tasted like one. And they are made with chickpeas, so why not?Overall, this is a solid diner in Chicago. If you want some great breakfast food, try this place."

Man, that place had a huge line forming before it was even open, but no surprise, so did this place! Lucky i was by myself this trip and got seating right at the bar! The service here was great and i was greeted promptly, recommended the little goat coffee drink (their own hand made salted caramel with goats milk latte. SUPER DELISH) and told personal favorites on the menu. I decided to get the shrimp and grits with poached egg and a fresh biscuit on the side. The first bite was amazing! but sadly as i kept eating it, i just felt like something was missing. salt? more pepper maybe? i don&#39;t know, but just something was missing. maybe more cheese on the grits, but i just can&#39;t give it more than the three stars for this place, especially once the bill came out and i found that the eggs were extra. Now that biscuit was superb. so i&#39;ll give em that, definitely come by and grab a baked good and some coffee and you&#39;ll be happy. but as for the food my personal opinion is its just okay. Try for yourself!happy eating :D"

The environment is loud but vibrant ... It bustles with excitement.  The food is global twists on classics and definitely made well with some serious speed.  It helps to have the same attention warmth to the service we saw at the girl and the goat.So we ordered 2 sides and 2 main ... Not realizing the mains can feed a super hungry person or realistically 2 people!! So be warned ... Come with an appetite or with a lot of mouths!  Yes tuna melt looked like a salad at first ... It&#39;s like 2 meals in one.  A full sized salad AND the sandwich.  I was impressed with the the sandwich as it was perfectly crunchy from being nicely toasted and the filling was excellent.  Lots of tuna, very creamy and healthy dose of lemon to cut through the mayo.  The cheese added another tasty component to it.  My goato goato salad was meal sized with plentiful amount of shrimp and a great variety of vegetables.  Definitely one of the better salads I&#39;ve had in Chicago.The sides nearly stole the night... The tempura mash potato was so well done.  Creamy starchy interior was perfectly battered and fried to a greaseless crunch that was still crispy 10 minutes later.  Is it indulgent yes but whoever came up with this idea ... I love you.  The fish sauce pea greens was a nice Vietnamese influenced dish.  I really liked the sweet and pungent savory fish notes to the crunchy greens.Our ending to the night was a great lemon curd tart that coverted a lemon hater.  A thick buttery graham tart shell contained a creamy bright lemon curd that was lightly covered with a blueberry sauce.  Loved this!!Lastly the service was phenomenal ... Water was always refilled the moment it got to half.  A friendly passing of the staff to make sure everything was good happened throughout the night but it never felt intrusive.  Just a gentle pulse to make sure everything was perfect.  I do admit the speed of service was incredibly fast.  I think we got the tuna melt I under 5 minutes.I&#39;ll definitely return!"

So we headed down the street and saw that Little Goat had some tables available. Waitress was lackluster on service. Didn&#39;t really seem enthusiastic about the menu offerings or what we wanted to drink. On to the food:- Breakfast spaghetti &#39;n clams &#39;n crab: I don&#39;t get this dish. It&#39;s like an egg omelet...with pan-fried noodles and 3 clams...sitting in a salty clear broth. I did not see or taste any crab. Highly disappointed in this dish.- Pork Belly Pancake: this was a very tasty dish. The scallion pancake was very similar to the Beijing style ones and the pork belly was tender and well seasoned (albeit skimpy in portion). The cabbage slaw on top was a nice crunch factor to tie everything together.- Smoked fries: not worth the $6. Thin fries that were room temperature, nothing special, McDonald&#39;s trump these any day.- Patty Melt: this was pretty good- the caramelized onions, pickles and gooey cheese all made it a messy tasty sandwich. But again, nothing special that will make me crave it and come back.- Backyard BBQ cocktail- did not taste any alcohol and the flavors just did not work for me.Overall, I have tried their brunch and now I&#39;ve tried their dinner and it&#39;s just not that special for me to come back. Chicago has so many other places that would blow this place away."

We got goat burgers, lamb ribs, and a very yummy and creamy crab dip with ritz crackers.The ambiance was awesome. It was a bit dim with glass ceiling which made it intimate it enough, yet it was loud as a typical diner lol. So, I enjoyed the &#34;QT&#34; with the boyfriend here.He liked his goat burger, however, said that there was nothing special about it and the burger was a bit salty. I had the lamb ribs and it was good. It fell right off the bone as I was hoping for. I am not too big on lamb (they didn&#39;t have the duck I wanted anymore!), but the vegetables and strawberries served with this dish married the flavors altogether very well.Service was great and it ran so smooth! Our waitress was very sweet and hip. She knew the menu very well and helped us make our decisions on food.Although tempted, we did not try the dessert of the day, &#34;Cheez It,&#34; but everything on their menu looks and sounded great!

From the beginning, this place is great: the interior is classy, but the menu is almost childlike (in a good way) with the little cartoons. Our waitress was friendly and took great care of us.My bullseye French toast was incredible. The sweet syrup and strawberries somehow worked perfectly with the more heavy components of egg and chicken. However, my friend ordered this little piggy went to China, and I think I actually preferred her food-talk about bursting with flavor.Also ordered hash browns for the table. Weren&#39;t my favorite ever, but definitely good-they were stringier than most, but packed on the bottom which still gave them good crunch.This place definitely leaves me wanting to head over to girl and the goat and give it a shot.

Their bakery also looks adorable and sells sandwiches (good for on the go and throwing down less $$)Warning: this place gets LOUD and is not a good place to bring your grandparents visiting from Canada. This is not an intimate environment;I&#39;ve had times where I couldnt hear myself speak.If Im ordering an entree Il go for the spring shrimp and pork belly or the fried chicken with a biscuit (their housemade hot sauces are great.) Great place to order a lot of different items and share.Over all highly recommend if youre looking for a &#39;west loop dining experience&#39; without breaking the bank, setting reservations months in advance, or waiting forever to be seated."

After hearing that the owner of Girl and the Goat had this sister restaurant, I knew we had to come here for breakfast! Overall, all of the dishes had really rich flavors and we left satisfied.- Los Drowned Sandwich (My favorite!!): extremely tender and juicy braised beef with so many different levels of flavor and depth in every bite. Possibly one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I&#39;ll be telling everyone about this and coming back just to eat this amazingness again.- Goat Chili: Hearty chili, a little salty for my taste, but I think it probably would have been good with a piece of bread or crackers to balance out the salt.- Hashbrowns: not your typical soft on the inside crisp on the outside diner hashbrowns. These come out crisp all around and seemed so light that we kept reaching for more.- Bulls Eye French Toast: a mix of sweet and savory. If the sweetness level was toned down a notch or two, this probably would have blown me away.- Breakfast Spaghetti: This dish was definitely different from anything I&#39;ve tasted before. The flavors hit you from your first bite. - very rich"

The server was also very friendly, and she didn&#39;t seem to mind or give us any grief. We only went to help fill up a friend with some carbs so the morning after wasn&#39;t going to be so rough. Therefore, we got the biscuit and gravy, garlic bread, and mac and cheese.My favorite item out of the three would have to be the garlic bread (which wasn&#39;t very garlic-y) because of that tomato puree they have for it. Oh my goodness, it was so good! I wasn&#39;t even that hungry but I wanted to eat more of the garlic bread because of that puree.The mac and cheese seemed average...very back-to-basics. The biscuit and gravy were good but I don&#39;t think it was anything spectacular, however my friend was very happy with both of the items.I&#39;d want to come back to try the other things though."

Also, the host/ hostess doesn&#39;t always provide a drink / cocktail menu so make sure you ask for it!Food. I ordered the duck breast. It was melt in your mouth delicious! Not too heavy or overly fatty either. I cleaned my plate. Dessert. I went with the lemon pie tart. It hit the spot. Not too sweet, a little tart but definitely a great lemon dessert.

My friends and I came here after a long day of work on a Monday and it was still packed. We originally tried to go to Goat on the Grill (same owner), but of course there was a 2 hour wait on a Monday night at 8 pm... So we headed over here to get some diner food. I was of course skeptical because there was no way diner food would live up to the insane amount of hype I was hearing from my friends. But man, this place is fantastic. Awe-inspiring. Think food buds exploding into a symphony in your mouth. Best yet, the drinks are fantastic and so is the coffee.We ordered some smoked fries and nachos to start. Skip the fries, the nachos are humongous and taste so good. My friends got a bunch of other sandwiches, but the best by far was the Asian pork belly sandwich and this ridiculous Goat almighty burger.

That one experience was not the typical patron&#39;s experience, as it was for a private event held upstairs. I was not responsible for the arrangements, so I can&#39;t even speak to whether this restaurant creates these menus for each event or what. I don&#39;t see any of the dishes I enjoyed in the pictures or the current menu. But... y&#39;all. It&#39;s so worth it to call and ask.When I lived in Chicago, I frequented G&amp;tG as much as possible. Big fan who only got bigger after every visit. During a recent visit to Chicago, I was especially excited to have been invited to a private event held at this location. Let me describe some of the highlights so you can all be jealous:The assortment of fresh baked breads, including an olive loaf and a parmesan crisp. These paired perfectly with the sriracha butter and the goat liver mousse. Other starter dishes included a PHENOMENAL tuna poke. I tried to restrict myself to one piece of bread, but... well. I couldn&#39;t.A sea scallop served with a blueberry nuoc cham and all these other bits of delicious goodness. My dining companions and I all looked at each other after finishing the actual scallop and we lifted the bowls to our mouths and drank that sauce. Yes we did.at this point of this chef tasting menu, I was so very thankful that I had had the foresight to wear stretchy clothes. THANK YOU MAXI DRESS.A perfectly cooked salmon served family style (with a szechuan chile sauce, veggies, and a yogurt sauce) was divine. Had a crisp layer at the top but was perfectly flaky and tender inside. Bowls of a green curry roasted pork shank. I don&#39;t know where a shank comes from, but these were some big ol meaty bones that melted in my mouth. At no point was a knife needed. (There was def some parsley or cilantro in this dish, and I hate them both. But it was so good, I didn&#39;t care. I went back for seconds and thirds).We were treated to a shared plate of vanilla malt gelato, served with crunchy caramel popcorn and chocolate magic shell. Individual tiny mason jars of gelee with blueberries, topped with sour cream whip and crunchy meringue. These two desserts were a contrast in sweet and rich vs light and refreshing.TL;DR: I had an atypical experience and food at this restaurant due to special event. Each dish blew my mind in the complex flavor combinations that left me wanting more. Service was friendly, non-intrusive, and impeccable. GO GET YOU SOME GOAT.pro tip: upstairs dining room/event room has a GORGEOUS rooftop."

WIN!Next door and connects is Little Goat Bakery and coffee bar. We grabbed some lattes and a couple open stools and drank and chatted for a few. There is some outside seating too.We were seated in about 45 min even though they said an hour. Ordered onion rings and fried pickles before. The best pickles I&#39;ve ever had. They onion rings tasted like they were marinated in mustard before breaded and fried &amp; it was great.I definitely wanted something with goat. Order the sloppy goat like a sloppy joe with rosemary slaw. Yep! This was delish!!!!!!! Didn&#39;t want it to end. Only comes with the sandwich but with the coffee and onion rings/pickles before it was plenty.They don&#39;t have same day reservations but you can make them before. If you don&#39;t want to wait like we did, do that."

The place was bustling. We checked in around 11:30 and the host said there was a 45 minute wait. The good news is they do have a texting system that will text you when your table is ready. Also the bakery/bar/cafe is next door if you want to grab a quick drink while you wait which is what we did. The wife had a Bloody Mary and I had a coffee and piece of the white chocolate Rosemary bread which was amazing. After waiting about 35 minutes we were seated in a nice cozy table for two in the center of the restaurant. They definitely designed this place for maximizing space and efficiency. The interior has a nice contemporary design. Love the skylight in the center of the place which allows a ton of natural light.On to the meal. We ordered the little trip to China and brioche French toast. The French toast was unique in that the center was medium cooked egg topped off with strawberries and fried chicken. Utterly delicious.Everyone should check this place out!

If I&#39;m eating somewhere that I&#39;m going to pay $50 for breakfast, regardless of what part of the city the restaurant is in or who the chef/owner is, it better be pretty damn good.Unfortunately, I just didn&#39;t feel that way. I ordered the &#34;This Little Pig Went to China.&#34; I thought certain elements of the meal were really good, and others weren&#39;t. I was disappointed. We ended up stopping next door at the bakery where I got a Mexican chocolate scone, which was very good, to erase the food memory.I will say the service was very friendly and answered all of my wife&#39;s questions."

I would describe the Little Goat as a diner with a modern twist and playful creations on diner food. Several dishes caught my eye such as the Bahn Mi Burger and the Fish Tostadas, but having to narrow it down to one I went for the Pork Belly Pancake sammich. Basically a large scallion pancake a slice of tender pork belly with hoisin sauce and topped with a bok choi salad. Rather than eat it like a sandwich / wrap, I went knife and fork on it down to the last bite. Super tasty! My only gripe was that only half the pancake was topped with that super tender and delicious pork belly :(I also got a chance to try a bite of the Not Chinese Broccoli and the Fried Chicken. The Not Chinese Broccoli reminded me of like a really mild szechuan vegetable dish, super light and delicious. The Fried Chicken also had some asian fusion going on as the breading did remind me of chicken tonkatsu. Super delicious as well!&#39;Til next time, cheers!"

We couldn&#39;t get into Girl and the Goat, so we were happy to secure reservations at the next best thing. It was loud, it was fun, it was great! It is not romantic or quiet. The food is heavy, although I was pleased with the Goat&#39;o Goat&#39;o salad. We had a blast, but I do think it&#39;s better suited for lunch or brunch. Great location, though, and excellent service."

I myself have come here twice already, once for breakfast and lunch, and definitely plan on visiting many more times. Part of this is because the wait staff is amazing, the food is quick to get out, and the ambiance of the restaurant is fun and well lit.When I came here for breakfast on Saturday, I had to wait about an hour to be seated. There was a similar wait when I came for lunch if I had wanted to get a table or booth seat. However, I skipped the wait by opting to sit at the bar. However, this isn&#39;t really possible if you come with more than one or two friends as usually there isn&#39;t enough space.Breakfast - I&#39;m the type of guy who loves quantity when it comes to breakfast food because it&#39;s hard to mess up breakfast food and it&#39;s also hard to make it much better. I also like when the meal comes with sides so that you could match sweet and salty. So initially I was disappointed to see that menu is all à la carte. In addition the menu had few of the classic breakfast dishes that you would find at a place like IHOP. A lot of the dishes had Asian aspects and although I&#39;m Asian and have grown up mixing American and Korean food, most of the menu did not appeal to me. Part of this is because I love classic breakfast dishes. So I ended up ordering Corned Beef and Hash since that was something I knew I wouldn&#39;t hate, but I was instantly filled with regret because I don&#39;t really enjoy it that much either. In fact I had the same meal at Wildberry, a place that I really like, and didn&#39;t enjoy it because it was so plain. Yet, I can honestly say Little Goat&#39;s Corned Beef and Hash blew me away. It was sooooo good. There was a lot of juicy meat and the hash was crispy on the outside, which I love. I was full from just this one dish so it was okay that it didn&#39;t come with any sides. However, I also ordered the Bull&#39;s Eye French Toast because it was something sweet and people raved about it on Yelp. It was weird, did not satisfy my desire for something sweet as it mixed sweet and savory a little too much, and is something that I won&#39;t be getting again.Lunch - Ah... I regret that I did not order a sandwich. The sandwiches here are amazing and delicious (I tried my friends&#39; orders). Instead I got the Springy Shrimp &amp; Pork Belly. It was an Asian inspired dish that was not filling and overall mediocre. In general, when it comes to the lunch items I&#39;m just sticking to the burgers and sandwiches. So even though I did not enjoy my lunch, the reason why I am giving this place 5 stars is because the other dishes are that great."

Great atmosphere, never has the wait like Girl &amp; the Goat, and has a menu that is filled with straight comfort food.I had the biscuits and gravy and Bullseye french toast. The biscuits and gravy was exactly what I needed that Tuesday night at 11pm. My mama never made me biscuits and gravy as a kid, and now I&#39;m pissed she didn&#39;t. The only thing I would say is that the biscuits were slightly drier than expected.Now for the Bullseye french toast. The description is &#34;eggs, crispy chicken, sweet onion brioche, bbq maple syrup&#34;. I couldn&#39;t even imagine what that would taste like. It just doesn&#39;t make sense. But, once I combined all those flavors in single bites I was enlightened. So strange, but soooooo good. And wait for that hidden egg IN the french toast. Next level.When I&#39;ve had a long day or when I need to eat and let the worries of life fade away in dreams of Bullseye french toast or when I just feel like it, find me at Little Goat."

I have been traveling to Chicago on business for the past couple of months and have eaten here twice. Each time I got the tasting menu and had two very different meals that I loved!The first time I came with two other people and we enjoyed &#34;the gilda&#34; (skewer of olives, anchovy, and peppers), croquettes, oysters, duck empanadas, grilled octopus, and chorizo stuffed quail. The chef even treated us to the ribeye, which was sliced for sharing and just unbelievable!! We also ordered the paella which was WAY over the top and we all kind of hated ourselves afterwards because we were so full. We finished with churros and flan. I hate flan and this one was so good with a blood orange gelee on top!This past time I came with a friend and we got to try &#34;the gilda&#34; (skewer of olives, anchovy, and peppers), croquettes, duck wings (my fav this time - AMAZING), hamachi crudo (my friend&#39;s fav), oysters, brussel sprouts, grilled octopus, pork belly, churros and the flan again.Finally, the cocktails are amazing - but be careful, they are strong! I had the autumn sangria last time I was here and it was delicious, and the old fashioned is legit.The one thing I would say is that they start you with bread and olive oil but don&#39;t leave it on the table. There are lots of yummy sauces to sop up (half the fun of tapas) so I wish they would ask if you wanted more bread throughout the meal.They are flexible on the tasting too - if there are one or two things you want to try off the menu, they will work them in to the meal. The staff is so great. I hope I get to come back before my Chicago trips are over!"

Let&#39;s start with the fact that we were driving and running late, maybe 15 minutes at most where most restaurants give you a grace period anyway. I was nice enough to call and the lady on the phone, who was also pleasant told me that they would have to give away my table and that I could have a bar high top when I came in. I was a little annoyed but then again, what was I going to argue with her on a Saturday night. We walked by Avec which was packed and into Salero, which was half empty at 7pm on a Saturday night. I seriously, should have just walked back to Avec where we always had an awesome experience. But anyways, I love spanish food and decided to try Salero.The hostess told us we could have our original table, because clearly the restaurant was half full. We sat down and our server came up to. She seemed cold from the start and annoyed for whatever reason. It didn&#39;t make me happy since we were there for our date night. I asked her if we could start up with a few appetizers so I can get a feel for the food before I order my entrees. I mean that&#39;s normal right. If I love the appetizers, of course I would go ahead and order a few entrees as well. She gave me a dirty look.Nonetheless, we tried quite a few things. We started with the duck empanadas which were super tiny for the price. The dough was delicious but the filling was extremely salty. Our server walks by and asks us how they were and I said they were okay. Was I going to lie to her and tell her they are fantastic? No. But I didn&#39;t want to be rude either and say how salty they were so the respectful answer was okay. She gives me an even dirtier look then in a condescending tone says &#34;JUST OKAY?&#34; Wow, way to put someone on the spot. I wanted to get up there and just leave. I don&#39;t remember being treated like that in a nice establishment for quite some time.We also ordered the croquettes which although small, were very tasty. We got the jamon iberico which we also liked. We got the sausage stuffed quail which I can&#39;t say I loved, it was a little chewy and again, salty to me. They do give you nice complimentary bread, just a piece though, which was tasty. I wanted to order the paella for my entree since overall, the food didn&#39;t wow me but it wasn&#39;t horrible, but our server just really gave us a negative vibe and I can&#39;t say I wanted to waste another $50 on an entree that I would have also thought was just okay so we decided to pass. I did want to try their churros with chocolate which were also very  good, as the churros just fall apart and melt in your mouth. So kudos to them on nailing that. Wish they came with a dark chocolate dipping sauce but that&#39;s okay as well.Overall, Salero did not impress. I don&#39;t like restaurants that pretend and act like they are all that and a bag of chips, when they really are not. Your food and service should stand out by itself and you should also respect peoples opinions and if you don&#39;t want to hear them, then don&#39;t ask. Salero, I doubt that I will be back even though you do have a nice, intimate date like atmosphere."

The watermelon added a refreshing kick. The octopus was fresh and grilled perfectly and the croquetas had a great crunch with creamy hazelnut romesco sauce!We then both had sea bass a la plancha for our dinner, which came with a fresh summer squash and more delicious crunchy croquettes.Get the churros and chocolate for dessert!

Going into the experience, I knew that there wasn&#39;t a ton of vegetarian options on the menu, however with the ratings of this place, I figured the vegetarian options would still be great! To start off with, we were served some bread. Nothing too special about it, but it was a bit stale. Didn&#39;t complain and was actually too hungry to really care, so I ate it anyway. To start off with, I got the Artichoke hearts, which were very delicious! It was a bit lemony and light. We thoroughly enjoyed this dish and was scraping off every last bit of the remaining sauce. I also got the little gem salad (without the anchovy). I thought this salad was pretty standard - nothing too special about it. I actually thought it was slightly dry and could have used a touch more of the salad dressing. Very unimpressed by it, especially for the price of it.For the main course, I got Confit potatoes a la plancha. The presentation of this dish was great and made me excited to try it. I was very disappointed to say the least. The peas tasted undercooked and overall was a relatively bland dish. Some of the vegetables in the dish weren&#39;t even properly cooked  (see picture). To end the meal, we figured we should try some dessert. We again had to ask for the dessert menu twice. After asking the first time, I saw the waitress go stand in the corner watching the tables. I was definitely confused cause it was as if she didn&#39;t hear us. We waived to get her to come over about 10 minutes later to ask again. I got the chocolate cake. This was good, but I have had better!To end the meal, I know this isn&#39;t anyone&#39;s fault in particular, however the credit card machine was down. The waitress handed my boyfriend a sheet of paper, where she wrote down his entire credit card number and all his information. We left feeling very uneasy about it."

Here are some things about my meal at Salero that could be easily improved:The bread was stale (note: only our first rolls were stale. The second ones came straight out of the oven. Maybe a better serving system could keep them tasting fresh?)The olive oil was doled out in such petite portions that four of us at a table couldn&#39;t each get a spoonful for our bread. When we asked for more, the same drizzle-sized serving was given. I realize it&#39;s probably a high-quality product, but it wasn&#39;t enough for four people to enjoy.Speaking of our table of four, it seems a little silly to me that they would militaristically stick to three shrimps I stead of just giving us four for ease. Same with the sweetbreads. Giving us three of everything felt like a disregard for our dining experience. Again, I know it&#39;s a high-quality product, but price it for four and we will gladly pay it.Great cocktails. Nothing but praise for those.All in all, Salero has a few changes they could make to keep us coming back, but whether they make those tweaks is up to them."

The peppers are stuffed with oxtail and arrive basting in a flavorful sherry broth. It also comes with a couple of pieces of crisp bread. I&#39;m unfamiliar with oxtail in general, but I do feel that the meat was on the fatty side, still delicious but a little too fatty for my liking.I had scanned the drink menu before dinner and went with the Spanish gin and tonic #2. It&#39;s the perfect blend of lemongrass and basil, a very good drink for gin fans!For my main entree I tried the Confit Potatoes a la Plancha. Can&#39;t stress enough how fantastic this dish is! I believe the potato is fried, and arrives cut into a cube shape with the sunny egg sitting on top, with mushrooms, broccoli and the tetilla cheese around it. The mushroom glaze is amazing!For dessert we tried the churro, which was light. A couple of friends mentioned they thought it was a little on the salty side, I didn&#39;t mind. It comes with a coffee pudding for dipping.Overall the staff was very attentive and the food was amazing!"

The flan was magical.  Enough said! Otherwise, the duck empanada, the grilled octopus, the pork belly (although I&#39;m kinda done with pork belly), patas bravas (this could have been improved - sorry, we&#39;re all spoiled with Ibecio&#39;s patatas bravas!, crudo, uni and a special were all very good.  If looking for an elevated tapas experience give Salero a try.  The space is nice, and the service was very good too.  Including a bottle of wine, tax, tip it was about $95/pp. A bit on the high end though."

To be in the spirit of a Spanish dining experience I had the spiked apple cider, white rioja, pear shrub, lemon and baked apple bitters.  This glass filled me up with winter, warmth and delight!We started with the marinated olives and grilled shishito peppers.  A word of caution...the olives are not really dinner friendly items.  Almost something  you shouldn&#39;t eat in public.  With the hurdle of elegantly removing the pit from your mouth to the empty bowl at the table I was surprised they were not already pitted.  The shishito peppers had a bit of heat and were the perfect char flavor.For my second course I had the grilled baby octopus in a chile sauce with olive oil poached potatoes and herb aioli.  I also tried the endive salad with roasted beets and garrotxa cheese.  The octopus was cooked perfectly with right amount of char and texture was just right.The main entrée I had the grilled atlantic swordfish.  I was greatly satisfied with my selection.  The fish was cooked perfectly and each bite felt very meaty.I finished off the meal with a bit of disappointment.  After great excitement to have churros I was very unhappy that the fried dough tasted just like that, fried dough.  You could taste the grease and heaviness was abundant.  I couldn&#39;t bare to have more than a few bites.  Which if you know me, I never miss an opportunity to have any variation of a doughnut!Overall great spot, with ciders on tap as well as  a great cocktail and wine list this is a spot to check out."

It&#39;s intimate, but not dark. Bigger and brighter than I expected. A lot of bar seating. Tables are close together but not right on top of each other. Unlike many restaurants, I was not able to hear every word of the conversations around us.Restaurant Week menu was delicious, filling, and a great value for $44!TAPASJamon and manchego croquettes--very good as an appetizer/snack! They&#39;re delicious but no heavy.Marcona almonds--I know they&#39;re just almonds, but they&#39;re fried with sea salt so they&#39;re flavorful, but not overly salty. Only thing that was bummer is that they aren&#39;t warm at all, but that was really just my assumption that they would be.RACIONESGrilled baby octopus--very good flavors, loved the spice.Jamon serrano--we love a good charcuterie and cheese board and the way this dish is plated is like dish version of that (meaning that you&#39;re eating it with a fork and knife rather than as separate pieces). The quince paste was on the sweeter side so just had a little bit, but I am also not a huge fan of sugar.PLATOS PRINCIPALESAtlantic swordfish--perfectly grilled. Large portion. Really liked the flavor from the chermoula marinade.Pork loin--my husband was a big fan of his dish. It was also a large portion, but he clean plate clubbed it so I think that speaks for itself.POSTRESChurros--fried decadence. They literally melted in your mouth. I only had 2-3 bites because of my whole not big on desserts thing, but these were great. My husband also enjoyed the various chocolate additions to the dish.Flan--I love flan and this one did not disappoint. It had a thin top layer of orange gelatin that added a nice extra flavor.Desserts were also large portions and I did not finish mine. Service was very friendly and attentive, but not overbearing. We skipped drinks because neither of us was in the mood for a Wednesday night cocktail.We really enjoyed everything about Salero, especially our meal. I&#39;ve wanted to try it since it opened and am glad we finally took advantage of Restaurant Week to do so. Definitely looking forward to returning and having some of what we had (the croquettes!) and trying a few new dishes as well. (And some Spanish wines!) I think Salero is a perfect spot for a date or girls dinner."

Salero offers a combination of Spanish entrees and small plates.The menu here is unique and you&#39;ll find things like duck wrapped in quail and venison. My personal favorite was the hanger steak. Amazing. But all of the food is delicious and presented beautifully- but be warned, it does come with a higher price tag."

First, the wait staff was excellent-very professional, courteous and provided just the right amount of attention and advice.  We started with sharing three appetizers, octopus, stuffed quail and artichokes. We all had the Maine lobster paellas-that can be shared- very generous portion of lobster, shrimp and mussels.  Save room for dessert-the churros comes with three, so definitely also a great size to share!"

Outside about 4, 4 tops with 2 occupied, about 6, 2 tops with no-one sitting in them. (I came at a non-peak time)  I am told &#34;I&#39;m sorry outside is for full dining only, you can sit at the bar&#34;.  I HATE that comment &#34;you can sit at the bar&#34;.  Yes I am alone but I guarantee you I will more than likely be shelling out enough $ that I should deserve a table.  I then said &#34;so a couple of glasses of wine and some aps is not considered full dining for 1 person&#34;?  &#34;No I&#39;m sorry&#34;.  Seriously????  I get it is a Sat. BUT there are more tables open outside then at the bar.  It&#39;s too bad that Salero is following many other Randolph St. eateries that are so into the hype that they forget about their neighborhood, loyal patrons.  At best I would have been there for 30-45 mins. but instead you would rather not take my $ and watch empty tables.  I have personally dined her on at least 5 occasions and introduced numerous friends and acquaintances to your restaurant as I love Spanish cuisine and more specifically Catalonian cuisine.BIG fail and HUGE let down.  If they had a -rating I would give you that."

We did the Menu del Dia, which was an amazing deal and everything was really good. I appreciated that our server asked if there was anything we wanted or didn&#39;t want and they accommodated. Also, our service was totally fine; if anything, we were getting things a little fast because my date was eating slowly. Tip: As something of an octopus connoisseur, theirs was awesome. This place should be a lot harder to get a reservation at than it is, but they are apparently going to be on Check Please soon so maybe that will change."

It was definitely nice, but also pretty casual.Appetizer:We shared the octopus. It was very sweet of them to just split it into 2 plates for us so it was very easy and clean to share. I wasn&#39;t thrilled about the food itself as it I found it pretty lacking in flavor.Entree:- Pork Collar - it was a very tender and well roasted piece of pork indeed. Not a fan of the dead looking vegetables on the side.- Lamb shoulder - same thing. The actual chunk of meat was cooked to perfection. The lentils that came with it? I think not.Normally I think the side things a main dish is served with should bring out the best of the dish, but here somehow they achieved the opposite effect?Dessert:Olive oil cake! It was decent, nice and spongy and not too sweet, topped with some cream and rasberries for a contrast in flavor. Didn&#39;t blow my mind though.At the end we each had a drink, shared the appetizer, each had an entree, then shared a dessert. Nothing was spectacular. The bill came out to be $120 before tip. I&#39;m all about shelling out for food, but at that price I can have a lot more bang for my buck elsewhere."

We started with the gazpacho, a refreshing tomato soup with just the right accents, perfectly accompanied by their piping hot rolls and a delicious evoo. Next we shared their Serano ham and burrata, very atypically garnished with mesclun and piquant herbs. Finally, we forgoed the traditional fare for a special twenty ounce rib-eye fit enough for three with an almost cured texture perfectly seared and seasoned that capped the evening. A highlight."

The octopus was a favorite with a nice char over a delicious salad. The sepia was out of my taste zone but others loved it. The shrimp with heads was also quite good. We split the Lubina, which was perfectly cooked but had that taste of spices that kept throwing me throughout the meal.The deserts really shined. The flan with blood orange was outstanding and the churro were light as air.Drew did a great job of explaining our meal and made good suggestions.

I&#39;m drooling just remembering it (I shouldn&#39;t be typing reviews just before lunchtime...)The other dishes I managed a taste of were the serrano, the scallops, and the tripe.For my maincourse, I had the whole lobster over rice. The lobster was a bit overcooked for my liking, but only slightly.  The flavor of the dish overall, however, was phenomenal.  My dish may have been slightly overshadowed by my friend&#39;s duck dish.  The duck was perfectly cooked and the foie gras was maybe one of the best I&#39;ve ever had in this city!Overall, Salero has found a place in the heart of my belly.  Recently, there has been a lack of restaurants I&#39;ve tried that I would want to revisit again so soon, but Salero seems to have bucked that trend."

That exact scenario played itself out on our visit,   I phoned to let the house know that we were running a &#34;few&#34;  minutes late, and was queried abruptly as to &#34;how many minutes?&#34;.  When we arrived, the host at the door had the same  imperious attitude .   It must have been the same person I spoke with on the phone a few minutes prior.Our server came to the table within 3 minutes, and asked if we were ready to order dinner.  We hadn&#39;t even seen the wine list yet or ordered a cocktail!   I had to flag him down to get his attention after we had perused the menu and made some decisions.   Between the abrupt host and the frenetic server, I have no hesitation in saying that Salero has some issues with the front of the house that need addressing.   The kitchen has it together."

For a spanish cuisine, the flavor was light and not full of spice.  The food presentation was beautiful. The pork belly was very lean and not fatty at all. The flan was very smooth and flavorful. It&#39;s one of the better flan I&#39;ve ever had. The garlic soup is more of a french onion soup, except the base and the flavor is lighter and not salty. For the scallop, it came with 2 jumbo scallop made medium and just right. It taste like regular seared scallop where you can order from any better seafood restaurant, (except here for a better price) where the flavor was accented by the pesto sauce. The churro was fried fresh which it took awhile to prepare. Otherwise it was a very enjoyable lunch."

A complete fluke, I assure you! I met a friend at Salero. The four course tasting menu was absolutely divine. From the appetizers through the main courses and desserts, I cannot complain about a single thing. Octopus, lovely. The jamon appetizer with cranberry jam was perfect. The service was the wonderful balance between &#34;how are you doing?&#34; and unobtrusive delivery and clearing of plates. I cannot wait to go back and try other dishes on the menu. $44 for the four courses seemed very, very reasonable to us. Totally worth a stop. Loved it."

Salero is at a cross roads and can either continue to soar or drop off Chicago&#39;s crowded restaurant scene.  This place has everything it needs to succeed, great atmosphere, good location and amazing food.  The one thing it seems to lack is front of the house management and service.  We went for dinner and ending up leaving after a few starters even though the food was delicious!The service was friendly but lacked training.  The bar was out of several drinks and we tried to order something off the food menu and the server came back and the kitchen was out of that.  The women&#39;s bathroom was a mess.  The server comped some drinks even though we never complained.  It was appaernet that the service was not properly trained and we actually just felt bad and left.I really hope they get on the right track because I would love to go back and try more of the flavorful and inventive dishes.  Good luck Salero:)"

It was a Thursday night and we had made a reservation so we were seated right away by the nice man at the door. The place was pretty busy for a Thursday.Love the decor and environment. Urban yet sophisticated.No complaints about the food!! Everything was delicious! We had olives and the Spanish mackerel to start then moved on to the duck breast and the lobster. The flavors and portions were perfect. Finished it off with the churro. Fried deliciousness. Out bottle of wine was really great as well.Ok, the service. That is my reason for 3 stars. I don&#39;t know if she was new or what, but she wasn&#39;t great. She wasn&#39;t super attentive or friendly and when we told her we needed just a few more minutes, she didn&#39;t come back for a good long while although we could see her at other tables. I had to set our menus out on the end of the table so she could get a clue to come back. I used to be a server myself so things like this really bother me.Another thing is that she hardly looked at me once. She spoke only to my fiance whenever she was at the table. RUDE. She even had her body facing away from me and towards him the entire time. I know he&#39;s cute, but COME ON.Every other person who worked there seemed extra friendly to us except for our server.I am definitely open to returning because the food and wine was stellar. Hopefully we will get another server."

Food and service were very good and ambiance is okay. I think the food is a bit overpriced even by Chicago standards, though, hence my lack of enthusiasm. Drink prices are good but extraordinarily high. We couldn&#39;t find a bottle of red that looked good for under $50. We lucked out on the appetizers: the burrata, the octopus, and the watercress salad were great. The sausage pepper dish was good but not as good as I expected (not a fan of soggy peppers). For an entree, I had the grilled hanger steak, which was excellent. We shared flan and a spiced cake of some sort for dessert, and both were lackluster (the cake was especially blah: super dry). Overall, I had a nice evening but things just didn&#39;t live up to my expectations."

If you order this, ask for bread.Cabeza croqueta - deliciousBurrata - great combination w/sweet blood orange preserves, buttery endive, &amp; morcilla- just wish it wasn&#39;t on toast - the bread was too crusty, biting through the incredibly soft toppings and creating a mess/ripping apart your upper palate is undesirable.Halibut - enjoyable light dish (great use of fresh spring vegetables), but not something I would order again in a restaurant, too simple for my taste.Flan de Queso Fresco - outstanding, GET THIS. Blood orange, caramel, and fresh cheese flavor and texture bomb. Best part of our meal.On a service note - lunch took too long. The first few dishes came out quickly and then we waited a while before the entree came out (acceptable for dinner, not for a weekday lunch).Our busser kept forgetting to bring silverware with the food, adding to the wait time (I would rather wait 5 extra seconds but get the utensils required to eat the meal with).LOVE the decor!"

For two drinks, two appetizers, and two entrees= $122 without tip. The food also did not stand up to the prices. The cocktails were reasonably priced at $12 and were probably the best part of dinner.Started off with grilled octopus ($14) and sweetbreads ($17). The grilled octopus was served with foam on top. I hate foam, it looks like spit and the texture is awful and it has NO place on an octopus. Definitely not visually appealing. The octopus didn&#39;t have that grilled crisp skin or that charred flavor that I love. It was a bit too soft in texture but at least not rubbery. It was served with flash cooked quinoa, actually really good much better than the octopus itself. The sweetbreads dish was tiny, especially for $17. Sweetbreads is the cheapest portion of &#34;meat&#34; you can purchase, for that price there should definitely be more served. The sweetbreads themselves were fine, nothing out of this world. The carrot purée it was served with was delicious. I would have rather ate the carrot purée and I do really like sweetbreads in general.For entrees, my friend and I ordered pork belly ($25) and a seafood stew ($33). It wasn&#39;t a typical pork belly, more like an actual piece of pork meat, not very fatty at all. Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t falling off the fork kind. Had to actually use the knife and chew through it, wasn&#39;t melting in my mouth, had better pork bellies elsewhere in the city. The seafood stew was pretty large, came with scallops, fish fillet, mussels, and some fingerling potatoes. The seafood itself was cooked perfectly but not much flavor. There wasn&#39;t much soup happening in the dish. Overall, it was a tasty dish but nothing to write home about. It left me begging for more flavor. It would have been better if served with bread to soak up some of the liquid.This restaurant left me begging for more flavor. I can&#39;t say I was impressed or that I will be rushing back to come back and tell all my friends about, unfortunately. I will come back for a drink at the bar as it is super cozy and they offer bar bites. But I would recommend skipping the dinner itself."

It was in some food article on top chicago places to eat and I don&#39;t agree at all. Yes, the food was delicious (4 stars), but the service was horrendous! It took us 40 minutes to get WATER and finally order our cocktails. Then another 15 minutes on top of that before the waitress came back and explained the menu. She was not attentive at all. They screwed up our order and said I ordered the veal sweet bread (which I didn&#39;t do). So they took it back, but they she charged us twice on our bill for the veal sweet bread (an additional $30). She asked if we wanted dessert and when we said no she literally ROLLED her eyes and said she would go get the check. Seriously?? I&#39;m sure the dessert was good but we had enough of the service and just wanted to leave.I&#39;ve seen a few comments below about how bad the service was and I wish I would have checked yelp before I went there. Not sure if we are all talking about the same waitress or if your service sucks all around. Either way, figure it out or that place won&#39;t stay in business.Also - there was no music in there which was awkward. Just a ton of people talking. Maybe add sounds barriers and some music to help with the overall atmosphere."

Our waitress walked up and filled our water glasses without saying anything then launched into a greeting . A bit awkward. She was professional but just didn&#39;t seem friendly or happy to be there. My drink was empty for a good 15 min before she noticed it and asked if I wanted another. In addition she just assumed we wanted to see a dessert menu without asking us.This place has some potential but for the price they&#39;re charging it&#39;s not living up service wise.

Top 3 faves are the QUIMET &amp; QUIMET, PAPAS BRAVAS and JAMON IBERICO.  As for drinks, I stuck to my old stand by (dirty martini, vodka, up, olives), but others I dined with enjoyed a variety of the cocktails offered.After my first time here, I noticed that some people would go in a separate door and up a staircase.  Of course, curiosity got the best of me, so I inquired what was going on over there.  The lovely owner, Franco, came over and told us it is a private event space and offered to let us check it out.  The timing was perfect, because I was looking for a smaller venue to hold a professional event for work.If you are looking for a unique, ideally located, versatile, but not too huge space to host an event, you  must check this place out.  The event coordinator, Ashley, is a cut above the rest when it comes to planning and making your event perfect down to  the last detail. She is easy to get in touch with, has great ideas and in general is a fabulous person.  Pricing is very reasonable, especially for the neighborhood."

We told them half of our group was only there for drinks and they did not mind at all. The three of us that were eating had the restaurant week four-course dinner.I did not try it myself but my group was raving about the sangria.  It is served in a wine glass with a single chunk of ice and is dangerously smooth and easy to drink.For dinner I had marinated olives, Serrano/Manchego plate, porkchop, and flan.  My wife had the croquetas, grilled octopus, swordfish, and churros.  Every dish was amazing.  The olives were salty and had a hint of spice.  The Serrano tasted like it had just been shaved off the leg, not too dry and very tender.  The porkchop was juicy on the inside and had a beautiful crust on the outside.  My wife kept stealing bites from my plate!  The flan was very rich and moist and the blood orange gel gave it a unique flavor that was new to me.  The croquetas came out piping hot and their interior was a creamy ham and cheese heaven.  The grilled octopus was cooked to perfection with a delicious smoky char.  The swordfish was also cooked beautifully and the chermoula on it was perfect.  The churros were a little different than the more popularized ones.  These were a little more doughy/salty and less crunchy/sugary than the usual but still great in their own right.The service was on point.  Food and drinks were always timed together for the group.  Our waiter was also very helpful and answered our questions on the dishes and provided his opinions/recommendations.  Splitting the check was not a problem despite being in a group and the staff handled it without us having to specify anything."

The restaurant was still relatively new at this point, so perhaps they were working out the kinks, but the evening left much to be desired.We arrived a bit early for our reservation, but were not seated until nearly 45 minutes after the reservation time. The bar area was crowded, and there&#39;s actually a seating area at the bar for diners that further crushed us into the main entrance area. Many others, also waiting for their tables, congregating out of the cold and close to the booze made it difficult to order a glass of wine while we waited, and there was nowhere to stand without getting in the way of restaurant staff delivering delicious looking plates to tables seated around us. As the night went on and we got hungrier, I became more and more tempted to snag a shrimp as they whizzed by my face.When we finally placed our wine order at the bar, I witnessed the bartender dump what was left of one bottle into my glass (mostly sediment) and top it off with a new bottle, although it was presumably the same wine, this whole ritual threw me for a loop and the sediment was more than I bargained for. Fighting my way back to the bartender&#39;s attention through other hungry waiting patrons didn&#39;t seem worth it at the time.Once we were finally seated, it then took a long while before we were actually able to place our order. Our waitress was patient and happy to explain menu items/offer wine suggestions, but was otherwise difficult to locate. We split a three appetizers and the venison entree.  I highly recommend the jamon - it was a simple but unexpectedly refreshing and tasty dish. Though the venison was prepared well, it was nothing to rave about. We planned to order dessert/another drink we could not find our waitress and eventually gave up as the restaurant was clearing out by the time it was all said and done.All in all, it felt we were somewhat of an afterthought from start to finish of our visit to Salero. The food was good, but overshadowed by the rest of our experience.  I&#39;d give the place a second try if someone else is picking the restaurant-- perhaps these were administrative issues still being worked out."

The staff was so happy to accommodate any of our needs and also wanted feedback, especially bc it was their first week. I really want to give this place four stars because their bartenders were so friendly. Also, they serve pinxos specifically in the bar space.My boyfriend and I got an appetizer and entree each. The menu is refreshingly different than other Spanish places. Having been to Spain, (and wanting to go back!) I was excited to try!Everything was delicious but lacked one flaw each dish. I wish the chorizo stuffed qual had a better sear, but the piquillo sauce, veggies, and overall flavor of the dish was fantastic. The mackeral crudo was amazing, but the plating could have been better.I got the seafood stew with grilled shrimp and mussels had amazing flavor, but the shrimp was over cooked and the scallops were soggy. My boyfriend got the flat iron steak with two sauces. The green sauce was out of this world, but the steak also lacked a solid sear and just seemed blah and limp.After three drinks total (sangria, beer, and cocktail), two apps, and two entrees our bill came out to $120 before tip.  I think had the place been a bit cheaper my review would be more lenient, however this is more expensive than the restaurants nearby on restaurant row (ie: Avec and Girl &amp; the Goat).I would love to come back to restaurant in a few months and see how they evolve over time."

I arrived a bit early for my 7:30pm reservation but the restaurant was not even half full. My friend was arriving separately and had messaged me he was parking. The host informed me he could not seat me without the entire party being present but that I could order a drink at the bar. After letting him know my friend was minutes away and asking if I could just be seated (there is minimal standing room in the entrance) he indicated that he would see and then pretended to be busy in dramatic fashion until my friend arrived.Grouchy host aside the menu quickly put a smile on my face as so many items seemed enticing and involved many of my favorite foods. Salero (which translates to &#34;salt shaker&#34;, &#34;sex appeal&#34; or &#34;wit/charm&#34; according to the Google) features &#34;Modern Spanish&#34; cuisine from the Basque region. Rather than tapas, the menu is divided into entradas (appetizers) and  platos fuertes (strong plates or entrees for my non Spanish speaking readers). My friend and I split a trio of appetizers including the grilled octopus, chorizo stuffed quail and jamon serrano. All were delicious; octopus is one of my favorite foods but is always a risk as it is very easy to either overcook or undercook and the result of either is not pretty. Delicious char flavor from the grill and perfectly tender and flavorful; my only complaint is I would have liked a little larger portion of octopus. The quail had a beautiful presentation and was equally outstanding and we both enjoyed the jamon as well.We each ordered our own entree and I opted for the roasted venison. Flavor wise this was amazing and was a generous portion; the venison loin was cooked a perfect medium rare and the sauce smelled amazing and tasted exquisite. The accompaniments, especially the sunchokes and the sweet potato puree really enhanced the dish and the flavors played so well off one another. The only miscue was it was apparent the dish had sat a while in the kitchen before being brought out as it was barely warm. We decided to skip dessert as we both were comfortably full at this point and nothing seemed so appealing on the dessert menu to merit indulging; I also was still enjoying the fantastic aftertaste the venison had left behind.Beverage wise I ordered a pisco based cocktail that was fair; overall the cocktail menu did not really sing to me (all are priced $12 and many involve sherry as a component, a beverage I do not enjoy). The wines and beers seemed priced just a bit high so I just slowly sipped my cocktail.Service aside from the unhospitable host was adequate to good; two people seemed to tag team as our primary server and both were attentive and efficient though just a bit too impersonal style than I prefer at a restaurant of this caliber. The space is beautiful; I loved the dark wood floors and exposed brick wall but acoustics are a bit on the loud side and two tops on the small side.All in all the savories were clearly five star but the rest of the dining experience lagged a bit to merit an overall five star rating. Definitely would return here to try more of the cuisine (or even to repeat the octopus and venison), but not so much for the vibe."

Not what I was expecting.   I felt it lacked passion, punch, character, boldness, even olive oil, all things I think are synonyms with what Spain&#39;s diverse cuisine is. I might give it another try when im in town because the service was actually nice and friendly. However, the maitre d asked if I was enjoying everything and when my answer was a friendly &#39;so so&#39; he took my bread plate and walked away. Maybe he knew what I meant and agreed with me.Franco G.&#39;s (owner) comment on your review:I&#39;m sorry that our cuisine didn&#39;t take you to Spain but if you&#39;re truly being honest you would mention that the maître d&#39; offered to bring you something different and when you were completely done with your bill in front of you, then and only then did he ask if you would like to have the bread plate cleared. I appreciate your feedback but complete honesty is more appreciated rather than trying to make the maître d&#39; seem like he didn&#39;t care.My reply to Franco&#39;s messageYou are correct, you did ask at the end of my meal to if it was ok to take the bread plate. So now let me clarify what happened the first time you approached me; you asked if I was enjoying everything or if I was enjoying my dinner, or smoothing to that effect, to which I responded &#39;not so much&#39; and you said &#39;perhaps something else&#39; which I took as if were asking if I was considering ordering another dish that I might enjoy.  I answered &#39;no, I&#39;m done&#39; and you walked away.if you really cared to know why I didn&#39;t like the food and really were suggesting for me to order something else, then you should have asked me then what wasn&#39;t about it that i didn&#39;t like. You should have made the effort to show that you really cared and wanted to ensure I was having a good dining experience. But to me you didn&#39;t because you left without knowing or caring to know why I said &#39;no so much&#39;. Instead you chose to walk away.  Perhaps that is good service to you, one that shows that you cared but I don&#39;t agree. To me you didn&#39;t want to deal with it then but you are ok dealing with it here.  You asked for the truth and you got it.Franco G.&#39;s (owner) comment on your review:Thank you. I guess you misunderstood my offer and hope that you give us another chance to make your experience better the next time around."

I have never written on yelp before but felt compelled to do so after our wonderful night at Salero! We had the Chef&#39;s menu which is at the discretion of the chef. The grilled octopus was perfectly done as were the Jamon croquettes. Christopher, our waiter was attentive and realized that we were celebrating a wedding anniversary. At the end he arranged for a dessert with a candle to celebrate the occasion. We only realized later after leaving that  none of us had told the staff about the anniversary. It  was really thoughtful and unexpected. I would recommend Salero to anyone who wants to celebrate or to those want a great night out with friends!"

It&#39;s a noun for the feeling which happens JUUUUST post-orgasm where every centimeter of your body is asking, &#34;what just happened &amp; can I have that again?!?&#34; The term: Salero.Easily the best restaurant in Chicago. No, they&#39;re not gonna ask you to guess what their dessert is at the end of your eighteenth course (p.s. that&#39;ll be a liquefied Krispy Kreme donut in a shot glass), nor will there be the laboriousness of eighteen courses. You&#39;re gonna get amazing food, portions perfect to carry you through the evening, drinks &amp; bartenders are unpretentiously inventive, and enough dining room to enjoy yourself &amp; your company.Walk confidently by Avec and Blackbird like great former lovers who&#39;s time has passed and savor every bit of this new romance."

I had the chorizo stuffed quail  (delicious!!!) and the braised short ribs (amazing!!) My husband had the grilled octopus (was delicious, but wished there was more octopus and less endive, we probably won&#39;t ordered this again) and the grilled lobster w Manila clams (wonderful!)Our waiter was very attentive and pleasant and gave us great recommendations for dinner and bottle of wine. I give 5 stars for our waiter and 4 stars overall for the food because of the octopus dish."

I decided to have the $44 4-course option and could not have been more pleased. The jamon/Manchego croquettes w hazelnut romesco sauce made my eyes roll back in my head. The grilled baby octopus decorated with celery leaves was the most tender I have had. The confit potato plate is the one to beat so far this year for me. It was a vegetarian meal that surpassed expectations for intensity of flavor. The potato is skinned and presented like a steak and topped with a perfectly cooked sunny-side-up egg. Oyster mushrooms added depth. The black truffle shavings and melty manchego cheese knocked it out of the park. The churros had just the right combination of warmth and crispiness and referenced the opening croquettes: fried &#34;book ends.&#34; The wines-by-the-glass selections were thoughtfully curated (I had a Corbieres and a chenin blanc). Salero is one of my favorite Chicago restaurants. The host/manager always makes me and my guests feel special. If Scott is there, ask for him to be your server. The staff is always cheerful and helpful. The room is comfortable and lively but not too loud. I look forward to my next visit."

Chris, who I later found out is the wine director, was our server and he was amazing! I was a server many moons ago and Chris seamlessly handled the bulk of the tables in the rear of the restaurant. I came with my husband to celebrate our anniversary and we were treated so thoughtfully and kindly! Happy Anniversary was printed on our menu&#39;s and Chris wished us a happy anniversary as soon as he came to our table. The food was excellent! There were many layers of flavors to each dish as well as thoughtful surprises on each plate. We had a four course meal but the food was so light that we didn&#39;t feel stuffed and heavy. We ordered the flan for dessert and it is the freshest and most flavorful flan I&#39;ve ever had! To top it off Happy Anniversary was scrolled in chocolate on our dessert plate. Prior to getting our check we received two delicious mini almond chocolate cookies. Salero is now our go to restaurant for special occasions and when my friends and family come to town from NY.We ordered:-Chorizo stuffed quail and crab for the appetizer (explosions of flavor)-Hangar steak and duck for our entrees (cooked to perfection with wonderful vegetables and sauces to accompany them)-Flan for dessert (fresh and flavorful)*Hubby had an epa and ipa to drink with dinner while I had the still rose and coffee with baileys (to accompany dessert).Everything was absolute perfection and we would order it all again if the menu didn&#39;t have so many amazing options to try."

The service was a real letdown. I&#39;m not sure if the server was new, but he wasn&#39;t very friendly and did a fairly poor job at watching over our table. We had to flag him down for almost everything. Working in the restaurant industry, I know alot about prepping for service; this place just doesn&#39;t cut it. How do you run out of sangria at 8pm? It&#39;s clear that it&#39;s a good seller, and there&#39;s nothing in it that could potentially go bad, so why not have enough in house for it? The plates are obviously not thought about very much either. The creativity in presentation is nonexistent. For the price you pay, it&#39;s not worth it at all. I&#39;d rather go to purple pig and spend the same amount for more food and better service if I want tapas. (Also, you should really make patrons aware that tapas are only served at the bar from the get go rather than after they are seated outside)"

The only challenge was that the space has high ceilings and it was a busy Saturday evening, which made it difficult to hear each other at times, but you adapt to it.The menu showcases a great assortment of Spanish style meats, fish and poultry. The wine list is equally as extensive, and the staff did an awesome job of recommending great pairings.There is also a very cool cocktail list however we did not try as we wanted to stick with wine.I highly recommend the Grilled Octopus app and Grilled Strip Steak  Dinner.Overall, Salero is a great place, with an awesome menu, even better wine list, very knowledgeable and friendly staff. Perfect spot to kick back at the end of a long week!"

They even put my name in the menu- such a delight!  I went back last night and sat at the bar where we   received the same great service and the food again did not disappoint. The lobster risotto and the lamb are exceptional entrées while the grilled calamari and the burrata were great starting choices. From the tapas menu, the anchovies were delightful (my first time!) and the Jamon, both the croquettes and the plate, took me back to Madrid where my love for Spanish cuisine began.  This is the kind of place where the entire experience fits the bill.  And to top it off? A Spaniard was sitting next to me, and she&#39;s a regular. With that being said, I think they have something there."

The menu was phenomenal and I love that they don&#39;t do small plates, but large plates just like Blackbird, next door. In fact I&#39;m surprised this place did not get a Michelin star after their first year (last year) being open, the meal was just as good as the one I had at Blackbird for my 3-year anniversary.My girl and I ended up eating the pork jowl, the chorizo-stuffed quail, the seasonal softshell crab entree special (probably gone by now), and the famous grilled lobster. Everything was great, but the pork jowl especially was one of the best things we&#39;ve ever eaten. The service was great too, since we shared everything they brought out each plate one at a time, even splitting the 2 entrees into perfect half plates for us, so it was like we had a 4-course dinner. (They also offer a real 5-course tasting menu, which was tempting, but we opted for a la carte so we could get the softshell crabs). The server also made great beverage suggestions and hooked it up with dessert to celebrate our anniversary... word to the wise: do not skip the queso fresco flan. So good!Highly recommended."

The bar area is in the front when you walk in and the actual dining room is in the back. The space is not too big, but can seat quite a few tables. The restaurant gave off a rustic vibe with wooden panels and a long shelf of candles on one side. It was also really loud considering that it was a weeknight. Maybe the walls don&#39;t absorb sound very well, I don&#39;t know.The Service: This is why I ended up giving this place a low rating. After we were seated, we had to wait a long time for our waiter to come by to take our order. For dinner, we decided to order a couple small plates to start and an entree to share. We waited more than 30 minutes after the small plates for our entree. The wait was ridiculous! I don&#39;t think the slow service was just our table either. I looked around and most of the people around us were also waiting for their food.The Food: We ordered the grilled octopus, chorizo stuffed quail, veal sweetbreads, and vennison. The food was just okay, nothing special. Disclaimer -- I&#39;m not a huge fan of gamey food and their menu is pretty gamey, so I might be biased. The veal sweetbreads were a little too &#39;heavy&#39; for my liking and I did not like the sweet potato puree with the vennison. The puree overpowered everything else on the plate and did not mix well with the vennison.Overall: Don&#39;t come in if you&#39;re in a rush. Service will most likely be slow. You can probably find better food for the price elsewhere on Randolph Street."

Initially there were four of us and we ordered three wines and a beer.  Nothing that needed to be mixed and there were only 3-4 other people in the entire place. And we waited...After 10-15 minutes we had three more of our party arrive, asked for three more wines plus our original drinks.  After a couple minutes the bartender brought over 2 glasses of wine and that&#39;s it.  We had to repeat the rest of our order again.  After another 5-10 minutes we finally got our drinks.  At that point we decided to just pay for the one round and leave.All-in-all it was embarrassingly slow service, which no one apologized for, bad enough where no one wanted to stick around or try the food (we also ordered an appetizer that never came).And all of this would have been even semi-acceptable if the place was busy, we ordered complicated drinks, they had to run to restock, or someone came around to apologize at any point, etc., but none of that was the case.  And to top it off while we sat there mostly drink-less for the better part of 30 minutes, the bartender spent most of that time at the other end of the bar completely ignoring us."

It&#39;s only their second week or so in business and if the food is this promising early on, there is a ton of potential.We ordered four first courses to start: the grilled octopus, terrine, jamon Serrano and chorizo stuffed quail. We loved all the first courses. But, we had to wait quite a while for our drinks to arrive even after several people checked on us. The cocktails arrived ahead of a bottle of wine, which left everybody waiting for 8 or so minutes for the wine to come so everybody had a drink. There was legitimately no reason for the gap in drink delivery.And this brings me to our biggest gripe: the restaurant, while still new, needs to focus on the timing and delivery of the service. It&#39;s not enough to stop and check on the table. When people are ordering drinks or wine it shouldn&#39;t take 10 minutes to get a wine list. And then another ten to get the wine once it&#39;s ordered.Our main courses were superb. Everybody was thrilled. But we kept coming back to the service. It&#39;s a shame we kept dwelling on the disappointing service staff who had good intentions with their attentiveness, but ultimately failed to deliver in a timely manner. When spending $400 on dinner I don&#39;t want the service to be a factor in my experience. It should just work. And tonight, unfortunately, the service didn&#39;t live up to the quality of the food.If Salero can work out the kinks in the service side of the house, I have no doubt they&#39;ll be successful well into the future. The food was superb, but they have a long way to go when it come to the front of the house management and operations."

We have a love for all things Spanish, and we were thrilled to hear that Salero focused on a particular region (Basque Country) within Spain.Simply put, this meal ranks in a &#39;top 10 to 20&#39; of our lives. The depth of flavor throughout the entire meal was incredible, and the each dish was appropriately artistic to match. The sangria was (no joke) the best I&#39;ve ever had. I have a penchant for a classic sangria - nothing too sugary, and Salero did a stellar job ... the peach pureed ice cube certainly pushed me over the edge in love!This meal was one that you stop to savor throughout, as we couldn&#39;t get over the flavor profiles of each dish.

I had the sweet breads and my wife choose the shrimp. The sweet breads were incredible too the point that my wife ate every bite of her shrimp and then stole portions of my sweet breads. Perfectly cooked and accompanied well with well prepared local seasonal vegetables.The entrees we choose were the duck breast and the Zarzuela. The crispy duck skin was exceptional and the salt cod in the Zarzuela was delicate and beautifully cooked.We finished the evening with a Flan de queso and a Churro. My wife typically doesn&#39;t like sweet foods so the flan was perfect for her and I can never pass up a churro. The sauces with the churro each provided a new experience, but worked well with one another.The wine list is a nice compilation with a variety that introduced us to some different varietals as well as some different vineyards. The cocktails were well crafted and fit the season perfectly.We couldn&#39;t be happier about are experience and can&#39;t wait to come back. It is definitely on par with Avec, Girl and the Goat, and Publican, but provides a different experience as it focuses on escalating Spanish cuisine."

I probably couldn&#39;t have had a worse experience...I will preface by saying about 75% of the reason for the awful experience was due to the service. I usually try not to comment on service in my Yelp reviews, but the service we received was so awful and horrendous that I can&#39;t ignore it.I&#39;ll set the scene for you: There were about 9 of us at 10 PM on a Saturday. Greektown was bustling with people as it was also Taste of Greektown - there was live music, people dancing in the streets, and there was a great energy all around. Until we entered Artoplis...To begin, we had a bit of trouble finding a table for such a large group. We split up into two different tables, were kicked out of tables by servers, and then finally moved to a table that opened up thatwas large enough for all of us. During this time, the servers didn&#39;t approach us at all to ask what we wanted and even after we combined tables, we probably had to wait about 20 minutes before a server helped us, and the only reason they did is because we approached someone at the counter and asked if we could order.When we ordered, we asked for waters all around and ordered about 6-7 desserts as well. The server came back with 9 bottles of Evian water...uh, if you&#39;re going to charge me for water and bring over water bottles, I would think that you would let me know ahead of time. Wouldn&#39;t that be more considerate? Also, don&#39;t you have Crystal Glacier like everyone else? Sorry, but I don&#39;t need to be snobby about my water...When the desserts came out, they actually looked delicious. We were extremely excited to devour everything. Of course there is a &#34;but&#34; though. When we ordered, someone ordered an almond baklava, but had asked the server to ensure that there was no egg in it because she had an egg allergy. So naturally, they could only eat it if it was eggless. When she confirmed again that it was eggless, the server said she would check, and another server/manager(?) came back and said that it did have egg in it. Uh, then why did you bring it out? Didn&#39;t she ask you to check while she ordered it? So why didn&#39;t you? Also, they forgot to bring out one of the desserts that we had ordered and finally brought it out 15 minutes later once everyone else at the table had finished eating their dessert. And we were still charged for it...The desserts themselves were good, some better than others. Out of what I tried, I would definitely recommend the chocolate mousse, The Symphony, and the baklava. I ordered the Opera and was pretty disappointed with it - it was actually very dry and didn&#39;t have much flavor. Although the desserts were alright, I wouldn&#39;t return just because the service made the experience so awful. But if you do find yourself here, I will you patience and snarkiness to deal with the wait staff."

Affordable, delicious, and opened until the dead of night? Yes please!I&#39;ve been here twice: once for birthday drinks, and the other for an actual dinner meal. Artopolis is clearly known for their desserts, but don&#39;t let that prevent you from trying some of their drinks and savory dishes. Their cocktails are reasonably priced (less than $10 for most of them), strong, tasty, and overall a great deal. Their espresso cocktail was especially good. A great energy boost to your evening.During dinner, I ordered the Kasseri And Feta Pita with a side of pasta salad. The pita was baked to perfection and came with a blend of cheeses and mint. My plate was sprinkled with cilantro to really add to the presentation. If offered the choice, definitely go for the pasta salad. This penne side was amazing and tasty.For the dessert lovers, you can&#39;t go wrong with what I&#39;ve had. The Mango Yogurt Mousse is light with just enough sweetness, and had great texture. The almond baklava was uber sweet, so be prepared. Each of these was less than $5 a piece, so definitely splurge!The food and ambiance at Artopolis is fantastic. Only major gripe is that service can be slow at times and it may be difficult to flag down your server. This aside, I am very content with the selection and accessibility, and will be back very soon!"

But only if it&#39;s a really great desert, worthy of the carbs. One of my favorite places for dessert in Chicago is Artopolis in Greek Town. If you can&#39;t find what you like here, it probably doesn&#39;t exist (unless you&#39;re craving an ice cream concoction or a soufflé).Whenever I&#39;m having dinner on Halsted, I always try and talk my companions into stopping here afterwards for dessert and a cappuccino. My very favorite are the traditional Greek loukoumades. Small squishy balls of dough that have been fried, then covered in honey, nuts and cinammon. This is a generous dessert you&#39;ll definitely want to share.But Artopolis offers a lot more than desserts.There&#39;s an on-site bakery with artisan breads and rolls, and a full menu with salads, sandwiches, wood fired pizzas and a variety of Mediterranean foods. Some things I&#39;ve tried are good, and some just average. It has a full bar. And almost everything is available for take-out.No reservations, so I no longer have breakfast here weekends, when it&#39;s often packed. No table service for lunch except on weekends. And no free parking like at the other Greek restaurants on Halsted St. (I leave my car at the restaurant where I&#39;ve had dinner when I come here just for dessert)."

But I did get lunch there and the staff was so friendly I asked the guy what his favorite top three and picked from there I love doing that cuz the cooks or waiter/waitress will tell you what it is, what&#39;s great about it and if they add anything special. I ended up with the Tequila pollo sandwich  with potato salad and YUM! Big portions, all delicious and fresh. Full bar so I snagged a glass of wine too.

When my sister and I walked in, I was unsure if we should seat ourselves or place our order at the kitchen. We sat ourselves and after quite a while, someone came to our table with menus.My sister ordered the Jabon Artopita and I ordered the Chicken Rigganatti. The Artopita did not taste fresh and it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. It was not crispy like I expected. I&#39;m under the impression that all the food is pre-made and warmed up when it is ordered. The kitchen looks a bit like a cafeteria with all the vegetables already cut up and ready to go.The chicken was crispy and juicy but bland. I wished that there was hot sauce to eat with it. I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the potato and vegetables that came with the Rigganatti--they were all a bit sour.On a positive note, I did enjoy the potato salad that came with the Artopita. I remember enjoying their sandwiches and fries in college so next time, I will try those items. Also, my sister did a wine tasting of Greek wines that she really enjoyed and that was reasonably priced. Our waitress was also friendly and attentive."

Been wanting to come back, but I haven&#39;t until last week.It wasn&#39;t very busy during early dinner time on a Thursday, but there were a few couples and families. I ordered the Jambon and Kasseri (Zamponopita) with a large amount of potato salad (you could get pasta instead of potato salaries) because I haven&#39;t seen other types of Artopitas anywhere else. It had Black Forest Ham, mushroom, peppers, Kasseri and Cheddar cheese wrapped in baked filo dough.The Zamponopita wasn&#39;t fresh because the filo was not crispy and the whole thing wasn&#39;t warm. A major disappointment from my Spanakopita memory. The potato salad was ok.The best part of my meal was the Greek white wine tasting. The Greek wine tasting was like $10 with four 2 oz Greek wines and you can pick between white and reds. They also have a world wine tasting for $2 less, but it had common wines I have heard of and tried.There is a ramp that goes from the main entrance to the café area that have accessible tables, but there are downstairs and upstairs seating area that are not wheelchair accessible. My sister says that there is a wheelchair accessible restroom stall, but I didn&#39;t check it out myself.I&#39;ll try the Spanakopita if I come again and make sure it&#39;s fresh and warm."

A stone&#39;s throw from UIC.The spanakopita, or spinach artopitas, was the most heavenly, buttery, savory pastry I&#39;ve had as of yet. It was also surprisingly filling for under $6. (I didn&#39;t get the additional salad.) The flaky croissant outsides melt just enough with the generous spinach and feta filling. Not overpowering or gluttonously buttery. Also pleasantly not messy to eat; it doesn&#39;t fall apart, but holds together well, which I find to be a problem with any croissant-type pastry for me.Will be going back to try the other artopitas and pastries, but I might/will probably end up getting the spanakopita again.There&#39;s a bakery counter, meal corner (?), and bar. Self-service until 3 p.m. Light, airy ambiance, with an upscale cafeteria style setting.

It&#39;s really confusing upon entering though because there&#39;s no sign indicating that some one seat us or we seat ourselves or what... But upon arrival, we just wanted some dessert and approach the counter because there&#39;s no sign indicating the seating situation. So when we talked to the counter girl, since we wanted to have dessert there, we would have to seat ourselves and someone would come take our order. But we were already ready to order so we had to wait awhile for a server to approach us. Then when someone took our order, we had to wait when the dessert we wanted was already in the counter glass but whatever we waited.We finally got our dessert and it was pretty decent. I really enjoyed how moist the tiramisu was but I wish there was more cake in it and not just the other filling stuff but nonetheless it was still very tasty. My boyfriend got the strawberry shortcake and well there isn&#39;t anything special about it. But definitely a great spot for dessert though!"

Oh well.We ended up getting two desserts to share - mango yogurt and almond baklava (based on yelp reviews). Definitely get the mango yogurt - so delicious. The baklava was good, but definitely the mango yogurt was better.Service was decent, but I think the server didn&#39;t like the fact we didn&#39;t order drinks - oh well.Overall, great time as my first meal in Chicago.Protip: MANGO YOGURT."

Not that much parking in this area so we parked a few blocks away.We also ordered a chicken kebob plate with grilled tomatoes, rice pilaf, and tzatiki sauce.  I was able to try the mango mousse, tiramisu, and raspberry chocolate ganache cake. The chicken kebob plate was about $5 and had a decent amount of food on it, but not enough to justify the price.After trying the cakes I picked a mango mousse cake to order, and was not disappointed. The mango mousse cake is so light creamy and fluffy!! I would buy this for every special occasion if I had the chance. The other cakes were good as well but not enough to get an entire cake worth."

I&#39;ve dined here with friends for lunch, great soups, salads and specialty sandwiches. They&#39;re not big on many entrees, however you can put together a tasty meal, think small plates, mix and match stuff. Their traditional soup on the menu is lemon chicken with rice, is delicious and the bowl will fill you up, it&#39;s bigger than it looks. All I can think of after getting a third of the way through it was, &#34;am I still eating soup?&#34;The cafe part, you can sit at the cafe/wine bar and just do that in lieu of a table, or linger and have something from their bakery case. If that doesn&#39;t work the bakery case has a register so you can do a take out. You can also order whole cakes or other goodies.

They&#39;re a cafe as well, but I&#39;ve never come for anything savory. I head straight for the desserts!They have three or four bakery cases when you walk in, all filled with amazing treats. Behind that there is a display of all of their fresh breads. I have yet to have anything bad here. Most recently, we loaded up on baklava, chocolate-raspberry mousse, lemon tarts, and cheesecakes. The chocolate-raspberry treats were delicious. They&#39;re covered in ganache and are so rich, you almost think you can&#39;t finish a piece. Then, of course, you do. The lemon tarts I think are my favorite. They are just the right amount of both sweet and tart, the filling is thick without being too much. The crust is super crunchy and really sweet, which is a nice contrast to the tart lemon curd. The cheesecake... Well I never got to try that because my dad ate all of it. I think that&#39;s a good sign. The baklava is textbook and delicious, with heavy doses of honey and nuts with flaky pastry.I make a point now to come here whenever I&#39;m in the neighborhood, and it&#39;s given me a reason to venture up to Greektown more often. I&#39;d definitely recommend it. But, it&#39;s all so good looking and tempting, be prepared to walk out of there with a full box of treats."

They&#39;re buttery, flavorful, and flaky; they just simply melt in your mouth. Truthfully, the sandwiches are okay, they&#39;re pretty good but nothing special. The artopitas are what truly steal the show. The two free sides that come with food are their potato and pasta salad- I have had both. I think the potato salad is flavorless and quite bland, and that the pasta salad is absolutely spectacular. Most of the people I have brought here seem to agree.The atmosphere is nice, cozy, and a perfect place to take someone if you wan to sit, chat, and relax."

I want a cake for picking up around 12pm and you want me to call in the afternoon? I get it that you want to go home and probably sleep, but since you already picked up the phone so please listen to customers&#39; needs. Then why would you even bother picking it up?Their online system sucks too.

So happy I listened to her! A group of us 4 girls came in to grab coffee and desserts around 4 p.m. on a rainy Sunday afternoon. It was packed! We couldn&#39;t find a host so we looked at the delicious treats behind the window and the girls working there were so helpful with helping us choose what we wanted to eat! The mango dessert was suggested more than the white chocolate dessert but my friend who loves white chocolate got it and loved it. There were two macarons left and we got the pistachio and vanilla one. I am picky about macaron&#39;s so if you are too- this is where to get them!Since we weren&#39;t getting them to go- we had to order by table service but we just sat down on our own with a help of a hostess. When we got our waitress she was very friendly and took time with our order. I got a hot cocoa, my friend got the Americano, and my two other friends got the frappe in which they were able to choose if they wanted it sweet, medium sweet, or no sugar. They both choose sweet. We all loved our drinks from the taste, quality, and presentation. Temperature was perfect and we enjoyed talking and mingling in a loud- chatter environment,  cultured with decorations and ambiance, with a large crowd of people. Perfect for families, large groups, or a semi casual/romantic date. I would love coming in here after a good meal or for just coffee with a macaron.I haven&#39;t tried them all, but I&#39;m voting Artopolis as my favorite coffee/dessert place as I&#39;m sure it is for many of the locals in and near Greektown.

Was kind of saddened to see Greek Coffee blacked out on the menu...so I went with a Iced Cafe Latte instead and split the galaktoboureko with my family.The galaktoboureko was interesting. It was a lemon custard wrapped in phyllo. We were surprised that it was brought out warm...which probably explains why the phyllo burnt on one end. First bite, pretty awesome. There was a good balance of textures from the flaky phyllo to the smooth lemony custard. But ultimately, we found the dessert to be much too sweet, from the added syrup they put on. And because we let it sit in the syrupy topping, it became ever more difficult to separate and eat.The atmosphere within Artopolis was nice and laid back. The upstairs loft seemed mostly occupied by students from UIC, while the lower central seating area seemed occupied by tourists and &#39;regular&#39; customers fraternizing with the staff.

Had $40 worth of Groupon to spend here with a friend and I knew it would be no issue using it up.My friend and I considered ordering alcoholic beverages, but then decided on soda and whatever this one guy near us was having which was a frappe, and I could choose the sweetness level. I chose lightly sweet and my friend joked about putting in some alcohol but the waitress completely ignored the statement as if it wasn&#39;t even a possibility, even though we were kind of serious about maybe adding some Kahlua or Bailey&#39;s. Guess not.My friend ordered a sandwich, which comes with a choice of pasta or potato. She wanted a side salad. No, not possible. Not even an apology- just a no substitution attitude- you can have only pasta or potato. Ok, let&#39;s go for the potato then. No nonsense here! I ordered the 5 cheese pizza. I expected a very thin crust, personal pizza situation with a thin layer of mozzarella with maybe a smattering of other cheeses, but instead received a very doughy crust, huge dinner plate full of very cheesy pizza, showing the four kinds of cheeses that went into it and a huge glop of goat cheese in the middle. I would be lucky if I even finished half and took the rest home. I wasn&#39;t just lucky, I was enjoying it.We also had dessert, needing to make up the Groupon total, and my tiramisu was delicious, light in texture, but heavy on espresso flavor. Perfection. Because I had 90 cents left over in the total, our waitress offered me a couple almond cookies to take home to make up for it. I very much appreciated that- usually the restaurants say nothing and let you waste the rest of the deal. Plus, the cookies were really good- crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and tasted like marzipan, which I love. I will definitely be back- for the bakery, for the coffee, for the food."

Essentially a build your own pita with all your existing components.The gentleman at the counter said I had to be charged for each of them as individual sides: pita, tabbouleh, hummus, and feta.

One of the chefs were there inspecting everything, and he gave us a very nice introduction to the menu. He even offered us samples to try the different meats available. I am sad that I did not know his name, but I have a picture.The pepito was delicious. The braised beef short rib was rich, tender, and flavorful. The bread was toasted to a perfect crunch. The cochinita pibil, which is a achiote and citrus braised pork was interesting in a good way. It was also tender and the acid was refreshing. The sandwich also had a pickled red onion it is so there was lots of acid. I would skip the pickled red onion next time. The roasted habanero salsa was super spicy. A little bit of it goes a long way.Oh, I forgot the guacamole! When we arrived at 11am, they were still making it. It was that fresh, and good!"

Tortilla soup had a burnt taste, so I didn&#39;t finish it either. Roast chicken was OK, nicely smokey in flavor. The quesadilla and salad were ordinary.Something else I didn&#39;t enjoy was the service. Long line, of course. Very hard to personalize your order, like &#34;hold the cheese&#34; is a foreign phrase. And instead of asking, &#34;What can I get you?&#34; and letting you speak, the servers recite a list of questions you have to answer: &#34;Would you like chips with that?&#34;  &#34;Can I get you a beverage?&#34;  &#34;Would you like to add dessert?&#34;  Of course Rick hopes to increase your check by an item or two, but to me it&#39;s annoying to keep saying &#34;No thank you&#34; over and over.With Latinicity now open just across the street, I will give this place a miss in future."

Frontera Fresco gets particularly crowded.I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Quesadilla without onions. It was awesome. The chicken was super flavorful and juicy. The quesadilla was literally dripping. The quesadilla was also crisped up, which is not something that one usually finds at a restaurant, much less a fast casual restaurant. I could do without the salad on the side. I never eat it. I also asked for a side of tomatillo salsa. This one is better than the red, in my opinion. It&#39;s spicier and not smoky.The service is always wonderful at Seven on State, in my experience. They&#39;re always willing to grab you a refill, take your tray, or help find whatever you may need.My only complaint is that I wish the quesadilla was bigger. Especially given the price.

Well, they had convenient escalators all the way up - so it wasn&#39;t too much of a delay.I think my mistake was getting the huaraches. The masa was dry and not very good/tasty. In turn, the toppings tasted poorly. I got through about half before deciding that it wasn&#39;t worth it, then scraped off the toppings and ate those. On the other hand, the tortilla soup was fantastic. I would have ordered a ton of that if possible. The cheese and avocado they add are perfect little surprises at the bottom of the bowl.If I worked in the Loop, I&#39;d be here all the time. The service was fast and friendly.

Today, the bread on my torta was completely burnt and inedible! I saw the cook look at it and try to scrape the burnt areas off, but obviously, that didn&#39;t work. If I am paying $10 for a torta, I better be getting my money&#39;s worth. Other times, my torta, quesadilla, or taco is thrown together in such a sloppy fashion that when I open it up it completely falls apart.

I hate everything about O&#39;Hare EXCEPT Frontera.Which, readers, leads me to this review. Was Frontera good at Macy&#39;s? Absolutely. And as you can read from other reviewers here, you&#39;d be remiss in not going. But it was nowhere near as good as the exact same thing at O&#39;Hare. Was it the juxtaposition of the utter despair I feel at O&#39;Hare? Perhaps due to the 3rd delay in as many hours? Perhaps due to the fact I would then find out my plane would be cancelled from a case of the &#34;we&#39;re United and we do this kind of stuff to people because we can&#34;?Who knows, maybe it&#39;s because it&#39;s the only good thing in my life when I&#39;m at O&#39;Hare, but it just tastes better."

The tamale was great with bits of fresh corn studded throughout with creamy goat cheese and ricotta. My favorite torta was the cochinita pibil -- pork was tender and spicy with the pickled onions adding a punch of acidity.

The only complaint I have here is that the salsa portions are pretty small compared to the amount of chips and food you get to go along with it.The only other thing that brings this down a star is that while the cashier and other staff were friendly, they all had a problem with vocal projection. The first woman who helped us with the chips was right in front of us, separate by the counter/glass and I was having issues hearing her... this is a loud place, you need to use your outside voice if you&#39;re working! Then the cashier came over to us (the line was backed up a bit) to ask for our order. Then she went back to the register and shouted a couple questions to us about our order, unfortunately she didn&#39;t shout loud enough since she was at least 15 feet away, so we could not understand her.The wait time was not the fastest, but acceptable considering it was a Macy&#39;s day after Christmas sale, and there were probably about a dozen orders in before ours, and I constantly saw food coming out.In any case, I will definitely eat at the Frontera Fresco brand restaurants again, and would definitely recommend this to a friend."

I might recommend adding toppings because having it plain wasn&#39;t anything fantastic, I&#39;ve had better. Salsa tasted really fresh but just was too watery for me. On the other hand, the tacos were pretty good. You get 2 sizeable ones for about $7.50, which seemed a little pricey at the time for lunch but the ingredients did taste quality.

I don&#39;t mind waiting for quality food, though--and this certainly qualifies.The space on the seventh floor is very pleasant, and offers plenty of tops-of-people&#39;s-heads-watching opportunities as well as great views of State Street. I ordered a grilled steak huarache, which was really tasty and filling.

Located on the top floor of macy is a hidden gem that allows for a delicious meal without the heavy price tag. This is one of Rick Bayless restaurants that serves fresh cuisine with bold flavors. For 7.95 I had one of the best steak tortas of all time. It is filled with chipotle-rubbed steak, Chihuahua cheese, cilantro chimichurri, poblano rajas, black beans, and fresh slices of avocado. The steak was cooked perfectly a little pink mixed with the chipotle rub which was not spicy at all served on a panini sandwich. The flavors are hard to describe, but I can say that I could have 10 more and still be craving it. The other items on the menu include cooked to order taco with healthy slices of avacado. This place is highly recommended!Pro- Rick Bayless meal on a budget, best torta ever, bold flavorsCon- limited hours (11-3 pm) Monday thru saturday, closed on sundaysHidden deal- Ask for the frequent diner card. After 8 meals in the Macy food court, you get one free. Rick Bayless has been known to show up on the weekends. We went too early, but the chefs were already preparing for Rick Bayless to come and survey the restaurant this past Saturday."

I haven&#39;t made it to any of Rick Bayless&#39; sit down restaurants yet, but my mom and I were hangout in the city and decided to try Frontera Fresco, located in Macy&#39;s food court.The people behind the counter are pretty friendly. They have their guac bar as you&#39;re advancing in the (super long if you&#39;re there during lunch on a weekday) line. We weren&#39;t interested, but I&#39;d def try it next time.We shared the Roasted Vegetable torta and the tres quesos Huaraches. While the tortas was super delish, the Huaraches HIT THE SPOT and stole the show. They served both with their chipotle salsa which was good - legit the one they bottle up and sell in stores.Prices are higher if you&#39;re thinking quick food court food, but definitely in line with downtown prices, so not bad.I would definitely go back to try the guac, some more items on the menu, and to get me some more Huaraches!!! I can&#39;t wait to try some of Bayless&#39; other restaurants, either!"

Not bad at all."

Also the menu board is so hard to see, while standing in line.  The board was over the top of the grill and not the register where you placed your order.  I also looked for a written menu by the register but it did not exist.  I found a stack at the end of the grill counter (hidden on the right).  Not very helpful at this point because I was waiting for my food here.We ordered Grilled steak tacos w/grilled red onion, a Fresco salad w/roasted garlic dressing and a Guacamole with Chips.  Then we did a little family style dinning.The grand total was 18 bucks for fast food gourmet Mexican food. It was definately a little pricey for self service mexican in a food court.  The only good thing is that I now know what a 4 dollar taco looks like and tastes like.  The quality of the meat was really good and it was still a little rare but it was definately expensive considering what I got.  Also the Guacamole container was very small for the chips too...definately not enough Guac for all of the chips.My biggest negative was the one small salsa with your order...that is written on the menu board.  It seems a little cheap on there part considering what I just paid.  After 18 dollars, I should be able to get a little more salsa then just a tiny little sample size of salsa.  Also, do not waste that salsa choice on the Chiplote salsa because it was icky...it tasted like it was from a jar.  Go for the tomatillo salsa because it was super yummy and tasted fresh!!!I am glad that I tried it but I will not be fighting my way back here.  Rick Bayless does a nice job of creating good tasting food but I think based off of price I will be spending my money in Pilsen next time if I want some Mexican...you should see what I can get for 18 dollars...I will have two meals out of the leftovers."

My mom and I went here for a late lunch after a day at the Art Institute and some shopping at Macy&#39;s.Since it was late afternoon there wasn&#39;t a line, and the register fellow was patient with our dithering. I will say, we lived in TX for 20 years and have eaten a ton of Mexican food, and I still didn&#39;t know a few of the Spanish vocabulary words on Rick&#39;s menu. (I&#39;m sure the clerks love translating all day.)They were cool with some substitutions, or rather exclusions (i.e. &#34;I don&#39;t want a wad of raw cilantro on top of everything, is that ok?&#34;), but overall, you&#39;d better be okay with avocado and cilantro because it&#39;s in everything.I had the pulled pork tacos with pickled onions; while tasty, they were very greasy, and frankly were not as good as the ones I get at Burrito Parilla Mexicana in Lombard and Naperville.I think Mom hit the jackpot with the Huarache (sort of like a flatbread pizza thing). She also liked the guacamole (chunky, not gloppy), though the guy taking the order said casually, &#34;And what toppings would you like?&#34; not mentioning that they&#39;re 30¢ each extra (the menu says it, but it just seemed kind of shifty).The aguas frescas (limeades, essentially) are also a definite must-have. I got the raspberry-prickly pear, and she had the classic lime. Nice for a sip in the sun before your siesta!Overall, a convenient and not overly expensive lunch spot in the Loop, and a good way to get a taste of Rick without making a reservation."

The chips and salsa were served immediately so we tried that first.  The chips were bordering stale, probably had been out all day sitting in the little basket next to the other ones.  It was serves with two tiny cups of salsa.  The red salsa had a very slight kick to it and a slight smokey flavor, the green one just tasted like blended cilantro and was frankly pretty disgusting.The other things were ordered were also served with the same tiny salsa cups.  Thankfully mine had red.  The bread on the torta was fresh, the avocado pieces were very good, there was also grilled onion and peppers.  The chicken was pretty sparse considering this was a sandwich that cost over $8 and came with nothing but the sandwich and tiny salsa.  Overall I was not impressed at all with this.The quesadilla was served in two pieces, pretty large and had what seemed to be a small caesar salad with it as well as the green tiny salsa.  It had quite a bit of stuff in it, the chorizo, corn, onions, peppers, cheese, but again this was overall just okay.So as we both finished up our meals con tiny salsa we found ourselves longingly eyeing those lucky patrons that were receiving their food from the burger joint right next door.  Although I can&#39;t speak to the taste of those burgers I can say with almost 100% certainty that they could not be worse, or more expensive than what we had just eaten... and for that price we would have received more meat and no tiny salsa... undoubtedly a better bargain."

You really get the quality behind the name here. Plus, it&#39;s not like the next best alternative in the loop is any cheaper.As an added bonus, the view from the food court is really nice granted you grab a seat along the perimeter of the open atrium(?) area.

We watched the line cooks mess up orders, tell customers they were wrong, and make things out of order.I love Frontera! I own Rick&#39;s Mexican Everyday cookbook, watch his show, and I recently went to see a cooking demonstrations of his; so I was very disappointed that Frontera Fresco did not stand up to my love of all things Rick!I&#39;ve seen this place busier during weekday lunch hour, so why did a small Noon rush on Sunday seem like such a monkey wrench for the staff to handle?Aside from the disappointingly long wait after we ordered, the Mexican Pulled Pork Torta was fatty, flavorless, and did not impress me either. My son ordered the steak tacos, and they were full of fresh avocado and the meat was seasoned to perfection! This is definitely the way to go! We both enjoyed the aquas frescas, he got the classic lime, I opted for the raspberry lime w/pear.Everyone deserves a do-over, but a simple &#34;I&#39;m sorry for the long wait&#34; when being handed our food, would have done wonders!"

Once you find the place there is a 15-20 minute wait in line before you order, then another 5 minutes or so for prep. The Huaraches or flat bread which I dont even think is an authentic Mexican dish... was mediocre at best. The flavors are all there, its the experience of eating this thing that i didnt like. I would have their Tortas all day long but they have a Torta only branch inside Chase Tower which for me is much closer. My half hour lunch break ran late..If you work right near Macys, then you may get away with a lunch run here. The Guacamole on the other hand is awesome! get it fully loaded with chips which are also fresh. Dont forget to try Frontera inside O&#39;Hare airport next time you fly!"

Chill, casual vibe. Came on a Friday night around 8:45 and it wasn&#39;t too packed. Parking is difficult given the area. Permit parking on some side streets and pay for park on Division and some parts of Damen.Got the farm to fresh special which was a spinach pesto, goat cheese and tomato. SO GOOD, the crust was crispy and the combination of flavors was amazing. We also ordered the Bacon Bianca. It was tasty, but dry. Ordered a small of each and it was perfect for 4 people.

After a year, I finally made it over. I showed up on a Friday afternoon right after they opened, around 5 pm, intending to get a couple of slices. I was hoping they&#39;d have some of their specialty slices available, but they just had the standard cheese, pepperoni, and sausage. I went with a cheese and a sausage. With a fountain soda, it was 8 bucks. The soda cup was the tiniest I&#39;ve ever seen, it was probably just a little bigger than a rocks glass. It was a little surprising to see Jones soda.As for the pizza, here&#39;s what I&#39;ll say. This place uses good quality ingredients. The crust was nice and crispy all the way through, as it should be. The sauce had a bright tomato flavor and the quality of the mozzarella was fair. I thought the sausage had an ok flavor, but it could have used more seasoning. The ingredients were also well proportioned.Also, the condiments disappointed me. The parmesan in the shaker was turning yellow, like it had been sitting out for a week. And also, there was no oregano or granulated garlic available.This is one of those classic 3.5 star reviews, but since I do believe I would give them one more chance, I&#39;m giving the extra star. If I do go back, I probably would try one of their specialty pies such as the white and  take it to go."

(Seriously, can&#39;t a girl get a decent slice of NY-style pizza around here?)You can get single slices of cheese, sausage, or pepperoni for $3-$3.50 each. Ok, on the expensive side, but they&#39;re gooood. The single slices are only available at certain hours, though, and their hours in general are a bit confusing. What&#39;s on the website is different from what&#39;s on the window is different from what&#39;s on the chalkboard outside is different from the hours reported here on Yelp, but I can tell you Craft is for sure closed on Mondays, and the single slices are for sure available on weekdays right after work (5-6:30 p.m. is what the chalkboard currently says). Ramble about the hours aside, the cheese slice is great, but the sausage slice is better, and the whole pizzas are excellent! Try the Devil in the White City."

It looked clean enough, so we make our way in and order 4 large pizzas.Hands down, my favorite pizza was the sausage pizza. It had some of the best pizza-sausage I&#39;ve ever tasted. A close second was the Amore, on which we chose to add prosciutto.I&#39;m a sucker for prosciutto.Aside from the food, the atmosphere inside was delectable.

Decided to stop in here after a Blackhawks game since it is just a bit further north on Damen.This small spot is an order at the counter set up. We placed our order for two pizzas. A Margherita and a Bacon Bianca. We then picked out a spot to sit.When ordering, the counter person asked if I was going home after here. I did not understand why she was asking this and thought it had something to do with their description of lots of fresh garlic on the Bacon Bianca pizza. Once we received the pizzas, Doh!  I knew then she was asking me because these pizzas were 14 inches each. I was thinking that they were more personal size pizza. I also noticed the very large sign (Doh! again) right where you order showing the two sizes available. Oh well, pizza is one of my favorite things so I never experienced having too much pizza as being a problem.The pizza here is good. It is somewhat a Neapolitan style. Not true Neapolitan but definitely inspired by it. The Bacon Bianca had a lot of things going for it especially the awesome bacon that they use here.Service was super nice and friendly.

They have a Happy Hour special that&#39;s probably worth going to, but we ordered carry-out after learning our lesson from the last time. I popped in to pick-up and it was less busy during this time of night and the staff was really nice and friendly. I got the Hawaiian style pizza which was very tasty. Prices are reasonable as well."

One other thing to note is that there isn&#39;t many tables inside and the biggest party you can have is 10 people (biggest table). There are two tables outside which seat 6.We got 2 large pizzas with two toppings each + 2 garlic breads and paid $53 for it (about the same price as Piece).

I would choose this restaurant over the nearby Parlor Pizza because they have vegan options with vegan cheese. A small outdoor patio is open during the summer and it can be romantic with the stringed lights they hang. I would definitely recommend to a friend. It is a little annoying that it is not open on Mondays."

No TV&#39;s is a plus. Further, it&#39;s BYOB and I believe no corkage fee.On a not so good note, I would probably skip the bagels.

For starters, my friend inquired as to how long the pizza would take to be served after being ordered, considering I was running late. He was told 20 minutes, which was on cue for when I was due to arrive. However, the pizza ended up being brought to the table 8 minutes later, which meant it sat there cold. The owner was accommodating enough to reheat it in the oven, but it certainly lost some of its appeal.Secondly, we ordered the 14&#34; &#39;Devil in the White City&#39; and the 14&#34; &#39;Amore&#39; with sausage, after viewing both pictures and reviews on Yelp of each. We were surprised when the Amore pizza arrived with hardly any sausage on it. Not only was there such a disproportionate amount of meat on it [2 tiny pieces per slice], it was considerably less compared to other pictures we saw of the same exact pizza posted on Yelp by other patrons. For $45 dollars worth of pizza, this the least anyone should expect - complete letdown.Finally, if there were to be one redeeming quality this restaurant had to offer, it would have been this request. The crust was delicious albeit the lack of toppings, so we decided to ask for a side of marinara dipping sauce.  The server at the register actually gave us a side of cold marinara sauce that tasted as if it were straight out of the can [pretty sure it was] -- note: not room temperature; COLD. It killed any desire to continue eating. What staff with any common sense does this? Just plain ridiculous.All in all, we were thoroughly disappointed. Several prior reviews recounted experiences where the owner asked them to return after an unfulfilled experience the first time around. The problem here is clearly not the owner [Scott was nothing but helpful &amp; friendly], but the seemingly careless and indifferent staff. Although the &#39;Devil in the White City&#39; was good, the entire overly priced meal was a mediocre experience, at best. We will not be going back for more - maybe Coalfire Pizza won&#39;t shaft us on the toppings."

Really enjoyed it. Pizza was delicious, similar to what you&#39;d get at a Coal Fire, but since it&#39;s byob and counter service, it winds up costing about half as much. Outdoor dining area is nice for nights w good weather, like the one we enjoyed, but w the restaurant sitting right on busy Damen Ave, it can get a little noisy, but hey, it&#39;s a happening area. Worker could have been a little more helpful w getting us some plates from a nearby cart instead of leaving us to maneuver from our seats, which were kinda pinned in due to nearby diners.

The pizza was doughy and under cooked - perhaps everyone was just trying to clean up shop for the night and get out of there - I can relate.An invitation from owner Scott to come back in and give them a second shot was equally as redeeming as the first experience was disappointing. Not only is Scott a great business man for extending this invitation, but his shop has a pretty tasty thing going for it. Second experience left me excited to try the Devil in the White City pizza that everyone raves about.

There is not a lot of seating in the dining area, especially for a larger group.  It is BYOB and a great neighborhood spot.

However, after the horrible service I received last night I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be coming here in future.We called to place an order for the Farm to Table pizza, one of the &#34;House Pies,&#34; which is listed on the website for $20. The girl taking the order was very confusing, mentioning that they don&#39;t have that pizza any more, but offering to make it and ring the ingredients up individually. The pizza, as listed on the website and menu inside the store, doesn&#39;t even have a specified set of toppings, it just says seasonal veggies, so we just went ahead and ordered it, thinking it was some sort of quirk in their ordering system.When I arrived to pick up the pizza the same girl who took the order rang the pizza up as costing $24. I called her out on this, as the pizza we called to order is listed as $20 in multiple locations. She claimed that the pizza &#34;wasn&#39;t on sale any more&#34; (huh?) and so the toppings had to be rung up individually. She was very rude to me right from the moment that I first suggested the price wasn&#39;t correct, and refused to do anything to fix the issue. We argued back and forth for a while, and eventually one of the cooks came over, and offered to make up the difference from his own wallet. He pulls out 4 bucks, puts them in the cash register, and she adjusts the price (she had acted like this was completely impossible). All in all, a baffling encounter.I would suggest everyone ordering here does what we should have done, and makes sure to get the price of their order on the phone before they go to pick it up. This place is pretty clearly scamming people by adding the toppings of their &#34;House Pies&#34; individually and charging more for it."
craft-pizza-chicago,Tony M.,HSqVgkdBIZ4qPFNusM7MMA,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,92,WoyNOo4GbpBbtwohV0HxOQ,3.0,2014-07-25,"I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m actually giving this place a 1, but yes, my experience there was just that bad.I had been wanting to try this place ever since it opened, so I took two of my friends there tonight. I understand that they don&#39;t take reservations, but I called ahead to see if there was a wait. There was not. In fact, two tables were apparently open. I asked if Craft took call-ahead seating. It does not. So my friends and I walked very quickly from Six Corners to Craft, which took maybe 10 minutes.When we got there, there was of course no seating. Now, at this point, a restaurant will usually take your name and let you know when a table is available. Craft did not. They simply told us that seating was first-come, first-serve.Okay...We were then handed a menu and advised to order while waiting for a table since the pizza takes 30 minutes to make. Okay, fair enough.For the house pies, you cannot make substitutions. None. Zero. Unless the food is frozen - and it&#39;s obviously not - that makes little to no sense. I saw a house pie that I wanted and asked if I could add a topping to it. I was told that wouldn&#39;t be possible, either. The girl behind the counter said that the house pies are meant to serve as &#34;inspiration&#34; for a build-your-own pie. Again, that makes no sense. I know which pie I want. Why can&#39;t you just throw some prosciutto on there? Also, if you want to build you own pie, you cannot add bacon.This was literally the oddest, most random menu I&#39;ve ever seen.We end up ordering two pizzas: a small plain jane and a large bacon bianca.I ask once again if we should put our name in for a table. I am once again told that seating is first-come, first-serve. When a table is open, just grab a seat.Okay...My friends and I see that a table of three by the door is putting the finishing touches on their meal - which was good, because everyone else inside the restaurant was just settling in with their BYOB buckets. So we go stand near the doorway - not close enough to where we can hear the conversation of the finishing party, but close enough so that we can pounce as soon as they leave. Well, about 20 minutes later, the table of three leaves, and we sit down immediately.I get up to get the three of us plates and water. By the time I get back, I see that my two friends are standing and looking very confused at someone who I&#39;m guessing is the owner (and if he wasn&#39;t the owner, he was very clearly the person in charge). I get back and ask my friends what&#39;s going on. Apparently this guy came over and said - pretty rudely, according to my friends - that we couldn&#39;t sit there. I asked why. Apparently a party of two ordered their food right before we did and their food was ready, so they were entitled to the table.That&#39;s right. It was a table for four, they were a party of two, and seating is first-come, first-serve. Yet they were entitled to the table.At that point, our food was going to be ready within 10 minutes. A quick scan of the room revealed that no tables were going to be even close to open by then, so I was left with no other option. I canceled our order.On a scale of 1-10, my level of anger was a solid 7.5. We hurry to this restaurant; there are no tables; no name is taken; we order (under a set of ridiculously random rules); we&#39;re told seating is first-come, first-serve; we grab the first open seat available; and then we&#39;re told we can&#39;t sit there.Believe it or not, the guy in charge was actually confused and angered as to why we canceled our order.Here&#39;s some Restaurant 101 advice: Take reservations. If you don&#39;t want to take reservations, offer call-ahead seating. If you don&#39;t want to offer call-ahead seating and just have it be first-come, first-serve, don&#39;t kick people out of a table after they&#39;ve been waiting 20 minutes to sit down. And if you&#39;re going to do all that, you damn sure better have more seating options than you do - and you don&#39;t. I understand that this place is new, but there was zero organization and zero accountability - from anyone.Also, it was really, really hot in there.So yeah, all in all, this was easily one of the worst dining experiences I&#39;ve ever had - and I ate nothing.For what it&#39;s worth, the pizza did look good. Maybe I&#39;ll give this place a second shot someday, but I don&#39;t know. Piece, Dimo&#39;s, Santullo&#39;s and a bunch of other pizza places are a five-minute walk from where I live. If you want me to walk 15-20, you need to do a hell of a lot better than what you did tonight.Of course, if tonight was any indication, that&#39;s not going to be happening any time soon."

I ordered a pizza last Sunday and wrote the below review. Within minutes the owner, Scott, emailed me a personal message to express his apology and requested that I come in and give us another chance. Scott told me the next pizza would be on the house, which is a very generous thing to do for a new business owner. I went back yesterday and met Scott - a very gregarious, smiley, passionate guy. We agreed that I should try to replicate the same pizza from the other night (sausage with red sauce). Wow. What a difference. The crust was done perfectly, as you can see in the picture, and the cheese, sausage, and overall taste was amazing. THIS is what everyone was raving about. Now, if I had gotten this pizza originally I would have given Craft 4 stars, but considering the class and care that Scott handles his business, I have no choice but to give him 5 stars here. We need more business owners like this in the neighborhood - men and women who take pride in their craft, whatever that may be. I&#39;ll be coming back to Craft to try some of the other creative pizzas on the menu.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Not sure what the hype is all about. I&#39;ve eaten at many many Chicago pizza places and this just doesn&#39;t measure up. The pizza was much too doughy - felt like more of a Papa Johns / Dominos feel than a legitimately craft pizza spot. Sauce was meh. I&#39;ve read that a lot of people loved the Devil in the White City pizza, but any Chicago pizza place should be able to deliver an amazing marinara-based sausage or pepperoni pizza...and this place really doesn&#39;t stack up. Sorry guys - I live in the neighborhood and love to support local business, but there are too many other good pizza places nearby (Piece, Santullo&#39;s, Lou Malnati&#39;s, Metro)."

Normally I try not to write reviews until a place has been open for a bit, but Craft Pizza demands to be talked about.For those familiar with Pizzeria Serio in Lakeview, this is from the same people. And if you know Pizzeria Serio, you&#39;d know that it&#39;s very good. Well, they have stepped up their game even more for Craft Pizza.One of the things that they have been pushing is their slow rising crust. While I don&#39;t know all of the specifics behind it, I do know that the crust is really damn good. What&#39;s more, the rest of the ingredients are all top notch.I have yet to do a make my own pie because I want to work my way through all of the house pies. I&#39;ve done the amore+prosciutto (there was no way for me not to use the prosciutto option) and farm to table so far. I haven&#39;t even gotten into the more complex pies and I&#39;m completely in love. The ingredients and sauce are soooo good and it&#39;s hard not to just destroy one of these awesome pizzas.They are also BYO and I&#39;ve noticed that they are very kid friendly when I&#39;ve stopped in.I really hope that Craft Pizza is around for a long while. This location has been a bit of a bogey location with Bagel on Damen and Haute &amp; the Dog both having been here not too long ago. They are doing everything right so far and I want it to continue for as long as they are willing."

Since they have outdoor seating Hank found a spot. Didn&#39;t know if they had wait service, so I tied up Hank and ordered inside. The cook realized my befuddled look when gazing at their menu and offered some advise. I ended up with a large bacon bianca.Pizza came out in great time, looked teasingly tasty and so it began. The pizza was thin, crispy, a little oily but still tickled the top of my pallet.  The bacon was good and the crust was like having a bonus order of bread sticks. Ate half the pizza and boxed up the rest for the ladyfriend and I to enjoy later tonight when we are 3 sheets to the wind.Would go back.  The dining experience isn&#39;t the finest, but then again, it&#39;s a pizza joint. Do they have delivery? I&#39;d probably do that.Update... ladyfriend called it cheesy bread with bacon. Not a bad thing, sounds delish. Think I&#39;ll have another piece."

My boyfriend and I decided to walk here on a Thursday night around 8. It was about halfway full. The ordering system was a little unusual, but nothing wrong with that. We started with the Caesar salad which was actually pretty tasty and not bad for $6. We got a small pepperoni pizza. It was good. I feel like the meat was a little sparse for an extra $2.5, but the flavor was good and it wasn&#39;t overly watery like some wood-fired pizzas ..

It looks like a nice little neighborhood joint. A few tables outside of glorified patio furniture, a simple interior, where your order is called at the counter and you walk over and grab it yourself. If this is your neighborhood joint though, consider yourself very lucky. Craft starts out with a thin yet chewy crust. Instead of opting for the cracker, crispy each piece has a slightly pliable crust that I&#39;m a big fan of. The ingredients are top notch and fresh. The mozzarella cheese on our margherita pie had melted into shiny layers of cheesy goodness with just the right amount of saltiness. The casual nature of the place really stands out as a strength, it&#39;s BYOB which makes it easier of your wallet and a large pie could easily feed 3 -4 people depending on your appetite. We went on a Friday night and they had plenty of space. It&#39;s new though and I wouldn&#39;t count on that staying this way as this place is good enough to garner a following. It wouldn&#39;t be my pick for best pizza in the city, but is close enough with enough strengths (quality/cost, BYOB) that I&#39;ll be coming back."

I think I never went because everything else that has been in that space was horrible, like the Haute and the dog, so I guess I figured it would be bad too! I was wrong! It is awesome, if you didn&#39;t actually see the pizza ovens you would think it was cooked in a brick, fire oven. Not really sure how that is? The manager, John was so super nice and really into his job. He cares about the place as if he owned it and I told him that I hope the owners know how lucky they are to have him, because he rocks!!!

The chipotle chicken was definitely my favorite with excellent proportions of hot peppers and chipotle aoili. The reuben was also solid but a greater ratio of kraut and slightly more corned beef would&#39;ve made it excellent in my opinion. Overall a great place to grab a bite but admittedly expensive if you&#39;re starving."

I&#39;ve been here a few times and everything I have tried has been really good. I&#39;m definitely a fan of the breakfast menu, which offers substantial food for a good price. I really like the breakfast burrito because it&#39;s huge, filled with tons of eggs, cheese, sausage, and veggies. It was so good that I ate the whole thing while driving. I meant to have a bite at the stoplight, but then I couldn&#39;t stop eating something so delicious. It cost me $6. It was a really great deal.The only reason I deducted a star is that there&#39;s something about this place that just seems pretentious. I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it. Maybe it&#39;s that the guy working the register wasn&#39;t particularly friendly and the food doesn&#39;t come out very quickly, making me feel like they&#39;re going to take their sweet time because my time isn&#39;t their priority. Overall, this is a really solid place to grab breakfast or lunch in the area. I love knowing I can depend on not breaking the bank to get something delicious and filling here when I don&#39;t feel like cooking something myself. The service thing was just an impression I got, but certainly wasn&#39;t enough of a deterrent to keep me from coming back. I want to try more on the menu so I can find more favorites!"

I have ordered the M.B.T. breakfast croissant ($5) every time because it is so delicious and affordable. The croissant is big, flaky perfection and the fillings are bountiful. The M.B.T. croissant is like eating a sandwich with a whole gigantic omelette inside, filled with many eggs, fresh mozzarella, basil, and roasted tomato (hence the M.B.T. acronym). This big baby will fill me up for half a day easily!My only caveat is that there are tables to sit, free wifi, but no outlets! When I first came here, I intended to spend several hours there working on my laptop, but that wasn&#39;t possible. Additionally, service is a little slow at times. The first time I came here, it seemed a little understaffed and it took ~five minutes before anyone noticed me waiting to order (they seemed preoccupied with a big catering order). So, if you&#39;re in a big hurry, it might be a better idea to pick up one of their many pre-made foods, including healthy options like a quinoa salad.The morning after a party, my out-of-town friend asked me what the best filling breakfast food was nearest to the apartment and I had my answer before she could finish her sentence: Wicker Basket Cafe, of course! I will continue to recommend Wicker Basket for his delicious food, generous portions, and reasonable prices. Perhaps I&#39;ll even venture further on the menu my next visit and see what else WBC has to offer! Until then, I will enthusiastically recommend those breakfast sandwiches. I hope this business will stick around for a long time in Wicker Park/Uke Village!"

Well, our first stop was Wicker Basket, and that was the end of our &#34;exploring the neighborhood cafes&#34; idea. We were HOOKED! We started going there about once a week and now always think of them when we have guests in town and need to grab breakfast or are hosting and want to do sandwiches.My fave is the grilled chicken panini, and their chicken salad is my second fave. My husband loves their MBT panini. We also love their power panini from the breakfast menu. Their portions are huge and their prices are great-you can&#39;t go wrong. I always try to save half of my sandwiches for later but they are too good, I just can&#39;t do it.We also had some boxed lunches ordered for my daughter&#39;s birthday and they were so easy to work with-friendly, on time, no mistakes or confusion.

Walking west of Damen on Division, I was in the mood for... something. What it was, I didn&#39;t know but it certainly wasn&#39;t anything I was coming across. Just when I was ready to throw in the towel (and throw a tantrum), I came across WBC. I&#39;d never heard of it, but it looked promising -- from the outside. A quick check of my handy-dandy Yelp app and I saw that my hopes were supported by stars. Nice! I made my way inside and prepared for a nice lunch.I received it. The atmosphere is what you might expected at a Wickrainian Park-Village cafe but with 50% less angry, disaffected hipsters. There was more than a touch of, dareIsayit, Bucktown at this cafe... but that suited me just fine. I perused the menu and looked at the salads in the display case and came upon a plan of attack. To sate my hunger, I&#39;d get a sandwich with chips. To sate my sweeth tooth, I&#39;d get a jumbo M&amp;M cookie. To quench my thirst, I&#39;d go with San Pellegrino Limonata. It might have been the perfect lunch.I sat down at the table with my fizzy citrus soda and contemplated my cookie. Using all of my self-control, I determined to wait until after I&#39;d eaten my meal to enjoy my dessert. A short while after, I was served my grilled chicken panini on a proper plate -- with silverware! Bucktown! My pressed sandwich was a gooey delight of chicken, provolone, black olives, arugula, and sun-dried tomato pesto. Each bite was extremely satisfying but not at all guilt-inducing. That was coming. Paired with chips and between sips of soda, I felt refreshed and ready to take on the rest of my day. Then, I tackled a cookie as large as an Olympian&#39;s discus and I was ready for a nap.

My bf and I came here for a quick bite to eat. The cafe is a lot bigger than I expected. They have a lot of room to sit in the back area and it&#39;s very quiet.We ordered the turkey and pear panini and the hawaiian sandwich. All their meats are boar&#39;s head, which is a plus. When the sandwiches came out, it was a pretty decent size. The bread both sandwiches were very good. I really don&#39;t have any complaints about the sandwiches. The sides we ordered included the tuna pasta and the tomato and mozzerlla salad. Both were decent, but I&#39;d like to try some of their other sides, like the twice baked potato, mac n cheese, and other pastas.They have a large selection of sandwiches to pick from too. I&#39;m hoping to go there again and try their antipasto sandwich, ultimate grilled cheese, meatball sub, and their rueben panini.I only wish that they would be open later. They close at 6pm on Fridays and I think 8pm on weekdays. Not sure about their weekend hours."

I ordered the tuna sandwich no tomato add avocado and cucumber. The girl taking my order must of been in training because she didn&#39;t seem to knowledgable and was slow to make my tuna sandwich and forgot to put onions on it. Lettuce onion tomato is standard with every sandwich I said no tomato and she even repeated what I wanted back. Even though this is a small mistake I needed onions to balance my sandwich I was so looking forward to. I called to let the owner know I thought maybe he should tell his new staff so no one is ever disappointed like me again especially a first timer. Though he was nice he did not seem too concerned. I will come back because the tuna is delicious but ill know to check my food

They have good coffee and tea and I think the best things on the menu are the power panini for breakfast (grabbed this several times on my way to work) and the turkey and pear panini. I&#39;m pretty sure the turkey and pear panini is the best thing on the menu and you can have half for lunch and half for dinner. They have a couple little tables outside during the summer. Roommate loved it also so obviously they&#39;re doing something right.

Very reasonably priced considering the quality and portions. This is below my house and dangerously close because I crave it constantly. Although I usually just stop in for a sandwich, I recommended it for catering for my company and received many positive compliments on my suggestion- it sounded like everybody loved it! My sister was in town last week and got one of their breakfast paninis and said it was literally the best breakfast sandwich she has ever eaten.I typically call in my sandwich orders as I have found it can take a little long if you are just stoppping by and are in a hurry (10 mins or so).

What kind of place, especially a cafe, does not have WIFI? I understand from a previous review that they did have WIFI at some point and put a time limit on it because they didn&#39;t like campers, but to get rid of it all together? This just sounds like plain bad business. Most people go to cafes to study/work....sounds like the owner doesn&#39;t like people sitting in the many chairs they have...Also, I suggest getting your staff to be more helpful. I understand slicing deli meat is an extremely complex skill but when I stand at the counter for 5 minutes and not one of the 4 people behind the counter ( and one other customer in the store) ask if I need some help then perhaps it&#39;s time to teach them about service.

Two of us went with the Grilled Chicken Panini and and my other friend went for the MBT Panini. The sandwiches were priced pretty reasonable at about $6.95.WB has some tables set up curbiside which make for a delighful lunch  and with enough room in between tables to fit a stroller.

So I live within a 10 second walk from this place but I would only eat anywhere 5-8 times a week if I was in love with it. This place was built because the owners wanted to recreate the healthy aisle of a grocery store in a small sandwich place restaurant and they have succeeded.Their sandwiches and pasta salads are absolutely amazing! They use Boars Head meat and have the best flavors (including cracked pepper mill turkey). And the breads...oh the breads. They have the usuals plus pretzel bread and focaccia. Fresh avocados are cut in front of you if you want it in your sandwich or you can come here instead of going to the grocery store for $.50-$1 each.The service is phenomenal and the outdoor seating is perfect. Although I have only had breakfast there a couple times, my wife eats there all the time. I am pretty sure she can eat the quiche everyday.From the rest of my reviews, you can see how much I like Pot Belly and Jimmy Johns. There is a JJs about 6 doors down that I used to go to all the time. The extra $1 it costs to get a sandwich here is totally worth it."

You can make your own sandwich, grab a small salad or sweet and coffee or take something off the breakfast or lunch sandwich board and menu. The prices are right because I feel like I get a great sandwich for the same price I would pay for a crappy Jimmy John&#39;s sub down the street.Ok- it takes a few minutes for them to make your food as noted by other posters. But, it&#39;s worth it if you want to avoid jimmy johns or subway. You could call ahead and have it waiting for you for pick-up if you are in a pinch.  I am writing today to caution on the panini which was my first foray into a hot sandwich. I always get a cold sandwich and haven&#39;t been disappointed. But that all changed with my corned beef panini.  The thing was gi-nourmous. I expected corned beef, sauerkraut, cheese and 1000 island all melted into one gooey sandwich mess as usual. It was all there. But it didn&#39;t work. The cheese wasn&#39;t melted, the sauerkraut cold and meat over-stuffed to capacity. A panini should be better and wicker basket gets such great and loyal customers and reviews that my expectations for this panini were higher. It won&#39;t deter me from visiting again, but I feel like it was a sloppy attempt at a hot sandwich. Maybe it was an off day on the service.Agree with another poster that free Wi-Fi would be good even though we all have iphone 5s and 4G LTE service. If you are on a laptop and waiting for lunch, it would be helpful.  They have an outdoor cafe in the warm weather months and these days, that is simply  de-rigeur. It really is the cost of doing business.I don&#39;t do much with the grocery part other than grab a drink- I concur with another poster- I don&#39;t get the deli- grocery concept because the offerings are too small to make it a destination stop for any missing kitchen items.I do love being their neighbor, minus the panini."

However, the service still seems to be an issue; after well over a year (maybe two now?), they still can&#39;t seem to figure out how to take an order, how to run the cash register, or how not to misplace our food from counter to table. My boyfriend and I literally have some sort of minor issue every time we go here. Nothing is ever serious enough to prevent our monthly visits, but I really wish they&#39;d get it worked out.

I&#39;m there practically every day. They should name a sandwich after me.The husband-and-wife owners are sweet as pie. Terri, the wife, is an amazing chef and has incorporated many of their family recipes into the menu. There&#39;s sandwiches, salads, pasta salads, fresh-baked bread for sale, casseroles, side dishes, desserts, and grocery items like cheese &amp; crackers, chips, pasta sauce and a few little trinkets like candles, dog treats, etc. I&#39;ve never had anything I didn&#39;t like from there, and trust me, I&#39;ve been there a lot.The only downside is that sometimes the offerings are inconsistent (not their fault, but due to the season). You can go there and have an amazing muffin (for example, the pumpkin spice muffin) only to get attached to if and then one day it&#39;s gone!

Stopped in here today and ordered a side salad and some quinoa salad. The side salad was $2.99 (dirt cheap for Wicker Park), so I was expecting just some dinky greens. Was I pleasantly surprised! I wasn&#39;t paying attention to see who made my salad, but it tasted so incredibly fresh that I&#39;m almost positive they chopped everything up right there! The salad was nothing fancy, but I just wanted something simple and fresh. Not only was it incredibly fresh, it was also a healthy portion that filled up a large dinner plate. The quinoa salad was near perfection, and I felt full, healthy, and happy (that my wallet was still fat) after my lunch. They definitely don&#39;t skimp on quality or portion size here.I&#39;m a picky vegetarian, and I can say I can walk into this café and not worry about perusing for 15 minutes before settling for something I didn&#39;t really have a taste for in the first place. They also have variety of coffee, cheese, and lots of meat options for the meat lovers. They carry Boars Head, which I hear is excellent deli meat. The café itself is very clean and kinda cute too!

There were literally no other people in the place.  When I informed her of that, she began to complain about people who spend 6-7 hours there. How this was relevant to me was unclear.  Her general demeanor was rude and disrespectful.I used to buy Intelligentsia coffee there and try to support the business.  If they hope to keep loyal customers, it would be wise to have this woman avoid contact with patrons.  I would also suggest removing internet service or using a time limit card like other sensible places.  Ask any number of other cafes: Letizia&#39;s, Noble Tree, The Coffee Studio.  These are all places where people are never rude to regular customers.  That&#39;s a pretty bad business practice."

Sometimes I&#39;ll stop at Letizia&#39;s bakery across the street but because it&#39;s hard to maneuver a stroller through their entryway, I opt to walk on the south end of the street to go to wicker basket.So I walked in at lunch time, like I usually do.  It was madness, but more than usual.  It was warm in there with the windows open wide.  The staff seemed frazzled.  I ordered a decaf.  Easy.  Just pump the damn thing.  But I waited off to the side and entertained my daughter who was getting too warm in her stroller.  I looked anxiously at the woman at the register and she acknowledged me with the same nervous glance like, &#34;should I get her coffee or take the rest of these orders?&#34; She appologized.  But continued to take the orders.  What irked me was that their orders would NOT have been delayed in any way if she just pumped my coffee immediately because the staff was still busy fulfilling all the orders before mine. So my baby starts to fidget, squirm, whimper, then wail.  Great!  So I take her out of the car seat and calm her down.  Then the woman pauses and finally fulfills my order.  It took 1 minute to pump it but I waited 11 minutes.  In one arm I carry my daughter, in the other my coffee, while pushing the stroller with my chest to get some sugar. I&#39;m trying not to burn my daughter with the scalding hot coffee and console her at the same time.  Ugh.  Logistically a night mare.  But I eventually have to fight her back into the car seat.  And I&#39;m the sweaty woman with the screaming kid with my head bowed walking quickly out of the restaurant.  No one opened the door for me this time!So I&#39;m deducting 2 stars from my last experience. Boo"

Oh and free Wifi! Definitely a great neighborhood spot!"

Their tuna pasta salad is very delicious, and all of the sandwiches I&#39;ve tried have been great. The salads are usually okay, but sometimes aren&#39;t very fresh... maybe they were premade the day before. The atmosphere is friendly, but the service is very slow. The first time I went it took 4 people to make my 1 sandwich and still took forever. Today I ordered a latte to go and the guy took care of everyone else behind me in line before finally making it. He did apologize for the wait, but it would have made more sense to just make it and then go to the next 5 people in line.Over all I love being able to drop by there and get yummy pasta salads, and sandwiches, and with some better management it could be 5 stars!"

On Saturday, it was because we arrived in Bucktown fresh from our redeye and in desperate need of breakfast, and Red June was one of the few options at 7AM. On Sunday, it was because brunch lines elsewhere did not jive with our packed schedule, and we were already fans of this coffee shop.I got to try both the avocado toast and the mini bagels as my breakfast options. The avocado toast was generously spread with...wait for it...avocado, and also included strawberries, olive oil, and onion in the spread. Simple, delicious, filling. The mini bagels were each topped with cream cheese, incredibly flavorful olive oil, a slice of tomato, and a slice of avocado. The plate came with a side of delightfully fresh fruit. This was a more filling breakfast, but also just as enjoyable. I didn&#39;t get too adventurous with my drinks, and only stuck to drip coffee on both occasions--it did the job.With extremely reasonable prices, friendly staff, easy enough seating, and an unpretentious crowd, Red June was a fantastic breakfast destination for us out-of-towners. Highly recommended!"

We stop by quite often on weekend mornings while walking our dog, which is made especially easy thanks to the outside walk up window (I&#39;m not as comfortable as others tying up my dog to wait outside).The donuts and breakfast pastries are always fresh (and sprinkles are usually themed if you&#39;re stopping by during a holiday of some sort) and the service is always quick. I also love that they have some outdoor seating and have in the past stopped by with my laptop or a book and enjoyed an iced coffee while my dog kept watch over the neighborhood squirrels. Come to think of it, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever actually been inside, ha. One of these days we&#39;ll get around to ordering a breakfast or lunch sandwich as they always look very tempting.Though the employees are always friendly, they sometimes are very confused/annoyed when I ask them to see the stand with the donut offerings for the day--I don&#39;t think this is a crazy/unreasonable request as the variety isn&#39;t always the same and there is no menu posted! This is literally the only reason I&#39;m not giving 5 stars, but unfortunately it&#39;s happened often enough to keep this from being a &#34;perfect&#34; review."

I find methods such as this (&#34;yelping&#34;) to be unproductively passive aggressive. HOWEVER, the quality of food I received from Red June was ABHORRENT for such simple recipes, and upon calling the restaurant I was told there was no manager or owner available. Even worse, instead of being receptive to any criticisms, the woman who answered my call claimed that I was offending HER with my complaint! I&#39;m sorry to have inconvenienced them with my complaint! I understand--guests and clients are extremely unforgiving and the way I&#39;ve been treated by people in the past serving tables counts as borderline emotional and psychological abuse. BUT THERE IS ALWAYS, MOST CERTAINLY ROOM TO ACKNOWLEDGE FAILURE AND WORK TO CORRECT IT. This industry is for the thick skinned.What&#39;s actually offensive is spending $30 of my hard earned money and receiving their Classic Italian sandwich (seemingly a play on a caprese) to find it missing mozzarella (one of THREE of the only/main ingredients!!) and finding one slice of tomato and one sad basil leaf as the contents of the &#34;sandwich&#34;!What&#39;s actually offensive is receiving their Cobb Burrito with turned bleu cheese (by the way--who puts bleu cheese in a burrito?!) and being told that &#34;that&#39;s how bleu cheese is supposed to taste&#34;!! No. I have eaten, and continue to eat bleu cheese. Just no. WORSE YET, the salsa it was served with comes straight from a TOSTITO&#39;s salsa jar!!!!! I know that cheap, watered down Super Bowl Sunday flavor anywhere! I felt like I was being punked! Had me lookin around like, &#34;Where&#39;s Ashton?!&#34;What&#39;s actually offensive is looking to an establishment to provide you a service that makes your life easier, and having your life made more difficult instead. The food was inedible, insulting, and inconvenienced my day!What&#39;s offensive is that, as a server who works hard for her money, and enjoys supporting other local businesses in Chicago&#39;s restaurant industry, Red June did not even attempt to earn my money or solidify a mark that reflects the strength and integrity of Chicago&#39;s Restaurant Industry.Further, by refusing to discuss the issue without being &#34;offended&#34;, it seems they have no interest in correcting the issues and maintaining basic service industry standards.Please step your game all the way up, Red June. You&#39;re embarrassing the rest of us. Zero stars if Yelp would allow it. Or 5 stars for being the worst."

They sat there for an additional ~10 minutes until the hostess finally packed our food.I did hear the blonde owner talk with another patron how Sunday&#39;s were worse bc people are hungover and rude.

I was in a sandwich kind of mood, which doesn&#39;t strike often, so I took advantage of it. I ordered the California Dreamin, which consisted of turkey with tomato, swiss, and avocado on toasted grain bread. At first, when Igot my smallish sandwich at $8.25, I felt the price was a bit much BUT, some delicious kettle chips were included and after being almost overly satiated, I felt like the price point had been somewhat redeemed.On a separate trip, I grabbed one of the crumb cake muffins and it was soooooo good. Dangerous, even. I wish I could vouch for the coffee, but I had unlimited keurig where I was staying, so no need.My overall takeaway was that it&#39;s a cozy little spot (possibly a little claustrophobic) indoors, but a nice quiet outdoor space to grab a bite, or a cup, to enjoy whilst alone or with a friend. Service was a tiny bit slow, but only because I&#39;ve been brainwashed by the speed of other fast casual establishments."

The hours aren&#39;t as long as some places, but that&#39;s fine for such a tiny coffee shop. Unfortunately the day I finally made it over their steam wand was down. I guess that happens, but seemed odd. They still had espresso at least, and doing iced drinks, and accommodated my request for less ice. He iced latte was fine. Unlike ipsento they didn&#39;t ask about my milk preference. I&#39;m usually fine with whole milk in cafe-bought lattes because it complements the coffee better, but it was honestly pretty thick and overwhelming in my iced latte today.They were very accommodating to others getting food who didn&#39;t want coffee but ask for cups of water or ice.They have free, closed wifi networks.

And when I first moved to this area, I was actually a little sad that there wasn&#39;t a convenient Starbucks on my way to the train. Then I tried Red June. Fantastic.I love a vanilla latte. I know it&#39;s not the fanciest of coffee-shop drinks, but for some reason a lot of places have a hard time making a decent one. They to tend taste more like hot milk than a tasty espresso-based beverage. Not the case at Red June. The latte was perfectly strong. They know their coffee here.I also ordered breakfast on my first visit. I ordered an egg sandwich on a bagel, fully expecting a small, microwave-like disappointment that would hold me over until lunch. Instead, they delivered a large and well prepared breakfast sandwich on a fresh and yummy bagel with a side of beautiful fresh fruit. Filling and tasty.The atmosphere is casual and comfortable. You could easily bring your laptop and hang out here comfortably.If I had one complaint, it would be they typically only have one person working. That one person is making the drinks and the food so at the busiest of times, like my morning commute to the train, having an additional set of hands behind the counter would probably makes things move along a little quicker."

I live around the corner and have been probably a dozen times over the last year.Its just so slow and understaffed. The single employee working today was trying to do coffee, all good prep, and take orders.Needless to say, the line was ridiculously long for extremely simple orders. He didn&#39;t even get to making my sandwich until about 10-15 minutes after the bagel my girlfriend ordered was already out. When it&#39;s all said and done, it&#39;ll be a 30 minute+ trip to the coffee shop.I&#39;ll probably just start walking the extra couple minutes to Starbucks instead.

Friendly hidden gem that unless you&#39;re living around the area you wouldn&#39;t know about it unless you see a review online. (Especially from The Richlatino Chicagorican that speaks Spanglish not Spanish) The food menu has a variety of different options that cater for breakfast and lunch. Also have some vegan/vegetarian options as well. They have WiFi especially if you need to get work done. It&#39;s almost having a cafe spot that feels right at home when I am sitting right here. Music is really great and not loud like other cafe shops. I can guarantee if you have never been here or if you live in the area and didn&#39;t know about this gem it will take you from June to July through all the months wanting to come back. So for Red June Cafe I give them my personal 5 star recommendation on all to come check this place out. Friendly atmosphere, great music, awesome decor. Yumtastic options its great!"

Also cantaloupe.I had an iced coffee as well (my life force) and it was pretty standard. The walk up window for to-go orders was &#34;cute&#34; if you have dogs or children (so all of Bucktown).The only truly disturbing and tragic part about this place was that they have a special room in the center that masquerades as a cozy den but do not be fooled: it is expressly for screaming children and their overworked, early thirties mothers who smile weakly when you look at them as if to say, &#34;where did my soul go?&#34;"

Tucked away on a quiet corner, Red June is a great place to grab a quick bite for brunch. All of the pastry items looked phenomenal, but we were in a savory mood. I built my own breakfast sandwich on an english muffin, with bacon, egg, and cheese. It was huge and really tasty! It also came with a side of fresh fruit. The boyfriend ordered the breakfast burrito, complete with hash browns, cheddar, eggs, and sausage; he was thrilled, to say the least. Both of our dishes were very reasonably priced, at $5.50 and $7.75, respectively.We both ordered coffees and loved that they serve Julius Meinl. There isn&#39;t a ton of seating, but we didn&#39;t have any trouble finding a table. Overall, great option for a quick bite for breakfast.

It was light and fluffy but still dense and crumbly like a cake donut should be.  The outside was coated in sugar and the pumpkin flavor was pretty strong, deeeelish.The restaurant itself is small and adorable, and is so cozy you feel as if you&#39;re inside someone&#39;s house.  I sat in the back corner in a room by myself and did some work, but sadly I had to head home before I could try any of their sandwiches for lunch."

The RUDE woman with long blonde hair took my order (Three drinks and food). To go.When I got home the food was not how I asked for it and my drink was one of the worst things I have ever tasted-- Worse than Red June has ever made it in the past. I called Red June and When I explained that the food was wrong... She said &#34;Yea I know you ordered it like that, but we always serve it this other way-that&#39;s a given&#34;You have to be kidding right? This was the &#34;build your own&#34; option on the menu. I asked for it one way and you made it another. End of story-YUCK!As for the drink, She also told me.. yes that&#39;s how its always made. (Being that Ive been coming here for two years and the coffee and tea are both usually good. Today&#39;s &#34;milk of magnesia flavored latte&#34; was NOT PALPABLE.  Im going to say once again YUCK)At this point She implyed that I was wanting something for free and I told her TRUST ME I DON&#39;T want ANYTHING from you-- (while I was thinking...I might never survive the poison.)Long story short the food is USUALLY okay... the coffee is USUALLY pretty good... and the Customer Service has ALWAYS been absolute SH*T.If you don&#39;t like people, then please do us all a favor and get out of the service industry!!"

I understand pouring an espresso over ice, voila, an iced americano!  But hot coffee over ice = watered down, luke-warm coffee.The food took about 30 minutes and was honestly pretty good, hence the 2 stars. It was hard for us to appreciate the food because we were so aggravated by our service. Very rude to take our order in front of 4 other customers and then because we aren&#39;t  &#34;regulars&#34; yet, wait and watch while all 4 of those other people (who ordered after us) received their food AND coffee before us.We want to like this place!

Since the wait was unbearable for our rumbling stomachs, we decided to venture further into Buck Town to find an alternative. I noticed Red June wasn&#39;t very popular, yet still highly recommended.When I first saw the cafe, I was about to open up my Yelp app again and start hunting for a new spot since I was hesitant about how good their breakfast items would be. However, my stomach was not about to let me trek anymore for food.I decided to order the mini bagels, which came with a fresh fruit bowl. The bagels were topped with a thin layer of cream cheese, tomato, and avocado; it had a light drizzle of olive oil and some black pepper. The fruit bowl consisted of FRESH blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and grapes. The dish was so simple, yet very satisfying. Unlike other eateries, I did not feel overly full and the meal was perfectly portioned. Also the fruit bowl was the freshest fruit bowl I have ever had. I&#39;m so use to getting lame bowls that are filled with overly ripened cantaloupe and honeydew, so I really enjoyed that this bowl was different and fresh. The bagels were so good and I loved the hint of olive oil that I got with each bite.Red June is definitely a hidden gem and will give you healthier brunch items. A+ in my book."

Bring your dog up to the window for a hello and a treat. All of their drinks are yum, their breakfast foods are delish (the chicken salad sandwich and egg croissant are my personal faves). Just give yourself about 10 mins to wait if you order food &amp; coffee at the window. This place is meant for you to relax."

Even get a side of fruit with it :)

In addition to coffee (which I assume is good, but as a non-coffee person, I don&#39;t know for sure) and good tea, they also have a really nice menu. My favorite is the mini-bagels with tomato, olive oil, and avocado. Many of the sandwiches come with a cup of fruit, which I have always found to be deliciously fresh, even in the dead of winter. It&#39;s nice to have a breakfast option in the neighborhood that is fairly healthy.Since this is a fairly small place, it can tend to get crowded. I will say that I&#39;ve always eventually managed to get a place to sit, even on very crowded weekend mornings, which is great. It can get a little noisy in there if you are trying to read or work, what with people coming and going and the loud frothing machine, but that&#39;s true of pretty much every coffee shop. And they do have a little back room where you can sit and where things are a little quieter (so long as there are no little kids in there!).The only reason why this isn&#39;t a higher-star review is the customer service. Especially when things are busy, I&#39;ve noticed that the staff tends to ignore customers. I get that they are trying to serve two windows at once and are preparing food and drinks all on their own, but it really does make a difference when a staff member acknowledges your presence and says, &#34;I&#39;ll be with you in a minute&#34; or something when you walk in and are standing at the counter. I&#39;ve stood at the counter sometimes for several minutes without having my presence acknowledged at all, which is off-putting. I&#39;ve also had the experience of getting the wrong thing or never getting something I ordered, which is made worse when you have to stand at the counter for several minutes trying to catch one of the staff members&#39; eyes before you can even request that they correct their mistake. But, when you finally do get their attention, the staff members have always been perfectly nice."

We called an order in and when we got to the walk-up window to pick it up, the employee asked what we wanted. We told her we were picking an order up and she just said, &#34;Yeah, it&#39;s not ready.&#34; Okay...?Another time, we went to the walk-up window and asked if they had a menu we could look at.

I really like how all the food is made to order instead of tossed into a microwave.  I easily love it more than starbucks.Now for the bad - They seemed to really struggle with a larger order.  We had four drinks and four plates.  I understand that it takes a little while to put the drinks and food together, but they came out so far apart that people were done with their meals by time the next plate arrived.  Folks behind us were getting drinks so they could be on their way.  That would be fine (since we dined in), except you have already started giving us our order.  Once you&#39;ve committed to an order, those folks should be served all their drinks (seems like the right thing anyway).  Lastly, they forgot one of the sandwiches all together. I appriciate that they quickly fixed the situation.I will definetely return as the place had so much charm.  I&#39;m positive the next experience will be better."

I love eggs and eat them very often in many different forms.So, what else was I to order but an egg sandwich. The eggs were done perfectly. Light and fluffy and insanely enjoyable. Best of all, there was a good amount of eggs in the sandwich too. It also came with a side of fruit as part of the package. That was pretty sweet as well. Have a sandwich and then have some fruit with it.I should mention the smoothie that I got. It was slightly too thick at first for me, but it was still a real tasty smoothie made in house.I liked the vibe here. Modern with an old school coffee house touch to it. There was even a small lounge off to the side where one could just sit and relax. I would&#39;ve liked to do that if I wasn&#39;t rushing out on my lunch break.

And the rude response is that we should find a table and then come back..? So for all of you that haven&#39;t been here the place is so small that you could softly speak your order from your table and they could hear you at the front.

It&#39;s small, quaint and deliciously old-fashioned and a tad derelict but it makes it all the more comfortable.Precious in the middle of Bucktown.Get a seat in the little room in the back - there are couches and a fireplace. Settle with a creamy café au lait (served in a mug) and you are good to stay.Winner.Like: they have 4 sizes for drinks; the traditional small, medium and large, and a JUG to go!!!!!

Typically I&#39;m not crazy about Bucktown - too yuppiefied, too chi-chi, bad energy all around. And the parking sucks. But Red June is cute, on a quiet side of Leavitt, and there was actually ample free street parking (1pm weekday).This is a coffeehouse like coffehouses used to be, kind of quiet, limited food menu, and lots of coffee. But did we have coffee? No! We had lunch.I had the panini with mozzarella, tomato, and basil, and my friend had a turkey sandwich. I had kind of hoped for more than one vegetarian option, but, like I said, this is a small place. The panini was really good. The mozzarella tasted fresh, not Kraft.My friend said her turkey tasted clean and fresh. Even though it was not organic, she was very pleased.I ordered the apple crisp for dessert. It is served warm. I have to say, I was not real impressed. The apples were mushy, and the baker had a very heavy hand with the cinnamon. You can get this with whipped cream, but even I have to shy away from so many extra calories.I only ate about two bites of the apple crisp - the portion was huge - and took it home. After about 3 hours in the fridge, it actually tasted better. The cool crisped up the apples a bit. They did not seem so mushy.All in all, a pleasant experience. I would go back."

Its located on 26st and Lawndale in Little Village aka Little Mexico, the largest Mexican Community in the Midwest. Im VERY proud to be from this neighborhood because when you want TRUE AUTHENTIC Mexican Food, you come to Little Village.Nuevo Leon has been a staple in our community for decades and the restaurant took off so well, that the brothers decided to open a second restaurant in neighboring, Pilsen, and the brothers went on their separate ways, business wise.As Pilsen starting changing, prompted that owner to &#34;remodel&#34;.When you come to little village, its a basic restaurant. Its a five star cuisine on a 2 star budget. Thats as honest as I can be. Its not as gruesome as things, Ive heard about the pilsen, and its wayyy different. Anyone thats talks bad about a place, but goes 3 or 4 times, I question their reviews.This place has a cozy feeling and has a nice room for events and also does catering. Weekends they have kareokee as well as sometimes they will have Mariachi.I just noticed they have &#34;Cabrito de Monterrey&#34;, sorry but I will pass on that!When you order, you will be brought a free little individual appetizer. Sometimes it will be a sample of beef meat with red mild sauce with a small tortilla, sometimes its consume which is a soup. After your finished, your brought your dessert. Nothing fancy, sometimes its warm baked sweet potato in its own syrup, sometimes its a fruit salad. Its free and nowadays, places dont do this, let alone for free. I think its the owners nice touch.This place is know  for their platillos. My favorite is the tampiqueña. It has a half order (you can order a full order of meat which is huge or you can order half order of meat), comes with a carne asada (I ask for mine medium well, also comes with one suiza enchilada de queso, guacamole, potatos, grilled onions soooo good, and their famous yummy refried beans and your choice of corn or flour tortillas.Their horchatas are awesome n of course have liquor, beer and soda and mexican sodas and freshly squeezed juices.When you come, be open minded and enjoy a traditional mexican meal in a mexican family owned restaurant.Below is a picture of my Platillo- La tampiqueña (Carne Asada/Cheese Enchiladas/refried beans/Guacamole/Grilled Onions/Grilled Jalepeño pepper/potatoes/tortillas/Second pic is some of my mix fruit salad after dinner.....so refreshing."

I don&#39;t typically like going out for Mexican food (my usual thought is, &#34;I can just cook it myself&#34;). But Nuevo Leon is always my choice if I ever do go out for Mexican. The chicken fajitas are my favorite. Usually by the time I get them though, I&#39;m already full off of the complimentary apps (chips and typically a taco). I also love the fact that they give you like 5 different types of salsas at your salsa. I always have leftovers. They usually give complimentary deserts too. I brought my parents here and they loved it too. Overall, a great laid back place with great authentic food. Just an fyi for those who care, they do not have fountain drinks. So no free refills."

Then the food you actually order, and just when you think there&#39;s no way you could possibly eat another bite . . . they hit you with strawberries and cream to finish off the meal.Eating at Nuevo Leon may have spoiled me for all future Mexican restaurants because I&#39;ll just be wondering &#34;what only one kind of salsa?&#34; and &#34;You know what would be the perfect ending to this meal?

We went to El Milagro but he wanted something with waitresses and nice atmosphere, and El Milagro is just a fast kitchen type restaurant, but still awesome food in my opinion.First thing you notice when you enter Nuevo Leon is the plethora of Mexican art murals depicting the various Mexican area&#39;s in beautiful colors. One would wonder where the connection of artifacts and music in the background connects to this particular restaurant, but honestly who cares, it&#39;s one of the hottest spots for Mexican food; two of the greatest things ever wrapped into one!  This place scores a 5 on atmosphere alone, but it&#39;s a restaurant so let&#39;s leave the overall score up to the food.Our meal started with the typical Mexican fare of Chips and Salsa (complimentary) so we ordered the Queso Fundido (which is a chihuahua cheese melted with chili chiles and green peppers. At first I was like, uh oh it&#39;s hardening really fast, but when I tasted it, honestly I almost passed out with the nice and sweet flavored cheese.   My gosh this was enough for 4 so since we were two, we took some home.He had the birria (goat meat) with rice and beans and of course I gravitated towards the Chili Rellenos. The waitress was nice enough to say I could have a cheese and the other can also be a ground beef mixture. Good lord these rellenos were wonderful, again they had queso fundido (melted cheese) and it added the right texture to the perfectly battered and seasoned chiles. The beans were like my (dearly departed) grandmas and I knew it was going to be a good day after this. And most Mexican restaurants we go to always have SUPER loud music in the background which stops conversation, but this place had the music on, but low enough to have great talk. I totally can appreciate that.I highly recommend this place if you want something SUPER AUTHENTIC, and as a finicky latino who loves his latin foods, this is as good as it gets. SERIOUSLY! I use to frequent this place back in the early 90&#39;s and I so wasn&#39;t disappointed in the least. For $32 with appetizer, coffee, home made tortillas, chips, salsa, queso fundido and here goes, the waitress at the end brought us dessert! It consisted of apples, granola, raisins, a yogurt with mangos. Oh my god they took me back and I will be returning, She so deserved that TIP for real."

I can&#39;t even begin to describe. My fiance and I went to this place because he had the flu, he got a caldo de pollo with vegetables &amp; i got chilaquiles.*We asked if this is the same owner as the one on 18th because we loved that place, they said no, they just share the same name. So thank god! this place is just a NO!First, the food took FOREVER we were about to walk out and the server saw us so she came rushing to us to get us our water.When he got his caldo the chicken was half way cooked, i dont even think it was cooked! It still had pink! smelled horrible. So he told the server and she came back saying the owner took a look at it and this chicken is over cooked....Overcooked? It was pink!!! so whatever he returned it but asked for no chicken. I asked who&#39;s the owner and she said the lady at the register. She was on the phone sitting on her chair.My chilaquiles, were the worst I had. It was those hard chips they give you with your salsa, but they just covered it with TOMATO SAUCE! Chilaquies are with CHILE! The rice was covered with salsa and it was just the worst... We didn&#39;t finish our food, we left &amp; we are NEVER EVER going back to this place! the Nuevo leon on 18th is WAAAYYYY better. Don&#39;t go here!!!!!!!"

The dishes were very greasy.  I know most mexican places are not going to skimping on the fat but it would be nice not to get the tortillas of my tacos bathed in grease.Also, the refried beans had way too much lard, I could&#39;ve baked a pie crust with them.  That being said, the tacos and beans were fairly tasty but nothing to write home about.The horchata was decent too but they served it with almost no ice, which is kinda weird in the middle of the hellishly hot summer we&#39;ve been having (same thing with the water too, maybe their ice machine was on the fritz).My wife had the shrimp, which came in like a fajita style.  Again it was served up with a good dollop of grease, not as much as my tacos though. And it also was overcooked a bit because all the vegetables were somewhat mushy, almost stewed. The ingredients did seem fairly fresh though, too bad they did not maximize that on the plate. The taste was also pretty good, at least my wife enjoyed it.The service was also quite spotty.  It was nice getting a complimentary appetizer, beans and carne with a tortilla, as we sat down.  But then our waitress at the end overcharged us a bit for what we had.  She promptly adjusted it when we told her though.  But that wasn&#39;t too surprising when I could see her looking over at our table at the end and trying to remember and add up what we had in her head (maybe next time write it down at the get go). She also was mia, especially at the end when we were ready to get out of there. She was preoccupied getting the forks and knives ready for the next days service.So overall, this last experience was my worst. Yet having been there a few times I know it is not typically that bad but it has never been very memorable either. There prices are pretty good, although I&#39;d be happy to pay a bit more if they could improve what they put on the table.Last words I&#39;d say decent but overhyped."

The staff is great!

I agree with Leo, If you are latin@ you will feel right at home and will appreciate delicious food and the hard working people! A lot of the complaints are kinda ridiculous, people will p 14$ and up for tacos at Rick Bayless&#39;s  restaurant but ask them to pay more than 3$ for tacos in Pilsen and they get upset!

I got there and the food was all packed up and ready to go which is great. However I was a little shocked to find out my bill was over $12 for 3 steak tacos with a side of rice &amp; beans. It could have been because I ordered flour tortillas instead of corn and added avocado to the tacos that the price got jacked up. Anyway, I thought this was a cheap restaurant with great food and service? I was very disappointed.The tacos tasted good when I looked past the fact that they were extremely greasy and a bit too salty. The only thing that made them good was the homemade tortillas.

They always present a complimentary appetizer and dessert, and these have been different each time I go in. I usually go in for lunch during the weekday, and sometimes I only have twenty minutes to spare.

So, my girlfriend and I went last night feelings of excitement and empty stomachs. The waitress was very nice and she brought us salsas along with chips. First, the chips were incredibly stale. I was so disappointed because I thought that they would be crisp and warm - boy was I wrong. Next, we ordered a carne asada sope and tacos de asada. The tortillas were cold and the skirt steak was not well seasoned. The only reason I am giving it two stars was because the decor was actually very authentic and because I was tipsy - everything tastes better when you&#39;re tipsy. On the other hand, the bathrooms were incredibly disgusting. However, I will say this. I have been to the Nuevo Leon restaurant in Pilsen. I 100% recommend going to that restaurant than this one.

Our hotel gave us a $10 off coupon, so figured might as well give it a shot. We arrived around noon and were seated right away by a friendly hostess. We opted for outdoor seating and within a minute our waters were filled and our small preset plates were swapped out for non dusty ones. I was tempted by the bellinis but had been drinking enough the previous few days that I decide to give the liver a rest and went for a cup of hot chocolate instead. The food menu was a good size, with varied options but not overwhelming, which made for easy decisions.I decided on the Benedict with Prosciutto and my guy got the Short Ribs Hash. They were served with toast and arrived in a timely manner and an appropriate temperature. My eggs were perfectly poached and the English muffin toasted well. A few of my potatoes were slightly undercooked but no biggie since the dish came with so many. The only thing I would have changed is to serve the toast with some butter or better yet homemade jam. It was dry on its own, though after eating the muffins I probably didn&#39;t need the toast anyway.The outdoors atmosphere was casual for noon on a weekend, but indoors it definitely was a classy affair and I would be sure to dress up a bit if coming for dinner. Our sever Chris was prompt and attentive, present at appropriate intervals and always had an answer for our questions. We ended up charging the bill to our hotel room to take advantage of the $10 coupon, so that made paying easy. All in all a good experience and I would return for brunch."

We were seated promptly upstairs. I really enjoyed the space as it was classic and quite fancy. It was nice and quiet, as we were able to converse with ease.We shared the carpaccio di polpo, crostini de peche, and the buffala for the apps. These were all pretty good, but not amazing. While I enjoyed the flavors of the octopus dish especially with the arugula topping, everything on the plate pretty much could have equaled one bite. I wasn&#39;t expecting hefty portions, but I probably would not get that dish again.I got the ahi tuna salad (rare). Presentation here is definitely very nice. While I enjoyed the salad overall, I wasn&#39;t all that impressed. The tuna pieces were unevenly cooked and the grill on the outside was inconsistent with each piece, as some were more cooked while others were more rare. I could have also used a few more olives. All the ingredients and flavors went well together though.The best thing here was the focaccia bread brought out to us in the beginning, accompanied by a yummy tomato olive oil spread, as this was the only thing that was truly memorable to me.Overall, food was pretty good. Our server was pretty good. We didn&#39;t have to wait too long for service. This is a good place to go for a client meeting or an important team outing or other occasion to impress someone, as options are limited in the loop, since most place are all pretty standard and serve generic bar food. Aside from that reason though, there are better options for food with similar price tags in general."

The carrot flavor was strong and was a fresh start to the meal.  My boyfriend had the Buffala, which is grilled buffalo mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto with artichokes and sun dried tomato pesto and balsamic.  It was a good but a little on the salty side.For entrees, we had the Tortelloni di Zucca, which was homemade and filled with butternut squash and brown butter sage sauce.  The tortelloni was great, but the sauce was a little too oily for my taste.Finally, for dessert, we had the Torta di Formaggio con Espresso (Espresso Cheesecake).  The cheesecake had a great chocolate crust and some delicious fresh berries on the side.Overall, the atmosphere was very inviting and the service was fast.  It was a great restaurant for a three-course meal in under one hour."

Our waitress was very friendly and recommended a great wine. We ordered the dry aged New York strip and the Bucatini Carbonara.The steak was absolutely perfect and very hearty, I believe it was 12oz and was served with tasty roasted potatoes. I tried my girlfriend&#39;s pasta dish and it was also quite delicious.A great upscale place for a meal if you&#39;re near by or just want to stop by the bar.

He&#39;s gone here often as it&#39;s close to our office so I figured I&#39;d give it a shot. We had a noon reservation and were seat immediately. The waiter took our drink order and we were left to check out the menu. All the options are pretty reasonably priced for a loop restaurant near the theater district and there was even a 3 course lunch deal for $29. My colleague opted for the lobster bisque soup, a pasta dish, and then sorbet for dessert off of their lunch deal menu. I opted for the pollo panini as I wanted something a little lighter for lunch.While we waited we got a basket of bread which was very good. The basket had a few different types of bread which weren&#39;t right out of the oven but were still soft and very fresh. While we were sitting at our table the restaurant around us started filling up. Two different groups were seated at tables near us and placed their orders long after we did. This generally isn&#39;t an issue until those same people start receiving their food before you do. We brought this up with our waiter and he went off to check on our food. Moments later the manager stopped by and said our food would be right out.When our food finally arrived it was pleasant enough. My colleague enjoyed the pasta but because we waited so long for our food he had to get his sorbet to go... My panini was lukewarm at best but tasted fine. Perhaps it was left sitting in the kitchen for 20 minutes.Would I return? Probably not. We were seated for 90 minutes at the restaurant and barely got through our lunch. The fact that it took that long to cook a plate of pasta and throw a panini together is embarrassing. The food would probably warrant 3 stars but the service was terrible bringing this down to 2 stars."

I specifically asked them to throw in some fava beans as I noticed they were on the menu elsewhere and I love them. They put the salmon on a bed of romaine and fava beans.

Everything started off great as I secured a seat at the non-crowded bar and settled in to watch the Thursday PM NFL game. Bartender was spot on and I quickly received a delicious adult beverage. I ordered the Caesar salad and the black ink pasta.My salad arrived without delay and it looked wonderful. However it had a creamy taste to it. I expected a sharper taste with my Caesar salad. I believe someone else commented on the creamy Caesar salad as well. The kicker was finding a hair at the bottom of the salad. My first instinct was to just report, pay, and leave. But, unfortunately, hunger got the better of me. The bartender was apologetic and the manager, I believe, stopped by a few minutes later to apologize as well. She asked me if I had already ordered my entrée. She then asked if I had ordered another drink, yes and yes. She then smiled at me and said well, OK... and walked away. I see that 312 reads and responds to reviews so here is some advice use this situation as a learning experience. When I worked in the food industry and this situation would occur, and it did, I would:- Apologize- State of course you will not be charged for the salad- Offer a complimentary cocktail or dessert- Come back to check in before the patron leftNow on to my entrée. I have never had black ink pasta and seafood with a creamy buttery like sauce. Creamy seems to be the standard theme here. It was OK but I have certainly had better. Oh and finally it took forever for my entrée to appear. The bartender stated there was a large party upstairs. Well it did not effect the diner aside of me who ordered after me but received her pasta and was finished before I even received mine.When I asked for my check the bartender, a good guy, stated that I will not be charged for the hairy salad, hooray!Always follow your initial instinct."

Very delicious, but we were only given 3 pieces. Fortunately we only had 2 people, as with more folks it would be just a tiny bite for each person.For the entree we both had fish. I ordered the salmon, which to my pleasant surprise could be cooked to order as I don&#39;t see many places doing that. I asked for a medium and the center was nice and soft. My friend ordered the sea bass, which came with delicious perfect grilled crispy skin. Both were delicious!Overall it was a good experience.

I ate here this past weekend with one of my best friends and her family. Entering the restaurant, the interior reminded me of a hotel which was perfectly fitting since this restaurant is located in the loop. It was Saturday night at around 7PM and we were seated with no wait. Initially we chose this spot because we saw there was outdoor seating, but sadly the rain has been pounding the city as of late so we ate inside.The servers started us off with some bread and tapenade. One of the loaves was just a standard roll while the other had herbs baked into it. It was a nice way to begin the meal, but like most restaurants I wish the bread was served warm.We all split a kale salad, hawaiian fish, and ravioli. The kale salad was light and the greens were vibrant- it was a small, but pleasing dish. Next, the ravioli was very flavorful and stuffed with ricotta and chicken. Combined with the butter sauce, it was a very heavy dish, but the ravioli was cooked to a perfect al dente. The hawaiian fish came covered in a mess of avocados, capers and tomatoes- I didn&#39;t even notice the fish. But underneath it all was a perfectly cooked filet- slightly browned on the outside and very tender. Nothing too special about the service, but the food was pretty good!"

With no reservations, we were cutting it close to the show time at 6:45 pm. When we mentioned this to the hostess, she assured us that she would have us &#34;in and out&#34; in no time at all. True to her words we got our order in less than 10 minutes without compromising the quality of food or service! We did not feel rushed and we made it to the theater with a few minutes to spare. Loved the Brussels sprouts and the burratta salad! Top notch service and great food! Definitely coming back!!"

Atmosphere is upbeat busy but comfortable. Service was very attentive.Faro Island Salmon was delicious. As was the waiter suggested pairing of the Alto Adige Pinot Noir.The food was quite tasty and well prepared, and also felt healthy and light -- a big plus for Chicago.Pasta entrees keep it in the $$ range, anything else can get pricey but not extreme.Didn&#39;t give it 5* because of the limited lower priced options. But, considering that it&#39;s a hotel restaurant in an upscale neighborhood, not out of line.Decent value, enjoyed it, will  go back."

It&#39;s just difficult to give the full 5 accolades for a Loop venue that isn&#39;t exceptionally decorated or carefully, strategically located.We started with Caesar salads, which were phenomenal. Probably the best I&#39;ve ever had. Partly because there&#39;s a grand anchovy in the middle, surrounded by the freshest romaine, the perfect amount of cheese, the best dressing, perfectly toasted croutons. It was all around fantastic and worth $8.00. The Melanzane sandwich of breaded eggplant, provolone was delicious, just maybe not $15.00 delicious. Same for the Pollo Panini. Both sandwiches had interesting flavors and were substantial in size, it&#39;s just the price tag that seems ridiculous.For dessert we split the Fruta di Bosca that our wonderful server, Alli, suggested. While we agreed, the mix of fresh berries, mint, ginger gelato was magnifico, I&#39;m not sure $10 for a teaspoon sized scoop of gelato wasn&#39;t anything but highway robbery. But notwithstanding the lunchtime HIGH prices, the meal was yummy and a 1/2 of a sandwich with tasty fries was more than enough for now, especially with the salad, and will carry over for tomorrow as well."

A treat to my parents and kids.  Coffee was like $4 (for drip). Kids Meals were $15 (for small very small sizes).  I ordered the &#34;special&#34; salmon.  What i got was an overcooked, very small piece of fish.Service was weak at best.  Ordered all our food, and when they brought out my 5 year old daughter&#39;s kids meal, they brought her calamari. She ordered spaghetti with meatball.  The waitress never came by to apologize, and while the rest of our table waited our meals (and they got cold), it took them 10 minutes to cook the spaghetti and meatballs. Never an offer to remove it from the bill, or an apology.Feels like when the restaurant arrived 15 years ago, it was trendsetting. Now it just feels out dated, overpriced and meh. . .

Although I did see a few people eat at the bar. All but one at my table tried the fixed price lunch menu - one appetizer/salad, entrée, and dessert. My choices were mozzarella wrapped prosciutto, grilled calamari, and flourless chocolate cake. I really like the mozzarella dish and could&#39;ve just had that with the table bread alone. Speaking of the table bread, the roasted tomato spread that comes along with is very tasty. The calamari entrée was a bit bland but it was the lightest looking dish to choose from. Everyone at the table tried a different dessert and we shared but my favorite was a carrot cake. The chocolate cake was good but a bit richer than I like. Some of the items are hit or miss, but it&#39;s a good place overall."

For sheer accessibility - the restaurant gets five stars. They were also very quick with seating. The line was nearly out the door after the play let out. I stood in line for about a minute and a half before we were immediately seated.312 Chicago only gets three stars as looks can be deceiving. The food is good - not great - I would expect a bit better at this swanky venue. The decor is very &#39;old Chicago&#39; and comfortable...in a good way...at least the first floor was. I walked through the second-floor seating area to the restroom and it&#39;s also &#39;old Chicago&#39; in a not so good way. Drab, boring, cramped, colorless....thank God we were seated on the first floor. Otherwise, I might have felt a bit slighted.We ordered the prix fixe menu with wine pairings for dinner. I had the Gamberetti with white wine to start, the Salmon entree with red wine, and the cheesecake with a Riesling for dessert. Let me start off by saying that the wine was fantastic....though I wish they had given me a white for the main course as opposed to a heavy red (I love reds but not with fish). I loved the appetizer, the Salmon was cooked perfectly and it fell off the fork. Though there was no sauce to the salmon it was sitting on top of a lentil salad. Each component to the entree was very good by itself but together, it just made the dish too dry. The cheesecake with cherries was good. I&#39;m not a huge fan of cheesecake but I don&#39;t dislike it. However, I have had amazing cheesecake before. I think I could have gotten the same quality from a Cheesecake factory or from a box...I would definitely go back to 312 Chicago based on its proximity to the theater but otherwise, it&#39;s a one and done kind of place."

We topped that with the Tiramisu which was what one would expect. Overall a pretty nice experience but not sure if that has more to do with the drinks then the food."

Make no mistake, this is a lovely and romantic spot as well for a couple. I just happened to be so impressed with their service to my family.This year, with little else as options on a Friday night of a holiday weekend, we made a last minute 5:45 reservation, before seeing Cinderella at the Cadillac Palace. We were told we could feel free to arrive earlier, as we would most likely be seated whenever we got to there. Indeed we were greeted warmly, our coats taken, and out 4 year old daughter greeted personally as well.We were expecting a stuffy atmosphere, dining with a child, but intended to make due. It was a huge comfort to encounter a restaurant full of families with little girls also dining pre-show. A children&#39;s menu and crayons were also provided.Our food was incredible. (Even the Mac and cheese from the kid&#39;s menu, lol) I had the beet salad and a pork tenderloin. My husband had a Caesar and an interesting and delicious sort of gnocchi thing. My description does not do this cuisine justice, I promise!!!  Food was priced as expected for the menu and environment.

This is the perfect restaurant to go to before a show as it&#39;s in the heart of the theater district.The menu is frequently changing to represent seasonal items. They have a risotto of the day that is often so delicious and decadent you can&#39;t help but eat it all. They also do a lovely and reasonably priced prix fixe menu. Their desserts are lush and sweet that you absolutely have to save room for one. I have eaten here many, many times and have always left full and very, very happy I came.If you are going before a show, let them know and they always do their best to accommodate your time table and have often made recommendations to me to ensure I can get out on time. They do take reservations so if you want to be guaranteed a spot, call ahead. That being said, 90% of the time when I come here I forget to make a reservation and they can usually accommodate a small party (2-3) within just a few minutes.Seriously, I can&#39;t say enough wonderful things about this place. Just writing this review makes me want to go there right now.Insider tip:Ask to sit at the chef&#39;s table. It&#39;s at the bar by the grill where you can see the food being prepared and a very nice person expediting food will likely give you a free appetizer sample."

I had the butternut squash tortellini with amaretto sage brown butter.It was awesome. I would definitely return to try other items on the menu."

Would be a mistake to overlook this gem because it&#39;s in the Loop. We dined on the patio and enjoyed a lovely sunset tinged city view over a truly lovely meal. This is a Northern Italian (i.e. don&#39;t look for spaghetti and lasagna) menu. From the pork chop special (cooked to perfection, moist with an outstanding au jus) to the four-cheese risotto (not too dense, perfectly balanced with a tomato garnish) and the embarrassingly yummy chocolate torte (it&#39;s rude to lick the plate, right?), we had a perfect evening. Service was warm, friendly and efficient. Not a need was unmet. Because we were staying at its Kimpton-relative Hotel Allegro, we walked through the restaurant and observed so many tables of happy people. What a great vibe. We left marveling at how much we enjoyed this meal, even over flashier, trendy Chicago places."

I saw that 312 is the most booked through open table so decided to make a reservation.The service was nice.I ordered the lox with bagel and my boyfriend got the omelet. Everything was okay, but it was very very greasy and heavy.Both of us had tummy aches after eating here, so needless to say we will not be returning.The price range is also a bit high for such simple breakfast dishes. I guess it&#39;s understandable, and I am okay with paying the price but I would also expect a bit higher quality food :-/"

We were going to a show at the Chicago Theater and they picked due to the proximity of the restaurant to the theater. We were seated promptly and were approached promptly as well. We had a round of drinks and ordered starters, I told the waitress we were on a bit of a time table and she assured me our time would be met. Starters came (Corn Soup for me Cesar salad for her) Nice presentation and flavor. 2nd round of drinks, ordered mains. Nice attention and pace to the meal. Starters came - Paperdalle Bolognese, Seafood Ravioli very tasty meals, homemade, nicely presented. Everyone enjoyed their food. Check came at the perfect time $120 a couple including tax and tip. Everything was how it should be. Will be back very good."

Overall, I had a wonderful time learning how to cook some of the meals there.For about 80 bucks a couple, you can have a cooking lesson with the executive chef and his mother. She is so cute! He taught us how to make pappardelle ragu, shrimp skewers, and tiramisu! Gave us the recipes and a bottle of the house olive oil. After each dish was made, we were able to taste it. Super yummy! I have no complaints about any of the dishes. I&#39;m saving them to make those meals one day.He was very charismatic, answered all my questions, and made cooking sound like so much fun (anyone who knows me that I do not belong in the kitchen).The service was also excellent. There was this bartender guy who was so funny and hilarious! He kept our drinks coming and joked around with each of the patrons! It was a very enjoyable experience.The only thing I was suggest is that you go if you really want to learn how to cook and if you are a little older. We are in our late 20s and the rest of the people were probably in their early 40s and up so we felt a little out of place."

Food here is great, but really expensive for what you get. The bar area is lacking a bit in that it&#39;s seems more like an after thought that a real place to enjoy a beverage.

And was overpriced."

It&#39;s certainly not cheap but it&#39;s always tasty. The service this last time was quite slow considering it always appears empty (the times we were there). One plus are the gorgeous wooden booths and decor overall. The waitstaff are friendly, not overtly. It&#39;s possible it is more for work lunches (and more affordable then too) then a sought-after dinner venue."

I made a reservation ahead of time which wasn&#39;t an issue and I am glad I did. It was packed! We did the lunch 3 course option, which had nice variety. I had a soup, butternut squash tortellini. Which was homemade, you could tell. It was delicious! Melted in your mouth, it had a great brown butter sage sauce that accompanied it as well. We had a little bit of the mango sorbet for dessert, which was ok. The wine was great as well. I really thought it was a nice place for a business lunch and I will definitely go back.

American comfort food with a twist. The ambience is great and they place AWESOME music.Definitely get the mac and cheese. no seriously get it! The cheese curds were really good but a bit overdone for me. I love the ranch sauce and spicy marinara. The kick was unexpected but I loved it. We also got the roasted chicken and it was great. The gravy on the side was a nice touch."

They won the grand prize at the Mac and Cheese Fest and it&#39;s legit.AMK&#39;s macaroni and cheese has 5 cheeses!!!! --- asiago, provolone, gouda, fontina and havarti with big pieces of bacon and jalapeno throughout and a really tasty crumbly crust on top. I found it to be a pretty big portion, too. The Mac &amp; Cheese is one of the best I&#39;ve had in the city - creamy with all the right ingredients and a bit of a kick to it - a must get.The fella and I started with a couple of cocktails recommended by our server. AMK specializes in whiskey with a giant wall full of various whiskeys and a plethora of cool whiskey cocktails. Both we tried were really tasty but I thought the Slow Smoke was the star of the night. I love smokey drinks and this drink had just the right amount of toasty flavor with cool garnish. Loved it!We tried the Oxtail Poutine which is a fun take on a Canadian classic. The oxtail was a delicious addition to the standard dish and more importantly the gravy was just so tasty! Gravy is always the key component in any good poutine and AMK does it right.Turducken Meatballs. Yes, it&#39;s a thing at AMK. Before you go and get toooooo excited, it&#39;s not a chicken stuffed into a duck then into a turkey. It just seemed to be the three meats together in a meatball however they were still huge, scrumptious meatballs. This may sound silly, but I thought the garlic cheesy bread that came with the meatballs was even better than the protein. Strangely, it was like the best garlic cheesy bread I&#39;ve ever had!AMK Kitchen Bar in Bucktown is a hidden gem of Bucktown with unique items on their menu, including delicious cocktails and a must-get Mac N Cheese, and wonderful service! Chef Barney Smith is doing real good things at AMK!"

We had a reservation and we were seated promptly when we arrived. It did look pretty crowded, but it didn&#39;t look like anyone was really waiting for a table.We ordered the fried pickles which were fried dill pickles, and quite large. We also ordered the oxtail poutine, which was really good. I thought it was a little salty, to which my roommate said I must have a very sensitive palate to salt. Which is strange bc I crave salt. Any ways we also ordered the fried chicken which was great, and the chopped salad pizza which was also delicious.There were 4 of us and we shared all the dishes and it was plenty of food.Understandably this weekend has been ridiculously hot, but the restaurant was very warm, we all started to feel very drowsy after sitting there for awhile as the restaurant was very warm and stuffy. We were seated by the front window, which was closed and that could of been the reason but it was very uncomfortable. Otherwise everything else was great."

I assumed it would be more style than substance, but I was happily so wrong! This was one of our favorite meals in Wicker Park, super fun at dinner time. The vibe is very lively (but not party-hardy-douchey), the staff are incredibly nice and accommodating, and the food was on point. We had the skillet cornbread, warm brussel sprout salad with bacon, mussels, and some top notch drinks (they even made me a swanky mock-tail).About those drinks: 16 beers on tap, 30+ unique bottles &amp; cans from &#39;round the globe.

Those expertly crafted cocktails, seriously good food, and cool vibes are speakin&#39; my language! The accommodating service and delightful presentation was also impressive. I started with the roasted watermelon, beet, and goat cheese salad, which was not only beautiful, but absolutely delicious too. Then I couldn&#39;t pass on ordering the macaroni and cheese since I heard they won an award for it... at least that&#39;s the excuse I gave myself to indulge in this wonderfully decadent dish. As far as drinks, my favorite cocktail of the night was the Slow Smoke. They actually light a sprig of rosemary on fire to give it the smokey flavor. Hello!

I had the smokey something or other and it was awesome and let me tell ya, &#34;smokey&#34; was not just in the name, they lit a pine needle branch on fire, blew it out and used it as a garnish! It was amazing how much it actually added to the smokey flavor of the drink! Needless to say, I was impressed. Food wise- we split the Brussel sprout salad, cheese curds and Mac and cheese! Fair warning- this food is not for those susceptible to heart burn, it is heavy and fried and perfect. Even the Brussel sprout salad was fried, so much for ordering a heathy option!"

Stopped in for a Monday evening dinner with my parents and we all left feeling very impressed (and full!). Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive.Rather than going for an entrée, I decided to get the meatballs along with the side mac and cheese. Both were so flippin&#39; good! The meatballs also came with some cheesy garlic bread and I&#39;m not at all surprised that the mac and cheese won an award for best in the city. My mom had the pork chop, which was comically large, but she really liked it. My dad had the chicken pot pie and was a big fan. We also got the chopped salad pizza to share and that was delicious too. We were too full to finish it but it reheated well the next day (I did the stovetop pan method due to the fresh toppings). And because we decided to just really go all out, we also split a slice of their carrot cake. I think they make it in house, but it might as well have been from a bakery because it was that good! It was also huuuuuge enough to take the rest home. I also had about half the mac and cheese portion leftover and that reheated well the next day, too.Overall it was a great meal in a well decorated space. I had a glass of wine, but my mom had one of their summer cocktails, which she enjoyed (and was strong!). Can&#39;t wait to come back and try other items (plus have more of the same). This was modern comfort food done right.The only negative thing I can think of is that the volume on the music could be a tad lower, but it didn&#39;t ruin our experience."

Specials are 1/2 pice drafts and $8 pizzas. Not much on the menu I&#39;d eat (lots of food restrictions for me), but the turducken meatballs were fantastic. The spicy red sauce is not spicy. It&#39;s pretty much marinara sauce, but pretty tasty all the same.It was an interesting crowd. Couple of hipsters, some not, lots of families with young children.The waitress and temperature were definitely the worst parts. She didn&#39;t know the specials, was horrible with service. Not sure if the waitress drinks beer, but when I asked for a recommendation similar to an IPA, but lower alcohol content, she suggested the watermelon or raspberry beer. The beer was fine, but nowhere near an IPA. It was very humid in the restaurant too. My friends and I were dripping sweat. Gross.Overall, I enjoyed it, but not what I had expected.

We had a group of 8 coming so we asked for a table and drank at the bar while the group funneled in. It&#39;s a really cool spot with great atmosphere. Everyone&#39;s food looked great, my mac &amp; cheese and corn bread was perfect for a cold day. We will be back for sure."

BUT. maybe they tried to be too efficient with their small space. If you&#39;re seated in the middle row of tables, you&#39;ll either get a purse in the face, or an elbow to the head; it&#39;s that tight of a squeeze. garage door looks great, but in the dead of summer, with no fans and an exposed kitchen, you&#39;re sweating bullets.bartenders are great - snag a seat there if you can. BUT. if you grab a table, servers aren&#39;t quite up to par with the bartenders. maybe a little overwhelmed, with forgotten appetizers and empty water glasses. maybe it&#39;s the amount of times they need to run back and forth between the kitchen and the table - because they so kindly let you know that this is a &#39;shared plates&#39; kinda place, because they&#39;ll just bring the food out when it&#39;s done (instead of everyone getting their entrees at the same time). weird, I know. but whatever...the menu itself is a good kinda different. duck pot pie, frito pie, etc. it&#39;s adventurous (but, still not sure how you share those plates). BUT. it&#39;s just alright. the burger (which I don&#39;t think is a shared plate either) is reminiscent of, dare I say it, au cheval, but a greasier, smaller, version. duck pot pie is probs your best bet.to be fair, I&#39;ll more likely than not be back. BUT. it&#39;s definitely a grab at beer (or two) at the bar, then go somewhere else kinda middle stop place."

The bartender was entertaining to watch, he definitely seems like a keeper of his craft, not just a typical drink slinger. I had the cheese curd appetizer which was just great. For my entree I had the fried chicken which came with a sweet/spicy glaze and the smoothest white cheddar mashed potatoes that I&#39;ve ever had. It was the perfect combination packed full of flavor. My only complaint was the portion size....it was so delicious and went too fast. For dinner my cousin and I shared the churro sundae which was spectacular.

I came here on a Friday night with a bunch of friends and the restaurant was pretty crowded (save 2 tables), so that was a good sign. I had:-Basil 46: this was a delicious drink. I don&#39;t remember the liquor that was in it (I think it was bourbon?), but it was pretty damn tasty.-Fried pickles: these had a nice crunch to them and just the right amount of batter on em.-Pork belly: if I see pork belly on a menu, I&#39;m gettin&#39; it. The pork belly here was real good - 3 big strips of tender pork belly with a nice char and a sweet flavor to it.I want to rate AMK higher, but I have to knock &#39;em down for the wait time for food. Our server  explained to us that the food would be brought out as it was prepared, which we were totally fine with. One of our friends ordered a pizza, which came out in about 5 minutes. The next dish didn&#39;t get to the table until maybe 15 minutes later (our friend had already eaten 1/2 his pizza by then), and the last dish, the salmon, didn&#39;t hit our friend&#39;s plate until another 10 minutes later (by this time, said pizza was gone).Don&#39;t get me wrong, the drinks and food here are real solid, but they really need to work on the timing of their dishes IMO."

My fiance and I visited for dinner over the weekend with another couple, and we loved it.For appetizers, we shared the cheese curds and chicken crackers. The cheese curds were delicious and came with two sauces - a ranch and a spicy marinara sauce. I liked the chicken crackers more; they were crispy and delightful! I highly recommend either of these appetizers.Everybody at the table also enjoyed their cocktails! I ordered the Garter Girl, and it was awesome because it wasn&#39;t overly sweet. If you love strawberry, you need to try it.For dinner, I got the duck fat crust pot pie, and it was probably the best pot pie I had ever had! Sometimes pot pies can border on bland, but this one had great flavor. It comes out piping hot in a crock, so you need a wait a few minutes before you dig in. Also, it&#39;s a pretty big portion, so you&#39;ll be able to enjoy the leftovers the next day.My fiance had the grilled cheese with mac n&#39; cheese on the side. The grilled cheese has lots of different cheeses and bacon in it - of course I took a bite, and it was delicious! The mac n&#39; cheese had a kick to it with its jalapeno crust - I stole a bite of this too, and it was also very tasty.Additionally, the service was great, and the ambiance was very trendy and cool.To summarize: Great comfort food + awesome cocktails = AMK Kitchen!"

The biggest complaint was the music. The ambience is great, food plates are between bar food and gourmet and having h to the izzo, big pimpin, amongst others in the same genre was quite annoying. I didn&#39;t mind the music so much, but the volume made it impossible to hear my friend who had to scream at me so we could chat. While I love my rap music at times, it didn&#39;t go with the place. I see other reviews mention this. Easy fix and I&#39;ll go back when enough complain and maybe it changes. Food and drinks were great. No other issues."

Our mushroom pizza barely had any mushrooms and had too much crust and not enough pizza. Also the chicken that we ordered was tough and dry. The drinks were yummy and fun, which is the reason I gave 3 instead of 2. Also I was very disappointed that when I tried to order carry out, all of the items that I originally wanted to order were denied to me because either they didn&#39;t have them anymore and hadn&#39;t updated their online menu, or because they didn&#39;t have a method to package them since they were cooked in a skillet."

It was a warm, humid evening and the AC at AMK apparently was not working.  We had reservations, but we were not told of the air conditioning status ahead of time or when we sat down either. After sweat began dripping from all 3 of us, we asked what was going on with the AC. We never really got a straight answer or an apology, but we can only assume the AC was not working.  It really made for a very bad experience at this restaurant. I am really disappointed no one from AMK followed up with me. I don&#39;t plan to return - too many good restaurants in the area with better management and customer service."

The burger was good, but the bottom bun was completely soggy by the time they brought it to our table.The buttermilk chicken had enough salt for the streets of Chicago.The Dorito pie is a snack-size bag of cool ranch chips with a little bit of beans and pico on top.

We thought they&#39;d worked out the kinks since opening, but the good time is seemingly the outlier.We had Dylan as a server the first and third time, so maybe it&#39;s him, but we waited about an hour after ordering for our food with no apology and instead him telling us they had JUST plated it (even though the couple next to us who arrived after us were almost done with their food). The only thing hot about the food was the plate it was on. Over-cooked eggs, cold burger, soggy benedict. I asked for a refill on our coffee halfway into our wait and it didn&#39;t come until our food arrived. My friend ordered tea early on and it came after our food was almost finished. My food came out first, my friend&#39;s came out 5 minutes later and my boyfriend&#39;s 5 minutes after that.We watched the bartender and hostess talk about the poor service we were getting and yet no one did anything about it.The food may have been good if it wasn&#39;t cold and we didn&#39;t have to scarf it down because after an hour we were now on a time crunch. If you do go and Dylan is your server, just leave - you&#39;ll get food faster if you walk somewhere else.Quick note - we&#39;ve gone with our baby every time and to their credit they have been able to accommodate his stroller easily.

And it was only 5:45 on a Saturday night. I wanted the chicken and butternut squash dumplings, out. Ordered a slow smoke cocktail, wanted a second, they were out. Same thing with another cocktail. Two of us at the table ordered the pot pie and due to some mix up in the kitchen, we could only get one. Therefore my backup entrée option needed yet another backup! While I appreciate the fact that they aren&#39;t skimping and throwing together something as a substitute that is of lesser quality, it was still early on a Saturday night so I don&#39;t understand how they could have run out of so many ingredients.Another odd observation, they delivered the sides to our table way before the meal. Anywhere else, a side that you can get al a carte, is brought out with your main dish. So it was like we had 5 rounds of appetizers. And these sides weren&#39;t listed under the appetizer section. Weird.The upside, the food that we were able to order was delicious. Cracklings had a great flavor, the poutine was super rich and delicious and the pizza that I ordered as a backup (which they graciously comped), was good. The pot pie could have used a little more chicken, but the bites with the chicken were super flavorful. The inside decor has a great vibe and the cocktails we were able to order were tasty.I&#39;d like to say that I&#39;d be back to try my original order but there are too many other spots I&#39;d like to explore first.

Even if you aren&#39;t a whiskey-fan, the Peace Treaty is a really tasty drink. Beer choices are good too, however last time I was there, they didn&#39;t have any sours :(Food:  My favorite dish is absolutely the Wild Mushroom Pizza. It is lick-your-fingers-and-the-pan delicious. It has a cream sauce and is AMAZINGGGG! As a former, Sconnie I was not impressed by their cheese curds but they do have two nice dipping sauces to add a few different flavors. Braised Pork Belly has good flavor but was too fatty for most people at our table. And finally the Boursin Cheese and Potato Gnocchi has a very rich and creamy sauce and was great, but the texture of the gnocchi was just a little bit off. I&#39;ve also had the late night wings and Mac-N-Cheese too, but it was late..

The cheese curds were heavenly, as my girlfriend and I also had cocktails, and the Turducken meat balls with cheese garlic bread were tender, and flavorful.The restaurant has a very relaxed feel, and the exposed brick with open garage door, is such a common trend lately, but the real star is the food.Order the South side cocktail.  Chef Barney Smiths cuisine meets the Lincoln Park crowd head on.Roberta WilsonChicago, Il"

This gave us a nice opportunity to walk through Bucktown before eating. We arrived at 10:30, clearly 1/2 hour before &#34;the crowd&#34; showed up. Everything was delicious but the grilled cheese with bacon tomato jam was out of this world, as was the bacon and also the homemade habanero sauce. I had a Rhub and Tug, basically just a tastier and stronger Mimosa. Service was awesome."

I came with moderate, but by no means high expectations. Clearly I was unprepared for the level of attention to detail in the food. We started off with the grilled watermelon and beet salad, which sounds weird, but is an absolute gem. It comes with greens and little brûlée goat cheese. As weird as it sounded, it was delicious and a real winner. It also included some cooked pumpkin seeds, different, but it really worked.Being from Kentucky, I appreciate Bourbon, and their Bourbon selection is excellent, rivaled only really by Longman &amp; Eagle, LS&#39;s best whiskey bar. Seriously, I was impressed with the selection in a new bar of Bourbon. This place is legit. The draft beer has some normal local Chicago brews, and a few new ones I&#39;ve never heard of. One of my friends tried a hibiscus beer they had on draft, that was almost as crisp and nice as an English cider ale, and somehow managed to not be too sweet.For the main course, I tried their duck fat crust pot pie. It was such a winner as well. All around, this place has a really great thing going on. Let&#39;s hope they keep up the top notch service and food quality"

We arrived about 10-15 minutes after our reservation time and our table was given away to someone else (completely our fault) so we had to wait awhile for another table to open up. We ordered drinks (Basil 46 &amp; Old Fashioned) which were good and the food was good as well but a bit on the pricier side. Service was a bit slow but no complaints here since they were pretty crowded. My only complaint is the seating arrangements - we were placed at a small table in the most awkward spot in the middle of everything and right by the front door where the cold air would hit us every time someone opened the door. Nonetheless, this place has a beautiful ambiance with string lights hanging from the ceilings and a rustic feel to it."

I feel like if this was located in a busier area, it would always be packed. We came in for some drinks and appetizers, and it was perfect. We got in right away on a Saturday night.Their beer selection is really great, and it seems like they update it all the time. We ordered the mac &amp; cheese, brussel sprout salad, and doritos pie. Everything tasted really great, and there were a bunch of other options on the menu that made it really hard to decide. I would say their style is like classic American bar food with a lot of class. I have to give a big shout out to the mac &amp; cheese as well. It was especially great because they didn&#39;t use a cheese sauce, and instead just used a lot of real cheese, making it super cheesy without being oily. Amazing. And I basically get mac &amp; cheese everywhere I go, so I promise you can trust me.Our server, Brandon, was super great and helpful as well. The perfect mix of being around for us when we needed, but not checking back too often. The host (didn&#39;t get her name) was also really friendly and welcoming. And as an added bonus, the music selection was on point."

To be honest, I wasn&#39;t expecting much at first, kind of seemed like a random neighborhood spot. But then our food arrived and OH MY GOD. We ordered the grilled cheese and I swear Jesus himself came down to make our sandwich. So so so good! We also got the cornbread minus the chili, I think this would be great with the chili, that was a bad call on our part. For dessert we got the churro waffles and wow, I&#39;ve never devoured my food faster than that. Everything tasted amazing and looked good as well. Also loved the atmosphere, dark, large open window, cool art on the walls, and awesome music. Will definitely be back to try more of their food."

(If 4.5 were an option, I&#39;d give that.)What a welcome addition to the neighborhood! Overall, this place was very, very good. Probably one of the best brand new restaurants I&#39;ve experienced in a while.The beer selection is impressive (both draft and bottle), and their cocktails are inventive. It was challenging to make a decision, but in the end I ordered the IPA mule, and would definitely get it again.The food was very impressive, especially being the second night of business. AMK really deserves a pat on the back for it.* Turducken Meatballs - tasty little balls with red sauce and cheese. I&#39;m not sure I really picked up on the &#34;ducken&#34; addition, but they were comforting and flavorful.* Dorito Pie - This might be inspired by the Walking Taco, but it&#39;s different and very good. Would order again.* Brussels Sprouts Salad - What better way to eat brussels sprouts than shredded and fried and covered with vinegary dressing and crispy shallots?!* Tiger Shrimp - Good breading, and good sauce on top. These could have used a little spice in my opinion, although I&#39;ll eat a raw serrano from time to time so my opinion might be skewed.* Duck Fat Pot Pie - This was great. I liked how it wasn&#39;t overloaded with dough, and there was real flavor from the meat/soup mixture. May have been a touch salty, but salt is my best friend. Again, I would have enjoyed a drop or two of some habanero sauce...but that&#39;s just me.The design is fit for purpose -- a little edgy, some good indie and hip-hop tunes (I heard some old school Outkast last night which is always a pleasure), and an open kitchen (with a kick-ass venting system so you don&#39;t leave smelling like fryer grease).So why 4 stars and not 5, you ask? The service. Don&#39;t get me wrong, everybody was very hospitable and friendly, but there are just a few kinks that need to be resolved (timing of drinks to table, appropriate checkpoints to refresh drinks and/or food, end of meal follow-up). But remember, this was only night #2 so not everything can be perfect, and by no means was anything bad. I could see this place getting upped to 5 stars in the near future once they get into the groove.I&#39;m excited to go back, and even more excited it&#39;s a 3-4 block walk from home."

Perfect amount of spice.  Fried chicken - the honey mash along with the chili glaze are a perfect mesh of savory flavor.  Cheese curds had a nice coating more like panko.We all enjoyed our experience, But I would just suggest it for folks not in a rush, eating more family style to taste it all, or smaller groups"

However, within ten minutes of us sitting down the place was packed. We ordered drinks and got some recommendations for food from our server. He suggested the Mac and cheese and told us it even won an award, pointing to a trophy over the bar. We decided to go with the Brussels sprout salad, the turducken meatballs, Mac and cheese and the fried chicken. The salad was the perfect way to begin the meal. The chicken and meatballs were delicious.  The meatballs are served with read and a generous amount of cheese. I was disappointed in the Mac and cheese. I love a good Mac and cheese and felt like this one was missing something. I wasn&#39;t too thrilled with my cocktail either. Our server was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. The music was a little loud for my liking and it was at times hard to hear my dining partners. I would definitely return for the fried chicken and meatballs. Be sure to make a reservation!"

Just a &#34;no&#34; not even &#34;i&#39;m so sorry, the reason why is this: &#34;  Most places in this day and age are a little more vegetarian friendly than that (especially for a brussel sprouts dish) , so I was pretty surprised.  But all in all decent food, good portions, average prices.  If you are vegetarian though I might look for somewhere else."

The brussels sprouts salad was surprisingly good, and the buttermilk fried chicken was the crowd favorite.We went as a group of 4 on a Thursday night at 7PM, and were seated almost immediately, which I was pretty prepared to wait a bit.  But by no means was the place empty; when we were wrapping up every table was taken.

The exposed brick was really trendy and even though the bar had a &#34;circus&#34; theme, it was not overwhelming. It fit with the decor. Do note, however, this is not a place to watch a game as they do not have televisions. You simply need to just enjoy the company of the person you&#39;re there with..or yourself, if that&#39;s what you prefer!In terms of service, can I say AMAZING?! Our waiter was not only super friendly, but extremely knowledgeable and attentive. He was able to answer all of our questions about the menu and make great recommendations. What really blew us away was his knowledge of beer. They had great and interesting beers on draft and he was able to describe each beer in depth.The food was also really good. We ordered the Dorito pie for a starter. Taste-wise, it was delicious. The only thing was the chili was cold. I am not sure if that was intentional. For our entrees, we ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and the bacon &amp; jalapeno pizza. The fried chicken itself was very tasty. The breading had the perfect crisp factor. The combination of the sweet sauce and spicy jalapenos were also a great addition to the chicken. Unfortunately, i was not a fan of the cheddar mashed potatoes that accompanied the chicken. That is a rarity for me to say as I usually LOVE mashed potatoes. Personally, I felt as though they had the taste and consistency of the mashed potatoes that come in TV dinners. Also, they were kind of cold, which didn&#39;t help. The pizza was delicious. The crust was light and airy. For dessert, we ordered the brownie sundae. I thought my husband was about to fall out of his chair (and normally, he&#39;s not huge on desserts), it was so good. Our server recommended the caramel apple bread pudding, which looked so delicious. This only means that we have to come back again :-)"

Too much attitude and not enough simple competence.The head cook on the line with no hair covering, even after we&#39;d pointed out to the owner himself that that&#39;s a violation (V42--Chicago), a point he wanted to argue for some reason.  Watching the cook touch his face, and wipe sweat from his brow with his hands and then go back to plating food was not pleasant.I thought the hostess was drunk, since she almost fell several times; turned out that it was the weird coating of grease on the floor of the entire place, probably exacerbated by the fact that the kitchen didn&#39;t have the ventilation to pull air up and out, hence the entire restaurant&#39;s coughing fit when someone roasted a chile.Waiter (seemed like the neighbor&#39;s kid) who didn&#39;t really know the menu, and appeared completely in the weeds despite the fact that it wasn&#39;t particularly  crowded.An open garage window seemed nice, but it was about 86 outside, with like 90% humidity...they should have perhaps closed it and turned on the A/C, especially with the exposed kitchen area.A weird clientele and vibe....seemed like an episode of Jersey Shore...made worse by the dark lighting.Really, by the end of dinner--which was ok, but entrees and sides brought to the table like 10 minutes apart, a really messy two-patty (why?) burger that the cook came over (hair and sweat in full flower) to brag about being made from brisket...because he ran out of ground beef, as if either a) I care, b) that makes it better, which it doesn&#39;t, or c) that&#39;s anything other than him letting us know that he&#39;s still working on getting his kitchen under control--the whole experience was marred.So...maybe they just opened the project too early, and hired too quickly, or hired friends.  Lots of great restaurants in this town, and you&#39;re not guaranteed a success story just because you have short ribs and bourbon in Bucktown.  If they can pull things together (especially the sanitation issues), which they can, they&#39;ll do well.  There is some  potential here, but they need some work."

Small and intimate, you are literally next to the kitchen as the cooks prepare your food essentially in front of you. The brick is a nice touch as well as the shelves of a large selection of whiskeys against the bar.We had the fried chicken, pork belly, and kale artichoke pizza. All of it was ridiculously tasty and amazing. The chicken was probably one of the best, if not the best, pieces of fried poultry I have ever had. Not kidding whatsoever. The chicken was not dry at all and the crispy skin was fried to perfection. The pork belly was extremely tender and the glaze added a slight sweetness that balanced out the smokiness from the grill. Last but not least, the pizza was nice and creamy and the bits of charred kale was a great contrast to the rest of the pie. I really liked how a lot of their dishes were a more modern and urban take on traditional American diner fare.Food and service were great, especially since they literally just opened this week.As I am writing this review, I am already anticipating my next visit so I can take another bite of that heavenly fried chicken.In a nutshell, if you&#39;re in town you have to check this place out. Honestly, if you&#39;re in the city in general you have to check this place out regardless. You will not regret it."

We started with the cheese curbs and they were definitely homemade and melt in ur mouth good. The hot sauce was extremely hot, and I eat all spicy food! The black pepper buttermilk ranch was amazing. We then split the turdunkin meatballs which came with cheese bread and the whole dish was huge and mouthwatering. Then we split the jalapeño bacon pizza, it was also over the top!! I will be back!

The food was as always very good: their new chicken and mushroom pizza were great, 5 stars! Service: perfect, our regular waiter (forgot his name) is very friendly, 5 stars. The decor of this place is awesome, a beautiful decorated industrial style bar, 5 stars. So why do I only give 3 stars? To be honest: it&#39;s the music... This place is getting louder and louder every time we visit it. We&#39;d like to catch up after a busy week, but that was hardly possible Friday night.

A sophisticated restaurant with attention to detail dedicated to a wide selection of cocktails. Their whiskey list is very long! The pizza was perfectly cooked from the brick oven. The wings were small but they were cooked well, not the usual bar wings. And the bread pudding was amazing! It was devoured very quickly!

The food was wonderful (biscuits and gravy, chicken and waffles, breakfast special, and grilled cheese) and only one minor complaint was raised about the salt level (too high) in the frittata. The food was reasonably priced and you got a good portion of food. The drinks were yummy and the service was also great. The 90&#39;s hip hop on the audio system was a fun surprise.

I would recommend any of these selections, next time I&#39;m getting a order of the cheese curds!The only reason I couldn&#39;t give AMK five stars was the awkward service experience. I will definitely be back and I am sure the service side will work itself out in time. My only suggestion would be have a place for those waiting for a table. Currently only half of the bar is available for people waiting for tables and the other half is used for seating for the dining room...

Finally made it back in a week later to try some food with a group of 7 friends. The place is pretty small and we weren&#39;t sure if we&#39;d all be able to sit together but they worked something out for us and we all ended up getting cozy at a table up front, perfectly situated right by the huge open window. The cool Chicago breeze kept us comfy all evening. We all ordered the basil 46 cocktail to start because we loved it so much last time. Then we got started with some fried pickles--very tasty, but super hot temperature wise. I had the grilled watermelon salad (PERFECT summer food). Watermelon, crisp greens, gold and red beets, and goat cheese. Can you ask for more?? Turns out you can, because I also ordered the pork belly and it was amazing as well. So so juicy! The only reason I&#39;m taking this spot down a star is because the food was coming out at weird times. They did tell us everything would come out when it was ready, and lots of times it works (likes at tapas or sushi places) but it was a little awkward here because it took a REALLY long time between each dish. Anyway, still coming back for more. I hope this place does well!!"

We had brunch last week and it took about 30 minutes to get our food. I mean it was really slow. Food was great (biscuits and gravy).The other issue is the drink pour and the price. On a Friday night, I ordered a Knob Creek on the rocks. The bartender asked if I wanted 2oz or more..huh? Ok, 2oz will do. I watched him pour EXACTLY 2oz..like watching him use an eye dropper.

This place opened up kitty corner from me, so I&#39;ve been really excited about it for a couple months, especially with the promise of a large whiskey list.The food was really stellar. I had the short ribs - they were so tender and juicy, and the mashed potatoes were to die for. I had an Old Fashioned (good, if a little heavy on the sugar), and a coffee whiskey cocktail that was delicious, although I probably should have gotten something a little lighter on a hot night.My only issue is that there seem to be quite a few kinks left to work out with the service. I stopped in the night before to eat at the bar, and it was really busy. That&#39;s fine, I&#39;m ok if the hostess tells me there&#39;s no seating right now, but instead she tried to seat me on a stool directly in front of the drink tray. I said that wouldn&#39;t work, as I&#39;d need actual counter space to be able to eat, and she said I could also stand. What...?So I left and came back the next night with a friend. The waiter explained that they &#34;don&#39;t really course dishes&#34; because the kitchen is too small. Ok, I assume that means if I ordered soup, salad, and an entrée, he wouldn&#39;t be artfully timing their delivery. Instead this meant that as soon as my ribs were ready, they came out, and my friend&#39;s chicken sandwich took another 10 minutes. When I asked why they couldn&#39;t have arrived together, he said they would have just been sitting at the bar getting cold. So, instead they sat on the table getting cold, because I wanted to eat with my friend, not finish my whole meal before his sandwich arrived.However, our waiter let the manager know we weren&#39;t thrilled about the entrée timing, and she came to the table and was extremely gracious about it, offering us free dessert or another drink on her. I understand they&#39;re getting on their feet, and I definitely plan to return.Bottom line, the food was really delicious, the drinks were good, the wait service is in progress, and the customer service is very good."

Borek was a warm delicious and reasonably sized appetizer. I got the doner platter, which was great. The yogurt sauce was a bit weak, but the meat was great and came with a nice flatbread so I could also eat it wrap-style. Goat cheese salad came with a fantastic pomegranate salad.

Worst falafel, hummus and calamari I have ever tried. If I had the choice of a melba toast dinner and Galata, I&#39;d choose melba toast 9 times out of 10 and fast on the 10th. I feel robbed of my money and a decent Saturday night meal. Their &#34;hot sauce&#34;, for which they charge $.50 (for delivery), taste like tobasco sauce. Tobasco sauce?!?

Ordered chicken kebab platter and at $11.5 it was too much food to eat. I really liked kebab which were cooked at the right level. But I felt they could have done better with rest of the platter. I mean there were rice salad yogurt but not that impressive overall.  Sitting capacity indoors is less and tables are kind of uncomfortable. Our server was very charming but when a big group of 10 came in , she got overburdened. Kept forgetting our orders.  Person I went with ate doner wrap and was very satisfied with that. I am tempted to give 4th star but may be after trying out the wrap myself next time."

Like they want to be a bar and a restaurant. Board outside advertised daily drink specials. I almost walked past it. Its actually a very good Turkish restaurant. I don&#39;t usually like lentils..but this lentil soup was very good. Warm buttery consistency and spiced lightly as not to overpower. The eggplant salad tasted of charred eggplant and was served cold with pita. Great flavor.  The shwarma was grilled well and had the right amount of chew and burnt edges. The dessert was similar to Mexican flan but not as sweet. Custardy goodness with sprinkled cinnamon.

However, I was craving salmon.Let&#39;s get onwards with the food review:(1) Roasted Faroe Island Salmon was said to be prepared with chickpeas, cucumber and cherry tomato salad, lemon vinaigrette, and mint. I had cold chickpeas, corn and bits of frisee salad. The salmon was unremarkable. pan seared to a salty crisp!(2) Creme brulee. I&#39;m quite the creme brulee connoisseur.

The entrees were likewise oily and bland.On our third visit, we just had wine and a cheese plate.

I got the sparkling and my husband got the voluptuous whites. We were both pretty happy with the selections. There was a substitution for one of mine, which is fine and understandable, but then there was no explanation for what the one in its place is. Even just an explanation by the server would have sufficed.Anyway, the food was very tasty. I got the blt, which also included avocado and came with a side of crispy fries. My husband ordered the lemon and ricotta pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were really good, definitely recommend them. Portions were a good size, leaving us full but not stuffed.The outdoor seating area is cute and has a decent amount of tables/space.

We came in with a Groupon and told the waitress and her response was, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, we don&#39;t treat people differently when you have a Groupon!&#34;. Since I tend to be a deal-seeker, I appreciated this...as I always tip on the full amount anyways!BIN 36 seems like the type of place that probably gets most of its business during the loop lunch hour or corporate events. It&#39;s a beautiful and large space that is nicely done without trying too hard. Our weekend brunch experiences here have truly blown me away.The food menu changes by the season and everything is presented so well. We have tried multiple brunch things on the menu and they have all been good. It&#39;s nice because there&#39;s a variety of types of brunch food ranging from fancy toasts to sweet entrees like ricotta pancakes and hearty entrees such as shrimp and grits or eggs benedict. I had a mimosa flight and my husband had a bloody mary flight and they were fun and very yummy!The service at BIN 36 was exceptional both times. Our server was extremely professional and really tended to our needs. She asked us questions at just the right time and provided great, timely, friendly service. The owner/manager was there both times we had brunch and was very active and engaging with the customers.This is a great find in a somewhat dead area of the city on the weekends... and we will definitely be back!"

bin-36-chicago-3,Jill O.,whf02yAsGdZfEEGMZtb9HQ,"Lansing, IL",1,1,1,32,11,j8GSZZ081LVpJVzL3TucTw,3.0,2016-01-05,"I&#39;ll start out this review by saying I have absolutely no idea where these negative reviews are coming from. My sister and I were a bit weary about coming here after reading some of the reviews, but I&#39;m very glad that our experience was nothing but positive.We arrived on time for a reservation at 6pm on New Year&#39;s Day. The hostess was quick to seat us, happy to see us, and was sure to seat us at a table that was far from the drafty, Chicago-wind riddled front doors. It was chilly, and much appreciated! It was only a moment or two later that we were given our water. We saw the owner walking around, but didn&#39;t get to talk to him.Our server, Roberto, was awesome. He was nice and attentive without the feeling that he was hovering or watching us. He was sure to ask how things were, and if we needed anything. He was very patient as we sat for a rather long time deciding on what appetizers to order, and gave recommendations that weren&#39;t the most expensive options (as many servers do).We started off with two drinks, both of which were $7 because we happened to have our reservation during happy hour. My sister enjoyed her Whiskey Sour, and I had a Sweet Sinner, which was elderflower liqueur and lemon juice. It was fantastic (and dangerous) because it tasted like a lemon shake-up. No complaints here!We finally made decisions for what to start with. We decided to have the Charcuterie flight ($32), which samples all of the charcuterie options on the menu. It included rabbit pate, bourbon and apple chicken liver mousse, smoked ham, bresaola, and pheasant terrine, as well as the standard accoutrements . I really enjoyed all of the offerings, but my favorite was the chicken liver mousse. With the sweetness of the apple, and the crunch of it as well, it had a nice clean taste that wasn&#39;t too gamey, and a nice texture.We also had the BIN 36 cheese plate, which is comprised of whatever cheeses the chef desires. Ours included two goat cheeses, and four cow cheeses. They were hit and miss; I know that&#39;s the risk you take when you get a flight, especially a mystery one! I really enjoyed the Pleasant Ridge Reserve out of Wisconsin. There was also a wine gelee that was absolutely outstanding.My only complaint about the flights was the bread crisps that were served alongside the meats and cheeses weren&#39;t ideal for the spreading of things. They were delicious but delicate, so it made it a bit hard to spread the mousse/pate.We also got the Roasted Bone Marrow ($18, I believe) as a starter. It was the first time either of us had had it, and it was amazing. It had a great flavor to it, and the maple butter on top gave it just the right amount of sweetness. The garlic marmalade wasn&#39;t okay, but I didn&#39;t need it for this course. The marrow was good enough on its own.Then we moved on to our entrees, both of which hover around the $30 mark. My sister loved her house aged strip, which came with smashed potatoes and a bordelaise sauce. She was kind enough to let me try it, and that sauce was amazing; a good balance of sweet and savory. The steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I myself had the roasted rohan duck, which came with a blood orange reduction, charred cipollinis, caramelized rutabaga, and salsify. This was my first time having salsify, and it was pretty good. The char on the onions made them delicious. I initially thought my duck was a bit on the rare side, but I rolled with it and trusted the chef; I&#39;m glad I did! The skin was crispy and delicious, and the meat was tender. I wish that there had been a bit more of the blood orange, but that&#39;s really grasping at straws for complaints.Finally, we got desserts. My sister has a cinnamon allergy, so she vicariously lived through me this course. She got a creme brulee which was really good. It was super light and fluffy, which was nice. I had the Arroz Con Leche (rice pudding). It came in a caramel cage topped with caramel, two mini churros, dulce de leche ice cream, and speculoos cookie crumbles. I am a sucker for anything speculoos (cookie butter anyone?), so I was sold. I literally cleaned my plate. The ice cream was sweet and creamy, the churros were soft and airy inside with just the right crisp on the outside. Everything complimented one another, and it all went into my face. No shame in my game.I&#39;d love to come back here in the summer. There&#39;s a nice outside seating area that we obviously couldn&#39;t use in January. I&#39;d come back here again in a heartbeat. If you&#39;re looking for a cheap place, this isn&#39;t it. But it&#39;s very reasonably priced for the quality of food you get, and for the downtown location and chill, relaxing ambiance. Clean bathrooms, attentive staff, and great food. What more can you ask?"

They have an excellent selection of wine, which you can order by the glass or choose a varietal, and get a flight of smaller pours. As for the food, my boyfriend ordered the shrimp and grits and they were delicious. I had the Chicken and Biscuits and as a homesick Southerner, this was perfect comfort food!

Get seated right away since there is literally only one other table dining in the restaurant. The server greets us almost immediately and though a very seemingly nice girl, she stood at our table going on and on about wines and cheeses when we were clearly just there for lunch (wearing our work ID&#39;s around our neck, and all). I understand this process for dinner but to go into such a long shpeel for lunch hours, is unnecessary since most of us that work in the area are on a tight one-hour lunch time allowance.We order the brussels sprouts and two cobb salads. The brussels sprouts came out first and were amazing. The taste was awesome. After this appetizer, we were so excited for our next course!When our salads came out to our table, we literally laughed for a second, then the laughter turned into shock then pure anger. The size was incredibly small - like a side salad at a fast food restaurant. The presentation was HORRIBLE. There was a speck of dressing at the bottom of very pale, light green, sad looking romaine lettuce. They added a few pieces of bacon, 1/4 of a hard-boiled egg, one slice of pepper, and LITERALLY four tiny pieces of chicken to this &#34;cobb salad&#34;. At a hefty lunch price of $12 per salad, I just couldn&#39;t bare to accept this non-sense as my meal. My friend was equally mad.We asked the server to get the manager. The manager (Enoch) came out and the first thing he said was, &#34;hello ladies, I understand you are mad.&#34; First of all, that is not how you approach an already mad customer! You say, &#34;Hi ladies, what can I do for you?&#34; or &#34;what seems to be the problem?&#34; You just don&#39;t come in the scene and assume what someone&#39;s feeling.I asked him if he thought the portion was too small and he said, &#34;no, it is fine.&#34; Maybe for a bird, guy, maybe for a bird! I explained that there are many other restaurants nearby, even Chicago Raw in the French Market, with bigger and better salads at $10 each, instead of this joke for $12. I told him that we did not want the salads anymore and he said that&#39;s fine and collected our salads from the table. He didn&#39;t offer to fix the problem, he didn&#39;t offer to get us something else, nothing. He could care LESS that he had two unhappy customers. At that point, I told him that it&#39;s unfortunate that he runs business like that because I highly doubt he will make it with that attitude and those laughable portions.Then to top it off, I left the amount of the brussels sprouts ($8) plus $4 on the table in cash and left right after the manager took our salads. Our Chatty Cathy server came RUNNING after us after we were already down the block yelling, &#34;ladies, you didn&#39;t pay your bill!&#34;.... I yelled back, &#34;I left cash on the table!&#34;What..... the .....?????She must&#39;ve felt really crunchy there, huh!?Overall, my incredibly honest advice is to avoid this place like the plague. There&#39;s a reason they&#39;re on groupon and trying to get business in. They are horrible.I walked my happy self to Raw and got a giant salad for $10. Never again Bin 36, never again."

I was right. The whole menu is geared to pair with your wine. Being Pinot Noir lovers, we first did a flight of all 4 of their pinots. I ended up loving the one from Oregon and Macedonia. We paired it with the amazing cheese flight called buffalo, cow, sheep, goat. Sounds like the beginning of a bad joke but it was far from bad. The blue Brie was to die for.For dinner, I had the salmon which was just eh and him the porkchop, which he felt the same.We both agreed that this place is definitely more of a wine and bite place rather than for a full dinner experience. It&#39;s just not worth the $$$."

Disclaimer I&#39;m not a sommelier nor do I make or inspect cheese for a living but I know my pallette and what my pallette likes. So let&#39;s dive in.Started off with the &#34;Bin 36&#34; cheese flight which came with Persian feta, cremeux de bourgogne, fait gras, la clare, maple leaf, and cambozola. Each of there were great and different a very pleasant start. Also ordered two wine flights the &#34;I love cheese&#34;(because it seemed like a safe bet considering cheese was ordered) and &#34;we love italy&#34; all were great and came with small descriptions which help in placing the flavor profile and scents. Since the cheese flight was quite a bit we split one entree.We ordered the Roasted Amish Chicken - braised collard greens, smoked scarlett runner beans, heirloom grits, pan gravy. This was amazing the flavor profiles were perfect, the chicken was tender, the greens perfect, grits amazing,  the only negative is the consistency on the beans some were slightly under cooked but pretty much on the cusp.For dessert we had the Arroz con Leche - churros and dulce de leche ice cream. These flavors were great but  the churros were still doughy and the rice was undercooked more crunch than al dente.Overall this was a pleasurable experience and would have been that much better with a few quality checks on product from kitchen but none the less I&#39;d easily come back and recommend Bin 36 to anyone."

We came for an early dinner on New Year&#39;s Day, and it was a delightful dining experience. I&#39;ll admit I hesitated for a moment after reading some of the negative reviews, but then i considered the sources.  If you are looking for quick, this is not for you. If you are looking for a $10 anything, this is not for you. This restaurant is for those with an appreciation for the true experience of dining, thoroughly enjoying their company and each course.We were greeted immediately and taken to our table (we had a reservation). Service was outstanding - plates were cleared, water constantly filled, the wait staff was constantly assessing our needs without the feeling that they were rushing us or hovering. Our waiter Roberto was quick to make recommendations on apps and was very pleasant as well as attentive. The owner was on-site and seemed to bounce from table to table checking on guests. A little weird that he did not visit our table, but I&#39;ll try not to take it personally.We came with the intention of a leisurely multi-course meal and drinks. We started with the Bin36 cheese flight, charcuterie flight and roasted bone marrow. The cheese flight was as expected, some hits some misses. The cabernet gelee was a delightful addition to the chevre. The only problem we found was that the &#34;crostini&#34; that came with both flights while crispy and a welcomed contrast in texture, was far too delicate to hold any cheeses or meats. A more sturdy crostini or lavash would have been much more enjoyable.The charcuterie flight was delicious, rabbit, pheasant, chicken liver, ham, yum!  The star of the night, however, was the roasted bone marrow with smoked maple butter and roasted garlic marmalade. I cannot express my joy at this dish. Smooth, melt in your mouth delicious with just a hint of sweet. This will be a staple each time I return.For a entree I went with the house aged strip loin. It was cooked to perfection and the  charred romanesco and house made mashed potatoes were pleasurable as well. My sister went with the roasted duck. She seemed quite pleased with the crispy sear and we both enjoyed our first ever bite of salsify.Dessert for me was the creme brulee. Smooth with a thick brulee. More on the whipped fluffy side than the rich creamy custard side, but enjoyable none the less. And my sister enjoyed the arroz con leche while I enjoyed the heavenly fragrance of the accompanying  churros!  Throw in a couple of house special drinks and a lovely time was had by all.Any time I look up a menu on the website and notice no prices, i get a little nervous, flashing back to my dad&#39;s old saying &#34;if you have to ask, you can&#39;t afford it.&#34;  Not the case here. 2 drinks, 2 flights, an additional app, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, and our bill was just under $200.  I consider it quite a bargain for the quality and the zip code. I will be sure to visit BIN36 again whether for a full dinner or wine and bites before or after a show.  Well done guys :)"

Yes, it&#39;s just a delicious as it sounds). The pork chop was deliciously fatty but probably not the most attractive dish to order on a date. I had a lot of chewing to do.My date ordered the roasted Amish chicken.  I don&#39;t remember what all was on his plate because he ate it so quickly. Needless to say, he really enjoyed it.

It&#39;s in the building I work in so it&#39;s super convenient. And I LOVED the old location in River North. It was my favorite place to bring out of town guests.But I&#39;ve been here a few times since they opened and have mostly been disappointed.Today I ordered a burger for lunch to go. I called around 12:40 PM and the guy said to give it 15 minutes. So I came down at 1 PM and paid and the girl at the hostess stand said &#34;Katie?&#34; and I said no. And then she asked if I had a burger well done with extra ketchup. Still no. So then she just rang me up and said my burger would be right out.The place was very crowded with people waiting for their takeout orders. (The $8 lunch specials are a really great deal, as long as you don&#39;t get the salads, which are TINY and not even worth $4.) Around 1:15 (so 30+ min since I placed my order), the hostess came out with a few orders. She had to open the containers since there were no tickets. She opened the one and said it was a &#34;grilled burger?&#34; And I asked &#34;is that not your normal burger?&#34; And she didn&#39;t really answer, apparently not knowing. But it was a burger, I ordered a burger, so I took my food back to my office.I got to my desk and got ready to eat and when I opened the box with the burger, I saw not a burger, but a grilled chicken sandwich. I&#39;m still so confused how the hostess confused a chicken breast with a burger, but she did.I took it back down and told the woman what happened and she just took it back and said I should wait for my burger. No apology, no nothing.About 10 minutes later, I got my burger, checked right there in the restaurant to make sure it was a burger, and was on my way. The burger itself was half raw, half well done and the cheese wasn&#39;t even melted. Overall, pretty disappointing, even for $8.I was not the only one who waited a long time to get their food. The lobby of the restaurant was about 5-6 people, all waiting over 30 min for their orders.I don&#39;t mind waiting, I understand things get busy, but be honest on the phone when someone places an order. I specifically called ahead so I wouldn&#39;t have to wait, and then ended up waiting almost an hour to get my lunch. That is not acceptable."

Really tasty red wines ( i can&#39;t speak to the whites but i did not hear any complaints ) and decent charcuterie. They had us in a private-ish room that was hidden behind a curtain, so we had plenty of space to mingle with co workers.The problem was at the end. Our happy hour ended at 7pm and they started very quickly removing all of the tables and putting the curtain up, so that we were just standing in the center of the restaurant.. I think they could&#39;ve either A. given us a warning before they were going to do this... Or B waited until we finished our drinks to leave.I accidentally left my backpack there after all of the confusion and moving the tables around. I realized when I got home that I left it there.. I called, the woman on the phone was very rude and said they hadn&#39;t seen it... I call back again 15 minutes later saying I know I left my backpack there.. A different, much nicer man told me he had just found my bag. Not sure why the first woman was so rude and quick to shut me down without even looking.. Pretty bad customer service to me. When I finally get there I left the two working the front desk know how I am feeling; I mention that the first time I called no one looked.

It&#39;s really tender and delicious. I know I&#39;ll come back again.They have a big wine selection but not necessarily a good one. A lot of them are relatively cheap. I like that you can order by cup and then they give you a piece of paper with the name and description of that wine as well as its price by bottle. I didn&#39;t quite like the ones I tried. But I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find something sooner or later.

The outdoor area was covered (so if it had rained we would have been just fine) and has plenty of tables and even couches to sit at with nearly any size group. The ambiance is set with candles and it just has a really cool atmosphere. One thing, however, that I would caution: I&#39;d be weary of sitting next to the walls (with the plants on top). As we were finishing dinner I noticed to very large spiders descend the wall (from the plants) and begin to build webs. Left undisturbed they would have been very unpleasant surprises for anyone sitting there, but our server, after we gave her a heads up, did the humane thing and moved one of them to the sidewalk (via a menu).Bathroom: I did not use it during our visit.Staff: Our server was really cool and VERY knowledgeable about the food, wine, cocktails; everything! The bus boys were very speedy as well and our water glasses were always full.Food/Drink: We started with some wine flights and cocktails/beer. Everything was great and our server&#39;s bourbon recommendation was spot-on. We then had a cheese plate (pretty tasty) and the Blistered Shishito Peppers (very tasty and not too spicy) before starting into our main course. For dinner we had the burger + fires (pretty standard), the roasted chicken w/ chimichurri (perfectly cooked and delicious!) and the Cauliflower Steak (a huge slab of cauliflower, grilled - fantastic!).Value: This is a classy place that offers some different items so as you&#39;d imagine it&#39;s pretty pricey. Everything was excellent, so we definitely didn&#39;t feel ripped off, but we certainly won&#39;t be coming here on a weekly basis.This is a fantastic place that has great food/drinks, great atmosphere, and wonderful staff - we will certainly be coming back in the future."

My boyfriend and I went there for dinner last Saturday night. We made a reservation for 8pm but showed up about 10 minutes late. We had to wait for our table (totally understandable) but while we were waiting (for only 5 minutes), they gave us each a glass of champagne. Automatically we were impressed!Then to the meal, we each ordered a wine flight which was wonderful and we had the brussel sprouts and mushroom toast to start. The mushroom toast was a little salty for us, but the brussel sprouts were full of flavor and really yummy.We ordered the steak for dinner (just 1 to share) and ordered it medium. When it arrived it came medium rare. The waiter immediately offered to take it back and waited until we tasted it to make sure we were satisfied but we tasted it and it was still delicious so we told him no problem. As we are enjoying our meal, the owner came over, goes &#34;That steak looks more medium rare than medium, I put in another order for you so we can give you actual medium this time.&#34; We were shocked. NEVER had we had this type of service before- so incredible!!! Sure enough, he brought out a new steak that was perfectly cooked.From the welcome we got when we first got there, to our waiter, to the owner taking a vested interested in whether we were enjoying our meal, we were blown away with the service. Everything was delicious and we will definitely be back!!"

We also ordered the sweet potatoe chipotle soup which was incredible as well!As for entrees, I ordered the burger which was decent; however, the bun to burger ratio was seriously off.

Win.Also good, the cheese flights.  Again, very reasonably priced, with the usual accoutrements of crisps, jam, sliced apples, etc.  Again, very solid.Now the bad: the food.  As many other reviewers indicated, the portions are small.  And with such small portions, you&#39;d expect a delicate balance of flavors and textures.  Not exactly.  I feel like the perfect duck has a nice crisp &#39;confit-style&#39; skin, with slightly medium meat.  Here, the meat was perfectly medium, but unfortunately so was the skin.  With 4 tiny bite sized pieces over some undercooked grains, it just wasn&#39;t worth $29.  Same with their burger.  A solid burger, but an $18 worthy burger.Overall, we would only probably come back for pre-dinner drinks and cheese plates."

I recall the location as being cavernous, not necessarily the most conducive to sipping wine and relaxing. Fast forward to last Tuesday, when I stumbled onto the West Loop location after leaving book club at Open Books. The stars had aligned, as I happened to look down Jefferson Street and recognized the sign. From the looks of it, there is outdoor seating, but the weather wasn&#39;t up to par, so the covers were still on tables and chairs. As luck would have it, I could sign up for an app, Wisely, with which the restaurant had partnered. For my troubles, I got a free glass of Prosecco, definitely the right way to cap off a long day. I ended up staying for a sample of the rose wine and some cheese--I tried the Humboldt Fog.  It looks like this place is going to be a hard habit for me to break, as I stopped by later that week, on Friday evening, before a panel discussion in the neighborhood. This time I ordered food--the fish of the day (salmon) which came with a pea puree and beets. The fish was excellent although the beets were slightly underdone. The Van Duzer Pinot Noir, while one I&#39;d tried before, was a great complement to the dish. The food menu includes wine pairings and the wine is cross-referenced to the food, which is very helpful when choosing among the selections. I sat at the bar which was convivial without being claustrophobic. The cocktails looked good, unfortunately I arrived too late to take advantage of these happy hour specials (specialty cocktails and nibbles).  This is not esoteric stuff, as one will find at other West Loop spots, but sometimes a person just craves well-executed, recognizable food. This accessible approach to food and wine has made a fan out of me. I will certainly be adding this spot to my rotation."

Got the Brussels sprouts, decent but wouldn&#39;t highly recommend.WHEN THE CHECK CAME OUT...Brussels sprouts were on the bill.

The main dining area is a little cold, but the patio looked very inviting. Service was really good and I especially appreciated them doing some parts of the dishes on the side to accommodate some of us sharing food and having different tolerances for spicy, dairy, etc..The wine flights were interesting, but I also thought there was a lot of complication on the menu ($3.22 for this pour, $4.16 that). Just charge flat prices.We had the brussels sprouts (good, heavy handed on the cheese), lobster roll (really overlooked seafood and bland), peaches with cheese (okay, but expensive for what was served), and pork (freaking amazing with the perfect cook on the meat).The menu itself reads wonderfully, but the execution was not great and given the prices, it was disappointing. Let me be clear that the prices are really reasonable if the food had lived up to the descriptions.The staff was really great so I&#39;ll give them another try and hope they get their food kinks worked out."

The Brussels sprouts were the best I ever had. I ordered the burger, a sin at such a delicious menu, which was tasty and sweet and cooked to absolute perfection.

The grits were amazing with a nice creamy texture contrasted by small pieces of crunch from the bacon. The biscuits and gravy were great with a nice sweetness to the sausage. The lemon pancakes were outstanding. Bin has somehow found a way to make pancakes feel light. Paired with that I tested out the Bloody Mary Tasting with the English Breakfast version being my fave.Somehow I was able to make enough room to have some desserts as well. The ice creams and sorbets were ridiculously good with the peach ice cream and coconut sorbet being my faves. The beignets were also fantastic.My favorite item though has to be the housemade sangria. Just seeing the cold drip device used to make it is worth the trip. Order a glass and be amazed. The spices come through so well that you&#39;ll soon be on your third glass before you know it.

They also brought small glasses of prosecco to the table, without us telling they we were there for a special night, which was a lovely way to start off the meal.We ordered the charcuterie platter and a cheese flight plus one extra cheese to start. The charcuterie plate was amazing. I couldn&#39;t stop eating the foie gras parfait. I was a little disappointed at the size of the cheese that was served however. Very small serving size. Very hard to split with a group. We also ordered some extra bread, and they charged us a $1. We needed it and it was worth a dollar, but that felt a little cheap as there were 5 of us, and there wasn&#39;t enough bread originally served for us each to have a piece for each platter.We also split a bunch of sides, the brussel sprouts, bone marrow, grilled octopus, warm bread with spreads.We all ordered wine flights which were lots of fun, as well as a glass of the brachetto to finish the meal. The service was excellent. They overcharged us for our dessert wine, but once I pointed it out they fixed it right away and without complaint. The staff were very friendly, and even helped us get a cab at the end of the (rainy) night. And by that I mean someone went outside and hailed us a cab. Great service."

It&#39;s located in just the right location,too.  between the loop and west loop/ river west. Parking is not bad. This restaurant is true to his name with its many wine flights, cheese flights, and exquisite food pairings.I enjoyed the bubbly wine flight as well as the &#39;pour some sugar on me &#39; flight. (It was a long week). I elected to go with the pork chop which came with a scrumptious peach ceviche! YUM. We also had the chef&#39;s special as an appetizer. I&#39;m delighted with the fact that, our waitress, Maggie never disappointed us with her explanation of each potential course. We finished our meal with the raspberry beignets! Not too shabby.  Throughout the night, we were even greeted by the owner! I must say he and his staff were beyond the best in customer service and overall ability to make sure you had a great time. Now, if you are looking for a place that serves massive amounts of food, this is not the place for you. However,If you want to get your palette wet with just the right Portion of amazingness, then go here for dinner. If not, meet your girlfriends or take a date here, they&#39;ll love it!"

Which then we got the mimosas flight which was great! The food is amazing! We ordered the Eggs Benedict, shrimp and grits, Kentucky hot brown, and 2 sides of bacon, which it was delicious! Not only was the food exceptionally wonderful, the staff was very personable and great as well. I would highly recommend this restaurant! Such a great experience!"

My doctor told me it was &#34;campelobacter&#34; and it takes over a week to go away...in my case nine days. Bin 36 was the only place we had a common meal (we shared appetizers - the cheese plate and the meat plate) and I am guessing one of those was to blame.  The food poisoning symptoms emerged about 36 hours after eating lunch at Bin 36 and that is typical with &#34;campelobacter&#34;.I did not find a way to leave Bin 36 an email on their website and I would have done that if possible.  While the food was certainly tasty and the service was fine, there were unintended consequences.  I hope it was an isolated incident!"

I went with a friend for a dinner and were quickly seated and waited on. The restaurant gives you the option to sit outside and it&#39;s quite lovely. We ordered the ham prosciutto, artisan breads, the risotto, the Amish chicken, and a cheese flight and shared everything.The ham prosciutto and artisan breads were good but nothing special. I liked the intense flavor and saltiness of the prosciutto.The risotto was extremely moist and creamy. I would ask for it with less lime next time because the flavor is overbearingly sour despite its flavor.The Amish chicken was the star of the meal. It is possibly the best roast chicken, if not the best chicken, I&#39;ve ever had. The outside is crispy while the inside is juicy and flavorful. I absolutely recommend this. The smashed potatoes that came with the chicken was extremely fresh and slightly salty. I didn&#39;t add any seasoning like I usually do with mashed potatoes.I forget which cheese flight we ordered but I remember that one of the four cheeses included ground up coffee beans and lavender. This was definitely our favorite. The combination of the cheeses with the crostini and the Cabernet jelly that came with was quite strange but extremely delicious.The servers were very attentive and the atmosphere of the restaurant is perfect if you&#39;re looking for a romantic dinner or a social gathering.The entire bill came out to be slightly over $100 so it&#39;s a bit on the pricey side. Although I enjoyed the food, I don&#39;t believe it was worth the price. I would maybe come again if I got another groupon or had an important dinner."

First off, it was randomly difficult to find, and not a minute past my reservation time, I was getting texts from the restaurant asking if I still planned on coming in. I explained that I couldn&#39;t find the restaurant, but they were not very helpful.We all really enjoyed the wine flights, but the names of the flights are all pretty hokey (Sexy Reds? Really?). Made the place feel pretty kitschy. We did have quite a comical service experience. We were repeatedly served (and I do mean repeatedly...like at least 4 times) other tables&#39; food. They even put a full cheese plate down on our table, and then discovered it wasn&#39;t ours, so they picked it up, walked around a corner, and then walked right back and put it on the table next to ours. We hadn&#39;t touched it, but still...I thought it was common practice that once a dish is on the table, it&#39;s served, and not able to be served to someone else? The food we did eat was fine, good even, but not special, and certainly not even nearly worth the price.All in all, I&#39;d go back for drinks, but probably not for the food."

The new location is much smaller, but offers a more intimate and cozy experience, which I prefer over the cavernous space of their previous location.The service: I came for dinner with a few friends the Thursday after they first opened, so you could tell that the servers were still getting accustomed to the menu and the layout of the space, so service was a little slower, but not terrible. They&#39;ll definitely be up to snuff after the first couple weeks.The food: the portions are smaller, which isn&#39;t a knock, but just be aware, since, as a typical American, I get accustomed to expecting supersized meals. We started with the assorted artisanal breads, which was a nice starter with the wine. I had the roasted porkchop, which was oh, so good! The right balance of savory with a little bit of sweet from the sweet potatoes and the apple butter, and the porkchop was cooked to the right temp too. My friends had the burger and the strip steak, which, they were quite pleased with as well.The drinks: Granted, I know little about wine, but I enjoyed the We Reign in Spain wine flight... I enjoyed swirling it around like I knew what I was doing, but mostly just consuming it. It comes with on a sheet of paper which tells you which wines are which and some info about them, which is super great. I wish places that do beer flights would do this as well."

Anyone who was at the old Bin 36 knows they did two things really well, wine and cheese. The new Bin brings the same great wine and cheese but adds a new chef making much better food, a smaller more intimate space, and less tourists and more wine lovers. Hard to go wrong.It&#39;s easily one of the best places in the city for wine and everything you try is available to take home by the bottle at reasonable prices. The cheese is still fantastic (try the mozzarella). Chef Shane has several really tasty items on the menu (try the cheese fritters or the raspberry beignets). The space is much more conducive to a date or nice dinner with friends and there&#39;s a patio for summertime hanging out.Also a really friendly staff and an owner who clearly has a passion for wine but isn&#39;t at all pretentious about it.I highly recommend."

Preface by saying, I used a Groupon coupon for the evening.  Upon arrival, reservation was not on the books for some reason even though I had made them a week prior. Very pleasant hostess greeted us at the door. Once we were seated, Damian (sp?) introduced himself to us as our Server. Asking if this was our first time at Bin36, we said yes he proceeded to lament over the fact that we were new and he had to explain everything to us. Listen chief, 35 years as an Executive Chef, I don&#39;t need the attitude. After that, things were more positive. He knew the menu inside and out and described everything with passion and knowledge although he wasn&#39;t a big fan of the roasted bone marrow which I love. Anyway, we started off with the brussels sprouts appetizer. They were named the best in the city for a reason. Although, they may want to watch the season with the salt. The caper dressing naturally is salty as is the Wisconsin Parmesan cheese. To note, the owner Mr. Enoch Shully is a positively delightful person whom has a table presence, really first class guy.Our second course, main, my wife had the roasted airline chicken breast with chimichurri sauce and I had the bourbon glazed pork chop. Kudo&#39;s to the chef with the proteins, although no temperature was asked for the pork, both dishes were very good. I was curious as to the effort made with frenching the pork chop and the airline wing bone but the okra on my dish was spotted and old.Dessert was limited by the absence of the signature caramel cake which was a real disappointment to my wife. For me, I knew from the beginning the bleu cheese flight with a Port was in store for me. It&#39;s very hard to find that available in the city and Bin36 does it right with all of their cheese flights.Points of interest;Wine suggestions are circled by number for all food items which makes life much easier for all.Menu is very limited in choices and they offer no specials? Having said that, from what we saw, everything looks great.I know people who use Groupon have a bad rap for being cheap, so remember to tip your server on the gross of the check not the net after the Groupon discount. As an example, our Groupon discount was $80 with a net owing of $36 but I tipped on a $120. Don&#39;t &#34;punish&#34; the Server for the discount you received, treat them right.Another plus was the Groupon parking for $6 which was only a 1000 feet away from the door on Lake Street. The parking voucher gives you 3 hours so it&#39;s perfect for a nice dinner and a short walk back to the car.If you&#39;re looking for an affordable, upscale/casual night with very good wine choices, this place is for you. I would love to attend a wine dinner here and see what Chef Shane and Mr. Shully create. My wife didn&#39;t share the same opinion because of the very limited menu and no real wow factor plus the initial attitude of the Server really turned her a little sour on the experience."

We stopped in on a Tuesday for a late lunch of several yummy green salads sprinkled with edible flowers (a POP of happy color after a long Chicago winter), spicy sautéed deep greens, and perfectly charred carrots with tangy dill cream and little crunchy barley puffs. We sampled and PLAYED with different tastes and textures in a 4 cheese flight. The artisanal whole grain bread basket was accompanied by the most delicious dips (the potato chutney was my winner) and fresh goat butter...mmm.Our bartender Amanda was just lovely. Knowledgeable, generous, and attentive. The Manager and Beverage Director, Enoch Shully, came out and personally extended a warm welcome, beaming with the energy and enthusiasm that really lights up a room.Oh, and the WINE! The white flight we ordered was nothing short of amazing, with two standouts: a Washington Chenin Blanc and an Oregon Pinot Gris. After ordering a few glasses of our favorites, we decided to buy two bottles to take home, conveniently, on the spot...for a very reasonable market price.I loVE the new and improved BIN 36.

Enoch, the new owner, stopped by and was very present throughout the restaurant during both of my visits.  He has clearly spent considerable time ensuring that every detail of the new Bin is up to par!Where do I even begin with the food and drinks.... We were curious about the cold drip sangria and the Nose, so we tried both.  Not only were they delicious, and unlike any cocktail I&#39;ve ever had, but they were true experiences.  We had a variety of tasty shared plates and desserts. One was better than the next, and they were all presented beautifully.  The brussels sprouts, pimento cheese fritters, and raspberry beignets were my favorites...although it wasn&#39;t easy to narrow it down to just three!I&#39;ll be back soon to try out more of Chef Shane&#39;s creations...and of course a wine flight!"

We never felt rushed and really enjoyed the cheese plate before ordering dinner. My wife loved the cauliflower steak she had. For something that sounds kind of bland, there was tons of flavor.I&#39;ll add that we had a Groupon and let the server know when we started. I&#39;ve heard of getting second rate service when using one at various places. This was not the case at Bin 36. The service from the entire staff, including management, was perfect. The owner greeted us, gave a deeper background to the wines we were enjoying, and made sure we were happy with the food.

I loved everything about it-- the details on the interior, tall bar stools, floor tiles, kitchen setup.We came here at ~3pm on a Sunday, after we were done walking along the nearby 606 Trail. It was perfect timing as there was no wait to get seated. And, we were hungry. It was 82F outside but I still wanted to try the chicken pozole. Wow, it was really good. A solid bowl of pozole it was. My husband had the brisket and he enjoyed it very much as well.I have to mention the SALSA MACHA. Seriously the best thing ever. The tables have little bottles of condiments on the side. One of the condiments was a non-descript metal jar and all it said was &#34;Contains nuts...&#34; Out of curiosity, we tried and it was ahh-mazing. We loved it so much that we asked our server what was it. He said they do sell it for $8 for customers to enjoy at home. I&#39;ve since used it at home for different home cooking purposes :)"

Cheese dip transforms to pimento dip, toast is spread with avocados, and their super crispy fried chicken is amped up with peas and gravy.We&#39;ve gotten delivery from Dove&#39;s and really enjoyed their food in the comfort of home; however, I just had the full Dove&#39;s experience with Daniel C where we dined in. I recommend both!Parking wasn&#39;t nearly as difficult as anticipated. I snagged free street parking about two blocks south on Damen whereas Daniel paid the meter for his spot north. Then, we were also surprised that it wasn&#39;t busy when we went for dinner during the week.I think that all of the seats are counter - whether at the huge bar/kitchen area or along the walls and windows. We balanced on cushioned stools bolted to the floor and swiveled to face one another.The bar tender and server was amazing. He was perfectly pleasant and helpful. At the end of our meal he surprised us with a spicy juice pallet cleanser.In regards to the food and drinks, I assert that there are a few menu items for everybody. A number of things will appeal to you and others won&#39;t. For example, I loved my beet salad and blood sausage. The duck was a little salty and hard to eat and I preferred the fried chicken. However, it was clear that all of it was well constructed from quality ingredients."

It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not adventurous to branch out and try anything else on the menu but hey, if it ain&#39;t broke don&#39;t fix it. The wrap is like a meal in its own. Also the horchata pie was excellent.I describe service is interesting for two reasons: on my first visit, the kitchen didn&#39;t get whatever orders correct, so it took a while for my dish to come out even though my friend got hers a long time before. The waiter apologized and comped our desserts, which was great.  The weird thing was he kept rubbing the small of my back every time he came to our table. He didn&#39;t do it to her so odd and overly familiar. Since they ran out of the Horchata pie on my second visit, the next time I came in, I asked the waitress before even placing my order to keep a slice of the pie for me for later. She said it would be fine and they had a lot. However when she went on her smoke break, they ran out. Whomp whom but why the heck didn&#39;t she keep aside a slice in the first place? Oh well, the brisket probably will have me coming back."

I don&#39;t think they serve that dish anymore, but I&#39;m open to going again to try more of their food.Their cocktails are also really delicious, considering that a lot of places have fruity cocktails that just end up tasting like cough syrup, I&#39;m all about getting a pitcher of cantarito."

Got a seat at the bar, and ordered some quick food on the go.Started out with their pimento cheese sampler for only $5. I was going to order the regular pimento cheese off their menu, but they had a happy hour sampler special. Also got the corn on the cob small plate, and a $5 glass of rose wine as another one of their happy hour specials.Corn came out and was amazing. Smokey, with fresh cotija cheese, some kind of salsa verde, charred, and with a chipotle dressing. I made a mess eating it at the bar but I didn&#39;t care. Pimento cheese was also great, creamy with a hint of extra heat with some pickled serranos sprinkled on top.My only complaint was the crackers that came with the cheese. They were blah, just a bunch of saltines on a plate. The pimento cheese was so good, it just didn&#39;t taste good on those crackers. I ordered texas toast as a side, and the cheese tasted way better on that.With great friendly staff and awesome happy hour specials, I&#39;ll be back!"

On our most recent visit, I had the hojaldres de jamon y queso and the bf had the burnt ends hash. Their dishes are always very flavorful and vibrant. I loved how mine had a tangy salad on the side.

Four stars were both brunch; I docked half a point for the time I went for dinner because SO many items on the menu were unavailable. Both times at brunch I went with the crepes because I was having a random sweet craving. The crepes aren&#39;t the best ever, but they are pretty good.The standout item on the menu is the chicken fried chicken, which I have actually not personally ordered because I&#39;ve tried bites when friends ordered it, and I wanted to branch out and try other things on the menu -- but next time I come here, I am definitely going for the chicken fried chicken.

The cocktail was beautiful before and after mixing, and was very refreshing. I&#39;m curious to try their other libations! The meat in the tacos was not very apparent as it was mixed with the eggs, but the flavors were delicious! The tacos were very well filled and I enjoyed the tortillas.

But really, it&#39;s rowdy and it&#39;s just tacos.We decided to be grown-up and eat at Dove&#39;s next door (same owners, after all). No regrets! Great people watching from the window seats, and a way more interesting menu than Big Star. The food is so beyond basic here, they really know how to pack a flavor punch. The potatoes &amp; peppers are a must. The grilled romaine and cauliflower fritters, also great, but the potatoes were the stand-out. Put their homemade salsa on everything!

I arrived on a late Saturday morning with 2 dining partners and the wait was approximately one hour. I&#39;ll tell you now; it was well worth the wait (and I&#39;m an impatient person lol). The good part about Dove&#39;s location is that it&#39;s surrounded by greatness from specialty clothing, shoe, hat and lingerie boutiques as well as cafés, donut shops, surplus stores and of course Wicker Park. We had plenty to occupy our time until they called the cell phone to notify us that our table was ready.We opted for seats at the bar which was a super cool view with a super cool server. The drinks were spot on from the coffee to mimosas &amp; cocktails. We all tried something different and sampled a taste of heaven in every bite from each other&#39;s plate. I must say....my Oyster Omelette was a real crowd favorite.On to décor (because well, décor is crucial to me). Think 60&#39;s nostalgia; juke box player, chrome detailing, window bar stools that swivel, linen napkins, heavy silverware, beautiful ceramic mugs, dimly lit well kept restroom &amp; servers with style.

The food was heavily Mexican influenced with all kind of twist and turns.We ordered some Mexican beers and cauliflower fritters to start. That was a dish I did not care for it was pretty tasteless. I actually went with a good friend of mine who is a chef and he would not let me have one until he sprinkled some salt on top of them.We also tried a cheese spread platter that was ok. The menu is confusing. It goes from very Mexican to contemporary dishes.The second time I took my gf and we decided to give the beats appetizer and the seafood cocktail a try. The beats dish is very contemporary but the pepitas did not work for us. The seafood cocktail was good nothing to come back for again.My gf ordered a tequila based bloody marry that was awful. It literary tasted like salsa roja with tequila. It had a base of spices on the bottom of the drink. It should really be taken off the menu.If we go back there was some other interesting choices in the menu but I doubt we will.

If you sit at the bar area on the fair left side, you can watch the record selection live in person. Definitely a nice touch for this vintage themed diner.And all of that aside, the food was great and well priced. The pozole is what won me over. That braised pork shoulder in that chile broth and avocado and radishes and cilantro--the flavors were all so crisp and fresh and they all melted together in your mouth. It was filling but with the light chile broth it all just went together so well! The enchiladas were also good with the collard greens, but not quite up to the pozole standard for our group. And I think it is phenomenal that you can add an egg to anything for a $1. Sure call that trendy since adding an egg on anything seems to be a trend these days.

Brunch was once again going to be a sibling&#39;s affair.The place was packed to the gills and bustling with the clatter of plates and utensils, people talking, children crying, and I sort of regretted the idea of eating here when my head felt like it was stuffed with Brillo pads. Then I remembered Dove&#39;s has a bloody mary that can bring anyone back from the dead, so I soldiered on and talked to the hostess, and within 20 minutes I was seated. A couple minutes later Little Sis arrived. I could tell she was out of breath from walking but she tried to play it cool. She complained about us not getting a booth but I tell her it&#39;s fine. The two guys next to us wore suspenders, burlap pants, and wool shirts. They asked the waitress for goat&#39;s milk.Our waitress was extremely friendly and took our drink orders as soon as Sis was situated. Right away I knew what I wanted: the chicken fried chicken, breaded with buttermilk and smothered in chorizo verde gravy. I asked Sis what she&#39;s getting and she said the little gem wedge salad, which is romaine lettuce with grilled radicchio. I love my sister, but like a lot of plus sized women today, she&#39;s so caught up in the world&#39;s current standards for beauty. Instead of making her feel guilty or adding more pressure to her decision, I simply told her she&#39;s beautiful. The menu lowered from her face slightly to show her eyes, looking up at me suspiciously. &#34;Healthy at all sizes,&#34; I said. The menu rose to cover her face again. &#34;I just feel like a salad,&#34; she said. Fried chicken is her favorite, so I told her about the amazing chicken fried chicken. The strips are crisped to perfection, and the gravy comes with sweet peas and pearled onions for a more full bodied texture. From behind the menu she said she&#39;s good with her decision. I suggested it could be her cheat meal. She said it wasn&#39;t even about that, so I let it go.Our drinks arrived and after a couple sips off the bloody mary, I felt like a million bucks. Dove&#39;s doesn&#39;t skimp on the vodka here. When our waitress arrived with our meals I ordered another bloody, and asked for a second plate so I could give my Sis some of the chicken. She told the waitress really, don&#39;t.We talked about traveling and the upcoming marathon. Apparently she&#39;s joined a CrossFit gym. I wonder if it&#39;s because she&#39;s seen my progress, the leanness around my clavicle, but I don&#39;t say anything. She doesn&#39;t need another person telling her what she can and can&#39;t do. I only know that I will be there for her when she fails.The waitress was asking about dessert when a rush of people burst through the door and filled the aisles in the restaurant. They carried signs and chanted, &#34;While you are here celebrating over brunch, black families are struggling to keep themselves safe from CPD.&#34; Most of the patrons lookeddown at their plates and stayed silent. A few people pulled out their camera phones. Our waitress was strangely frozen mid sentence as protesters walked around our table. Even my Sis was bowing down at her plate, refusing to make eye contact. A young black woman lowered her sign and stared at me, and it was only then I realized it&#39;s because I was standing with her, and I heard &#34;Sixteen shots and a cover up&#34; come out of my own mouth. The protesters around me stepped back a little, as if the words sounded different coming from me. I wanted to say I supported what they were doing, we&#39;re on the same side, but I kept tripping over the phrase &#34;My brothas&#34; and after a while they all left. Children were crying and patrons looked around helplessly. Our waitress started backing away but not before I ordered a slice of Hoosier mama pie."

I love the atmosphere and vibe, plus they have a good looking guy on the line. However when I was in, I was not feeling the hostess on staff at all. She kept exclaiming, &#34;I&#39;m so bored!!!&#34; and trying to get the chefs to make up games with her. They didn&#39;t seem to be feeling it at all as she would lay herself on the counter in front of them. Her very clear unhappiness to be at work just put a damper on everything for me.Dove&#39;s Luncheonette didn&#39;t have a ton of menu items to choose from and I kept going over and over the menu trying to find something that called out to me. It&#39;s a Tex Mex menu with a diner atmosphere. I ended up getting a steak dish and it was quite tasty. Just be warned it takes forever to come out and I was told that is because it was steak. The chicken fried chicken looked like a good dish that I think I will end up trying if I ever go back.Dove&#39;s dishes are $12-16 and I realize I&#39;m biased as I didn&#39;t completely enjoy myself, but it seems slightly overpriced. I feel bad but I just am not into Dove&#39;s, however I&#39;d absolutely give it another chance."

It&#39;s a diner with semi traditional diner items but with a twist to make it a little more high end. Prices are good, but not traditional cheap diner good.

Though I am hard pressed to change my mind, I would probably give Dove&#39;s another run. The cocktails were good. The carne asada was not special. The chicken was moist &amp; flavorful, but I still wouldn&#39;t order it if it were up to me. I was under a brunch understanding on arrival &amp; super ready for it. I sat down to a Tex Mex menu with no desire for it &amp; let the birthday girl pick all the food. She happened to order everything I wasn&#39;t interested in to begin with. Perhaps they deserve another shot."

Mexican with a diner twist? I can&#39;t tell. Most dishes I&#39;ve tried here are greasy and overpriced but it&#39;s fine if that&#39;s your thing. I&#39;ve been here about 3 times... The sides often taste better than the mains. The hash and hush puppies are great but those are hard to screw up. I&#39;ve heard the pork shoulder soup is outstanding too. However my daily dinner menu item of squash and pepper quesadilla was forgettable and tasted more like a panini.The servers seem frantic and passive aggressive... One time they charged the wrong bill on my friend&#39;s card and another time we had a party of four which they sat against some bar tables against a wall with no window. It made it really hard for us to talk. I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t think this place is really for group dinners but if you want to impress your date with potent drinks and horchata pie...

Order this with fried eggs. Can&#39;t go wrong with this dish. Tasty and crunchy. Make sure you use their jar of homemade spice.- arugula salad. Fresh and light. I felt like going healthy today.

I&#39;ve always wanted to stop in for brunch on the weekend but it&#39;s always slammed. So as we were wandering around Wicker Park Post gym, I thought it would be the perfect time. We walked in and were seated quickly at the counter like spots along the windows, great for people watching. Our server greeted us and told us of the items they were out of, nothing that we we&#39;re too interested in anyway, so no biggie. My husband and I decided to share a few things so we started with the ceviche which is the shrimp tostada Then followed up by the tortilla soup and next one, the showstopper... potato cheese hash with a fried egg on top. We should have stopped there and would have been full but we had already ordered the brisket taco.  It took forever to get our drinks and for the food to start coming but once it did it was pretty much one right after another. I will say that the potato hash rocked My World and that all of the items that we had, had a really great flavor profiles and tons of kick. The brisket Taco was huge, I would highly recommend sharing with someone if you go that route but make sure that you are up for the spiciness, as it was pretty hot. Definitely opt the fried egg on top of the potato hash that was amazing and the most flavorful item of the evening. The ceviche while tasty, was a little lackluster but we were so hungry that we gobbled it up. The tortilla soup was really tasty full of flavor and it was nice that all of the toppings came on the side so we could add as we pleased. Overall a very successful dining experience and we will be back especially for those potatoes!"

With an instant, it&#39;s clear that this hopping brunch spot is heavily influenced by Mexican styles...the menu boasts items such as enchiladas, sopapillas, tacos and small plates to include shrimp tostadas and potatoes and shishito peppers. We had the taco entree with kimchi and added brisket, the chicken fried chicken with gravy and peas and the sopapillas with fresh fruit. The side of potatoes and peppers is delicious! Cooked perfectly with just the right amount of cheese and seasoning. Additionally, we started with the pimento cheese and shrimp tostada. Both amazing. Use the oil with jalapeño seasoning on the table to your bite of pimento cheese spread...adds the perfect kick. The shrimp tostada has some type of avocado sauce, I don&#39;t recall its exact name, but it was tasty! Our service was quick and friendly, and their bussers were never lacking in water and coffee refills.

Nor will we suggest anyone go there. First thing is the service. I don&#39;t think I saw a single employee smile the whole time we were there. Our waitress looked miserable as could be. We ordered bloody &#34;Maria&#39;s&#34; because that&#39;s what was on the chalkboard. Our burgers came out before our drinks.. I mentioned it to the food runner and he said &#34;they are coming in a minute, thanks for waiting&#34;. I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve been in the hospitality industry for 9 years...you always apologize or offer something or have a manager come over. So we started eating our burger without our Bloody Mary. When they came, they were gross. The tequila was overpowering the drink. We brought up to the waitress that one in our party couldn&#39;t drink it because he didn&#39;t like it. She didn&#39;t apologize or anything. She just said it&#39;s a bloody Maria, not a Bloody Mary. She didn&#39;t offer a replacement drink that he could enjoy. I&#39;ve never been anywhere where they don&#39;t make you feel comfortable. I wish the owners good luck with employees like this. If they want to be successful, get some employees who care!"

Can&#39;t go wrong with that combination!Unfortunately for me though it didn&#39;t come with anything else, no sides, zero, nada, nothing...unless you&#39;re counting the ice water.  Personally I don&#39;t consider that a side!Honestly whatever happened to bread, bread sticks, or crackers? The old standbys. Obviously that wasn&#39;t part of the concept.Also, at that price point ($16) I was expecting better service from a more personable/attentive server and I felt the food should&#39;ve at least been presented on a newer dish, not one that&#39;s been put through the dishwasher a million times. And it would&#39;ve been nice to be able to sit at a regular (adult) table with regular (adult) chairs, not those tiny baby stools! What I&#39;d like to know is whose idiotic idea was that.... let me answer that, I&#39;d say ONE BIG cheapskate!   I felt like I was in a high school soda shop from the 50&#39;s...minus the charm, cheerful employees and reasonable prices.And while I&#39;m on a roll here, I&#39;m getting just a little sick of these concept places, a lot of hype always surrounds them, but little else.  Dove&#39;s has a definite worn out feel to it.... as in tired and worn out, not comfy and cozy, it needs a facelift!!Better yet, how about a R E A L restaurant with REAL plates, REAL bread, REAL service and REAL tables, etc.  Now that&#39;s a concept I could wrap my head around.Honestly, I can&#39;t see see Dove&#39;s lasting a whole lot longer.  It needs to go the way of, or should I say Go Away like that other concept Glazed &amp; Confused.....I mean Infused, CLOSED FOR GOOD!!!!"

The place is pretty small but we didn&#39;t have to wait to get seated. I would definitely suggest not going with a large group of people as most of the seating is against the walls. Our server, Celia, was extremely friendly and gave great suggestions throughout our meal.Started with the hushpuppies as an app. Perfect amount of crispiness and the cheese inside was delicious. Shrimp cream cheese had a good smokey flavor. For entrees I ordered the brisket taco while my friend got the pork loin sandwich. That thing was MASSIVE and looked amazing. My taco was also really big, and had large, tender strips of brisket inside. Really tasty! The dark, chunky sauce they have in the silver bottle goes well with it!We even ended up getting dessert too. The vanilla honey ice cream hit the spot after my brisket taco. Really good food that&#39;s different than just about anywhere else you&#39;ll go. It&#39;s definitely more expensive than your average diner but you get large portions of great food.5 stars!

My first Dove&#39;s experience really was, in Yelp parlance, A-OK. Nothing wrong at all: a unique atmosphere, a fun (if a bit Wicker Park-priced) menu, efficient service--heck, even their bathrooms and record collection feel very carefully curated. Everything here is very, very focused on a singular aesthetic, and in this way, it excels.Four- and five-star reviews seem to imply that you&#39;ll return again and again. And though my dinner at Dove&#39;s was perfectly pleasant, I don&#39;t really think I&#39;ll make it any sort of go-to. Delicious enchiladas, tuna ceviche, and tamale, and a great stop on an early Saturday evening, but nothing I would withstand a half-hour wait for. Ultimately, though, this place doesn&#39;t need my repeated patronage. It&#39;s got its diehards, and that&#39;s (again) A-OK!"

Both dishes were so good very flavorful. I really wanted the smothered chicken dish but they were all out at the time and I was told to come early if I want to order it next time. Both dishes needed a little extra salsa and aioli which the waitress grabbed for us no problem. I want to try the chicken so I def will return this is a great breakfast option in wicker especially if you like more savory for breakfast vs sweet.

Dove&#39;s Luncheonette is a solid 3.5, and in some circumstances I would round up to four, but that would put it in the same category as some more deserving restaurants--and, in keeping with fairness, 3 stars it is.It&#39;s a mismatch of many eras--70s wood paneling, 60s era tile, 2010s &#34;trying to be vintage but clearly not&#34; painted lettering on the window, and those same white letter tile information boards that every rustic-chic-retro-trendy restaurant is using to announce their special of avocado toast.  I have a designer colleague who would want to light this place on fire due to that mismatch, but I suppose that&#39;s part of the charm of Dove&#39;s.The host and server were very warm and welcoming, and I found our server&#39;s guidance to be the most wonderful thing of the evening. She wasn&#39;t overbearing, but was very attentive. She brought the sad news, though, of two items on the menu that they were out of: tuna ceviche and the barbacoa dish. Nonetheless, I commend Dove&#39;s for hiring great talent.I ordered the Smoked Brisket Taco Norteño, basically a large taco in a 9&#34; flour tortilla. The brisket was a little tough, the toasted peanuts and cilantro a nice touch, and the star was a stunning crisp texture from the chayote squash. It&#39;s definitely a fork and knife dish. I wouldn&#39;t order it again, though. I&#39;ve seen some stunning photos of plating from Dove&#39;s, and mine did not reflect those photos.I indulged on dessert with three scoops of three different ice creams: bourbon butter pecan, honeyed vanilla, and Jamaica coconut sorbet. I loved the bourbon butter pecan and honeyed vanilla. They both reminded me of the LaserDisc movement--it didn&#39;t last long enough! If Dove&#39;s got rid of their entire menu and only served ice cream, and I&#39;d come here every Tuesday and Thursday, and alternating Mondays.My counterpart and I were seated at a bar that wrapped around the restaurant, and we had a lovely view of a crosswalk just south of a busy intersection on Damen in Wicker Park. We throughly enjoyed staring into people&#39;s eyes as they walked across the walk, mainly because there was no other comfortable way to look.For some reason, towards the end of our time at Dove&#39;s, it felt like I was in some movie, just two guys sitting at a bar staring out of the window into the abyss of yuppie-stroller-filled Wicker Park with, and I have to mention this again, the 70s era wood paneling surrounding us. That wood paneling. I&#39;m torn between absolutely loving it or hating it.The beer was great, and I forgot what I was drinking because I was already slightly buzzed from enjoying two delicious cocktails from Scofflaw in the Logan Square/Humboldt Park neighborhood. They are known for their use of mezcal and the cocktails that came out looked spectacular.It&#39;s unique to the heart, a little eclectic, but still attractive enough for the usual &#34;let&#39;s stand up when I get my dish so I can Instagram it from a good angle and talk about our sixth trip to Coachella&#34; crowd. The flavors are there--in full force--and you won&#39;t be displeased by Dove&#39;s. It&#39;s a very nice addition to the Wicker Park dining scene, but treat yourself to some more appealing options first--Revolution Brewing, for example."

Unless you like a small amount of meat (circular patty on square toast, no less) and way too much extra overly crispy bread due to the square shape, Steak n Shake&#39;s patty melt is better. No exaggeration.The chicken fried chicken is wayyyyy overpriced; the peas, pearl onions and gravy were good but the chicken itself isn&#39;t even as good as KFC. If you want legit fried chicken go to Parson&#39;s, Roost, Crisp, Harold&#39;s or any other dedicated chicken house in the city.Even the drinks here at $9 apiece were watered and uninspired. The saving grace was the ice cream; for $4 you get three scoops of ice cream so delicious it could rival Jennie&#39;s best offerings.Conclusion: skip this overpriced hipster haven and try something more specialized."

Pepper hash is somehow ridiculously good for its simplicity. Pazole rojo is fire. Chicken fried chick could be the only thing on the menu and you would still have to get a reservation.

Overly bitter. Metropolis is superior IMO.-PANCAKE SPECIAL: quinoa and apricot with lemon crema. Very good, cooked in a cast iron skillet. This was probably the lightest dining option I could find other than avocado toast or yogurt.  Huge pancake, I ate half of it.-BRISKET HASH SPECIAL: beef brisket with salsa atop baby reds with sunny eggs. Hot sauces were excellent and complimented this dish well.Overall pretty tasty, $32 and change for two of us.  Docking a star because this menu doesn&#39;t offer any light options and sometimes it&#39;s a little jarring to eat such greasy fatty food for breakfast.  There are salads but I don&#39;t typically order salads for breakfast.  The drinks all sounded awesome, however we stuck with coffee this morning since we were on a bikeride.  A solid option for brunch if in the mood for a heavier more savory option."

I would love to love this place.  But it gets a &#34;Meh&#34; from me. For 20 bucks, you&#39;ve got lots of better options for a weekday breakfast.Seeing the place at 9am after an early appointment in Bucktown, I thought it looked like a perfect breakfast place.  You really have to search for &#34;breakfast&#34; on their menu.I am sure that its great for a weekend brunch, but lack of an honest to god breakfast menu will keep me from coming back."

There&#39;s tons of bar seating so you don&#39;t feel odd going by yourself, and it&#39;s quick enough to get in and out easily. All that being said, it&#39;s probably not the best spot for a big group.The food itself was amazing. My boyfriend&#39;s chicken fried chicken was delicious, and easily something I would come back for. My red chili enchiladas were also really really good, especially with a fried egg on top. I was in the mood for a bloody and thought theirs was probably one of the best I&#39;ve had in the neighborhood. Not to mention, you get a Negro Modelo or Pacifico as a back!Lastly, dark matter coffee, on tap. Thank the coffee god!Dove&#39;s I&#39;ll be back for you, time and time again!"

The hostess was very nice and texted me when table is ready. While we wait, we walked around and had La Colombe coffee and Stans donut.This is a small cute diner with barstool. I would not recommend coming here in the winter for there is no room for your coat and purse. Unless you want to sit on your coat and leave it halfway hanging on the floor. I would not rcmd if you have more than 4 ppl, because space is tight and mostly communal sitting in the table counter. The regular menu will be provided and dont forget to look up against the wall. The specials and desserts are all listed there.Red chile enchilada - It&#39;s good, but typical for a good enchilada. Nothing special. The roasted chicken, which was a thigh and dark meat was bit dry. This entree is not spicy.Brisket Hash - Sounds good and plenty of positive review. In my opinion, the brisket was not tender enough. It&#39;s overrated and there&#39;s room for improvement.Blood sausage - Its tasty and not as pungent with the blood scent from previous blood sausage I&#39;ve had. This was very enjoyable."

Food was too salty. I ordered corn soup which was average. The pan fried noodles and hor-fun was SALTY as hell. Fried dumpling&#39;s skin was too thick and the sauce paired was weird.  Not the usual sauce. I don&#39;t think the local Asians actually come to this place.  This place is mostly for the gway los (non Asians).

Once we were there came the hard decision on where to eat and we hit the jack pot with Emperor&#39;s Choice. We arrived right when they were opening on Sunday and thank goodness we did because the place started to get packed! Since there was three of us we decide to order a bunch of things and split. Started off with Egg Rolls, Crab Rangoon and Pot Stickers. Honestly the best I&#39;ve had yet! All the main dishes came with white rice, all piping hot to table and delish!

Since we love Asian culture and foods, I can&#39;t believe it took us so long. After being in Chinatown in NYC, Philadelphia and San Francisco, Chicago&#39;s is much smaller. But they do have a wide variety of restaurants for all tastes.Originally, we chose another restaurant by looking at reviews on Yelp. But, we arrived a little early and while browsing through shops, I asked the clerk &#34;where the locals go.&#34; She said Emperor&#39;s Choice (right across the street from this shop) was the place to go.Emperor&#39;s Choice is not a large restaurant, and it was early when we arrived so there were seats available. Over the course of the couple of hours we were there, it filled up.We ordered a variety of items - soup, noodle, shrimp and beef dishes. The food was hot when served and it was excellent. For a Chinese restaurant recommended by a local person, I was surprised that the menu was a pretty traditional Americanized version of Chinese food. They had a few traditional offerings, but it was not what I expected it to be. However, as I said, what we ate was very good.I need to say something about their service. I unfortunately did not get the waitresses name but she was outstanding. She kept coming by our table to make sure everything was good, she kept the tea pot and water glasses filled at all times, and was very helpful navigating the menu. I really can&#39;t say enough about how much she made the experience all that much better."

Somewhat better than any of the other establishments on this street! We ordered egg drop soup and egg rolls to start.The egg rolls were fantastic and fresh. The house made sauce was also quite great! I did not have any of the soup but my mother really loved it.The portion sizes for our two entrees were HUGE. In fact I had lunch for two extra days at work.

The appetizers were absolutely amazing.My problem was I was apart of a large group dining here and there was an overpowering souring smell. It was like soured mop water that was a month old.

My boyfriend and I ordered the fried shrimp appetizer, veggie dumplings, sweet and sour chicken, and general tso chicken. The fried shrimp was soaked in complete oil. Although the batter tasted good it was only because of how much oil was left inside of it. I can literally taste the grease all around my lips after each bite. I was extremely disappointed with their veggie dumplings. They were completely dried out and just stuck to each other and on the cabbage. As I tried to take a piece, it kept on falling apart. Both of the chicken dishes were extremely disappointing. The chicken tasted completely dried out and had a taste as if it had been reheated. I&#39;m not sure if we came on a day where the chef was lazy but I would never return to this place. It was just a total fail and I wish I could have had a good food experience in China town but that wasn&#39;t the case. Either these reviewers don&#39;t know what good Chinese food is or we just came on a wrong day. I feel bad for giving this place one star because the service was good and our server was really nice so I had to add an extra star. As far as the food goes I would rate it one star.

I had the spicy eggplant which whenever I see eggplant I must order and it was well worth it. Every time I tried to stop to leave leftovers I couldn&#39;t the food was that good.

That&#39;s the only thing I ordered and it was one of the best things I&#39;ve ever eaten. Can&#39;t speak to anything else, though.Lightly breaded shrimp. Shrimp that are big, juicy, and firm pink flesh. Mixed in with an assortment of sliced peppers. Not served in a fishy tasting broth. Just tasted like really fresh ingredients. Loved it. I am always SO disappointed by shrimp at Chinese restaurants; usually they are small, few, and slightly discolored.But these... make up for every nasty shrimp I&#39;ve ever eaten. Real talk. I called my boyfriend after I ate it and raved about them for like 20 minutes to the point where he was just like... shut up. BUT I KNOW HE WOULD LOVE THEM, TOO! AND SO WILL YOU!"

However, due the beautiful interior and consistent attention-to-detail, I&#39;m bumping them to 4. Unlike most of their counterparts in Chinatown, Emperor&#39;s Choice keeps their establishment meticulously clean and their wares up to date. This is by far the most aesthetically pleasing of the restaurants I&#39;ve been to in Chinatown, except maybe Kai, but much cleaner. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve recently updated their decor, as this was my first time dining here, but they did a great job. Tables are pristine, bathrooms spic and span, and the bar when you walk in didn&#39;t have a crumb on it. Definitely a welcoming place!Food was good! We tried the hot and sour soup, which was among the best I&#39;ve ever had. For entrees, we ate the Hunan Beef, which features some of the freshest veggies I&#39;ve ever tasted. The fresh bamboo was my favorite, as I had only had this in chute form, previously. Beef was extremely lean, which is always great. The seafood dish was not as good, but still tasty. It had shrimp, squid, scallops, jalapeno peppers, and snow peas. Scallops are my favorite, and I wish there were more than three or four of them in the dish. Server was routinely checking up on us, but not in an overbearing, creepy way like some servers in Chinatown.While this isn&#39;t my favorite in Chinatown, I&#39;ll add it to my list of options every time I go back. Disclaimer: I go back quite often and refuse to eat Chinese in Chicago outside of Chinatown."

It concerned me when we walked in and realized a lack of Asian people at this restaurant. I perceived that as a lack of authenticity. But we decided to try it out regardless.We ordered the soft shelled crab, sizzling black peppered beef, and garlic stir fried snowpea leaves. They turned out to be pretty good, didn&#39;t give me the cheap asian takeout food feeling. The dining environment was good for chinese restaurant (I guess this is an important aspect to attract non-asian customers). Clean floor, white table cloth, clean and non smelly bathroom."

Here&#39;s why -Crab Rangoon - The best I&#39;ve had in Chicago so far. For starter, you get 6 pieces, which totally beats the 4 that you&#39;d get at some other places for the same price. They&#39;re actually crispy and not soggy (mind you, I ordered them to take out and had a 30 min trip back to my place). There&#39;s also this garlic-y taste to them that I thought was great.Emperor&#39;s Egg Rolls - This was also fried perfectly. I&#39;m not completely sure what is inside them. I&#39;m guessing it was something along the lines of cabbage, a little sliced scallion, some tiny shrimp, and maybe a few other basic ingredients.Bar-B-que Pork - I know people have been saying this place is highly Americanized, and I&#39;m not going to argue over that, but these pieces of sliced bbq pork were made just like how I&#39;d get them at legit Chinese food places in NY. The slices have just the right amount of meat and fat and they&#39;re not dry at all!The only thing that annoyed me was that they didn&#39;t give me any type of duck sauce or anything along those lines for the egg roll or crab rangoon, but I guess I&#39;d also have to blame myself for not asking. Besides that, this place was great and I look forward to going back and trying their other dishes."

I ended up here at this restaurant because it was closest to me at that point in time.I got the orange peel chicken, kung po chicken, and black pepper beef. I absolutely love the orange peel chicken. It&#39;s not as sweet like how most restaurants make it. You can really taste the orange when eating this dish. The kung po chicken and black pepper beef are also very good.

Had no problem paying $10 or more as long as the food was good quality and I got it here. My friends had the eggrolls and I tried pot stickers and was not disappointed. All appetizers come with three different sauces and I must say, the hot mustard sauce was spicy and tasty. I got the show mien noodles with shrimp and again I wasn&#39;t disappointed and my friends got poultry and rice and were impressed.I enjoyed the ambiance of this restaurant. White table cloths and Asian music in the background made me feel like I was at a more classy restaurant. The service also deserved high praise.

I&#39;d say Busy Burger is five times better than similar places like Epic Burger, while being 1/4th of the cost. My two patty burger with cheese and all other toppings was less than $8, and filled me to the brim.I&#39;m also impressed with customer service -- tonight a girl working called me to confirm some details about my order that other places would&#39;ve just guessed/ignored.

You get 15% off if you&#39;re a student and the first time I came here, the cashier saw me with my backpack and I had a college hoodie on but he didn&#39;t bring up the 15% off. Later as I was walking around, I saw the sign and told him &#34;I didn&#39;t know I get 15% off&#34; and he said &#34;O sorry man, next time for sure&#34;. I read some other reviews on here where the cashier fails to ask follow up questions like these... someone should train them too.They have plenty of seating inside and outside.

Needless to say, they&#39;re a pretty damn good neighborhood spot. The shakes are made fresh on site, the spotted cow is a personal favorite.In terms of food menu items you can&#39;t go wrong with the classic busy burger. The spicy busy sauce is amazing, it&#39;s basically a chipotle mayo, the spiciness is perfect on their butter toasted buns.I&#39;m also a huge fan of the chicken blt. It&#39;s a pretty standard chicken sandwich with bacon, lettuce, tomato + the busy sauce; I generally add avocado to mine, it&#39;s the perfect addition.The only disappointing item I&#39;ve tried has to be the fries. Since they don&#39;t come standard with the burger, it&#39;s an extra cost that I just don&#39;t feel are worth spending the money on. They&#39;re average fries, nothing too spectacular. If you do go with an order don&#39;t waste your money on adding cheese, they taste better dipped into a side of the busy sauce."
busy-burger-chicago,Peter T.,VP5wjC-QIeKvUv6_E-laBA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,92,8,NkYHQ9O_IZohSHzyfFTSkg,4.0,2016-04-05,"Americans have been in love with burgers arguably since the first fast food chain (White Castle) launched in the 1920s, but the current infatuation is thought to have come to the forefront around 2011.There are several theories as to why the burger business amped up at that point in time, but many feel it was the result of a tough time in the economy - people wanted their beef quotient but at the time, couldn&#39;t justify buying steak.But 20 years earlier, Joseph DeVito imagined his own burger paradise, and at the age of 18, started Busy Burger near the University of Chicago campus. His concept was simple: produce a quality product, cooked to order, at a great value, and the business will prosper. He was right, of course.Since DeVito launched Busy,  a plethora of &#34;gourmet&#34; burger chains have popped up around the U.S. Many of them have no more to offer than any other chain, other than slick marketing or gimmicks (&#34;our beef comes from cows who are only fed M&amp;Ms by the light of the full moon!&#34;). Some chains are amazingly silly (&#34;we&#39;re gonna charge twice as much for a product half the weight and you&#39;ll love us&#34;).In 2015 DeVito thought Busy could use an update, so he remodeled, got a new logo, added a few new items to the menu to satisfy the changing tastes of consumers, and developed a state of the industry customer service program for the employees.I set out to check out Busy Burger.. I ordered, and the food was quickly prepared and delivered. And I&#39;m looking at it, and a thought comes to mind.There are a lot of burger eaters in the US that feel that the West Coast chain &#34;In N Out&#34; sets the standard for quality burgers. I&#39;ve personally never felt that way, and after the first bite of my Busy Burger (beef, lettuce, tomato, red onion, spicy busy sauce, American cheese on a butter toasted bun), I thought, &#34;Holy moly, this is what In N Out would be like if their burgers were actually GOOD!&#34;Cause you see, for me, if a burger patty can&#39;t stand on its own, what&#39;s the point? And at Busy Burger  it does. Fresh natural ground beef, nicely seasoned, hand formed patty, grilled and not fried, the Busy beef patty is a thing of beauty. Topped with amazingly fresh chopped vegetables, it becomes a work of art.  I like to take a couple bites of the entire sandwich, then make my way through the individual ingredients. The spicy sauce is unique and flavorful, not the same old thing, and I loved the pickle chips which are reminiscent of a traditional half sour dill. (Half sours are tangy,  crispy and with lower salt than traditional hamburger dills).I loved the Busy Burger. I opted for a side of rings, which were great, nice breading, not greasy, substantial whole onion inside, and at the table we also had a fully loaded Chicago style hot dog (yellow mustard, chopped white onions, bright green sweet pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, tomato slices or wedges, pickled sport peppers and a dash of celery salt), fresh cut fries, and a vanilla shake.The dog matched or surpasses anybody&#39;s in the city, and the fresh cut fries are over the top delicious, hot, crispy, slightly seasoned. One of Chicago&#39;s television stations took a peek behind the scenes at Busy and learned some of the secrets to making their excellent patties.Busy Burger is located at 1120 West Taylor Street in Chicago, easily accessible from downtown and major freeways (see map below). Trust me, it&#39;s worth a stop."

Im one that is pretty picky when it comes to my turkey burgers and Busy&#39;s legit you cant even tell the difference! a burger fry and drink will run you a good $10 and some change which I dont think is bad for a fresh meat burger vs a patty.keep up the good work Busy Burger!"

First time trying a Busy Burger tonight, just went for the Busy Burger single patty with everything and Cheddar Cheese. I was pleasantly surprised- it was really nice and flavorful! Good large bun, which tasted pretty fresh. The Spicy Busy Sauce was great, and had a little heat to make for an interesting flavor to go on the char broiled meat.I ordered for pickup on the phone and it was ready by the time I walked in the door. My friend who has tried the Turkey Burger (wrapped in lettuce for a bun as she requested) liked hers too, and she&#39;s not so much a burger person, so that&#39;s saying something. All in all, the best burger place on that stretch of Taylor St. I&#39;ve found so far.A bartender that works at another local restaurant mentioned he knows the owner and they are open on holidays, when they always seem to do decent business then as well.Great service, lots of smiles, clean environment, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back some time.Enjoy-Cheers!"

But I figure if you have a Portobello mushroom burger, a turkey burger, and a chicken BLT sandwich on your menu, then clearly its fair game for reviewers.Busy Burger is right down the block from where I stay, and it&#39;s a quick grab-and-go place for my boyfriend and me when we&#39;re too lazy to cook something, or when it&#39;s late and BB is the only feasible place to go to. Since we&#39;re not students anymore and can&#39;t use the student discount, $8 for a burger/sandwich (including taxes, and not including fries) is a little pricey.This place is usually pretty full no matter when you stop by, and during the summer the outside seating area is a great option. Service is quick, and the only problem is that as far I know, they don&#39;t have paper menus, so it can get a little crowded up front where everyone is trying to read the giant wall menu to decide what to get.All of the burger/sandwich accoutrements - grilled red onions, caramelized onions, pickles and of course, the game-changing busy sauce are noteworthy, but all the three patties I had (Portobello, turkey and chicken) were underwhelming - a little too dry and compact and not seasoned very well. The butter-toasted bun is really quite good, and doesn&#39;t get soggy too soon.I usually get the chicken BLT, but because I don&#39;t eat bacon, I sub in pickles and grilled onions instead, so it&#39;s really a chicken burger. I&#39;ve tried the fries once, and never again. They&#39;re not seasoned enough, a little limp and not worth the excess fat. I subbed in a lettuce wrap instead of the bread, and they didn&#39;t really wrap it around the patty, just placed the patty and the onions etc, so that everything kept falling out. I&#39;m not sure if it was a mistake, or if that&#39;s how they make the lettuce wrap, so I&#39;ll try it out again and update this review!Extra star for their milkshakes. They&#39;re freshly made, and SO GOOD! The spotted cow with huge chunks of crushed oreos is my personal favorite.All in all, a dependable place to fulfill your late night fast food cravings, if you&#39;re willing to shell a little extra cash. And when the cashier asks if you &#34;want fries with that?&#34;, ALWAYS say no!"

It is moist, flavorful, and perfectly seasoned; their turkey burger definitely needs some recognition.

It has a little punch to it and compliments the meat and bun really well. They have indoor seating as well as outdoor seating. The menu has options to satisfy different palates/diets.For a local burger place next to a university, they are kind of expensive. They do offer a discount for students, but it is still kind of on the upper side for a burger. I didn&#39;t even get fries.

Ordered a DCB and he didn&#39;t ask me if I wanted cheese or if I wanted raw or grilled onions!? I ended up with a burger with no cheese &amp; raw onions.. Come on its your job to ask those specifics/ never in my life have I had a burger without cheese! The burger was good but I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about how good it could have been the other way, -1 star. Prices are def above average and the grub comes out pretty quick! Finish it off with an Italian Ice from Mario&#39;s- Get Dat Did"

I had never heard of Busy Burger before, and we stopped by on a whim to get a mini burger and onion rings to tide us over for the afternoon. I&#39;m pleased to report that the burger was fantastic! Delicious, hot, grilled to perfection, with fantastic grilled onions with the right amount of carmelization on them. And the bun was great too--on the spectrum of breads, it was somewhere near the &#34;pretzel roll&#34; end of things, and it was a fantastic complement to the burger contents. The onion rings were also fantastic too--served piping hot with a delicious coating that was not too heavy.All this was served up in a cute, shiny, clean location right near the University. Stop on by, you won&#39;t be disappointed."

Regular burger with fries &amp; a soda for 2 people came to about $25, not the cheapest option you could find, and I&#39;ve had better for less. Food was decent but the burger was lacking the real flame-grilled taste. Ordering was difficult as the only menu in the place is the one large-printed on the wall two feet from the register, so everyone is bottlenecked into the narrow front of store while deciding and ordering. Quick service, staff was ok, but wouldn&#39;t come back."

Even the driver didn&#39;t want me to tip him, because he feels bad for me.

Yummi.  I ordered fries but was so engrossed with the burger, I didn&#39;t eat many.  My coworker got the chili fries and said they were amazing (but remember, she&#39;s preggers).  Anyway, the burger was hot and so juicy.  They put &#34;busy sauce&#34; on the burgers which is essentially chipotle mayo...OMG.  It is a little pricey  ($14 for a combo) especially someone who rarely orders burgers, but well worth it."

The meaty cheese burger is super-yum too.My tastebuds and wallet are def big fans.  I am surprised this place doesn&#39;t have higher Yelp marks b/c I am def coming back--- often.First let&#39;s talk meat since that&#39;s what most of you will probably get. This is not the place for some 1/2 lb thick burger, if that&#39;s what you are into. These patties are thinner but in a great way--- SO FLAVORFUL.  They really pick up that great charbroil flavor big-time. Get it w/ cheese. Trust me. I&#39;m lactose intolerant and the rule is: ALWAYS GET CHEESE if offered cheese. (There&#39;s pills for those kind of problems.) The toppings/dressings are the usual L,T,O but.....so fresh and, oooooh! the pickle &amp; spicy mayo... icing on your fatty burger cake. We are talking FRESH PICKLE CHIPS! Not that weird &#39;70&#39;s puke-green-colored-piece-of-salty-rubber; this is the good clean, crunchy pickle you can actually tell once was a cucumber.Ok, so after your first time getting meat-y (b/c we all know you are hesitant to go meatless at a burger joint), when you go back, get the PORTABELLA BURGER W/ CHEESE. Sooooooooo goooood. Even better than the meaty one! I promise. All of the flavors blend so well and you can taste how fresh all the ingredients are--- and that little Diet Fairy sitting on your shoulder, doesn&#39;t clunk you in the head this time....Except maybe if you order fries.... which you most definitely should! Totally worth the calories and repercussions of dieting guilt.  Besides, you can be a big girl/boy and SHARE FRIES. There are a zillion of them in one order. Seriously. They are crispy, seasoned and perfect. Especially the smaller crunchy pieces. Those are my fav.All of this, for about $7. Such a deal! I heard they have hotdogs too but I&#39;m stuck on my mushroom burger. Eat outside if it&#39;s a nice day. Makes the experience even better. Enjoy."

They taste like a grill and are delicious. But my favorite thing ever there is the busy dippin rings. Onion rings and spicy mayo.

I had seen it previously while walking around Taylor St, so I decided to give it a shot.First thing wrong with the place...it was HOT and MUGGY in there. Okay, so it&#39;s summertime and you&#39;re in a room with large flames, but seriously? It was still 65 degrees outside. After I ordered I had to stand by the door and outside to keep from sweating. I was willing to overlook this, especially if the food was good.Second thing...they obviously spent a lot of time decorating the outside of their building, but the inside was your generic old cheap burger place that you would see anywhere else on a street corner with the yellow Vienna sausage sign. Again, willing to overlook if the food was good.Finally, when I ordered, I ordered the special of the day, a 1/2 slab of meat. I figured I&#39;d give it a shot since it was my first time there.BIG MISTAKE.I went home, settled down and ate my sandwich while my out of town friends arrived. Within three hours, I had major stomach cramps, headache,  fatigue and nausea. A half hour more, I was lying in the bathroom with my head in a toilet.Luckily, my friends were sympathetic and didn&#39;t mind that their host was spending most of the night in the bathroom emptying her stomach. One of them, who happens to be a doctor, offered to prescribe some antibiotics since it was becoming apparent that I had food poisoning.All through the night, I started alternating between being too hot and too cold and in addition to chills and muscle aches. I drank some chicken broth to sooth the stomach (which came up within a couple of hours). I could only stay asleep for 1-2 hours at a time.This morning, I felt much better but had to decline going out with my friends (who I haven&#39;t seen in months) due to the sensitivity of my head to light, fatigue, muscle aches and the unpredictable nature of my stomach.WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.

The total for our order of two double busy burgers, one busy burger and two sides of fries were a total of ~$15.I had to wait for my friends to finish working out so by the time we actually consumed the burgers, the food was sitting out for a total of over an hour.The fries.....still super crispy after sitting in the bag for over an hour! Usually fries turn soggy and just does not taste the same.. But not busy burger fries!I&#39;d like to add that I was looking through the photos posted by my fellow yelpers, and the type of fries that was delivered to us was different than the ones in the photos.The burger....I can only speak for the bush burger but I&#39;d like to say that it&#39;s the same thing as double burger but the double has ...obviously, one more patty. Burgers were good. Almost had similar toppings as burger king -the standard tomatoes, onions, pickles and lettuce. We also requested for the spicy mayo but it&#39;s not as spicy as I anticipated it to be.Spicy mayo that wasn&#39;t so spicy was the only downfall of this order.I have a feeling we found our new burger joint!!"

I&#39;ve tried everything on the menu and never had a complaint. Both hot and the mild sauce complement the tacos pretty well.What makes this place almost a 4 star is they keep things simple without compromising on the essentials.One would say there&#39;s nothing special about these tacos and I&#39;d say maybe you&#39;re right but sometimes simple is what we need and they do it the right way."

I actually saw people walk in, see the menu and walk right back out. And of course the restaurant, which was once regularly busy, was empty. On a weeknight before a Cubs game.I hope the management checks their greed and lowers the prices, because this place is going out of business if they don&#39;t.The food is the same and still good quality but not worth what they&#39;re charging now. If you have cash you can get Mexican food that&#39;s just as good a couple blocks away for a lot less. Had they just charged an extra buck for extra ingredients like other restaurants, or 50c more for steak, and left the other prices where they are, it would have served whatever purpose they thought raising prices would serve, far more effectively than this blanket increase that just punishes everyone.I will add that sometimes they switch out the red salsa for this awful red sauce that smells like a combination of cat piss and motor fluid."

It&#39;s similar to Chitpotle in concept (pick your poison, then your meat, then toppings) while they assemble everything for you. However, it&#39;s a little cheaper and you can get tacos individually if you don&#39;t feel like a trio.Chicken and Steak are my go tos for protein when it comes to this burrito alternative. I had mine with what they call &#34;everything&#34; - cilantro, onions and cheese. Cilantro overload! They pack slightly too much cilantro on in my opinion and it overpowers the tacos a bit. Other topping options include sour cream, lettuce, tomato, avocado, rice and beans.

Their al pastor I wouldn&#39;t describe as the same al pastor you can get off the street in Mexico City, but it certainly was an upgrade from hitting a Chipotle. Now for reals I think you guys need to change the Mexican Water to be called Horchata... That threw me off and had I known at the time that Mexican Water was indeed Horchata I would&#39;ve grabbed a Large and some while I was there.Definitely worth a stop though! &#39;Til next time, cheers!"

I am happy that I finally took her up on the offer to check out this restaurant because after visiting her I became an instant fan. The decor of Salsita can best be described as a trendy family Mexican restaurant. I love the bright colors because it makes the restaurant stand out.The few staff that my friend and I encountered were extremely friendly. They normally hand you all of your sauces and water cup when you purchase your food at the cash register but because it was a slower night they brought everything to our table.The restaurant isn&#39;t too large so I wouldn&#39;t recommend coming with a large group of friends. This is the perfect place for a party of at max 3 because the sitting area is not too large.The food itself didn&#39;t stand out too much to me because it&#39;s hard to make cheap basic Mexican food something to rave about. I would stay that based off the prices and the quantity of food they give you I can see why everything loves this place. This is definitely my new go to Mexican restaurant!

Tortas and tacos.. we opted for the spicy chicken, with the salsa, still bland. The visual looks great, the ingredients were all there, the seasoning is where it fell short. i had the rice and beans which were good, but cant really make a dinner out of a side. The Torta bread was very soft which is different for a torta.. bit of a let down but i guess if you dont like it spicy you may prefer this place."

Though it appears to be just a hole in the wall restaurant, it definitely did not disappoint.Tacos are at a great price and come with great topping options without adding to the price. They even will add avocado at no extra charge. Note that you do need a $10 minimum in order to charge credit.I ordered steak tacos with cilantro, onion, tomato, cheese, avocado, and sour cream. I also ordered chips and green salsa, which wasn&#39;t the greatest. I will definitely be coming back next time I am in Wrigleyville."

The guac was $5 but you got a ton of it in this little tortilla bowl with a bag of chips. The taco was flavorful, meat wasnt dry, and service was quick.

I made it a meal by adding a pretty large portion of beans and horchata. This meal after tax only cost me $12! The food came out within 5 minutes and the lady there was extremely polite!

I&#39;ve seriously been here at least 15 times in the last month and a half. The steak tacos and tostadas are simply delicious and you can make it &#34; grande&#34; which essentially means that you would like to add all the veggie toppings including fresh avocado slices for free. There aren&#39;t any other Mexican places nearby that can compare in terms of how tasty the food is and price, and comparing this place to chipotle is offensive because this is truly legit Mexican food which chipotle can&#39;t come close. Give this place a try it&#39;s so good! I&#39;m moving out of state in just a few days and am sad that I just found this place not that long ago as its already one of my favorite places when I crave good Mexican food.My one minor complaint is that there is a $10 minimum when you use credit/debit.

My one gripe is, that if it&#39;s that spicy, and I am by no means intolerant to spice, you should put some sort of indication near the item and suggest people ask for modifications if necessary.

The girl that is there most often is amazing and personable. The fact that they even have vegan options is over-the-top incredible. My main and only issue? The fact that the last 4 times I walked in and ordered food there, the order was messed up completely and not vegan at all. By the time I returned home, there was no way I was going to walk all the way back. Today was the last day. I&#39;ll never go back again unfortunately. But I&#39;m sure all the non-vegans would totally enjoy the food there."

There is a menu board, some chairs along a wall bar and a counter. The music is loud and there are no decorations. It&#39;s no frills.They did have Seitan for the vegetarians which I thought was thoughtful. The tortilla for my was flour - it was brown, so maybe whole wheat? You are given a choice of spicy meat or regular, another nice touch. My taco, rice and beans was pretty good.As I sat and ate my food I watched what appeared to be the owner or manager unload his white Mercedes parked in the bike lane for about 5-10 minutes. I found this strange especially since a space marked &#34;loading zone&#34; was totally free only about 3 spaces back. Luckily no bikes came by but none the less it was very rude and inconsiderate to bikers. Considering Kozy cycler is two doors down there has to be a ton of bike traffic in the area. I was actually on my way to retrieve my bike from Kozy."

The menu is pretty simple &amp; straightforward - but what they do, they do very very well. The woman working at the counter was incredibly sweet and friendly. She made sure we had plenty of napkins and salsa and served us quickly.We got the chips and guac to share to start. It came with a huge bag of chips (plenty for 2 people, maybe more) and a taco shell bowl filled with a huge portion of guacamole. I&#39;ve never seen such a huge portion for the price! For my main meal, I got the chicken quesadilla with lettuce, tomato, and avocado. It was amazing - so fresh and not greasy at all. I also tried the pineapple habanero salsa with my meal - VERY spicy but so delicious.I enjoyed the friendly, welcoming atmosphere of this place and of course, the delicious food.

Their food is DELICIOUS and even though I don&#39;t like spicy food I always get their spicy chicken and sauces because trust me it is so delicious that you will want more.Their prices are reasonably cheap and you get very good food, every member of the staff has always been so helpful and they all are very friendly!

They already know the late night regulars and always have a smile for you.Now to the food...it&#39;s so good! Actually its really good...you expect a late night taco/burrito joint to be the same old rice and beans with a dingy atmosphere...not here. Tacos, Salads, Tortas, Burritos, Quesadillas, and probably the best fries I have had in a long time. You would think...well so what...how&#39;s that different... Except it&#39;s really delicious and prepared with love. They actually seem to care about your order!And its not just rice and beans...the meat options go from your basics of steak, chicken and pork to veggie, fish and Seitan! Yes Seitan...done 3 different ways! Praise! I am a meat free lover and this is genius! Plus the add on toppings are epic! Btw...the best guacamole I have had since moving to Chicago from Los Angeles!Late Night hours...Sunday through Wednesday 12-3 and Thursday through Saturday 12-?

They even have Daiya vegan cheese (it&#39;s not on the menu, you have to ask)!I ordered guacamole one night expecting a little cup and small bag of chips similar to what Chipotle gives, but the guac container was massive.

No. But if we&#39;re walking around and hungry I would stop here again.The food:-Slutty ravioli: the ravioli is stuffed with spicy sausage and cheese, and I didn&#39;t love the filling. However, that melty, gooey, slightly burnt cheese topping was amazing. I wish that was a separate app on its own.-Check into Yelp and get a free taco. The pork taco is shredded pork and I highly recommend it! The brisket taco is chunks of fatty meat and was not my favorite.-BBQ chicken pizza: good, not great. The BBQ sauce obviously makes or breaks the pizza, and it&#39;s just decent here. Also, they put marinara on it as well and I wish it was just BBQ.-Popeyes pizza: superb! They put whole garlic cloves on here which is a bit much to actually bite into (unless you&#39;re trying to get rid of vampires, I suppose), but pick them off and this pizza is DELISH!-Brisket sandwich: this was a complete miss since it&#39;s the same brisket from the taco app and the same BBQ sauce from the pizza, neither of which I cared for.

The Mac and cheese was basically noodles, no cheese, no sauce ... Dry. LITERALLY NO TASTE. (I ordered it before and it was super tasty, I was sad and confused) the ribs were good.. But they didn&#39;t send a side of BBQ like at the restaurant. Overall a crappy experience."

We lucked out and found a table right away. Their patio is quite large with a lot of seating. Definitely a good spot to relax and enjoy a meal or some of their $4 draft beers; however, a little background music would&#39;ve have been a great addition to an otherwise great dining experience.When it came to the drinks were pretty amped by not only the stellar price of their draft beer but by the wide and varied selection they offered. I was torn between two choices and our waitress offered to let me try each of them which I really appreciated.But if I thought choosing a beverage was hard it was ridiculously hard trying to order off of the Big Bricks menu. Just about everything on there looks mouthwateringly delicious and we kept getting whiffs of the smoky smells from their meat.We ended up deciding to share and going with a side order of the Burnt End Mac and Cheese, Goat Cheese Dip, and the Burnt Ends Sampler. To top it off we each went with a slider, Pulled Pork for me and Brisket for him. Each dish was more delicious than the last and I have to say we both agreed the macaroni and cheese was pretty much the best ever!I&#39;d highly recommend Big Bricks, their bar and dining area looked just as inviting as the patio and the food is spot on."

It has a very warm and inviting atmosphere, especially with their xmas decorations up this time of year. It also has a very casual, laid back vibe about it.I&#39;ve ordered both the pulled pork pizza and the pulled pork sandwich. Their house bbq sauce is really good, not too sweet, and I applied it liberally to both dishes. I definitely recommend getting tater tots to go with the sandwiches, because you can basically never go wrong with tater tots. I&#39;ve also had their mac n cheese as an appetizer and it did not disappoint. A full order is plenty to share among 2-3 people. They have a lot of great pizzas on their menu in addition to offering the full gamut of smoked meats.I&#39;ve really enjoyed both my visits to Big Bricks! Will definitely be coming back"

Of the four pizzas we tried, the BBQ chicken was the only one worth coming back for. As mentioned before, the BBQ meats themselves lack any flavor and aren&#39;t high enough quality meats to come back for.But, honestly, this probably would have gotten at least three stars if it hadn&#39;t been for the deplorable service. After calling three days in advance to warn that we had a very large party coming, they didn&#39;t have our reservation. Thankfully, they weren&#39;t busy. Throughout our meal, we had to flag our waitress (and occasionally someone else&#39;s waitress) down repeatedly do to basic things like order, beg for more water (and then beg again when she took away the pitchers and didn&#39;t bring more for over an hour), and then point out that they had forgotten TWO of our FOUR pizzas (both vegetarian-friendly options). It was a total disaster. I fully understand that large parties are hard to handle, but the response shouldn&#39;t be to run away from us."

I also am a big fan of their BBQ sauce (its thinner, tangy sweet and peppery), I even purchased a bottle for $5! I also sampled the ribs and pizza and both were delicious. The pizza is on the thinner side (but not too thin).My only con is that their cole slaw is super creamy (and I&#39;m a creamy girl) and not as vinegary as some bbq joints.

Overpriced beer and service that drops with a thud of &#34;we just don&#39;t care.&#34;Meanwhile, Mom and Dad bring the kids in, drink the beer and have no time to notice that the pizza is tiny, weak and--except for the sugar--tasteless.We came in on a cold night and they didn&#39;t even turn the heat on till we were half way through.

The not lean is about 1/8-1/4 fat. Unless you like eating the fat in which case dig in.The Mac and cheese had nothing burnt.  Would have like some toasted cheese or meat. The slaw has too much mayo.Kids meals are good.Great kid friendly place! Never seen our 2 1/2 year old eat so much. Pulled chicken was wonderful but I wish they had more dark beers on the menu.

So when I heard that Bricks had a second location with both of those things, my mind was blown and I knew I had to visit. Not sure what the crowd situation would be, I made a reservation for 4 at 8:00. When we arrived, the place was kind of crowded, but we could have definitely walked in without a reservation. The back patio area has a bunch of picnic tables and we opted to sit outside.Our waiter came over and was very helpful in guiding us through the menu. First, Big Bricks has a unique selection of draft beers which is awesome. Second, our goal was to try as much BBQ as possible, and we did just that. Starting with the nachos with brisket on top was a great move. The brisket is chopped in big pieces and incredibly flavorful. It really adds to the other delicious nachos components. This was also a huge serving. more than enough for the four of us. Deciding to add something remotely healthy into the mix, we ordered the beet salad, which was pretty standard and came with goat cheese and red onion. For pizza, we had to do BBQ chicken and it did not disappoint. As a semi-impulsive move, we also ordered some smoked chicken wings. We saw them going by to another table and, after staring longingly, could not resist. They were super tasty and delicious as well.Overall, I definitely recommend Big Bricks for a casual dinner. The back patio ambiance is great, our server was very attentive, and the food/beers were fantastic. Can&#39;t wait to head back and try more of that BBQ!"

The menu is more expansive; including many BBQ options in addition to their signature thin crust pizza.We ordered:BeerTwo of their pulled pork tacos (free w Yelp Check-in, thanks Yelp!)They were small but packed with dripping meat. I felt mine had too much cilantro.(they only have 1 kind of BBQ sauce on the table...most places have at least 2.)Half rack of Ribs (dry at the server&#39;s suggestion), baked beans (with pulled pork in), cole slaw (tiny bit), pickle spear, and comes w a slice of white bread (why? No one every eats it).He thought the ribs were ok. I kind of agree they have a bit of tug and nice bark but the texture wasn&#39;t great. They were large and meaty though. He thought the cole slaw was too mayo-y. The bean we both agreed were good. Large prices of pulled pork and couple tiny bits of onion made them a savory winner.I got the pulled pork sandwich on brioche bun, macaroni and cheese, the tiny cole slaw.Stop, collaborate, and listen! The Mac and cheese is one of the BEST I&#39;ve had in this city! Spiral noodles that&#39;s shape really hold the thick, rich cheese...so delicious! A must order. The pulled pork sandwich was good. Meaty and really didn&#39;t need the BBQ sauce as the meat was juicy and well seasoned. I could only eat half, my dining partner having had enough pulled pork w the taco and beans preferred to focus on the ribs. Odd thing was the bun top and both sides were very buttered and toasted. The bun was soft, but I guess they toast it to hold up to the drippy meat. Just big butter taste. I&#39;d order it again. I didn&#39;t bother w the cole slaw.The atmosphere was very nice. Well decorated, spacious cozy booths, music at a reasonable volume. It&#39;s family friendly and hosts parties.

The hostess said she could seat us in a back room. I indicated to her I would like to sit up front so the kids could watch hockey on the big screen. The hostess still went to check on a table in the back room anyway. Evidently they want kids to sit in the back.

We have sat in the front many times with my kid and never a problem.So we sit down at a table. Immediately another staff member comes to me to say we have a table in back.

Although, isn&#39;t that always the case Oddly, its their BBQ chicken pizza that really doesn&#39;t deliver well. Its always arrives dry as all get-out. So yeah I would definitely recommend going there! The delivery I&#39;m half and half on."

They have a solid burger and great brisket. The sides are fresh and satisfying (and contemporary). I admit I haven&#39;t explored the menu broadly, but that&#39;s only because the burger is hard to say no to. And they have great daily beer specials. The service is friendly, and everything comes plenty fast. It&#39;s never too packed but there&#39;s always a comfortable number of people there."

So the stars are for cleanliness.However the food is bland.  The side of slaw is more like a sample of slaw, literally 2 bites. But that was fine because it had no taste and I didn&#39;t want any more than that. I ordered a slab of baby back ribs since their claim to fame is supposed to be the BBQ.  It had no flavor. I drowned it in the BBQ sauce that was sitting on the table but it didn&#39;t help. I ate 2 bones and took the rest home for my son (teenagers aren&#39;t picky).  I also ordered a side of the Mac and Cheese that people were raving about here on Yelp. There was nothing special about it and it was over-priced for the quality. I figured it was gourmet-level Mac &amp; Cheese which is why I felt compelled to try it despite the price. It wasn&#39;t.The owner walked through greeting customers, which was nice. He asked me how everything was I said &#34;Fine.&#34;, I think out of politeness, and because was was he gonna do about everything being bland? Develop new recipes on the spot and replace my food?Props for having the cleanest restaurant (including the restrooms!) EVER :)I almost forgot...I had a Yelp offer (free taco for checking in). The taco was very good. It was tiny and cute, I suppose it was intended as an appetizer.  It was the only part of the meal I actually enjoyed.  If I were to go back, I would just have the tacos :)"

Obviously we wouldn&#39;t.Goat cheese appetizer drowned in tomato sauce (they offered to bring bread three times but we couldn&#39;t get thru half of it). The BBQ sauce has way too much vinegar in it. The coleslaw has way too much mayo in it. The corn bread is actually bread with corn in it. The pulled pork was undercooked on one side, but then BURNT END is a &#39;thing&#39; here, so i&#39;ve no doubt they took a meat temp on the burnt end. Even the chardonnay, made for them, has an awful aftertaste.So what to do? When you are having an absolutely terrible dining experience the least is let someone know, right?The manager stated himself that he&#39;s had critiques on these points before and that even 50% of the people don&#39;t like it, but it must just be our opinion. That&#39;s a pretty high percentage to ignore customers opinions on. So he compt us and we left....but I guess when he said: &#34;We wouldn&#39;t charge you for a meal you didn&#39;t enjoy&#34; that meant let me chase you down the street for the drinks, which we didn&#39;t finish either.When we stated we&#39;d pay for the drinks he only told us &#34;DON&#39;T COME BACK&#34;.No fear of that.So many better places for everything they do only 50% as well."

I wanted to go with 4 but there were just a couple things that could have been a bit better.First of all, I like the feel of this place. It&#39;s almost a divey type atmosphere that looks like a 1930&#39;s speakeasy. I was ready for Al Capone himself to come barging through the door demanding a cocktail at gunpoint. I&#39;m also clicking on &#34;very helpful&#34; to the picture someone took of that amazing maroon and gold patterned wall paper they got going on in the main bar area. Classic points for interior design!!Now for the food. We started off with the pulled pork nachos. The pulled pork was definitely EXCELLENT and high quality. However, the rest of the ingredients...not so much. For the quality of that pork, they should use some Merkts cheese and some higher end ingredients to compliment. Instead, I noticed the Whiz of cheese was used, along with what I thought was NOT a homemade quac and jalapenos that you&#39;d find in your nachos at a ball game. For a $10.97 app (why does every price here end in $.97?)  I just wanted a little bit more. That $.97 thing definitely irks me as well!The &#34;Slutty Ravioli&#34; was also ordered based on the positive reviews. However, this was the most disappointing item we ordered. It was a cheesy mess on an app plate with 4 ravioli&#39;s hidden underneath and about 4 tiny little slices of bread that weren&#39;t even toasted. Meeh, I could make that at home no prob.The pizza though was VERY good. LOVED the cracker crust that was crispy and a little chared/burned at the bottom. We ordered the Painful w/ jalapenos, purple onion, spicy pepperoni &amp; garlic. It packed a punch and I&#39;m glad I had my Mirror Pond Pale Ale right by my side to wash it down!!!I would come back if someone else suggested this place. It&#39;s tough though b/c I don&#39;t live in the city anymore, so any chance I can get to try new places and review I will!! It&#39;s only the special places that I make the extra effort to come back, and Big Bricks has a great location but the competition for restaurants is fierce on Lincoln Ave!"

I mean...burnt ends...mac &amp; cheese. You just can&#39;t go wrong. So off I went and enjoyed me some burnt ends mac &amp; cheese and a pulled pork sandwich. It was not my healthiest lunch by any means but everything was delicious. My date enjoyed the brisket sandwich and I got to try some of the tender tasty meat (heyo!). The tots and french fries that came with the sandwiches were also tasty and the service was great! It was really quiet for lunch on a Sunday so it&#39;s a nice place for families if you&#39;re looking for something that&#39;s not too crowded!

I didn&#39;t think they existed!). Anyway, he had went to Big Bricks and had a horrible experience with the bartender; he vowed never to go back. Which is interesting, since it was after one visit.Maybe I didn&#39;t get the exact details of what happened that night; this is the reason why I was willing to give this place a chance. The bonus is that this place is a stone&#39;s throw away from my house. I needed a quick dinner fix on a Friday night for dinner, so I decided to go.I settled on the Burnt ends sandwich, with fries and tater tots on the side. The sandwich itself was slightly on the dry side, and the fries were way on the opposite end of the crispy side (If I had to describe it on a certain level, I&#39;d say they were one step higher than being completely soggy.) The one saving grace about that meal were the tater tots. Thank goodness, because I am a sucker for a good tater tot.The service was quick and the hostess that took my order were pleasant. The place wasn&#39;t terribly busy when I ordered.With a name like &#34;Big Bricks&#34;, my friend and I had a debate as to whether this place was a pizzeria that served BBQ or a BBQ place that served pizza. I thought that with a name like that, it referred to the big brick pizza oven. And with places that serve similar food down the street, is this how they&#39;re aiming to differentiate themselves?I&#39;m willing to try the pizza when I come back, just because I&#39;m a bit curious. and maybe I&#39;ll be impressed a bit more."

Immediately, I feared what was coming. We took a table on the enormous patio. Service was excellent. Since we were catching up with friends, the server had to come to the table about six times before we were actually ready to order and she never seemed annoyed or inconvenienced. She let us know about the drink and entree specials for the evening. Everything sounded good, but I had heard all about the brisket so there was no way I was leaving without trying the brisket.There you have it, I ordered the brisket sandwich. It came on a nice brioche bun unsauced, side of well done hand-cut fries, and a small cole slaw portion. I really enjoyed the fact that I could taste the meat before deciding how much sauce I wanted to add. It was smoky, trim, slightly dry but nothing that a dip in the au ju or homemade bbq sauce couldn&#39;t fix. It was definitely worth the trip. My friend had the pizza and while he wasn&#39;t sharing, it smelled great. Two people at the table had the side of kale and we were all blown away by how scrumptious the veggie side was - almost justifiable to swap the fries for the greens.By the time we left at 8:30 every table on the patio was filled. The overhead lights were on and I was full and satisfied. Thanks Big Bricks for proving my initial fears wrong."

Of course she didn&#39;t realize it until we got the check, but she doesn&#39;t eat a lot of meat and tries hard to stay away from pork. Yikes! She still enjoyed her meal, but was a little sad she didn&#39;t have the chicken.  Their beer selection was nice.

Chicken, pepperoni, bacon and sausage what do you need else when you are a pure non-vegetarian. And the pizza was really delicious no doubt. One of my vegetarian friends ordered cheese pizza for himself and it was also tasty according to him.Plus: They have all kinds of popular beers: Millar, Coors, Budlight, Sam Adams, Stella Artois and you name it.

We almost had an issue getting spinach swapped for the mushroom. A manager needed to be involved. Seriously? I had also gotten skipped online prior to even ordering. I wasn&#39;t a happy camper.We got seated within minutes of ordering so didn&#39;t even time to order anything at the bar. The craft beer list was pretty limited, especially in comparison to Geno&#39;s East.We split a small house salad to hold us over during the wait. We asked for cheese on the side. The salad came out with cheese on it, and on the side. D&#39;oh.So the pizza finally came out and it was placed on the sort of unstable elevated holder, not a pan or dish. It wasn&#39;t really warm.The crust was really rich and buttery at first but then got kind of hard, almost like it had been frozen. It hardened if you didn&#39;t eat it too quickly. It seemed more like a stuffed crust versus a deep dish.The place was definitely family friendly. There was crying and screeching galore.Our server only popped by sporadically.It wasn&#39;t a bad visit but it just wasn&#39;t that great. I&#39;d pass and not recommend this pizza joint."

And just like a lot of &#34;firsts&#34;, there are high expectations which end up in disappointment.This was definitely one of them.I ordered take out as I was walking through the downtown core of Chicago on a beautiful night. My legs were tired and I was starving. The reviews for this place were good. So I went in to put in my order.Got a personal deep dish pizza and a small Cesar salad.The cashier said it would be 35min for the pizza to bake. That was a long commitment since I was already starving, but hey... It&#39;s my first time and it&#39;ll just taste THAT much better right?AFTER 55min, I confirmed it with the cashier as they time stamped my receipt.. My pizza was ready. The cashier apologized for the lengthy time it took for this tiny pizza to bake. Forgiven. I just need to eat and get an Über back to my unit.My Über was also 20min delayed (I could have walked back in 30min) so that didn&#39;t help.Finally made it back to my unit and noticed that the small Cesar salad I ordered was not in the bag. Effff!! So i called back the restaurant to see if they could at the least deliver the salad (it&#39;s a 30min walk, but a 5min drive).The cashier at the take out counter.. Same guy who took and gave me my order (and forgot the salad) said they couldn&#39;t deliver it that far, but they can credit me the salad so next time I come in, I can provide my phone number and they will give me my small Cesar salad.Verdict. My cold greasy deep dish pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza was fair. Then Cesar salad will remain a figment of my imagination. The service was expected if I were in a hocker market in Indonesia or something... but I was not.Service 1/10Pizza 4/10"

We were greeted and sat right away. We put in our order as soon as we sat as it takes about 45 minutes for the deep dish to bake. The meats and more meats was just scrumptious! The crust was thick enough to hold all that lusciousness, but not too thick where thats all you can taste. All of the meats were so flavorful and that cheese was heaven!

Gordon&#39;s delicious crust and wonderful toppings creates a delicious pizza you have to eat with a fork. Now I know people from New York City have a hard time accepting a pizza you have to eat with a fork but I have a hard time accepting a slice of pizza that is folded in half to eat. I seem to get fuller taste eating a deep dish pizza than I do eating thin crust pizza. Also, because you get fuller faster, you eat less, which is good for my diet!

The two places that other people had been recommending that I go to try this specialty were Lou Malnati&#39;s and Giordano&#39;s.I had intended to visit Lou Malnati&#39;s instead of Giordano&#39;s. But having spent a long time waiting in lines at Skydeck and feeling beat, I decided to go to Giordano&#39;s as I happened to walk by their location on Jackson which is just down the street from Skydeck.The restaurant has three seating areas. I decided to take a seat at the bar which is on the far right hand side of the restaurant. Note that you need to enter from a different entrance further down as the entrance in front of the bar doesn&#39;t seem to open from the street.While I wanted a deep dish pizza, I didn&#39;t want to buy a whole pizza as that would be too much food. I wanted a personal size pizza, but after looking through the menu I learned that they only offer personal size deep dish pizzas on weekdays. So if I wanted deep dish, I had to buy a whole pie or go elsewhere.Not wanting to have to find a different deep dish restaurant, I stayed. The pizzas come in different sizes with small being the closest option to what I was looking for. Still, a small pizza has 6 slices. You can choose your own ingredients or pick a specialty pizza. Ended up settling on getting the Chicago Classic stuffed deep dish pizza ($22.75).Another reason I didn&#39;t want to leave was because deep dish pizzas take a long time to cook. The wait for the pizza was about 45 minutes so I had nothing to do but watch a NBA playoff game while I waited.After the pizza arrived, the bartender served up the first slice on my plate. The Chicago Classic comes with pepperoni, mushroom, onions and green peppers. Giordano&#39;s deep dish is known for having a lot of cheese and it certainly lived up to its reputation. I wasn&#39;t in much of a mood to eat so much cheese in one seating, so I really felt that the cheese in the deep dish was overkill. As for the crust, I didn&#39;t like it very much on first bite. It had more of a cracker like crust rather than a buttery crisp crust that I prefer.I knew that there was no way I was going to finish the whole pizza, so having eaten three slices seemed like a feat. My main concern about having to order a whole pizza was food safety. I was going to be carrying the deep dish in a pizza box around without any refrigeration for 12 hours when I got back home to Bellevue. I guess the worst case scenario would be that I would just throw it out if it went bad.I ended up eating up the leftovers over the next couple days after reheating them in the microwave and I didn&#39;t get sick fortunately. The deep dish pizza actually seemed to taste better too. Though that seems often to be the case when I eat leftover pizza as the microwave moistens up the crust.Glad I had some time to mull over writing this review as this would have been a 2 star review if I wrote it when I was dining. Didn&#39;t like having to order a whole pizza as it was more than I was willing to eat. But the taste of the pizza grew on me, particularly eating it as leftovers. If you feel like you can&#39;t eat it all, don&#39;t worry as you can just have them box it for you as a lot of the other customers do that as well.Tip for Skydeck visitors: If you visit Skydeck and dine at Giordano&#39;s afterward, there is a coupon on the back of the ticket redeemable at this Giordano&#39;s location. Either a $2 discount off a $10 purchase or $5 off a $25 purchase. If you get a small specialty pizza and a couple drinks, you should reach the threshold for the $5 off discount."

Service as a result was very attentive and nice. The waiter told me about their lunch special which included a drink, side and personal sized deep dish pizza. Since I was by myself that fit the bill.It was a decent amount of food. I was quite full after the pizza and garlic fries. But wowed? Unfortunately not. I&#39;m in the school of thick crust pizzas (unlike another east coast city) and the crust here was actually not bad. But it just didn&#39;t seem like there was much in the pizza itself. It wasn&#39;t the pizza jam packed with fresh delicious ingredients I was expecting. It&#39;s a danger for all places that become chains right? The fries were good actually, But I didn&#39;t go to lunch and a place known for their fries did I?Not bad, but I felt like I needed to try more places to compare afterwards. We&#39;ll see!"

I came here on Monday with a group of people, half of them had never had Chicago deep dish pizza before.As a group we ordered a deep dish pizza, a thin crust pizza, a harvest salad (my dish) and then some apps. The salad came out with the appetizers (I guess the waiter assumed I wanted the starter salad, rather than the entrée), so I waited until the pizzas came out to eat the salad.That was at least an hour later. I know--deep dish pizzas can take 45 minutes to make. But we ordered the pizzas right when we sat down, so I didn&#39;t anticipate it taking that long. My salad was pretty good--but also really SALTY.the Harvest Salad was really good because the blue cheese wasn&#39;t too overwhelming, and the walnuts and craisins added a nice touch. But there was way too much dressing and it was really salty. I asked the waiter for another one with the dressing on the side. It was perfect then.I am not sure if he took it off of the bill or not, since someone in the group surprised us and covered the bill. Either way, it was a nice experience. We were in a back room, to accommodate our group, and they gave my boyfriend the remote to the TVs so the guys were busy watching ESPN."

It takes 45 minutes, but the menu and the server were very clear about that, so it wasn&#39;t an issue at all. In regards to the pizza, ...um, wow! This is a serious deep dish pizza. I was starving and could really only handle 1.5 pieces! It is definitely good, the flavors and the crust were wonderful. That said, I enjoy the other option better (its a few down on my reviews if you don&#39;t know what I am talking about). I think this is truly just a matter of taste though. My only complaints with Giordano&#39;s is that it really is just so much! Maybe the non deep dish option is more manageable, but who goes to Chicago for non deep dish? My other suggestion is to not get a half and half style if one person can&#39;t have an item. It was close to impossible to see what pieces had sausage and which ones didn&#39;t.Overall; definitely a good pizza, it just has tough competition!"

Nothing to go completely crazy over.The service was ok too but nothing to rant or rave about.I really think this place is completely overrated.It was cool for the experience, just to say, I went to a Giordano&#39;s while in Chicago, but I have a feeling there are much better places to try in this city."

During our dinner the servers(2 different servers were checking in on us periodically) were nice and helpful to our needs!

Germs and all. (isn&#39;t this a health code violation?!?).We were definitely looking forward to enjoying our bbq chicken pizza after our night out, especially since we paid for it, but were not able to!

Would you believe that it still took 10 minutes for someone to notice?  My arm got so tired I had to hold it up with the other arm by that time.  And again, we waited to get the card back.It was so blatantly obvious that we were left for dead; we watched other tables come and go while we waited.

My order was ready when I got there, and it was a great lunch! Lou&#39;s pizza is too bread-y, Gino&#39;s is too sauce-y, but giordano&#39;s is extra cheesy which is what I like! You can literally see the layers of it all when you cut through it, which is awesome. Reminds me of lasagna but pizza! The small deep dish was $20 which is not cheap, but it is very filling and could serve 2-3 I would say! (I just unfortunately got it for myself). Online there wasn&#39;t an option to order the lunch special, and I realized once I got there that would&#39;ve been a much better deal for a personal pizza, fries or soup, and drink for only $11."

You can visit the Sky Deck then make your way down for some deep dish for the true Chicago experience.// SERVICE // Good, but be warned, because it is deep dish and takes a long time to cook, be prepared to wait ~40 min for your pizza.// FOOD //+ Chicago classic deep dish with pepperoni: The sauce was very heavy and very flavorful. The crust was stuffed which was an added bonus.After try both, I definitely enjoyed Giordanos more than Lou Malnatis!"

There were still a lot of people, but we were able to be seated immediately. I was visiting Chicago and tried a few of the popular deep dish spots. Personally, I liked Giordano&#39;s the best. I think the sauce was bolder than Lou Malnatis, which some people may not prefer, but I liked it. The pizza itself was thicker, so more ingredients. This was my second time having Giordano&#39;s and I thoroughly enjoyed the food. We did have to wait a while for the pizza, but that seems pretty expected. This location has a lot of seating and is actually 2 parts connected, straddling a Dunking Donuts."

You&#39;ve got to be kidding me. Stuffed pizza is my favorite kind of pizza in the world, and Giordano&#39;s happens to be my favorite place to get it. We were entertaining out-of-town guests, one of whom had never been to Chicago, so I absolutely insisted that we  all go to Giordano&#39;s for dinner. I really talked up the huge stuffed cheese pizza, explaining how many people can&#39;t manage to eat more than one slice because it&#39;s so substantial. Maybe it was my fault because I&#39;ve never eaten at this specific Giordano&#39;s location, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a stretch to assume chain restaurants are about the same.Anyway, imagine my disappointment when we dined here and the pizza just. Was. Not. Up to par. We ordered a size medium and size large stuffed cheese (one with fresh garlic and one with sausage). I reassured everyone that it would be plenty and we would all be stuffed (hey, it&#39;s not called &#34;stuffed&#34; for a reason, right?). Wrong. I should have been clued in to the fact that we might not be receiving the same huge stuffed pizza I&#39;ve come to expect and enjoy from Giordano&#39;s when we were not informed of a 40-45 minute wait time like usual. The pizzas definitely came to our table in less than that time (prob more like 30 minutes).My disclaimer is that it was NOT bad pizza by any means. It tasted great, was hot, fresh, and the fresh garlic was fantastic. If I were from out of town and were trying stuffed pizza for the first time, I&#39;m sure I would be impressed and satisfied. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s how it is for the many tourists who choose to dine at this location. However, knowing the standard that has been set by other Giordano&#39;s locations (like Westchester, the one in the &#39;burbs closest to where I live), I&#39;m not at all impressed. My girlfriend usually pulls off gobs of cheese because she thinks Giordano&#39;s stuffed is too excessive, but she ate every last string of cheese on her two pieces of pizza. As a true stuffed pizza fan, I was disappointed.That being said, the service was great. Our waitress was very friendly, and easily accommodated splitting the check even though we were a group, which I very much appreciated."

While waiting for your table, you can place your pizza order in the back so it&#39;ll come faster when you&#39;re finally seated.We ordered the &#34;The Special&#34; stuffed pizza. For two people, we ordered the small (which comes with 6 slices), but it was way too much! The portions are very generous - indeed &#34;stuffed&#34;. Our pizza was stuffed with sausage, peppers, onions. It was so cheesy and tasty! You can pull the cheese for miles! I didn&#39;t really like the crust though, it tasted stale to me - not sure why since everything else about the pizza was fresh!I definitely want to return to this place when I&#39;m more hungry so I can eat more.

Long wait time to get in, long wait time to receive the pizza. Honestly, I do not understand why people rave about this establishment. The sauce...way to runny so the entire thing just flops about and makes a huge mess. And then when you do the blasphemous thing to pizza (eg. use a fork and knife), the thing just spurts everywhere. It was like the pizza was sloppily made and without care by a five year old. Sorry, that&#39;s unfair to five year old pizza making geniuses. Sloppily made and without care by an untrained homeless animal. Better.Also, the service was unattentive and the waiters were like zombies. Mostly made of Eastern Bloc servers, they were very cold and annoyed. Why. Your tip and job rests on your service. Lose the bad attitude, be more attentive to water(s), drinks, napkins, and would a smile or an &#34;Enjoy&#34; kill you?Did I mention the amount of sauce is just absurd? It&#39;s like they opened up a Costco sized can or THREE of tomato sauce and dumped it onto the pie. What are you hiding Giordanos? The lack of cheese, ingredients, or toppings? By the time the food arrived, you are so starved you cannot force down more than a few bites and then the bloaty feel after consumption is not appreciated. The crust was burnt on a few areas and stupidly hot...it&#39;s just torture.SIDE NOTE: The pizza is ACTUALLY much better cold when the sauce gets a chance to congeal and solidify. That is the only avenue to eat this...kinda like Silician pizza! But when I sit down for more than 1hr and 30minutes, I&#39;m not going to refrigerate the food and eat it the next day...I&#39;m eating it then and there. Maybe it was just this location but I mean how different can the recipe be from place to place? No-go."

It  mwas definitely different than the usual pizza. It almost reminds me of a lasagne personally because the cheese is soo thick. I would recommend to start eating it as soon as  the pizza arrives versus spending five minutes trying to get the right angle of the pizza to take photo like we did  because the cheese hardens up pretty fast and the pizza taste the best when the cheese is soft and warm.The place also sells a cheaper ticket to the Willis tower/sky deck. So make sure you buy it from there. It&#39;s about five dollars cheaper than buying at the entrance of the tower which is a block away.

The delivery was actually about 20 minutes early, which was nice. Website didn&#39;t want to accept the address of the Merchandise Mart, it kept saying it didn&#39;t exist. I put it in five or six times, copying and pasting every time, and it took the last time with no changes whatsoever.The crust was mediocre in my mind. Not nearly as good as NY pizza, and kind of bland and hard, not a thin crust. Next time I&#39;ll try super thin. The group of 5 were happier than I was (but hey, it&#39;s my review!). For me, it had way too much cheese on it. I really couldn&#39;t taste the spinach or onions, artichoke was nice large pieces, but it was pretty much drowned out by the cheese.

After 10 minutes, we were seated (yeah!). Our server, Lorie, was AMAZING! She was very attentive and very accommodating. She had a very pleasant and cheerful vibe. The atmosphere here was great. Food wise, we didn&#39;t try their pizza because we didn&#39;t have time to wait for an hour for the pizza as we had a train catch but the food hat we ordered were tasty. We&#39;ll be trying the pizza when we come back!"

I am a native New Yorker, so I prefer a flat New York style pizza. The pizza was good, it was unusual to me, because the sauce was on top. But it was Pizza, a bit salty. But I ate two slices so I obvious enjoyed. When you are seated they warn you that it takes 20-30 minutes for an entire Pizza Pie. The service was ok."

I have never had a bad experience or a bad meal...  They have it down to a science. It takes about 45 minutes for your pizza to cook and the wait for our table was 35 minutes. So they took our order and while we were waiting for the table to get ready our pizza was in the oven.I was here with James Zacariello, a guy who knows his Chicago food.  While we waited for our table we decided to hop across the street to a bar and have a drink. After a bourbon and some beer we headed back across the street to take our seat at this Chicago institution.We ordered the bruschetta, which always comes looking beautifully presented. The tomatoes were juicy and flavorful and the mozzerella that sat atop the toast was fresh and cut to the perfect thickness. Add balsamic drizzle and fresh basil and you get one wonderful dish. It is an explosion of deliciousness.We ordered the pepperoni pizza and it came out right on time. The deep dish thin crust, with a nice layer of pepperoni directly on top... Smothered in the thick layers of mozzarella cheese and a thin layer of tomato sauce.... (All melted to perfection)... danced in our mouth&#39;s like Fred Astaire.This time I decided not to overeat.  I took my last slice &#34;to go.&#34;  But right before starting this review, and several hours after being back at my hotel, I opened the box and attacked the last piece.This place is a must... Move over New York pizza. You are good. In fact you are very, very good - but nothing can beat a good Chicago deep dish experience!!!"

If I just eat the cheese and deep dish crust, it is fine, decent for a lunch. But my stomach does not feel good after that.The salad and especially the lettuce in it is absolutely limp and tasteless, as if it came out of a year long deep freeze.The special deep dish with green peppers is fresher, but still I&#39;d give it a 3.5.

As a health conscious person, I wasn&#39;t totally for the idea of coming here for dinner, but the pizza turned out to be less heavy than I expected.

Once sat, the waiter we had was prompt and friendly. Looked as though the wait staff was understaffed.

The presentation was beautiful, and the preparation was perfect - the Halibut melted in my mouth and the Sturgeon was equally delicious.  DThe brussel sprouts were also very well done.We asked Andrew to surprise us with a nice white wine to pair, and the 2014 Sauvenniers was a great recommendation. A small production wine that we highly enjoyed.We ended the night with the Sticky Toffee Pudding which had us looking forward to the holidays.Overall and excellent experience that I look to repeat soon!"

Brought my sister here for her birthday dinner late September. There were only a couple Yelp reviews at the time and very mixed critics&#39; reviews, so we were hesitant of what to expect.Went on a Wednesday at 6:30pm and the bar was bustling with happy hour parties, but the dining room was only a third full. We also almost walked past this place since the only sign outside read &#34;Honey&#39;s&#34; on the window of the front door. Walking in, you&#39;re greeted by the host in the dark entryway then you enter the beautiful bar area that&#39;s perfect for dates and happy hour drinks. Then walking past the grand bar, there is a all wood floor dining room with tasteful fresh calla flowers and candles on each table. The aesthetics of this place was amazing.DRINKS - We both ordered the Bae of Bengal. A very boozy gin based cocktail. I&#39;m usually into really boozy drinks at dinner, but this was a little too much for my liking.APPETIZERS -  We had the hamachi and half a dozen oysters. Like other reviews, I definitely recommend the hamachi. Fresh fish and bright, bursting flavors. A small portion, but worth every bite. As an oyster lover, the oysters were perfectly seasoned and I could probably eat a full dozen myself.ENTREES - We ordered the squid ink pasta, buckwheat pasta, and the rotisserie chicken to share. Looks like they discontinued the squid ink pasta and changed the rotisserie option to duck.I actually preferred the buckwheat pasta than the squid ink, since I&#39;ve had better squid ink pasta elsewhere.The rotisserie chicken was a little too salty and the sauce didn&#39;t really make sense, but it was cooked perfectly.Although I called 2x to make sure they knew it was my sister&#39;s birthday/special occasion, only the host had acknowledged it and I had to remind the waiter it was her birthday. Unfortunately he didn&#39;t bring out a small treat as some restaurants downtown/ West Loop do as a nice gesture, which was a little disappointing.Overall, 4/5 stars and we will be returning again. Service was a little slow, but I&#39;m excited to come back and try the other updated dishes!"

The flavors work so well together and leave you wanting just a little more with every fresh bite.For our second small bite we had the oysters - cucumber, melon, apple vinegar, macadamia, basil.  Once again did not fail on flavors that took us by surprise but worked very well together.  The texture of macadamia and the apple vinegar bringing out the brighteness of the cucumber and melon did not out shine the oyster at all.For dinner I had the chermoula marinated sturgeon - summer vegetable panzanella, and charred tomato vinagrette and my bf had the rainbow trout - charred eggplant, roasted cornsuccotash, bacon, pea shoots.  Both fish were cooked to perfection!  My sturgeon had a smokey char and the vegetables were fresh and marinated well.  The rainbow trout was also cooked well and I absolutely loved the charred eggplant and succotash.  The two married well with the trout.For dessert we had the tahini chocolate bar.  This dessert was a play on a kit kat bar and it could not have been executed any better than it had!  The unusual flavors of date chutney and buttermilk ice cream married very well.  The last bite was definitely one to satisfy your sweet tooth and still leave you wanting more.Overall, I loved every minute of my experience at Honey&#39;s and would not hesitate to come back!"

The inside was awesome and not what we expected. Large atrium-ish entry/bar which was nice enough to go out for a girls night/cocktails. The restaurant is small but somehow felt huge inside!

White bright bar area but toned down.  Cute sky light.Dining area was library style...but not the over done, dark, smokey, speakeasy style...more like a classic muted tone.  I really loved it.We were sat at a booth and we waited and waited and waited.  Finally I had to ask someone for menus and water.  There were a MILLION workers but not one even noticed us.  The space is small...maybe 20 tables.  How did they not see us sit down?  Why didnt we get menus when we sat?  Then I had to flag down someone else to ask if we could actually order a drink.Server was nice and very apologetic about the wait.  Someone asked about whiskey...couldnt tell us what kind they had.  Had to go look.  All were mediocre bottles so they went with beer.Ugh...the food...the food was bad.  When I asked the server what to get, he started just reading off the menu items.  LOL!  It was odd.  Then he was side swiping the question, saying everything is spectacular...well, let me tell you...nothing was spectacular.Bread-this was actually REALLY good.  They served three little dough balls with some butter.  It was really great.  But one little roll does not make for a great dining experience.Caesar salad-grilled and was pretty decent.  The char on it really brought out some flavor that I hadnt had in caesar salad before.Bay scallops-he described it on bread...there was no bread.  It was in a &#34;white gazpacho&#34; which tasted more like a creamy, cold, blah sauce...ZERO FLAVOR.  Also, the scallops were these teeny, tiny scallops about the size of a nickel...no joke.  It was bad.Clams-ugh.  The &#34;bloody mary&#34; mignonette was so bad.  I cant even describe the flavor.  And the clam was chewy.Oysters-better than the clams, but I just felt like these were ok.  Nothing special.Pork chop-soooo dry.  It was so overcooked, it was awful.  It need more than the white bean sauce to save it.  There was no jus.  The flavor was ok, but it was so overcooked, I couldnt get over it.Trout-this was actually decent.  I wouldnt say it was amazing.  I felt like it was just very one note.  It needed some citrus or zest to break up the monotone of the dish, but it was cooked well.Grilled striploin-nothing exciting...my husband should know to not order steak from non steakhouses in this city...but he hasnt learned.  The dish just didnt go together.  Romesco was good...but it just felt like an outlier on the dish.Orecchiette-this was the ONLY thing that was worth eating at honey...besides the complimentary bread.  It was housemade pillows...yum.  So good.  Great garlicky sauce.  Most definitely could have used more seafood, but I&#39;ll take what we got.The vibe in here was weird...like really weird.  It felt like everyone was just a bunch of friends hanging at their friends house.  I dont know if everyone else in there knew staff or what.I am convinced the 5 yelp 5 star reviews are just of friends.  Save yourself $250 and go somewhere else.Overpriced, underdelivery"

It started off poorly when I walk in and there was nobody at the front! This wouldn&#39;t be a problem except that they have a separate room you wool into before walking into the main room. Apparently the hostess was walking around in the bar trying to figure out which parties needed to be seated, but it took me a solid 5 minutes of waiting out front before anyone popped up. Maybe investing in two hostesses on Saturday night to help w a first impression isn&#39;t a bad idea... but, it&#39;s my fault for not taking that initial experience as the foreshadowing for the rest of our experience. There were a couple plates like the sturgeon (outstanding)  and the beef tartare which were very good, but apparently they figured that the 3 halibut dishes we ordered weren&#39;t in need of proper cooking. I will say they did comp us for our Halibut, a few drinks and dessert but that was only after we had complained to anyone that would listen including the manager about the hour long wait between oysters and appetizers and another 45 min wait between appetizers and entrees. Oh, we did finally get bread about 30 minutes after sitting which was a nice touch. If your thinking it might have been because of peak Saturday time..our party of 6 got seated at 9:30pm, and didn&#39;t get our entrees until 11:15. Bottom line is that no matter how good the food is (par at best on our night), if you are going to be an expensive restaurant then your execution must be on point and this was not it! Plenty of spots in West Loop more deserving right now of your 100+/head. Hopefully these guys turn it around because the space is very cool. Reminds me of some smaller New York spots.I&#39;m definitely questioning how there are so many 5 out 5s for this spot right now."

The ambiance is cute, the service wonderful (I think they&#39;re still finding their rhythm), cocktails and dessert delicious! Unfortunately our main entrees weren&#39;t very good. I got the duck and it was so rubbery I ended up not eating it and ate some of my husbands pork chops instead, which were okay. We were super disappointed in the food especially since we went to Grace the year before for our anniversary. However, the drinks, dessert and service at Honey was so great, we&#39;ll be back to give it another shot. Second times the charm?"

We ordered a few appetizers to snack on and my only complaint is that the portions were quite small (like smaller than most small plates). The hamachi, scallops, and spit roasted cauliflower were all delicious and beautifully plated."

This is a great spot to meet up with friends and hang out at the bar or for a nice date night. The atmosphere is cool and fun. The cocktails (especially the Summer of 75) are awesome. The food is delicious (can&#39;t go wrong with the roasted chicken). Combine all of that with great service and you are in for a treat!

To start, the drinks were amazingly delicious &amp; super strong :) Tried the roasted cauliflower w/ giardinera appetizer and all I have to say is, just do it. Oysters were also very good. The squid ink pasta is thebomb.comand the spit roasted chicken was cooked to perfection and a large portion. Would say the vibe is a mix of elegant yet casual. The decor is gorgeous and classic, with a beautiful skylight and a menu with admittedly a few fancy terms / ingredients we weren&#39;t familiar with. However, everyone we encountered from the hostess to the mgmt staff were super friendly and down to earth, our waiter happily answered all of our ridiculous questions, joked around with us and made us feel right at home. Service was superb. Will definitely be back to try some other dishes!"

A new restaurant has to &#34;wow&#34; me to persuade me to go back. Isn&#39;t it what they want really? For people to consider this the new &#34;it&#34; spot, and keep coming back?Our reservation was for 9pm. We were told on the phone this was their busiest night so far, so they couldn&#39;t move up our dinner time. When we showed up, half of the tables were empty (this didn&#39;t change for the rest of the evening). The impression I got was that they didn&#39;t think their service was slow. It&#39;s like they thought it was OK for us to get our drinks 45 minutes after coming in, and our appetizers 45 minutes after that. I think we finished eating around 12. Nobody felt like dessert anymore. Not once did anyone acknowledge that they were running late. No one said sorry for a long wait, here&#39;s a free appetizer on the house, anything! They just pretended that this was the normal speed of dining.It&#39;s not!The 3 stars are for the food and the decor. The food was great! The music was kind of loud, but the booth seating was very comfy. This could have been my new favorite place, even, if not for me getting hungry in between courses. This is not OK, people! You can&#39;t pretend it&#39;s OK? This place will close within a year if it doesn&#39;t step up it&#39;s game."

And they meant it. That doesn&#39;t happen much, if ever anymore. So I&#39;ll be back (actually, I have a reservation for next week!)The front vestibule is cozy and dark, and I was warmly greeted by the hostess. That opens up to a large, bright bar with soaring ceilings, an enormous skylight and a big gorgeous bar. The dining room is cozy and quiet, and we watched summer storms through the skylight.I had a rye cocktail in a big coupe glass that was delicious - interesting and refreshing. ($14) My friend opted for a tequila/mezcal that came with orange and a sprig of rosemary, which was also great. With dinner, the waiter recommended a great bottle of white wine.The food was fresh and quite good, with portions that can accommodate sharing. Warm housemade bread and butter to start, grilled romaine salad was great, housemade pasta with morels was good; and the sea bass with brandade and piperade was delicious. The dessert (turkish coffee mouse - sponge cake with curry and cajeta ice cream) turned out to be the star of the show.Hector, our waiter was a sweetheart -friendly, engaging, and funny, but extremely professional. The bartenders were warm and attentive. One of the cooks (or the chef? I dunno ) brought out several plates himself. One of the owners, Justin, approached the table to welcome us, we talked for a while about the restaurant, his family, and life in general.  When he heard my birthday was approaching, he brought another owner over and they opened a bottle of Moet Rose and we all shared a glass and a toast together. One of them then took the cork, inscribed the date and &#34;Happy Early Birthday!&#34; on it and gave it to me as a souvenir.The food was 4 stars, the hospitality was 10 stars."

I have been there twice and have three more reservations coming up.  Can&#39;t stay away. First, when you walk in, you are made to feel so welcome and valued as a customer.  The service throughout dinner is simply superb.  And the food--drinks---so delicious.  The cocktails are creative and pack a good punch.  I love the Pimm&#39;s Punch Out...how can you go wrong with gin, pineapple, cucumber and basil?  We have ordered the spit roasted cauliflower, arugula salad and hamachi appetizers..all tasty and beautiful!  The two pastas are to die for--the buckwheat pasta a la chitarra and the squid in orecchiette--doesn&#39;t get any better. And you can order them in two sizes./ The chef is so accommodating that they give me the orecchiette with just shrimp--no calamari or octopus as i can&#39;t eat those.  I dream about this dish! It is a tough choice on what to order for entrees---I always wish I could eat more--we have loved the swordfish, the trout and the chicken so far but there are so many others to try. And on our last visit we had the most incredible baked Alaska you can possibly imagine. Honey&#39;s is a short walk from our home and we may go back just for that one night.The decor is simple and elegant, the staff, chef and owners are as nice and welcoming as possible, and the food and drinks are heavenly.  Can&#39;t wait for our next visit!"

Love the ambiance/decor etc in general. Service was so so. It took forever for our food to come out and they weren&#39;t that busy. I would expect service to be a bit better for their price point but it was still ok. Food on the other hand was underwhelming to say the least. We must have been there on an off night. Everything seemed a bit bland. We ordered the hamachi for appetizer. It wasn&#39;t anything to die for but ok. For our entrees, we got the pork chops and the rainbow trout. Pork chops were cooked to perfection and were delicious. Rainbow trout on the other hand was so bad that i could only have few bites of it. Charred eggplant that trout came with was spongy, cold and under cooked. (i should say eggplant is one of my favorite food to eat normally). Roasted corn succotash that trout came with was delicious but not sure if whole entree is worth its price for the delicious roasted corn!!

This was hands down- absolutely the greatest meal I have ever had in Chicago. It was sincerely- an experience. Everything was incredible- the staff- seriously- could they possibly be more professional and attentive? I can&#39;t imagine how. The decor- it was spot on perfect. The bookshelves had various displays- little collections of thoughtful curated arrangements. So current and stylish and yet relaxed and approachable. The food- just forget it. Every free moment I&#39;ve had since that meal until now- I am thinking about their bread and butter. I say that- and it&#39;s like- oh okay bread and butter- you&#39;ve had it literally a million times since you were a baby at restaurants and family meals. But that is just it--This is not like that. Talking about another level- the drinks. We started out- I had the Pimm&#39;s Punch Out and my husband had Smoke Up Your Glass. Both were outstandingly balanced and went well with everything we ate. We also had a spectacular bottle of Tempranillo- , which they decanted for us. Onto the food- We started out with the lamb tartare, marinated bay scallop, and the blistered shishitos. All were excellent. The scallop was in this delicious white gazpacho- and the crunchiness of the sorrel- swimming in there with the tenderness of the perfectly seared scallop- just forget it. I&#39;m sad now. The lamb tartare- spots of the black garlic mustard spaced throughout ensured every bite was well balanced and full of flavor. I was actually shocked how much I enjoyed the peppers. They had such a beautiful sweetness that really worked. We loved those too. We then had both the clams and oysters. The celery forwardness of the clam was unexpected and really bold- we loved it! As well as the soft undertones of melon on the oyster- absolutely perfect. I wish we had ordered more of those as they were just too good- We will have to get that again when we go back- And we HAVE to go back! Next- onto the Squid Ink Cavatelli. Absolutely insane flavors. It was the pasta from my dreams. I have NEVER had pasta taste so amazing and I lived near Boston&#39;s North End for 7 years before moving to Chicago. There is some serious pasta up there in the Boston area! Nothing like that though- Every bite of that dish was perfect. We finished up with the Turkish Coffee Mousse and the Corn Sponge Cake. Both were spectacular- explosive bold flavors. Beautifully presented- so artistic and thoughtful. A perfect way to finish such a creative and thoughtful meal. I just felt so incredibly spoiled eating all of these fabulous things! We did not order one thing that I felt like wasn&#39;t phenomenal and spot on. When do you say that? Never! It was truly a culinary memory- the entire experience was so special. Thank you!!!"

It took over 20 minutes for us to get our drinks with constant apologies from waiter. The restaurant is akin to eating in an Abercrombie and Fitch from a loud music standpoint. We were in a lovely round booth but it was hard for even those next to each other to have conversation. It is too expensive for that kind of experience. I can go to a bar for that.

Everything on Randolph was roped off so I could not have parked my own car if I tried!My daughter and I shared several plates and I was skeptical because I do not like &#34;sharing.&#34; I grew up relatively poor and sharing was not acceptable! It was first come, first served with meat and potatoes. I have been to Spain so I would compare the portions a little more generous than a tapas.I was quite impressed with the waitress and her laid back, but very accommodating style.The plates were great! We ordered a wonderful salad with beets, a really tasty pasta, and some mixed meat type of dish. It was very well prepared, tasty and worth of every penny.It was a very hot, 95 degree day so dining outdoors was not a choice for us! However, I think I would return to dine outdoors or go for brunch!Since it was so hot, we were not extremely hungry. However, I would think most people would order two to three  plates a piece to share.It&#39;s trendy, I&#39;ll tell you this.  We were dressed for an evening concert but people at this time of day, on a hot summer&#39;s evening, were dressed casual yet some, were coming from the office.

If that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for, just stop reading here.The food?  Meh is an overstatement.  I had the lyonnaise salad, it was about the size of a side salad.  It was simply frisee, a few small pieces of thick cut bacon, little brioche croutons, and an egg.  I use the word &#34;simply&#34; not as a compliment.   It was a tiny salad for an entrée salad, and it wasn&#39;t very good.  When I asked what dressing was on it the server told me it was just lard.  I understand tossing the frisee in some of the bacon drippings, but &#34;lard&#34; isn&#39;t a very appetizing word.  I didn&#39;t try any of the lobster hash that we also ordered, but I&#39;m told it wasn&#39;t very good.  The amount of time we waited for the dishes was a little ridiculous too.As I started the review...totally not worth the price.  A tiny salad and a glass of iced tea (a glass, no refills) $20?  No thanks.The service?  Really not good, especially at these prices.  The only plus I would give them is they brought a water bowl for the dogs.  This was before bringing us water and about 3-5 minutes before bringing our drinks.  The server stopped by maybe once after taking our order.  The bussers were on top of things though.  I wasn&#39;t done with my salad but he was done with his lobster hash.  The busser asked if he was finished and before &#34;yes&#34; had completely left his lips she&#39;d piled up his plate, both side plates, the silverware (including my knife) and took it all away.  Incredibly rude to clear the rest of the table while one diner is still eating.  Especially at a place that is purporting itself as a high-end establishment.We&#39;ll definitely never be back to Nellcote, not worth the time or money."

The crust was on point!  Slightly crunchy on the outside, but chewy in the center.Service was OK, although our waitress&#39; attire didn&#39;t affect how we enjoyed our meal, it was a little strange that she wore yoga pants and an inside-out halter top.  Someone was running late for work, apparently!I really can&#39;t wait to come back here, I felt like a princess...a tipsy princess...who doesn&#39;t want that?"

We were able to get an 8pm reservation on OpenTable just two days before. I&#39;m pretty sure they also take reservations for brunch, which is always a plus.My husband and I were promptly seated upon arrival and it didn&#39;t take long for our server to greet us and take our drink orders. We had a glass of sparkling and the garnacha rose which was my ideal rose in that it was perfectly dry. If only I had discovered it at the beginning of the summer! We decided to skip the entrees and only get small plates and pizza. Our server suggested 2-3 per person, but we started with 3 items total not wanting to over order:Beet salad--so small. Really, not so much a salad as much as a couple of tiny chopped beets on a plate. Luckily my husband is not a big fan of beets so I got to eat most of this teeny salad. It was topped with chicken chicharrones, which added a nice crunch.Venison tartare--again, such a small portion. Is there a shortage of food in the Nellcote kitchen? At least this one was priced better.Lamb merguez pizza--tasted fine, nothing to write home about but wouldn&#39;t advise anyone against it. Definitely not worth $19 though! It was smaller than I expected and for the price it had better be memorably delicious.In general, I now understand why a place with such a beautiful design and great atmosphere is not in the 4 or 5 star category. And, in my opinion, it is because the majority of menu items are overpriced in relation to portion size. Also, while the food is good enough, it is forgettable. I actually had to go and check their site to remember what it was my husband and I ordered. I would love to say that this is a great place to come with a group or a date, but I just can&#39;t. Do come for a pre-dinner drink though and soak in the fun vibe.Would I go back? Maybe to try the brunch. Probably if someone else was footing the bill. Most likely for a drink before heading elsewhere."

Since neither of us drink this early, we swapped out our drinks for coffee &amp; OJ. The coffee was a bitter French roast.We started with the pain perdu, which had soggy strawberries and cream. While the cream was nice &amp; light and bread crispy, the dish somehow tasted greasy. And that was the recurring theme for the rest of the meal. We got the lobster hash &amp; breakfast sandwich. Both dishes were paired with greasy potatoes. I&#39;d have much preferred some bread to mop up the excellent runny yolks from my poached eggs.

The decor and ambiance is stunning, yet comfortable. The food is also pretty. I don&#39;t have any serious qualms with the food itself other than it was just okay compared to the price point. I had the organic sunny side up egg pizza, and added Serrano ham to it because I&#39;m addicted to meat - but by that point, the dish was $22. The pizza was good, don&#39;t get me wrong, and I carried out two leftover slices, yet add in a $4 juice and you&#39;re over $26 a person before tax and tip when you can grab an even better brunch pizza across the street at Bar Siena for a little cheaper. My date had the quiche lorraine, and, for the price tag, the delicious morsel of quiche with a side of some olive oiled salad left her still a little hungry. You could get the whole shebang lorraine from Cindy&#39;s Rooftop for half of the total cost of our brunch at Nellcote, and watch people take bean selfies with a view while you&#39;re at it. Here&#39;s the thing: I don&#39;t mind paying for something stellar, but Nellcote was just A-OK. With a few minor adjustments, they could be so much better, but that&#39;s just the human condition, isn&#39;t it? Not to get philosophical.To end on a positive note: Nellcote was the only restaurant over there without a two hour wait for brunch."

Not that we thought it was super fancy or a dress code type of place, but we still went semi-formal for the occasion and found the general vibe to be &#34;wear whatever&#34; which didn&#39;t match up with what Yelp (dressy) or Open Table (smart casual) said.The decor was nice, but the club music blasting through the speakers didn&#39;t really match up. Again, did not think it was going to be a soft harp in the Titanic dining room, but the bar-level music wasn&#39;t great.On to the food...doing my best to recall names/details because their website menu is not current.Both cocktails we had were great. One had &#39;mother&#39; in the name but I&#39;m failing to recall anything else.The bread appetizer was...literally bread served with butter and olive oil. It was only $5 so that&#39;s fine, but if you&#39;re putting something as a menu item it&#39;s reasonable to assume there&#39;s some flair or panache that makes it different vs. paying for a bread basket.Enjoyed my steak and greens, but the sweet potato agnolotti was downright terrible. For starters, there were about seven agnolotti in the dish. That&#39;s to be expected if you&#39;ve ordered lobster, but the filling is sweet potatoes. Come on. It also just wasn&#39;t good at all. It was dressed with meyer lemon which sounded a bit off, but the gf went for it assuming someone in the back had tasted it before. I&#39;m not so sure. The pairing of lemon juice and sweet potato was not something I plan on trying again.All told, I feel like you can spend ~$80 (before tip) almost anywhere else on Randolph and walk away much more satisfied."

I didn&#39;t put it in my reservation because well, for a restaurant as nice as this place is, I naturally believed I didn&#39;t have to put in a message in a reservation or put out smoke signals to get a good experience. I should have just received good service regardless.The good: The maitre&#39;d was exceptional. He was prompt in getting us seated, friendly, smiled, and made recommendations before we even sat down. The food was good. It&#39;s been better in previous visits, but overall, still good. Unfortunately, from there service went down hill.I&#39;m not sure if our waitress didn&#39;t care about her job or was inexperienced. Regardless, the service she provided tarnished what was supposed to be a special occasion. There were only 8 tables total (from what I counted since we had long lapses in service) being served the same time as us. Basically, it was a slow night for them.We started with a wine with dinner. It took almost 10 minutes to get two glasses of wine when only 8 tables were being served. The drink was dropped off and I went to give it a whirl. The wine tasted like it may have been uncorked for a while so I asked for a different one. I was accommodated which I do appreciate but still, it was just not normal to have that happen in the many times I&#39;ve dined there.We then ordered our appetizer and entrees all at once. This is where things became unfortunate and didn&#39;t have to be. I don&#39;t know what was going on, but people who sat down after us got appetizers before us. To any diner, this is a pet peeve. We patiently waited but then over 30 minutes passed for our salad appetizer. Salad, as you know, isn&#39;t even cooked but assembled so I had no idea what took so long to assemble cheese, lettuce, and dressing.Our waitress was no where in sight for approximately a half hour so even though I wanted to bring this to her attention, I couldn&#39;t. I ended up waiving down a bus boy asking to check on our salad because our waitress, was *poof* missing. She then came out and said &#39;they&#39;re making you&#39;re salad now sorry for the wait&#39; after the bus boy tracked her down. I just thought that somewhere in those thirty minutes, we should have been checked on or asked &#34;how&#39;s your appetizers?&#34; but no such service was given.We then got our salads and then because of the terrible timing and slow service in our appetizer, food came out back-to-back. The cook on the salmon for my husband&#39;s dish was nice. The steak I had was good, but little left to be desired. We had been waiting a while so we ate our food, but I could only taste frustration and disappointment in every bite. Partially because I was there to celebrate something but our waitress put very little effort to provide even decent service. She checked on us once while we ate but at that point it was too little too late.I just wanted to pay the bill and leave. But I couldn&#39;t because the waitress gave us the wrong check. So I had to wait for the correct check to arrive. Between the long waits and uninterested server, my feelings were hurt. I know I&#39;m not a celebrity or anyone special. But I was there to have a good night. Instead, I&#39;m finishing my night disappointed in how I ended up &#34;celebrating&#34; my accomplishment and making reservations at a different restaurant for a redo because my husband felt so bad about this &#34;celebration.&#34;After tonight, there was little to be desired. I would have been happier going home, cracking open a bottle of wine and making my own dinner. It would have been done at a decent time, cost less, and I would have taken good care of myself. Instead, I feel like I wasted money on decent food and awful service.Sorry, Nellcote. You broke my heart tonight after I chose to be here and got the cold shoulder."

Unfortunately, in true Chicago fashion, it was 80 degrees on Friday, and 50 and raining on Saturday. Walking up, we were sad about the rain, as the outdoor seating area looked very nice. Think Parisian cafe with flowers and colorful tile.Walking in, my friend and I both agreed that the layout and decor of the place is gorgeous. We were taken away to a European cafe as we were seated at our marble table next to plush curtains. Our waiter, Michael, was very friendly. Sometimes when I come in and tell the restaurant that I am using a groupon or a promo, I can tell that I am treated like less of a customer. Here, however, I never felt slighted or not taken care of because I was using a voucher.The voucher was for one appetizer, two mimosas or Bellini&#39;s, and two entrees. We had a choice between the donut or the shared plate of meats and cheeses. We chose the shared plate along with two Bellini&#39;s.The drinks were very good, and so was the shared plate. The cheese was a little nutty, and paired with the salty proscuitto and buttery bread, it was a great little snack before our entree. There was also a selection of butter, apricot, and plum jams. This plate was a little on the small side, but it was perfect for us because we didn&#39;t want to get too full before our main course.My friend ordered the lobster hash and I ordered the quiche lorraine. The quiche was hands down the best I&#39;ve ever had. Rich, buttery, flaky crust with melt in your mouth eggs. Baked with herbs and chives, the smoky fatty bacon added a richness to the dish that was amazing. The side salad it came with was a nice light touch, balancing out the richness of the quiche with a slightly tangy champagne vinaigrette.My friend&#39;s lobster hash was also very good. The eggs were perfectly poached, and the hollandaise sauce was excellent. I think they added a little bay seasoning and smoked paprika to the hollandaise to balance out the fish taste of the lobster, which was great. My only complaint was, if I had ordered this dish, I would be upset by the fact that there were minuscule tiny pieces of lobster. My friend doesn&#39;t like overly fishy dishes, so she loved it, but I only found one piece of lobster bigger than the size of a dime in the whole dish!We decided to order one more drink each to top off brunch. My friend ordered a bloody mary and I ordered the rough justice cocktail, per the waiter&#39;s recommendation. Both were really good, I normally hate bloody mary&#39;s and even I liked my friend&#39;s drink. The rough justice came with tequila, cassis, lime juice, sparkling cider, and some muddled basil. It was sweet but not too sweet, with some earthy tones from the basil. Very fresh.The manager Stephanie came over after our meal and chatted with us, she was very nice and we will be definitely be returning to try out their dinner menu! Great food, great staff, great service, and gorgeous surroundings make this a must-visit on Randolph."

The interior of the restaurant was super cool (although definitely a little dark), and the food was on point. Also no complaints about the service - super friendly and fast, which is always nice!I tried the the hamachi crudo first, which was really really great. It was a bright dish with different flavors in each bite, which made it super enjoyable. It was definitely one of those dishes that you didn&#39;t want to end.The salmon entree was also really awesome. The portion was the perfect size and I particularly liked the roasted root veggies because they were a little saltier than the fish, which provided a nice contrast. The sauce was amazing and the fish was perfectly cooked.The only course I didn&#39;t really enjoy was dessert. The tart was a little heavy for me with the almond paste, and the gelato was good but the pairing was a little too sweet. The plum sauce was okay, but I wanted it to be a little more tart to cut the sugar and there wasn&#39;t enough of it.Overall - I left full and happy and would definitely come back!"

Finally !!   The interior was beautiful.  Since we went on my birthday we asked if there is a birthday dessert or something and the waiters reply was we will put a candle in your dessert.  Also the extremely LOUD music was a mismatch to this elegant restaurant."

While we were quickly seated, the rest of the experience and service was downhill from there.We sat around for THIRTY minutes without any service. Finally when the waiter showed up, he apologized and proceeded to provide his recommendations on popular dishes. As we had so much time to discuss and ruminate on the menu, during our lack-of-service time, we were able to order quickly.As we were running errands prior to our reservations, we did not have time to freshen up. Therefore, we ran to the restroom to compose ourselves. We were gone for no more than fifteen minutes. We were in no rush to get back to our table, as we did not expect the food to be ready so quickly, as reinforced above. Because we made reservations on Open Table, they had access to our phone number. But, the reservation was made through my brother&#39;s account. Therefore, he ended up receiving a call from them, stating something along the lines of &#34;We had disappeared but left our coats&#34;. Oh, I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t know I should have left my purse at my table, unattended. Evidently, I did not get the memo that we had to notify our waiter of our desire to use the restroom [please note the sarcasm in the previous two statements]. What is even more silly is that we specifically told the hostess upon checking in that my brother would not able to make the dinner tonight; and yet, they ended up calling him about our MIA status.When we returned to our seats, one of our entrees had been delivered. We had not been informed that the dishes would be served as they were ready.As if the night could not get worse, after our first dish was served, our waiter disappeared. During the night, he checked on us once. When we asked a waitress to find our waiter, her response was &#34;He&#39;s busy with a birthday party. You know how those are.&#34; She did not even apologize on the behalf of the waiter but more importantly, she did not even ask us what we needed assistance with. And, for the record, it was my birthday too!The only competent individuals at that restaurant were the busboys and chef. The food was magnificent, although a bit pricey based on the sparse quantity. We ordered: the wood-roasted cauliflower, the margherita pizza, and the sweet potato agnolotti. All of these were rich with well integrated flavors. Lastly, the decor was absolutely beautiful, especially in the restroom.Overall, the classiness of the dishes and the decor overtly clash with the quality of the wait staff.I will NEVER visit again, and I will tell all my family and friends to never even entertain the thought of visiting this place."

The interior of the restaurant is even more beautiful in person than in the stunning photos. The chandeliers add a touch of class, and plenty of natural light flows in freely through the large front windows. I basked in the comfort of the lounge area with the low tables and couch. The two large blue chairs add a great splash of color to the room. Even the bathroom was chic and cute.  The interior decorator did a spectacular job.As for the food,  I wish I could write about more than three items. We had the ahi tuna tartar, burrata salad, and the eggplant pizza. Every bite pleased my taste buds except for the last because they were yearning for more. Hands down the best ahi tuna tartar I&#39;ve ever had, and I&#39;ve had many. The crunchy black stuff on the plate added a balanced but subtle meat flavor,  the tuna was fresh and cut in perfectly bite size pieces, and the dollops of yellow gooey goodness were awesome. The presentation was also spot-on.  I&#39;d definitely recommend the burrata salad as well. The greens werr sparse but the flavor was abundant.  The burrata was a generous portion and the sunflower seeds added a yummy, nutty crunchiness. Finally, the eggplant pizza was great. I wouldn&#39;t call it the best pizza that&#39;s ever touched my tongue, but the crust was worthy of being eaten, and the eggplant was meaty and not salty or bitter.  The smoky cheese and the zesty sauce truly painted a delicious masterpiece in my mouth.I can&#39;t recall our server&#39;s name today, but she was sweet and was able to answer questions about the cocktail list and make some recommendations. I was pleased with the hostess as well because she greeted us with a smile as soon as we walked in.  I&#39;d love to come back for brunch, and when I do, I assure you there will be a review part dieux."

I had friends visiting the city and decided this was the place to impress them with Chicago&#39;s food scene - I was wrong. This use to be my favorite restaurant but my recent visit (after months of not visiting) contradicts all my previous experiences. No white table clothes anymore (just awkwardly bare wooden tables) mediocre and room temperature pizzas (these use to be my favorite) and the pasta bolognese was not the same pasta bolognese I had in the past - this one was pale tan with no hint of tomato or wine in the sauce, the &#34;meat&#34; had an odd texture, not soft like most bolognese - I couldn&#39;t even eat half of it. The hanger steak was boring and not accompanied by a starch or carb, just soggy salad. We tried to redeem our meal with a cleansing sorbet - this was also terrible - way too sweet, chunky with ice, not smooth.I was embarrassed to waste my friends&#39; time. Did I mention one of my friends is a chef? Waste of a meal, a night and money.  So sad because it WAS really great."

We tried it for the first time last night and were not impressed. Our server was good and there was a decent selection of wine (the cocktails looked good as well but we didn&#39;t try them), but the beer selection could definitely be improved. We tried the tuna tartare, cauliflower, hanger steak and chicken. Each item was extremely salty and the portions we very, very small.

The brunch goes until 3pm but as long as you get in your last order by 3, you&#39;ll be fine. Every time I went I got there around 1:30pm so maybe this was why I had such a pleasant experience with the staff. They weren&#39;t overwhelmed with people and orders so they were less distracted and patient going over the menu. They were also very punctual with filling up my water and clearing plates from the table. I had the server, Michael, each time and he was great. Very knowledgeable and knew the food and kitchen well. He was willing to give me his honest opinion on dishes which I appreciated. Didn&#39;t just say everything was great.Now to the food:The must tries for any table is the donut. It&#39;s pretty big and with a knife, you can cut it into at least 4 pieces so everyone can try it. Of course, I ate the whole thing myself but I&#39;m a pig. Takes one to know one.Pain Perdu was also very good. Gourmet french toast on a housemade brioche doesn&#39;t get much better. The dark chocolate flavor wasn&#39;t overpowering so if you are a chocolate fan don&#39;t expect chocolate covered french toast. It&#39;s a subtle aftertaste which I liked since it is legit dark chocolate and bitter so it went well with the sweet strawberries and cream.For the savory dishes, I really enjoyed the Bagel and Lox because of the experience and interaction it allowed me to have with the food. There were just so many combinations of flavors and textures available.Quiche Lorraine was good. Good ratios of bacon to cheese to egg to crust. The mixed green salad was very enjoyable as well. Lettuce was so fresh and crisp I think it was picked that morning.The omelet was nice. The melted brie cheese tasted great with the ham. Same mixed green salad as the quiche and again it was good. Vinaigrette is light but flavorful.I loved the breakfast sandwich. The muffin is one of the rare items not from the midwest. It is imported from New Hampshire. The right muffin makes this sandwich, and after one bite you can understand why the chef goes all the way to NH to get it.Nellcôte turned my tuna inta Lobsta! Lobster Hash- maybe the most popular dish here. Hash consists of their crispy kennebec potatoes, tender lobster chunks, carrots, chives, and spring onion. You should definitely order this if you enjoy hash browns with sunny side up or poached eggs and like mixing the runny yolk with the potatoes.Nellcôte turned my noodles inta Pasta! Agnolotti- This was amazing. It was small but where it lacks in size it makes up for in flavor and depth. Biting into a creamy and buttery noodle you get hit with a soft and fluffy ricotta and the garlic crunch from the chip is a pleasant surprise. It is definitely one of the best pasta dishes I can remember having. Becoming a big fan of house-milled flourI highly recommend the Eggs &#39;En Cocotte&#39; if you were always the person dipping your sandwich into your soup like I was. The grilled bread served on the side makes the best bread for dipping into what I will call the &#34;thick soup&#34; created by the sausage, tomato sauce, and runny egg yolk.Steak &amp; Eggs. An American classic. I ordered this with the side of toast. Honestly, the toast saved this dish. I placed the eggs on top of the toast, butter, and jam which was great. The steak was too tough and chewy for me. The bernaise was nice but couldn&#39;t save the meat. From a price and value perspective, skip this dish.Pizza Time.Margherita pizza was pretty standard. I would have liked to tasted more of the basil. Fresh basil usually is more present in this pizza. Good thing I orderFlour milled in-house to &#34;0-0&#34; consistency, coupled with a 90 second oven exposure, creates the amazing crust: thin, lightly chewy, puffy edgesSunnyside Up Organic Egg was a pizza I&#39;ve never had before. Arugula and an Egg on pizza? Maybe I&#39;m too American to have tried this before. Not only did it taste great but it came with a cool presentation. The sunny side up egg is poked with a spoon by the waiter, they then collect the yolk in the spoon and drizzle it all over the pizza. So if you don&#39;t enjoy the pizza, at least it came with a show!Housemade Fennel Sausage. Housemade? That&#39;s right! Van Camp doesn&#39;t mess around with his pork. Could I taste the in house difference? Well, no. But I appreciate the attention to detail in my food.Lamb Merguez was my favorite pizza. It was spicy which I like and all the flavors came together beautifully to give you complexity but not to an overwhelming level. A fan of spicy pizza? Love sausage? Get this and you will be glad you did."

We had the lobster hash, agnolotti and bacon glazed donut, all of which were very good.The decor here is by far their winning attribute though, with chandeliers everywhere! I&#39;m looking forward to eating on the patio once the weather is better.I&#39;ve previously been here for dinner and cocktails as well, the Robuchon potatoes are a standout to me, and their cocktails were nice and strong. They also have a pretty awesome happy hour deal, M-F from 5-7p that&#39;s $10 for any Pizza and a Beer.  That&#39;s a steal!"

Have some definite opinions.First, great bar and bartenders.Regarding food, we ordered pizza and rack of lamb. The margarita pizza was $15 and any topic made it a $20 pizza. Stupid.The worst was the rack of lamb. This came out with the fat carved and on the plate and one lamb chop; hardly a rack of lamb. We had the waitress take it back and dined on our margarita pizza for the night.I&#39;ll leave it that the place &#34;Smoke &amp; Mirrors&#34;. Not for food, solely a bar. Take it for what it is and enjoy it, but don&#39;t expect any pleasure or confuse as restaurant."

If I were a teacher, I&#39;d give it an A +. From the pizza to the house-made pasta, the dishes here are a winner. We had a party of six and ordered an abundance of food and cocktails-- roasted eggplant pizza, venison tartare, the piri-piri cauliflower, wood-roasted mushrooms with polenta, butternut with pork belly, the burrata, spaghetti, the bolognese, the agnolotti, the coconut pana cotta, and the peanut butter mousse-- plus a slew of flavorful, beautiful, and, most importantly, STIFF drinks. Everything was absolutely imbued with such a WOW! POP! of toothsome flavors. No complaints about the food, whatsoever.The bad news? The service here is spotty. Tonight I celebrated my birthday with my close friends, and had made a note that it was my birthday over the phone. But the service here did not reflect that it was a special day at all. We were checked on (unenthusiasticly) approx. 5x over the course of 1.5 hours. Our female server did not seem like she wanted to be there at all. Or perhaps was poorly trained. This might be the bad server mentioned in previous reviews. Either way, Lady Luck was not on our side tonight. Despite her being within earshot of the opening of presents and the &#34;Happy Birthday!&#34; cheers, our server did not seem either attentive nor seem to care that it was a special occasion. A little enthuisiasm wouldnt hurt, just sayin&#39;. Also, seriously... No candle on my dessert? Definitely felt a little hurt about that. Having been a former server myself, I always made it a point to check my reservations for the day for special notes before I started my shifts. Is it a birthday? An anniversary? A reunion? Check, check, check. Now go and put your game face on. And for pete&#39;s sake, smile! Or fake it if you cant muster a real one!It left a very bad taste in my mouth. Which is a shame because I really enjoyed our food and the wonderful company I had. And I have been here before with my relatives from Michigan, and we had an amazing server back then. I dunno if service has declined here in recent months and will continue to sink... But they really gotta do something about their indifferent, glum servers. The only highlight of the service was that the host was super-sweet. Tyler the host was so gracious and kind and even wished me a happy birthday on my way out. He helped redeem the night.But overall, if service was being graded (even on a curve), it would be a solid C- student. Whip those servers into shape! If it&#39;s a training discrepancy, then fix it. I sincerely hope they do improve because I do love the food, and I wish the service was as good as it was the last time I was here.UPDATE: I sent Nellcôte a direct message on Open Table to express my unpleasant experience with their service a week after this bad birthday dinner and have not heard any sort of response back from them... It has been almost 2 months. Not even a brief apology from management. Wow. Very unprofressional and frankly rude. I will not be recommending this place to anyone ever. And will actively discourage anyone from visiting Nelcôte. It&#39;s not worth the bad service and the cold shoulder you&#39;ll receive from them."

Our server, Lindsay was so nice and really made our experience enjoyable. She checked on us at just the right times and made sure we had everything we needed. We came in with a Gilt City deal for brunch and weren&#39;t treated any differently than any other customer! Side note/ pet peeve: Always tip on the full value of what you ate/drank when you come to these restaurants with a voucher...the server shouldn&#39;t have to lose tip money just because you&#39;re a saavy deal hunter like me.The atmosphere of this place was one of my favorite parts. It&#39;s gorgeous! Definitely French inspired decor with modern touches. There are multiple levels with a beautiful huge bar in between. On the top half, it looks like there are separate rooms for private parties. Seems like a fabulous place to host a baby or bridal shower...or even a birthday party! There was a baby shower going on while we were there.To start, I got a mimosa and my husband got a bloody mary. It&#39;s definitely a champagne place...the atmosphere alone made me want to guzzle a couple mimosas and make myself feel as fancy as the interior. Their mimosas are a combination of orange and raspberry juice...very good. We also got a shared plate which included brioche bread, plums, cheese, and meats. Absolutely phenomenal. One of my favorite things about this place is that they hand make as many of their ingredients as they can...even down to the flour! It&#39;s noted on their menu that if they can&#39;t hand make it, they find someone who can and buy from them!For brunch I had the pain perdu (aka french toast)...absolutely phenomenal, but definitely for those with a sweet tooth. It had the perfect amount of garnishes and glaze. My mouth is watering thinking about it now! My husband had the lobster hash and only had good things to say about it. He would, however, say that there wasn&#39;t much lobster. The potatoes served with it were great, though.Will definitely be back here and can&#39;t wait to sit on the patio during a warm morning! Thanks Nellcote for a great experience!"
