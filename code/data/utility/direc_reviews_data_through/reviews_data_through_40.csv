Heaven on Seven is a lively loud place to get authentic New Orleans&#39; food and more in downtown Chicago. Head to the 7th floor, put your name in for a table or find empty seats at the counter.Specials are listed on a chalk board and the servers can also cover the specials. They&#39;ve got all your Po&#39; Boys, Gumbos, Shrimp everythings, Burgers, and more. I&#39;ve recently loved the Diablo Chicken Tamales, and they&#39;re hot and smothered in cheese. Get a local (NOLA) beer here like Abita and you&#39;re good to go!Just get there early, as this place is popular (as it should be)!"

The pasta options are are also good as well.I&#39;m sad that they closed down the bigger location on Rush, that was the one we used to go to.  I like this smaller location-definitely a lot more cozy!  The service was top notch and we will continue to enjoy Cajun food at this location.  Like others mention, it&#39;s cash only and is found in the 7th floor of the Garland building."

No, it&#39;s not as good as many in New Orleans, but it&#39;s good. And what makes it special is the vibe, with its thousands of different hot sauces lining the walls (no, there are no repeats) and its perpetual Christmas-garlanded ceilings.I started with a cup of the gumbo, which was excellent, with its generous helping of tender, flavorful Andouille sausage.A jalapeno corn muffin wasn&#39;t all that impressive compared to others I&#39;ve had.My main was a Cajun barbecued shrimp po&#39;boy. The shrimp was very hot, with a slight saffron flavor, and the bread was nicely grilled. The whole mess (and I use the term intentionally) was covered in a flavorful Cajun gravy with just the right amount of spice. At first, as I picked at it with my fork, I thought it was just okay, but once I&#39;d eaten enough shrimp to be able to pick the whole thing up and get a bite of everything, I really liked it.Service was friendly and efficient. A lot of regulars came in and sat at the small, U-shaped lunch counter while I was there. I could tell it&#39;s a place many people have been coming to for decades, and I can see why."

You can pretty much create your own dish from all the options on the menu.Jalapeño cheddar cornbread: super dense, nice flavorsShrimp and corn chowder: oddly sweet and gelatinous.New Orleans BBQ Shrimp po&#39;boy: very saucy, lots of black pepper flavor.

I&#39;m not sure if it was because I hadn&#39;t eaten much all day, the fact that the drink came out in a mason jar the size of a fish bowl, or if the bartender was just being generous that night, but I had one and was nice and buzzed.  Well worth the price.I ordered a shrimp and oyster po boy and had mixed feelings about it.  When I first saw it, I figured it was an open faced sandwich because I couldn&#39;t find the top bun and actually started eating it with my knife and fork until I discovered that the tiny top bun was just hidden underneath the 4lbs of shredded lettuce.  The bread that they chose was tiny.  It was probably just mine but the bun was smaller than the average cell phone with sauce on the side.  The taste of the seafood, however, was good with way more fried shrimp than oyster.  I only had 3 oysters but the taste was pretty spot on and was fried perfectly."

My sister-in-law brought me here, we were all craving for some good southern food, and I am so glad she brought us here!Pros (+):- Atmosphere is great, a total hole in the wall. You ride the elevator up to the 7th floor, and then as soon as you walk in, you&#39;re bombarded with cool decor. The walls are lined with Hot Sauce bottles, many I have never seen, or heard of before.- The crab cakes are to die for. I haven&#39;t had a good crab cake in awhile. I live in Seattle where our seafood is fresh. I can&#39;t fathom how amazing these were.- The Gumbo is really awesome. Granted I have never had Gumbo before, but it&#39;s a dish I am totally down to eat after having it here!- They bombard you with so much food, I swear it&#39;s impossible to finish your entire meal!- Service is fantastic.

I&#39;m not a Cajun man, but I can easily say that the gumbo they serve is by far the best I&#39;ve ever had. We also got a round of cornbread, each of which was roughly the size of a softball and I ordered the shrimp po&#39;boy as my main, which was crispy, delicious, and perfectly fried.I really appreciate the selection of unusual hot sauces, which were fun to try in turn. My only gripe is that (at lest when we went) Heaven is cash only, which seemed a little inconvenient in spite of the fact that they have an ATM inside.

The food is great, but the ambiance is the selling point. The walls are lined with hot sauce bottles and Louisiana posters. They always have Mardi Gras streamers hanging from the roof, regardless of the time of year.CASH ONLY. There is an ATM in the restaurant, but it is not bank affiliated and charges a $3 fee.The food is tasty and the portions generous.  I got an oyster po-boy ($12.99), which comes with an option of a side salad, soup, or red beans and rice. I chose the soup option, which had the flavor profile of red beans and rice. You could taste the seafood stock, which had a great flavor. It was thickened with some flour, so the soup had the consistency of gravy. Thick, but tasty.The oyster po-boy came on the traditional hoagie with a tomato and iceberg lettuce. The oysters were well prepared- crisp cornmeal crust, but not overcooked to lose that delicate oyster flavor. It comes with a side of slaw and a side of the honey jalapeno dressing. I wished that they had made a strong remoulade available instead of the side of dressing.My escape from work!"

I&#39;ve been missing out- I prefer this one to the Rush location. It&#39;s a nostalgic place for us, since we had our first date there some four years ago.It&#39;s located on the seventh floor (see what they did there?) of the Garland Building, so it&#39;s easy to miss. It&#39;s much quieter than it&#39;s Rush counterpart, which I really found relieving. The decor is cute, with Mardi Gras themed chandeliers and wall hangings, as well as a wall of different hot sauce bottles.My girlfriend and I came here for the tail end of lunch, and it was nice because we were one of maybe three or four tables. The service was really quick and our waiter was really nice and helpful. My girlfriend ordered Southern Fried Catfish, which came with a bowl of their famous gumbo. It also came with red beans and rice and Cajun coleslaw. I think it hovered somewhere around $14. The fish was well seasoned, and was cooked perfectly. The spice didn&#39;t overpower the fish, which was great. The red beans and rice had just the right amount of kick. I ordered the Louisiana Soft Shell Crab Po&#39; Boy Sandwich which came with Cajun coleslaw and gumbo as well ($13.95). This sandwich was amazing. The outside of the crab was perfectly crisp, while still being soft enough to eat without problems (a reoccurring issue I have when getting soft shells). The meat inside was tender and delicious. It was also the first time my girlfriend had ever tried it, and it was kind of funny watching her try and eat a claw, shell and all.Chef Bannos was there when we ate, and he was super friendly. He came out and made sure that our food was good, and made conversation with us to make sure we were taken care of. If that isn&#39;t good hospitality, I don&#39;t know what is.The staffs&#39; shirts all say the same thing: &#34;People who come back from Heaven all say the same thing...try the gumbo!&#34; And they say that with damn good reason.

It came with a honey jalepeno sauce which was very good. The cole slaw had a tint of brown. I am not sure if that was the color of whatever they used to dress it, or it was because the cabbage was a little old? Regardless, it was so good I ate it all anyways. If the cabbage was old and I get diarrhea it was still worth it, but I am assuming it was just the color of the dressing in the cole slaw. I would go there again. very very good food."

I never eat cole slaw, but the way they do it here is tasty.The only reason this doesn&#39;t get five stars: They have a smaller lunch menu than the Naperville location which has some great entrees (and brunch options). Also, the cash-only (no checks, either, people) thing is a bit of a bummer, but there are ample ATMs in every direction of the building.Stop by for lunch, and you won&#39;t regret it."

It is not spicy at all and quite flavorless. The only thing saving it is the various hot sauces scattered around the restaurant. The roll that came with the gumbo was not fresh, and even though it was clearly store bought it was quite old and hard. The cole slaw that came with my crab cakes was absolutely repulsive, and the crab cakes themselves were decent, but nothing special. I came here expecting much more flavor, and the food is truthfully kind of bland. The crab cakes did not taste fresh, canned crab was clearly used and the breading was not cohesive, but very granular. The tarter sauce is gross."

I would return based off of her amazing service alone.H on 7 have a regular menu and also the specials menu which included gumbo, jambalaya &amp; étouffée. Although tempted by all of these options, I went with the southern fried chicken breast. Id been wanting fried chicken all week so it was an easy choice. The meal came with a delicious black bean soup, a side of steamed carrots and mashed potatoes and a side of gravy. Although not spice, there were several hot sauce and spice blend choices on the table. I chose a spice blend for my fried chicken and it paired very nicely. I wish I could remember the name but it&#39;s kind of fun to try several anyway. The food was fresh and came out very quickly. Solid 5 stars here."

Had a great experience here.The decor and ambiance alone were hits for me, as was our server - wish I could remember her name - but she had a fantastic personally, was fun to be around, and took awesome care of us. We&#39;re kind of a rough and tumble bunch, and after the gatekeeper in the lobby sized us up and granted us entry, we were treated like royalty. It was as if we were the only diners there for dinner that night.Beverage-wise, my iced tea was phenomenal. &#34;Well Sol, you can get an iced tea anywhere, right?&#34; Not so. Not like this. Mine came with a lemon wedge that may as well have been the size of my fist. As a confirmed citrusophile, this scored some major points with me. We all noshed on some fried jalapeno cheddar cornbread for our starter, and that pepper gave me a kick in the seat. (That&#39;s a plus here)Ignore the haters spewing venom over the Jambalaya, as it was amazing. Fresh ingredients, flavor galore, touch down! Gumbo was also outta this world, they didn&#39;t skimp on the Andouille. I also sampled my bud&#39;s red beans and rice, which were very pleasing on the ol&#39; palate.Long story short, I love Heaven on Seven, and definitely will be back.

We&#39;ve tried to find better in other places,but Heaven on Seven&#39;s take on this southern delight is unbelievable. The chicken is Rice Krispie coated with a hint of bacon and spice and the syrup is mixed with honey. Add any of 20 hot sauces on the table (or ask for some of their too hot handle sauces from the kitchen) and it&#39;s a firery sweet ecstasy. Gumbo also very good. Andouille sausage as an appetizer had great flavor, heat, grill, salty, sweet. We have made this a regular stop when we visit Chicago. Now only the original location, which is a little hard to find on the 7th floor of an office building (thus heaven on 7). This last visit the waitstaff was great, but, full disclosure, wasn&#39;t busy at all on a Thursday night. Enjoy!P.S.  9/17/16 - SO disappointed.

Have yet to have some real authentic creole cuisine but I could easily say this was the best I have had. The next was the main course with fried chicken po boy. This was a very sizable sandwich with a side of their home style sauce (jalapeño honey mustard). The chicken was still very moist and the spices on the chicken were not overwhelming at all, very light a flaky. The meal came with a side of coleslaw which is not my favorite dish so I passed. A side that I ordered was jalapeño cheddar cornbread. This was very good and perfect side for the dish. The only problem with the meal was that the rolls (which were complimentary) were very hard. I could still eat it but it did need to be ripped. This was not a huge problem compared to how the meal and service was. The service was very good. The waitress was attentive and very nice.The atmosphere is very relaxed and fun. The walls have hot sauce bottles all over them and they have more than enough hot sauces at the restaurant to use for the meal.One side note, I loved their home style jalapeño honey mustard sauce. The bottles can be purchased and I ended up getting one for salads and as a dipping sauce at home."

Then after asking a question about an item, the waitress left to get the information and never returned. We left with our to go food after waiting over 1.5 hours. When we got home, we realized that they forgot items from our take out. We called to notify them and the staff member who answered the phone was rude.

I had the softshell crab Po&#39;  boy. This was my first experience with softshell crab. The crab was tasty and boasted a crunchy crust and soft, tender,  buttery crab on the inside. Yum! But the sandwich as a whole suffered due to the cheap-ass, preservative-laced French roll on which it was made.  By preservative-laced, I mean it&#39;s one of those mass produced rolls that comes in a six-pack bag and can sit on the shelf for a couple days without going stale. It&#39;s not good French bread and it made this otherwise good sandwich suffer!The gumbo was an amazing bowl of chunky, thick creamy goodness! It was full of tender meat, and offered a deep complexity of flavor from what I can only assume was a well-toasted roux. I could eat/slurp this stuff every day. Except its super rich, so I&#39;ll save it for special occasions.Looking forward to my next bowl of Heaven on Seven gumbo!"

It has a southern Louisiana feel with southern music and a fun, mardi gras feel. I love a restaurant with a theme! The wall with a million billion hot sauces is very cool. I&#39;ve gone to the AMC theater here many times and have never ventured inside Heaven on Seven so was very happy when I got the chance.I tried their jambalaya with soup yesterday. The jambalaya was so spicy for me, it definitely did not require any additional spicy sauce. It had chunks of spicy sausage and tasty meat in it. I&#39;m not too sure what the soup was but it was just delicious!The menu here has so much to offer and we don&#39;t have a ton of Southern cooking places in the city. I don&#39;t know how I&#39;ve missed ever going here and will definitely be back when I go to the AMC theater. It won&#39;t be a destination spot though as what I did try did not completely blow me away.5/13/12 Update:I went here again after a movie and I&#39;m going to say the 3 Star Rating stands. The hostess ignored us and then was not friendly at all when she finally did seat us. Our waiter was fine during our meal but considering there were about 6 tables sat in the whole restaurant, service was shotty and slow. The food here is too expensive for what it is although portions are HUGE! I got the Fried Chicken Steak meal for $16.95. It came with a salad that had the most amazing dressing on it! The meal also came with veggies and mashed potatoes. All in all a good meal but I wasn&#39;t blown away and the service was not great at all. I won&#39;t be dining here again unless I absolutely have to because I&#39;m watching a movie upstairs."

Nando is it, though!My friend and I walked in on a whim on a Wednesday night. The restaurant was small with ambient lighting and close tables. The first thing I heard were people cheering their drinks in Italian (Salut!) I was a little intimidated but then our host appeared. He was an absolute delight! He graciously welcomed us and asked if we spoke Italian. Neither of us do. He smiled and welcomed us again as he ushered us to our table.We ordered fabulous red wine and our host checked in on us to see if we had questions about the menu. We both ordered pasta dishes that were AMAZING! The portions were smaller than a typical Italian restaurant but I ate everything on my plate and felt pleasantly full.It was on the menu but the host also mentioned that they make all their pasta fresh in the restaurant. I&#39;m definitely getting the Gnocchi next time because there is nothing better than freshly made Gnocchi!We were asked if we wanted dessert which we didn&#39;t but the host made us &#34;something a little sweet.&#34; It was a limoncello shot! He said they made fresh limon and limecello at the restaurant. It was super sweet and tasty- I love lemon.The whole experience was lovely and made me feel very welcomed.

After tonight I must change my mind because this was one of the best Italian dinners I&#39;ve ever had. The owners were born in Sicily &amp; moved to Milan before finally setting up shop in Chicago. This place is a cozy little gem that will knock your socks off. Save your money for your transatlantic flight to Italy &amp; just drive over here for dinner.A really great friend of mine called &amp; said he would be flying into Chicago &amp; wanted to go out for a great Italian dinner. It took me days to figure out where I should take him. I finally decided to come here because I knew everything was made in house. My buddy had the best meal of his life &amp; he said when he comes back to Chicago we are coming back here for dinner. So thanks to everyone for providing this fantastic dinner for an old friend. You made me look like a Rockstar.When I walked in I was greeted by Jelena who I thought was the hostess but then realized she was also our waitress. This place is small &amp; I think Jelena was taking the orders for every table. She never made us feel like we were waiting for service. She even spent time hanging out at our table &amp; when my buddy said he couldn&#39;t see the menu in the darkness... Jelena went &amp; grabbed a flashlight for him to see it. I call that 5 star service. Thanks for making our dinner a memorable experience.There were many specials to choose from. We decided to go with the mussels with saffron, capers &amp; chili flakes to start with as an app. The mussels were incredibly fresh. It also came with two pieces of toasted garlic bread which tasted so good in the saffron sauce. We had to ask for another bag of their house made bread to dip in the sauce. We kept dipping our bread in the sauce until the juice was all gone. When you&#39;re Sicilian &amp; something tastes good then you use you&#39;re bread to clean your plate &amp; we totally did that.This place makes everything fresh. The bread we were using to dip into the sauce was made in house. In fact, the pasta &amp; the ricotta are all made in house. I must give you some words of advice for Italian food, if the pasta isn&#39;t homemade then don&#39;t eat there. Anyone can open a bag of dried pasta but not everyone can make a fresh pasta noodle. My pasta was beyond amazing &amp; that is because it was made fresh. I am proud to say that the pasta here is some of the best in the city.I must mention the dipping oil for the bread. I loved how it was presented on the table. The dish had olive oil with red pepper flakes and a few other herbs along with 4 green seeded olives.  The olives were really good and luckily my buddy wasn&#39;t into olives which meant I got all four. I was in olive heaven.There was much to choose from on the menu. The apps, first plates, second plates and desserts all looked so good. We started out with a great bottle of red from Sicily. The wine was full bodied with hints of vanilla, chocolate and tobacco. I will tell you I did taste the tobacco but it worked with the sweetness flavor. I wish I remembered the name of the wine because I&#39;d love to order that again.When it came to me ordering the pasta I had a hard time. I was interested in the Rigatoni with house made sausage, peas &amp; a tomato cream sauce. I thought for sure I was going to get that until our waitress told me to order the fresh house made Pappardelle. These noodles are a large, broad, flat pasta noodle, similar to a wide fettuccine. The best part is that all of the pastas are made in house. The Pappardelle came with a Wild Boar Ragu that was simply amazing. This delicious sauce made me want to go home and start making my own version of it. Thanks chef for setting the bar too high even for me to achieve.My buddy who loves lobster ordered the house made ravioli di Aragosta E Granachio. He&#39;s an East coast guy, so he knows seafood. He mention his favorite place in Boston for lobster but was quick to recommend this place as his new favorite. Again I was looking like a super hero.As the evening rolled on we met Dario who is one of the owners. We spoke about Sicily and he even knew my Dads town in Sicily was famous for making chocolate.  It was great talking about food &amp; culture. Dario is what every restaurant owner should be. He&#39;s the face up front and he keeps all the customers happy. Dario treats everyone like family and that is simply the Italian way.For dessert we did a little table stalking and ordered exactly what our neighbors ordered.  We got the mifreddo al torroncino which is not on the menu but it should be. It had crushed up almonds &amp; hazelnut w/chocolate cake. We also ordered the Torta do Ricotta which is the best cheesecake u will ever have. We had 3 rounds of homemade cello...lemon, orange &amp; rhubarb(Mom&#39;s secret), then ended the night on the Espresso Martini.This was a perfect evening of old friends &amp; dinner. The owners, chef &amp; staff served with smiles &amp; I can hardly wait to come back. Thanks!"

I have not been to such a culinary experience and such wonderful people in the Midwest. Fresh pasta, wonderful wine. And you must try the doughnuts... yes, I said that, I hate them.... here, they surpassed the tiramisu...(only desert I eat). Make it out before the winter because the patio is perfect!"

We&#39;ve been to the other Italian restaurants in the neighborhood and while they were good we were never blown away so we decided to give Nando Milano a try since they are walking distance from my house. We were so impressed with the food and service that we came here for dinner two nights in a row! Between the two nights we tried 3 different appetizers, 5 entrees and 3 desserts! Every dish was more amazing than the last! I highly recommend trying the Polpette alla arrabbiata (meatball appetizer), Polipo e calamari alla siciliana (grilled octopus &amp; calamari), Spaghettoni Di Mare and my absolute favorite the Tagiatelle Con Gameroni (homemade spinach pasta with prawns in a light wine sauce)!"

My friend and I were also excited that we were able to score a patio seat on a lovely night.The food was very good. To start, we had share the 3 arancini.  They were delicious and pretty easy to share with 2. The prosciutto or the bolognese were my favorites - both rich and light at the same time. The spinach and marscarpone was good too but the meat ones definitely trumped it. We also ordered a wonderful (and reasonably priced) bottle of montepulciano d&#39;Abbruzzo.  It was nice and big and went well with our meal.The main sources were even better. I had the Ravioli Di Granchio, a crab ravioli with scallops in a lobster cream sauce.  Decadent and very tasty. You could taste that the pasta was fresh and handmade.  My friend ordered the gnocchi with gorgonzola in an aurora sauce (like a blend of tomato and cream). They were light and fluffy. There was a nice balance in the dish and the gorgonzola didn&#39;t overpower it. Conversation halted at this point as we devoured the food.Service was great. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the food and wine. He was attentive but not too pushy.  In true Italian style, no one rushed us out while we were finishing our wine even though it was after closing time. One of the owners sat next to us and was very friendly and approachable.Overall, it was a great experience and I am looking forward to coming back again. It was also pretty reasonably priced given what we ordered (about $55 per person with tip)."

The decor made it feel like an authentic Italian restaurant. My friend and I came in around 8:30pm on a Saturday night and were able to sit at the bar right away. It&#39;s dimmed lighting with candles at the table, while romantic I wouldn&#39;t call it ideal for a date night. It was loud and echoed and even sitting at the bar, I had a difficult time hearing my friend. However, I wouldn&#39;t make it a reason to deter you from the restaurant. The have an open kitchen as well so that could play into the loudness. With that being said, we didn&#39;t reek of food leaving the restaurant either. It terms of dressing code, I would go above casual, but not super formal.Food:HIGHLIGHTSPrice point- main course averaged $20Main course-Ravioli Di Granchio (crab ravioli with scallops and lobster cream sauce) and Tortelloni Di Ricotta in Salsa DI Noci (ravioli with ricotta cheese and spinach in a walnut sauce)Dessert-Semifreddo Al Chioccolat (special that wasn&#39;t on the menu)Wine- Pinot Noir and SauvignonDETAILI ordered the the Ravioli Di Granchio (crab ravioli with scallops and lobster cream sauce) and the pinot noir. Portion size was perfect, I was not overly full and finished the whole dish. I didn&#39;t taste much crab, but nonetheless still delicious especially the cream sauce. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s the best crab ravioli I&#39;ve had, but it was good. They only had one pinot noir, but it wasn&#39;t anything special, it was alright and I only ordered one glass. My friend ordered the Tortelloni Di Ricotta in Salsa DI Noci (ravioli with ricotta cheese and spinach in a walnut sauce) and sauvignon. It doesn&#39;t look like the square ravioli that we may be accustomed to, so don&#39;t be alarmed. This was also delicious. Although, the sauce kind of tasted like a pesto, but not an overpowering one, the walnuts may have balanced that out. She really enjoyed her wine and got two glasses. As for dessert, the semifreddo al chioccolat, AMAZING. Highly recommend. It was like a frozen white chocolate mousse with bits of something crunchy in it as well (not sure if there were wafers or chocolate bits) topped with milk chocolate. So good. I&#39;m salivating writing about it. It did take a bit of time for it to come out, I&#39;d say about 15-20 minutes.Service: It was alright, nothing spectacular. I&#39;m not sure if the host was the owner, but he seemed to really take pride in making sure everyone was having an enjoyable experience. It did take some time for us to put in an order though and I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s because we were sitting at the bar or not. But it was fine.I would go back."

I call it sweatpants food. Not because I eat so much of it, I can only wear sweatpants. Not because I wear sweatpants while eating it (except maybe when I&#39;m dining in). But because it makes me feel warm, cozy and comfortable. It was exactly what I craved on a blisteringly cold night.The manfriend ordered the gnocchi alla nonna and I ordered the cavatelli with shrimp and tomatoes in a pistachio cream sauce. Prior to our meals arriving we ate the bread that they I think they make in house. It was quite good. Both of us enjoyed our meals, but I liked his a bit more. The sauce was delicate and the gnocchi so light and airy. The flavors in mine are hard to describe, but the dish was rich; the saltiness of the shrimp helped balance it out. Overall, the food was well executed. Portions were adequate; if you&#39;re just there for a main dish, I don&#39;t see you leaving with leftovers.We arrived at Nando about 25 minutes before closing; it wasn&#39;t how we planned it, it just happened that way. The owner (?) let me know the kitchen closed soon when we arrived. I asked if it was ok if we dined and he said it was. That felt like a half truth because we were reminded at least 2 more times that the kitchen was closing at 9 sharp. When we placed our orders (entrees only, we weren&#39;t looking for a long, lingering meal), we were given the option of pre-ordering dessert, which we declined. When we got our meals, we were given a three minute warning on the kitchen closing and yet another chance to order dessert. Again, we declined. Everyone was polite, but it&#39;s hard not to feel like we were a big inconvenience on what appeared to be a slow night (only one other table in the place when we walked in). The only other knock was that the music was unnecessarily loud; until it was lowered, we couldn&#39;t even carry a conversation while we waited for our food. Aside from the feeling like we should make a quick exit, service was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly.Overall, I give the whole experience 3.5 stars. I&#39;d definitely try the place again and see if we can put that first awkward meal behind us."

To sum up what you can expect at Nando is cozy neighborhood spot where traditional Italian dishes are cooked to perfection!We had a Seafood Linguini and Fettuccine Bolognese, both dishes were flawless from the exquisite handmade noodles to sauces which makes you want to leak your plate. Excellent wine list and surprisingly large variety of desert options (loved Nutella Crepes!!!) completes a fabulous dining experience.However it would not be fair not to mention outstanding service and atmosphere at Nando. It&#39;s a cute place with a warm feel and they have a beautiful outside space (for the few warm Chicago nights we get to enjoy:)) The wait staff is friendly, attentive and very knowledgable of the menu.

The interior was dimly lit, rich woods, and intimate. It was sultry in the classiest sense of the word... and we crushed hard.I don&#39;t normally go for Italian food, but I saw Anthony M&#39;s review and pictures and planned an impromptu date for that same evening.I think the most important thing for you to know is that Nando Milano Trattoria is authentic Italian food served by Italians but different from a typical Italian American restaurant.Typical Italian American restaurants focus on generous portions of familiar dishes: spaghetti, ravioli, lasagna, etc. They have big personalities, big families, sloppy hugs and kisses, and comfortable atmospheres. Nando Milano Trattoria is the refined, tender, smaller brother from Italy. Perhaps a little perfectionist and a little creative... Nando Milano Trattoria is my favorite Italian restaurant to date.M loves it too. We still talk about how we must go back... How we MUST bring certain friends and family members there.After a delicious meal and at least two drinks each, the Italian owner came by and chatted with us. He was a charmer without being pushy. He gave us each some limoncello that was made from his family&#39;s recipe. It was a perfect way to end the evening."

Got seated promptly. This was our 2nd time, and what I enjoyed the most last time was the pasta. We ordered the lasagna, squid-ink pasta (kind of like a ravioli), pesto gnocchi, and the pasta with riccotta (closest to a fetticuine alfredo which was requested). BEST part is the pasta - home made, so yummy. Gnocchi has a great texture to it. My mother-in-law loved her lasagna and my brother-in-law who is a bit picky finished EVERY bite.Portion sizes are decent, not overly done, and of course the manager stopped by and was super friendly like last time.Why go to a place that doesn&#39;t have home-made pasta and basically pay the same amount?

You get a lot of &#34;I know what you will like&#34; to &#34;we can do anything&#34;...it&#39;s a bit uncomfortable. Eventually, you either let him order for you or you have to just be pushy back.The food is spectacular! We ordered the burrata and pappardelle with pork ragout.

I had cod for my main, which I had low expectations for since cod is not the most flavorful kind of fish, but it was surprisingly tasty. Several other people in our dinner party had lasagna bolognese, which some said was the best they&#39;ve had in the city. I skipped dessert and opted out for homemade limoncello, which  was delicious.The service: 5/5. The wait staff was very knowledgeable about the menu and their wine selection.Overall: 5/5.

Yes. I&#39;m cheesy like that. But it helps me find places like Nando so it works out.What is Nando not? Well if you think romantic is a dimly lit dinner place with good wine, great food, great service and quiet so you can hold a dinner conversation with your partner then this place will hit all your points except one. It&#39;s not quiet. In fact I had to use my outdoors voice a few times. (Full disclaimer: I didn&#39;t try the wine but the wine racks on the walls looked so quaint and classy that I imagine the wine they held were great :P).The food here is delicious. My gf wasn&#39;t very hungry which disappointed me slightly cause I wanted to over order due to the number of interesting options on the menu. :PBut instead we shared 2 appetizers, a main course (pasta) and a dessert.We started with the Polipo E Calamari Alla Siciliana. I&#39;ve order calamari at italian restaurants before but the presentation on this was so awesome. It&#39;s left mostly intact (tentacles separated) laying on a bed of couscous. Couscous isn&#39;t very exciting to me. In fact I am highly skeptical of anyone that gets excited by couscous. But the octopus and calamari was so fresh and perfectly cooked!Next up was Tris Di Arancini Di Riso. Ok there&#39;s very few times you can order crispy rice balls and be disappointed. So it might not be a culinary feat that these were delicious but I would definitely want these again. The contrast of the crunchy exterior and the warm, moist filling added to the experience.For the main we had the ink squid octopus agnolotti serve with mussels, clams and langoustine in imperial sauce. (Waitress recommendation) For those that don&#39;t know (and I didn&#39;t) agnolotti is like a ravioli. Apparently these are hand made and they are delicious. The sauce was a bit too acidic for me but (brace yourself this is pretty ingenious) I just knocked a bit of the sauce off before eating them. The shell fish surrounding the agnolotti was very well cooked and fresh.For desert we had the panna cotta. It wasn&#39;t too sweet and was very well made. A very good way to finish the meal.As for the service, the waitress was very nice and attentive and very friendly. The manager and even the chef walked around the table talking and making jokes with the patrons which I thought was a great touch of personalization.I definitely recommend this small cute neighborhood restaurant. I want to come back here when the weather&#39;s just a bit warmer and sit outside as they have a very charming setup there too."

It feels like a family owned type of restaurant which was nice. We were seated at what must be the worst table. We were at a two top right in the center of everything. Therefore, anytime a server, busser or diner went by, they would either knock into our arm or chair. It was uncomfortable.The server was nice, she took our drink order in a reasonable amount of time, but we waited about 20 minutes before our food order was taken. We had our menus down on the table as we watched her take the orders of tables that arrived after us, I guess I should have said something when the other manager/owner asked if we were being taken care of, but at the time I thought he meant did we have a server.  I finally caught her and asked if we could order and she said &#34;if you are ready.&#34;  Well, yes, we must be. Anyway, the food was delicious and that saved the experience. I could also tell that the other guests were having a nice time and many of them knew the managers/owners. I will request a different table next time.The food:  My husband had the cspeeds salad which was tasty and the ribeye with balsamic. The ribeye was very good, it was cooked perfectly and the balsamic gave it a hint of sweetness (I tried it, of course). For dessert he had the ricotta cheesecake, it was the best cheesecake I have ever had. I had the beet and pear carpaccio with duck prosciutto, it was pretty good but it was not thinly sliced pear and beet, they were huge slices with this one itty bitty strip of dick prosciutto for the whole pile of pear and beet. If it was more balanced, it would have been amazing. My main course was the wild boar with pappardelle, which was absolutely delicious. I want some more right now. For dessert, I had the mixed berry granita which was also very good.Overall, we had a nice time. If we had been at a different table, I may not have noticed how long we waited."

We had eaten here before and chose it for the quality of the food, and they definitely delivered again. Everyone loved the food.The reason I&#39;m not giving 5 stars is because the staff were a bit too pushy. We were already 10 people giving them a ton of business, and yet they kept trying to get us to order more antipasti, more wine, more everything. And not just a reasonable amount more, but like 3x what we would realistically ever consume.I&#39;ll definitely go back, but I recommend staying firm and not letting the staff take advantage of your good spirits."

Looking at the menu i was instantly struck at how high the prices were for both wine and food. Ordered my first glass of wine which was poured into small carafe then into my glass. Perhaps this was done for the effect, but to me it was a way to minimize the quantity (a bottle should provide not more than 4 glasses of wine). Tried a couple appetizers, the polenta and beef salad. They were both ok. Problem was the noise level. Music was very loud, which made the customers raise their voices making it impossible to have a conversation. Not a place I would return to quickly."

Overall I really liked this place. We sat  out on the patio at the front and it was a perfect night for it. It&#39;s also a really nice set-up.I think if I could, I would probably award it 3.5 stars - The appetizers and entrees were awesome! But the desserts were a real disappointment unfortunately:Buffalo Mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and parma ham (Special), OMG, so very very good. Really high quality ingredients in this one which is a must with such a simple dish.TRIS DI ARANCINI DI RISO (Trio of Arancini) this was also v delicious. If my husband had his way he would have had another portion of this!RIGATONI ALLA BEPPE - (Pasta w/ italian sausage and peas) - a nice solid dish. Big portion too so plenty to take home.Wild Boar Ragu (Special) another winner of a dish for the other half. This was rich and decadent.But the desserts.......hmmmm. I had the tiramisu which was bland and flavorless. I couldn&#39;t taste any coffee in it at all and the sponge element was dry. It was basically just a bowl of dry sponge and cream.My husband had the profiteroles which on the menu are described as &#39;Chocolate cream puff filled with vanilla cream&#39; (obviously) but when they came out were covered in cinnamon and had a cinnamon cream inside. Fine, if you describe it as such, but it really wasn&#39;t. I find chocolate and cinnamon to be a kind of strange combo TBHSo in summary, go here and eat the savory stuff but maybe avoid the desserts unless you are REALLY craving something sweet."

Everything genuinely tasted homemade and reminded me of my time living in Rome. My mother&#39;s side is Sicilian, so I can also appreciate that both the head waiter and chef were from Sicily, complete with thick accents and longer hair. It&#39;s hard to find an Italian restaurant you can trust is authentic, these days.They were very excited for our celebration and entertained us the entire evening with light banter and drinks.

Luckily all of the ingredients are very fresh so we weren&#39;t disappointed.The main course is where they hit it out of the park. We ordered the Bucatini and the Gnocchi. Oh my sweet lord. This homemade pasta was better than anything I had while studying in Italy. The gnocchi were like small pillows that just melted on your fork. All of the tastes complimented each other well and nothing was overbearing. The portions were just right to feel full but not stuffed.We also got a cannoli and a cappuccino, both perfectly made and the presentation was on point.Service was great. They speak Italian at the table which is fun and they were knowledgeable about everything on the menu.

What&#39;s great about restaurants in Italy is that the house wines are usually about €5 and totally drinkable. While we recognize that Wicker Park is not in Rome, we enjoyed our Prosecco, but the Chianti by the glass left a lot to be desired.We ate entirely off the specials menu. Everything was fresh and well-prepared. The portions were generous so I don&#39;t think we could have each managed an appetizer and two courses.

It is my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago. The staff (Dario, Alessio, etc) are so kind, charming, sweet, and funny. The food is out of this world and tastes like it&#39;s made with love. I absolutely LOVE coming to Nando Milano, especially in the summer and on Thursdays when it&#39;s ladies night and drinks are half off! The last time I was there, my friend and I went all out. We ordered oysters for our appetizer and they were delicious. Btw, my friend&#39;s name is Linda and she&#39;s the one that the Linda cocktail is named after :) We definitely got our drink on that night (hey they were half off!) Lots of bubbles all around. For our main dish, we enjoyed the gnocchi della nonna: house made gnocchi filled with gorgonzola cheese in an aurora sauce. I literally want to pour that sauce on someone and just lick it off. Sorry for that visual. It&#39;s just that good. After that, we were pretty stuffed. So we had some more cocktails (their Aperol spritzer is the ONLY way I&#39;ll drink Aperol). Then we ordered the bird&#39;s nest dessert. It&#39;s a delicious chocolate chocolate nest with gelato in the middle.Dario is like my favorite person. If you ever have a bad day and need to feel good about yourself, go to Nando. Dario is one hunk of an Italian man and he will make you feel like the most beautiful woman in the room, I must say. This place is just so charming and the food is delicious. Perfect for a date night, dessert, drinks, whatever! Just go."

Everything from the adorable Frank Sinatra playing throughout the restaurant to our slightly odd waiter with a thick, Italian accent who taught us how to pronounce the dishes we would be having. It was very obvious that everything here was handmade. The bread brought to us as a starter could have easily been made into a meal. Although the calories and my guilt would have destroyed me in an instant.We started with the Tris Di Arancini Di Riso. Each of the rice saffron balls were better than the next although the butter and prosciutto was my favorite. This was followed by the carpaccio di manzo. I&#39;ve had some capaccio that was not so good, this was not one of those times. The presentation was even better. And fresh raspberries to go along with this salad topped everything off.We decided to split one of pasta dishes and chose the Ghnocchi Di Patate Alla Sorrentina in a tomato pesto sauce. Once again, very obvious that the pasta was handmade. Yum.We we&#39;re easily talked into two desserts - the canoli and the panna cotta. While I am a huge fan of canolis and am a harsh judge on the makings of these, this was very good. However, I highly suggest the panna cotta. It is presented with a berry reduction sauce that makes it completely irresistible. We also had limoncello with our dessert that topped the meal off nicely.Will definitely be coming back and indulging in many more calories."

The warm fresh bread served in rustic paper bags that features in many Yelp pictures was no where to be seen. We even asked our waiter and he said they don&#39;t serve warm bread. We actually thought maybe we  had confused our Yelp reviews....alas no, it simply seems warm bread no longer makes an appearance here. We were still hopefull of a fantastic meal, but that hope quickly faded with our antipasti orders of crispy polenta with mushrooms and polpo (Octopus) carpaccio served with arugula and fennel. While the restaurant was indeed darkened wth only an atmospheric glow for light it certainly wasn&#39;t the lack of lighting that prevented us from barely being able to find the polpo within the underwhelming and tasteless bed of arugula. The polenta with mushrooms certainly offered taste compared to the polpo it tasted so salty that it was nearly inedible.....and for me to say something is &#34;salty&#34; is quite something as I&#39;m typically quite liberal in my use of salt. Our primi piatti of pasta dishes took nearly an hour to arrive and while not disasters, the best I can offer up is that they were just alright. Very mediocre. Nothing special or standout. After the so far mediocre experience we decided to forgo a secondi piatti and instead try out the &#34;tiramisu&#34;. I&#39;m writing &#34;tiramisu&#34; because what we had was a poor imitation full of whipped heavy cream and seriously lacking in both masacarpone and alcohol. It had almost a sickly sweet taste to it rather than the balanced sweet mascarpone-espresso-alcohol flavor experience you would expect of a quality tiramisu. Real tiramisu is made with quality mascarpone not cheap air whipped heavy cream. Forno Rosso in the West Loop.....they get it. This place...not so much."

We were promptly greeted at the door and upon learning that we were new the the area, the staff made us feel right at home. The atmosphere is very cozy and intimate and the food was absolutely delicious! We started with the Arancini. Our favorite was the one with the bolognese ragout. My husband had the maltagliati, which he enjoyed, and I had the Gnocchi Della Nonna. I would definitely recommend this dish. I usually get gnocchi when I go to an Italian restaurant and Nando&#39;s has some of the best I&#39;ve eaten! They were so light and the sauce was great. At the end of our meal, the waiter came by with some limoncello to welcome us to the neighborhood. We look forward to coming back and trying the rest of the menu!"

If you are Italian and speak Italian, you are treated like royalty; if not, you are tolerated.  I love Italy and have been there many times.  I have always been treated well at restaurants in Italy, unlike here. The food was fine, but given the lack of complexity, it was over-priced.  The waiter made a production of offering a free desert for  my mother&#39;s birthday and then charged us for it. We just took it out of his tip. There are too many similar or better Italian restaurants to bother with this place, which is pretty full of itself. It is next to a dumpy pawn shop on Division."

From the antipasti to the very poor dessert they call tiramisu, this restaurant does not do justice to Italian cuisine.The CARPACCIO DI POLPO was way bland and had no taste to it whatsoever. Barely edible.  The POLENTA GHIOTTA was way too salty and was expecting more when ordering polenta from an Italian restaurant.I ordered the MALTAGLIATI &#34;SAN MARCO&#34; as my main and although it too was very salty, it was mediocre at best... Portion was not that great. They did not even have freshly grated Parmesan to offer!I will spare you the details of the tiramisu as once again was expecting to have a real Italian dessert and not whipped cream on top of some lady fingers. Someone forgot to mention to them that tiramisu should contain mascarpone!The best thing about this restaurant was the bread. Plain and simple a very bad choice to spend a Friday night dinner."

Been here a few times and each time the place seems to get smaller. When we were being seated, we had to squeeze through and bump into almost every table just to sit down.The servers really know their stuff. If you see any of them, they are happy to help, if you&#39;re at the bar, they will all greet you, or suggest something great from the specials everytime.The food, is amazing, the chef definitely knows what he is doing, and it&#39;s nice to see him at the end of the night, come out of the kitchen with his broken English and ask how was the meal. You can tell he really cares. But sometimes you can tell they are trying to push some expensive wine that we will down in two glasses each and they start so high they make you feel like a cheap ass if you don&#39;t order a $100 bottle. (By the way, cheapest bottle is about $40, which is what we ordered, whole meal for two, about $120). Also, you&#39;re more likely to have a better experience if you&#39;re outside on the patio or sat in the front of the restaurant. If you&#39;re unfortunate enough to have to wait for the restroom or sit near the kitchen, it&#39;s hectic and you can hear the managers yelling and badgering their employees, awkward...Overall, food is good, if you want a true Italian experience, wine to foccacia, and creative twists on traditional Italian cuisine this place is for you. I&#39;ll be back, but only for the food, maybe take out next time."

Went last week on Thursday (July 9th) for my mother&#39;s birthday. I made my mother her favorite cake. We were going to cut the cake at her house and wish her a happy birthday, but the server offered to cut the cake for us. We thought cutting the cake at the restaurant would also be nice, so we agreed. However, the server failed to mention a fee, in which he later stated that he didn&#39;t know the restaurant charged for cutting a cake brought by a customer. When the bill arrived, they charged my mother $30 for cutting the cake, and they were not being flexible. They demanded that she paid the $30 for the service provided. The manager on duty knew of the situation, but didn&#39;t bother to explain or apologize for the hidden fee.I have never heard of this. It&#39;s as if my mother bought the homemade cake, i made for her, from Nandos.Many other restaurants, on the contrary, provide a birthday pastry for the person. Never have I heard of a fee to cut a dessert that was brought by a paying customer. Ridiculous.The food was great, but the service was far from what I expected."

The meats are wondrously marinated. The sashimi-bap is a bowl of fresh fish and vegetables that is priced at only $12!!!! I&#39;m not sure how they are offering such amazing prices for such wonderful, fresh, and high-quality food!This is also a family-run business, and I just love their story. A friend of mine recently asked in Korean what &#34;En Hakkore&#34; means, and we were told that it&#39;s a biblical location where Sampson was refreshed by a well-spring from the ground, and they wanted their restaurant to be a source of refreshment and strength for their customers!!

We&#39;ve been to En Hakkore about 10 times and have recommended it to countless people.The two of us always share a Korean BBQ beef bi bim bop and an order (2) of pratha tacos with spicy pork. It&#39;s the perfect amount of food for two hungry people and it&#39;s super reasonably priced. (Less than $25 for dinner for two in Chicago? Hell yeah.)The Bi Bim Bop is so flavorful (always go spicy) and fresh. I love the balance of intense flavor and fresh veggies! The tacos are great, but honestly it&#39;s all about the bread they are served on. If I could eat one thing forge rest of my life, it would be that bread....Eating it is fun because the Bi Bim is served in a giant bowl and the dining space is (small but) cute. We often take it to go, which is also delightful. It&#39;s right across from a park, so we aim to order it to go before a movie in the park and make a picnic of it!!!!"

I knew the food would be amazing just by looking at all of the pictures that other people have posted. I can now say that the food lived up to my expectations.My friends and I shared the black rice (!!!) sashimi bibimbap and the tofu paratha taco (a seasonal special). The bibimbap was served in a beautiful black bowl that helped accentuate all of the vivid colors of the vegetables and sashimi, making for a wonderful photo. Adding the black rice cost a bit extra, but I think it is definitely worth it since it was so delicious. Also, black rice is a healthy alternative to the traditional white sushi rice. A normal order of bibimbap would leave me feeling bloated and weighed down, but the sashimi bibimbap was so fresh and it left me feeling fantastic.In addition, the paratha tacos were amazing! The chewy, buttery paratha shells were by far the best part. I thought the tofu filling was actually pretty tasty. I tried some of my friend&#39;s pork taco, but it was too oily for my taste. The tofu was just perfect!I&#39;m so glad that I stopped by this place for dinner. I will most definitely be back soon to probably eat the amazing sashimi bibimbap and paratha tacos again.

It was our first visit and we each ordered 2 Paratho tacos (kimchi, onion, mushroom, cilantro, lettuce, pickled radish, enhakkore sauce, spicy pork or korean b.b.q beef). For $7.50 you get two generous sized tacos, much larger than Del Seoul (which is another favorite of ours).Between the beef and pork, the pork was our favorite and had a great spice to it even before adding the red pepper paste sauce. Our friends ordered the Bibimbap but this Yelper was fortunate to marry a lovely woman who can create some amazing Korean dishes including Bibimbap ($12) and Japchae noodles ($5 for a tiny, tiny, tiny bowl). Therefore, I can&#39;t bring myself to order/pay for traditional Korean dishes anymore. However from all the reviews and the first person witness of the dish, both the Bibimbap and Japcae looked authentic and was very large portions.I don&#39;t give 5 stars often but I was really surprised how much I enjoyed the flavors at En Hakkore. I thought the tacos would come in a regular flour tortilla like it does at Del Seoul but instead it arrived in a DELICIOUS naan style bread which was really, really good.  After dinner we walked next door to Miko&#39;s Italian Shaved Ice which is becoming my favorite place for shaved ice. The Damen entrance to the 606 trail is seconds away from En Hakkore so if you want to do a nice stroll/run before or after dinner, you can&#39;t ask for a better location.I will be back again but not on Sunday&#39;s because they are closed."

The goofy décor and the small menu add a unique character to the restaurant. I&#39;ve never had a bad experience and frequent it very often. The family that runs the restaurant is very kind and friendly and remember their regulars. The food is incredible. The bibimbap is not truly traditional, but instead a much lighter- salad type dish. The portions of each ingredient are perfectly balanced and the result is a delicious re-thinking of the traditional bibimbap. It is very filing- but you don&#39;t feel bad about yourself when you&#39;re done.I am an even bigger fan of their tacos. The tortilla they make is unbelievable. It&#39;s thick and buttery and tastes a bit like baked filo dough. Both the pork and beef are perfectly prepared and the spicing is unreal. This food should easily cost between 10 and 15 but I always make it out of there spending a total of under 10. En Hakkore is a special spot."

This was VERY tasty!!!Paratha tacos - WOW...definitely coming back for these!!! You get two in an order and can pick between beef, spicy pork, or tofu. I had a pork and a beef and both were sooooo tasty! The flavors are wonderful and definitely a taste that I would crave and return for!The parathas are large and I couldn&#39;t finish my two tacos. I guess it&#39;s also because we ordered two appetizers! I think the items are priced well! The ambiance is awesome! Such a cute place with great things on the wall as conversation pieces!Parking is difficult in this area, but be patient because this place is worth it! I can&#39;t wait to go back!!!"

The decor is really cute with a selection of pastel plates and antique / wood pieces.I typically order the beef bimbim bap which is loaded with fresh veggies and comes in a huge bowl when you dine in. You can also opt to have the bowl come with purple rice (so special!). Two other favorites are the paratha tacos (2) and the jap chae noodles. The tacos have the best pancake wrap on the outside - reminds me of the Chinese onion pancakes. Best served hot!I&#39;ve come to this restaurant for dine in and take out several times the past few months and their food is always consistently delicious.Note They are not open on Sunday&#39;s - I&#39;ve walked by a couple times only to be disappointed it was not open!

Vibrant colors and big portions!You know it&#39;s good when a Korean restaurant is owned by a Korean - try it out!I wish they would give the option of extra sea same oil and a fried egg instead of boiled but other than that - no complaints here :)

When it falls somewhere in the middle, things get a bit tricky. I procrastinate in writing the review because there isn&#39;t anything outstanding to write on either side of the spectrum. Oh hi, hello, En Hakkore.What I like most about En Hakkore is it&#39;s the most casual Korean food spot I&#39;ve ever been to. I wouldn&#39;t feel weird if I went alone or just dipped in casually to order some bibimbap or sashimibap. And in those solo situations, I could see myself coming again. All of the ingredients at En Hakkore are fresh, portions are small (compared to other K-spots), prices are competitive (maybe even a buck or two cheaper), great service and very chill atmosphere.Edumacation time - Bi Bim Bap is a traditional dish that is always a conglomerate of ingredients, mostly veggies, over rice. Bi Bim means &#39;mixed&#39; in Korean and Bap means &#39;rice&#39;. You can get bi bim bap sans meat so it&#39;s a great option for vegetarians, but normally there is meat (usually beef) and egg in it. It&#39;s served in a beautiful display of all the ingredients neatly divided into colorful sections...but before eating it you mix it up into a hot mess of food elements and usually mix in a bit of hot sauce.I&#39;ve had the bulgoki bi bim bap at En Hakkore and liked the dish but sadly it wasn&#39;t near the best Bi Bim Bap I&#39;ve had. And sadly, the bulgoki marinate wasn&#39;t mouth watering. Bulgoki is one of my favorite foods...I grew up eating it and am a strange gal that prefers it to kalbi. In my book, this bulgoki didn&#39;t knock it out of the park. I did enjoy their interesting take on mandoo (steamed dumplings). These were by no means the traditional version of mandoo but the En Hakkore way is unique and tasty, I&#39;d definitely get them again.En Hakkore is near my &#39;hood so I can definitely see myself popping in again when I need my Korean fix on the go!"

The food is not traditional Korean so if you&#39;re looking for some authentic stone pot bibimbap go elsewhere. Their menu is small, consisting of mainly their version of bibimbap and tacos. I tried the bibimbap with black rice (there&#39;s also choice of white or brown). Their serving bowl is humongous, like a black space saucer. The presentation is beautifully eye catching, with all the colorful vegetables arranged neatly around the rice and protein. Mix everything together and you have something reminiscent of a fresh salad, with lots of crunchy veggies and a hard boiled egg. The spicy pork has quite a kick so I would suggest not prematurely adding more of their spicy sauce. Overall, really cool concept and place delivering delicious food. Check them out!"

The menu is small and focuses on bap style bowls over rice and veggies plus some other fun options like paratha tacos, dumplings, etc.I wouldn&#39;t call this super authentic Korean but it&#39;s definitely a nice blended vibe of Korean cuisine and a modern western influence. I went with the sashimi bap which was every bit as delicious as all the other yelpers have raved. A fresh sashimi medley on top of your choice of rice (I went with black rice) and tons of salad fresh veggies. My friend went with the bulgogi beef bap which was similar and also excellent. Both servings were huge and you will easily leave full or with leftovers (or both). They gave us a delicious kimchi base style spicy sauce to douse our bowls with. Service is quick and friendly. Prices are very good for the quality and quantity you&#39;re getting. Location is right in the heart of Bucktown along the Damen strip. I will be back many times until I&#39;ve tried everything on the menu.My only complaint is that they serve a hard boiled egg with the bibimbap bowls. Half the fun of bibimbap is the runny yolk that you get to break and soak your rice in. I assume the hard boiled egg helps them keep costs down and service quick (you can make them ahead of time and they will keep for a few days) but come on. Give a girl some runny yolk!"

There&#39;s not much to the menu besides bibimbap, tacos, and some appetizers and a special or two, but what is available is done extremely well.Presentation, taste, quantity, quality of ingredients, interior decor, price, etc. all come together in a very simple, straightforward Korean fusion restaurant that crosses Korean fare with Japanese, Mexican, and Indian. I&#39;m not a big fan of fusion, but when it&#39;s done right with proper thought and attention is paid to taste, this can be a great crossing of paths.I highly suggest trying the sashimi bibimbap. It&#39;s a nice cross between a traditional Korean bibimbap and a Japanese chirashi bowl. It still has rice, but instead of beef, you get freshly cut sashimi (NOT FISHY) as the &#34;meat.&#34; The veggies are also finely cut and adds a nice mix of texture across all the ingredients in the bowl. The rice wasn&#39;t quite as sticky and cooked to what I eat all the time in my household, but it&#39;s not a big deal. Just a little quibble on an otherwise fantastic dish.You must absolutely try the paratha tacos. At first I thought these were like the tacos at Del Seoul, but there&#39;s a little twist in using paratha bread (i.e., Indian flatbread) to hold all the toppings. Cool beans! Both the pork and beef options are tasty and do well with the paratha bread. $7 is a tad high for two tacos, but again, just a minor quibble on what was a rather fantastic meal.En Hakkore is a must for anyone that can appreciate Korean fusion, but don&#39;t go expecting an endless menu of items to pick from. They do a few things here, but they do it right."

The menu is small, but given that everything on it amazing it doesn&#39;t really matter. The restaurant is small though, so it&#39;s best for couples or groups less than 4, and it&#39;s seat yourself. Honestly, there&#39;s nothing on the menu that I wouldn&#39;t recommend, but you definitely have to try the Korean Tacos (get one pork and and one beef!).Service: They are polite and serve you food. As a seat yourself place there isn&#39;t much interaction with the staff, but they have always been polite.Atmosphere: Probably seats about 20 people. Expect to be close to others, but it makes for a fun busy atmosphere. Very clean and minimal design.Food: GET THE TACOS! They are the star of the show here. Two tacos is a pretty hefty potion and while it&#39;s a good meal for one they could easily be split. I recommend trying both the beef and pork to see which one you like better (I have a slight preference for the spicy pork). That being said, I highly recommend everything on the menu. The noodles and dumpling appetizers they had were delicious too and everything was a good portion.Will be back and would go more often if it was easier to access by public transport."

Which means the rice doesn&#39;t get crispy/charred which I personally like a lot.   You can choose from vegetarian or two meat versions.The tacos are also tasty but to be honest... I like the ones you get in Los Angeles (kogi) more because of the slaw which the ones here don&#39;t have.All in all a fine little eatery and if I wasn&#39;t from SoCal this would be 4* easy.

The sashimi bap was clean, fresh tasting. You can taste the sashimi in the bowl pretty well, but I wish there was a little more sashimi in comparison to all the veggies. Felt like I was eating more of a salad than sashimi with veggies over rice. It was good, but not the best that I&#39;ve had. Great price for it though ($12). I&#39;d say the only thing missing for me here was having a craving for meat after. Sashimi and fresh veggies didn&#39;t totally hit the spot by itself. The bibimbap and sashimi bap here don&#39;t come in stone bowls, just one part that I felt was missing.The paratha tacos were great and I&#39;d come back to eat this again. A friend described the taco skin to us as a Chinese green onion pancake texture that was a bit buttery. After taking a bite of the tacos (got a spicy pork and a beef one), I think he was spot on. The taco tortilla was very authentic. Never had tacos with this type of tortilla before. Definitely similar to the oily green onion fried pancake texture with a little added buttery taste to it. The tacos weren&#39;t tiny, but maybe just two tacos isn&#39;t completely filling for those who eat a lot."

I will say the quality of fish was outstanding, but that&#39;s where is stopped. my husband found himself layering the dish with tons of their house made sauce (also good) but you shouldn&#39;t have to smother something in a whole container of sauce just to eat it. Perhaps, I&#39;m biased- we came from the bay area where the korean food was a plenty and always so delicious.the thing that annoyed us the most was that we got called out for leaving our plates on the table. as soon as we did, we immediately asked where the trash can is, in utter embarrassment. We are not those kind of people--- we throw our stuff out, but after seeing the only one trash can that deliberately said &#34;do not throw food in trash can&#34;, we gave up. If you want people to throw your plates out---make a sign and put it somewhere noticeable.

I watched as he tended to SUBSEQUENT CUSTOMERS, and realized he actually treated them with polite words, eye contact and body language that he hadn&#39;t me. He also didn&#39;t TOSS THE RECEIPT at them.Even when my order was ready, while there were no others waiting, he all too loudly yelled my order out making no eye contact,  KNOWING I was 2 ft. away in the small space that makes up the restautant.

Also, the vegetables on the side tasted really fresh. As for the paratha/taco, the spicy pork was seasoned perfectly. I am not quite sure if the paratha was made fresh; it reminded me of the frozen paratha&#39;s that you can buy from any Indian grocery store.

It&#39;s brilliant and a perfect combination to offset the bursting flavors that come from the meat and veggies.

I still crave the tacos every day. Both pork and beef are great; although I think I like the beef slightly more. Full of flavor and the taco bread they use is out of the world!Wasn&#39;t as in love with the bipimbap. I got the sashimi one. they were upstaged by the tacos for sure, but still not bad."

The sashimi bi bim bap reminds me a lot of poke bowls (without the seasoning on the fish, though), which was a pleasant surprise. I pretended like I was eating healthy as I scarfed down an entire bowl (hey, it&#39;s mostly veggies!).They have a ton of fun soda options, including ginger beer.1/2 star docked for the long food wait (about a half-hour), although I think this was mostly due to a high volume of call-in orders.If you&#39;re looking for a cheap, somewhat healthy option in Wicker Park, this is the place to go. Hell, if you&#39;re looking for tasty food filled with veggies, make sure to stop here."

En Hakkore makes a bold upgrade to Parathas.  A delightful, fluffy yet firm, wrap that handles the sauteed meat with confidence.  It brings the experience to another level.  It&#39;s like a free ride in a Benz Limo to the airport instead of a nappy cab.- Solid #2 - Sashimi Bap. A staple when looking to eat moderately healthy and stay away from any fried/massive carb categories.  Yes there is rice, but you can select brown or black which should help lessen the blow to your gut.  The sashimi is a fair portion for the $12-$13 you pay, but the real bonus is the vegetable variety.  They don&#39;t skimp.- Solid #3 - Anything Pork on the Menu.  The pork is marinated with a sweet and spicy tang to it that runs the show.Put it on a parathas.Put it on rice.Put it down on me, put it down on me.My only criticism is they try a little too hard with the rice presentations in the wide-ass and shallow bowl.Riddle me this? When does a bowl become too shallow that it becomes a plate?The identity crisis of the bowl-plate makes it a little difficult to eat the rice dishes or to mix all the componenets of the dish (which is done traditionally with bibimbap... I mean &#34;bibim&#34; means &#34;mixed&#34;)Also, the skinny, stumpy wood spoon is not helping...But besides the dish faux pas, the food itself is definitely worth it.They could give it to me on a burlap sack and I&#39;d still come back.Don&#39;t get any cute ideas En Hakkore..."

My friend ordered the veggie bibimbap, and it came in a HUGE bowl, which she quickly downed because of the flavor. She used the hot sauce on the table, which was a huge hit. I got the paratha tacos, one Korean BBQ beef and one spicy pork, and I was blown away. The tacos are huge so you get full after two, and they were so flavorful I probably could have eaten three more. The prices are very reasonable as well."

Now you&#39;ve got chefs from San Francisco&#39;s A16 bringing southern Italian cuisine, Neapolitan pizzas and those insane meatballs right to the neighborhood?! Remind me please why I do not live here?These storied meatballs are worth the visit alone! We came here early on Saturday night before the world famous Cubs game. The atmosphere is so upscale, you sort of expect Sophia Lauren herself to come around the corner. In addition to the meatballs, we had the antipasti, a margherita bufalo pizza and two handcrafted pastas. We finished with the coconut gelato and a seasonal apple crostata that was out-of-this-world. It was so good, we ended up ordering a second one. Hey now, don&#39;t judge - there were six of us! We all enjoyed every single bite.Everything was so deliciously authentic, perfectly prepared and presented.

This was followed by the Pizza Margarita, also very good. We split he Pork Chop which was one of the better cuts I have ever had and an appetizer portion of the Trombette Trapanese, fennel sausage, tomato, almond, garlic, basil, caciocavallo, (yes I copied this from the menu), it was excellent.I also liked the decor and especially the fact they have sound absorption material on the walls and ceiling so you can actually have a conversation.

By time I&#39;d finished, the reservation was up &amp; we were seated.I got the half portion of Bucatini Pomodoro with Mortadella &amp; Prosciutto Meatballs and paired with the Rocca dei Mori. The half portion was a great size to pair with the meatballs, and the two dishes went well together, and came recommended by the waiter, along with a few popular pizzas and the swordfish.

The restaurant has an open layout and has an expensive rustic looking vibe. The one thing I will say is I felt a bit under dressed. I went in jeans, a t-shirt and converse. You wanna dress it up kids, more of a collared shirt kind of place. I even joked with the waiter about it but he said the dress code is causal.Anyway, we ordered the arancini for an appetizer, the prosciutto cotto and paccheri genovese for dinner and had the chocolate hazelnut budino for dessert.

While it was tasty, was lukewarm.Onto the pasta we had the Trombette Trapanese. We split the small dish which was a perfect portion for us. The pasta had a lovely texture, fennel sausage was great, and the textures really went well together. It was fresh and well done.Finally we got to the main event, the Funghi Pizza, which is mostly smoke and mushroom. I really enjoyed the flavor - it was exciting and different compared to a lot of other specialty pizza places in the area.For desert, the Chocolate Hazelnut Budino tickled my fancy as a wonderful harmony of caramel balls, crumbly biscotti and heavenly chocolate - a perfect desert we took to go in order to drink through the horrendous presidential debate going on that evening.There were some flaws here and there, but this was a nice experience. Will I choose it again anytime soon? Probably not so much, but I did appreciate what they were going for and would go back."

Got an Old Fashioned and was very satisfied by the drink.The menu isn&#39;t as broad as certain other Italian restaurants, but the food items are quite good. The highlight of the meal was the Diavola pizza. It was great and the rest of the pizzas are likely also just as good given the wood-fired oven. We also got the Squid Ink Garganelli which was very good. It was slightly salty but as someone allergic to shellfish, I was very happy the squid ink pasta wasn&#39;t accompanied by shellfish which is so often the case.Overall, I&#39;d return but the prices are a touch high in my opinion, so I wouldn&#39;t make dinner here a regular occurrence."

It was very refreshing to learn that the chefs associated with Coda Di Volpe are well known for their previous endeavours.I made a reservation this afternoon for later tonight, and we were seated right on time. If I had any gripes about this evening, it was that it took a few minutes before we were noticed and attended to. Nothing to remove stars over. We started with drinks and aracini. My wine was delicious, but I felt I wasn&#39;t served enough for the price I paid. I got less than half a glass.The aracini: absolutely delicious.We moved onto the funghi pizza and sweet corn ravioli. Both dishes were on point and my girlfriend and I enjoy both. At one point I made the mistake of thinking the pizza was slightly undercooked, and the staff immediately offered to replace the pizza with another one. Recognizing my mistake I apologized profusely and said it would not be necessary. Im including this detail to point out their excellent service and attentiveness to our table once we were seated.I enjoyed the arancini so much I asked our waiter, Austin, to surprise me with another option from their fritti. He brought out the zucchini blossoms which were to die for. To be honest, I could have a whole meal of nothing but their delicious fritti options.We ended the meal with the Budino. A delicious blend of chocolate, caramel, and some other deliciousness that I forget.All in all, Coda Di Volpe is a very, very welcome addition to the Southport Corridor. It is an excellent alternative to all of the boring and mediocre sports bars in the vicinity and I will definitely be stopping by regularly.My only other complaint is that I did not feel that the full portion of sweet corn ravioli was worth a whopping $24. It was good, but not $24 good.Coda Di Volpe, you have to try it!"

Tons of outdoor seats that were filled for most of this Summer.Unfortunately, the food and service underwhelmed. Our waiter was baffled with wine recommendations and had to keep returning to ask his manager about our inquiries. The food portions were miniscule for the price, and we left hungry. I had the larger portion of the Squid Ink Garganelli and it lacked quite a bit of taste. I also can&#39;t imagine what the smaller $12 portion was like because mine was light.

We ate outside and the drinks were so refreshing. We then split the Proscuitto Cotto pizza which was very good.

The pizza comes uncut but the scissors they gave us to cut the pizza worked really well.Everything was going so well we decided to get dessert. we ordered the Blueberry Peach Crostata with a side of vanilla bean gelato and it was excellent.

We started with the grilled octopus which was grilled perfectly as the octopus was very tender, but it tasted a little fishy. The appetizer dishes are very small. In their defense, that&#39;s why they call them appetizers. Ordered the squash blossoms. Very greasy. When I took a bite, the oil was oozing all over my mouth. Archini (sp?), were smaller than a golf ball and unremarkable. We also ordered a small serving of Bucatini Pomodora.

It came out of the kitchen really fast, so I assume the meatballs were pre-made and maybe had been sitting a while.  Not to worry though, this sauce will rock your taste buds.We shared the Quattro Formaggi pizza.  Seriously, their wood burning pizza oven must be magic.  It was outstanding.  The dough is so fresh and delicious.  As was the arugula on top of this pizza.We also shared the Trombette Trapanese pasta.  Oh boy, was it yummy.  I&#39;m a sauce person, and I feel like it needed more sauce and maybe a sprinkle of course sea salt over the top.  And there really wasn&#39;t much sausage in it, which is odd since it&#39;s marketed as a fennel sausage pasta dish.  But overall, it was truly delicious.The service was fantastic.  We had several people taking care of us, our water glasses never got half-empty, and we were not rushed in the least.  Even the chef came by to see how we were enjoying our meal.  I have advised him to start selling that meatball sauce by the jar. Or the gallon. Or however they will give it to me.It is a tad loud in the restaurant, but the décor is really great.  There is a bar area as well, and I think I&#39;ll go back for drinks with friends.  And I&#39;ll see if they will serve me bread and meatball sauce on the side.Go here y&#39;all."

Brie blue cheese and Parmesan type of cheeses (I forget the exact names)  paired with almonds grapes fig preserve and some sort of lychee fruit. Delicious! My date had the Spaghetti alla Chitarra (Clam) and I had the Squid Ink Garganelli. Both were fresh and wonderful. They have a impressive wine list split by region of Italy! For desert we split a citrus passionfruit creation (cant remember the Italian pronunciation). It was one of the best things I have ever tasted. Im glad my friend works there because I will be a regular!

Service was mediocre at best and the food was about the same. I&#39;m apt to forgive one or the other, but it&#39;s hard to take a failure on both ends. Especially for what they&#39;re asking on the bill.We asked the waiter to explain to us how the menu works. Like how much to order, how big are the shared plates...you know basic questions. The waiter basically just read us the menu again and didn&#39;t explain anything. The only useful comment was that the pizzas are sized like appetizers.They have a wood fire oven which I supposed we should have stuck with. The only thing we got that was any good was the wood-fired octopus. Tender, well-seasoned and beautifully charred.Everything else was under-seasoned. Pasta was overcooked and bland. We tried 3 of the 5 pasta&#39;s between the 4 of us (small service sizes) and the gnocchi was the least overcooked, but still a bit too soft.This place could have been the first legit high-end place to hit Southport Ave in a while. For the price, this place definitely did not deliver.I may give them another shot down the road. The bar looks cool and the ambiance was nice. I mean you don&#39;t really go to an Italian place for the cocktails but they had a few that I was not able to try. There are so many great Italian restaurants in Chicago that it was a shame to see this place fail so miserably at meeting that standard.I hope it was just an off night. Maybe try the pizza and skip the pasta. They said it was house made but when it&#39;s been cooked to mush, it might as well have been boxed.And where were the managers?! You&#39;ve been open for 3 months. You should be at every table checking in on things to make sure everything is perfect. Even when we went looking for a manager to explain our comments, we couldn&#39;t find one. Didn&#39;t even bother looking at a dessert menu...For the price this place wants to charge, it should have been a lot better. I hope things improve before long. This could have been a real departure for the street of Southport, but instead it&#39;s just more of the same mediocre, overpriced food we tend to see on this street. If you&#39;re on Southport Ave for dinner, skip this place and head to Sushi Mura or Coal-Fire for better food at a a better price."

The service was great, and the food and cocktails made their way to our table in a very timely fashion.While the Arancini and the Margherita Di bufala pizza were both delicious and tasted very fresh, I think our favorite was the Spaghetti alla Chittara.The cocktails and desserts we tried were all great as well.We had a great experience, and are excited to have this spot in our neighborhood!"

Not a single complaint there!The food was great as well with a couple of things that you&#39;re going to have anytime a kitchen is brand new. I got the pork chop and it was one of the best cuts I&#39;ve had. The entree lacked a carb which was weird. My date got the braised beef cheek pasta which was good, but it had clearly been sitting in th window for a bit waiting on my meal. Just a kink that they will work out with time.A couple of suggestions - the tables need to have bread. An upscale Italian place without stunning bread is very odd. The appetizers didn&#39;t stand out very much and stood out even less considering there was no bread to eat them with. The entrees tending to be lacking a carb or a green element. I felt like I had to choose which one I would rather have and that was a little off putting.I think this place is going to just take off and be our go-to date spot once the kinks get worked out! Highly impressed with our first visit."

My friend and I shared the arrancini (fried risotto balls), the wood grilled octopus, the fried zucchini and the funghi pizza. I had a hard cider and she had a beer, both which were the cheaper side of the alcohol choices and the bill was only $75. Plenty to split between 2 semi hungry people- the portions were not obnoxiously small but were also super high quality.Would definitely come back, sounds like I need to try the bread and meatballs!"

The Baby Arugula Salad and Wood Roasted Carrots were extremely fresh and delivered superior taste.Dessert was on point too; make sure to order the Sicilian Cassata or the Chocolate Hazelnut Budino.

I have been waiting to try this place since I read about it in the Southport news. I believe the owners are responsible for Crosbys Kitchen as well so I knew I would be in for something good!Great ambiance though it&#39;s a little loud on the inside. I&#39;d say dress casual but on the nicer side- as other reviewers said it is possible to feel under dressed here, unlike many of the other restaurants on Southport. Service was on point! Attentive but we didn&#39;t feel rushed. We each had a glass of wine, split a cheese plate and pizza and made it out for $50 total before tip.. Not bad! We got the sweet corn pancetta pizza which I&#39;d definitely recommend. I was split between the pasta and pizza and our waiter advised pizza was their specialty so we went with that and it did not disappoint. Food was really great and not a bad price point for the neighborhood although this may be a &#39;special occasion&#39; place for me. You could easily make a dinner here $50 a person if you ordered differently.  Regardless, I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

We also had the arugula salad that was very good. Not knock-your-socks-off  but good. I liked the add of the crunch of the almonds.  We also got the margherita pizza, which I rarely get because it&#39;s usually boring, but one of us in the party really wanted it.  We all thought it was really good and I didn&#39;t find it boring at all.  I like that they serve it with a scissors for you to cut your own size pieces.  Not only unique but also makes sense.   Overall, very good food and a bustling place.  Wish server was less annoyed by us, and we were not demanding at all. 2 glasses of wine, 1 bottle of wine and 3 dishes.  Pretty straightforward.  He also had no personality to be found.  Bummer on the service front.Next visit was a Saturday night bar visit, just 2 of us. I had a different bartender then last time and again, was disappointed in the service.  Just seemed lackadaisical, wasn&#39;t very warm or friendly. Did what we asked but again, no personality.  It may sound like I want a stellar server, which I don&#39;t!  I just want someone with some personality who can smile, be reasonably attentive and give suggestions when needed.   Food wise, we had the burrata bruschetta which was excellent and we ate every bite.  I&#39;d recommend it and felt it was worth the price.  Had the arugula salad again which was the same as last time.  Good, not great. In hindsight it might have need a dash of salt to liven it up a bit. My friend chose the pizza and we got the spicy one, I forget what it was called.  I can do spicy to a degree, and she has more tolerance than me so it didn&#39;t affect her, but I found it too spicy.  I still ate it, but it was just too spicy for me.  No one&#39;s fault.  Drinks and wine chosen were great.  Bummer that it was a home Cubs game (playoffs) and they couldn&#39;t get the game on.  Men definitely left the bar and women stayed!  The restaurant was full as it was a Saturday night.  I&#39;m assuming they&#39;ve figured out that they need to change their cable package to get that channel by now!So, a long review for 2 other visits!    Overall on my 3 visits and interaction with 4 staff members, either bartenders or servers, I&#39;m 1 out of 4 which is disappointing. And each time it was concurred by my dining mates, it wasn&#39;t just me.  However, the food was really good to great so I&#39;ll go back.  If I have service again that is bad, I will definitely nicely mention it to the manager because it&#39;s a beautiful restaurant with really good food....ok- to-bad service is not acceptable for that price point.  Or any price point, in my opinion."

When I noticed the build-out had finished and it looked close to opening, my friend and I made reservations for last Saturday.The anticipation was worth it... completely. We were greeted warmly by lovely host staff  and decided to have a drink near the bar to wait for our table (we were early for our rez). The bartenders were efficient, friendly, and helpful. I had the Negroni, and it was exactly what I expect of a classic Italian standard. Spot on. My friend had Stolen Vesper, which was served in a beautiful rimmed coupe. The drink itself was unique, and if you like mezcal, I definitely recommend.Five to ten minutes before our 9:30 reservation, a hostess came to escort us to our table. The decor is really.... smooth and polished. The room lends an open view so people watching is fun. The windows lining the booths are perfect for taking in the busy street.Our server, Allison, introduced herself and immediately went into explaining the menu. I loved this. She gave a succinct rundown of the portion sizes and the menu items that were already becoming standouts (on the 3rd day of business, no less!) My friend and I decided to share a number of items:- The Octopus - Get this. It&#39;s delicious.- Insalata Mista (could be wrong on the name) - Perfectly dressed, and the earthiness from the goat cheese paired nicely with the tangy dressing.- Fritti: Bucatini - Adult swank version of Mac &amp; Cheese bites, two pieces. Just right for that desire for a bit of something fried.- Chicken Diavolo - We both thought the flavor was great and it was cooked perfectly. I had hoped it would be a little spicier, but Allison did explain the honey component, which understandably calms heat.- Squid Ink Garganelli with pan seared tuna heart - We got the smaller portion, which wound up being just right. The pasta was excellent in texture and beautiful to look at. I liked this dish a lot.I&#39;d go into dessert, but this is entirely too long at this point. Just go... you&#39;ll have a great time and eat delicious food and be taken care of very well. Allison was simply perfect, and she made my night by bringing out the Budino, even though my friend wasn&#39;t nuts about chocolate. Thank you, Allison!"

Almost as good as the frozen section kind. Scissors to cut the pizza unique but they should have supplied a paper cutter instead.

I made a reservation and in the special requests noted we were celebrating his birthday and would prefer a booth if possible. They sat us at a table, which was completely fine, but made no mention that they even saw my request for a booth. I previously worked in the restaurant industry for years and always made a point to acknowledge guests reservation request and apologize when the restaurant could not fulfill one of them.It took our server a good 7-8 minutes to come greet us and once he did he asked for our drink order rather than introducing us to the restaurant. Again, not a deal breaker most of the time, but at a brand new restaurant with an upscale feel should have some sort of introduction. The rest of our meal went really well, and the food was OUTSTANDING. We had the grilled octopus and arancini for an appetizer, swordfish(my boyfriend said was OK) and bucatini(which both of us loved) for entrees. I have read some reviews that complain portions were too small, but I really think they were perfect because I was satisfied but not overly stuffed.After dinner our server presented the dessert menu but then left and didn&#39;t return for ten minutes. In that time we had decided we would get dessert elsewhere and I put the credit card on the table. Almost immediately the manager came over and grabbed my card and said &#34;Ill take care of that for you&#34; and was off. I was really put-off by the fact that he didn&#39;t stop for a second and ask how everything was, and in fact felt completely rushed. I could tell he was trying to flip tables and wanted to speed the process along. Our server then came back and asked if we had decided on dessert, once we told him the manager was running our card his response was &#34;you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing out on&#34;. It felt like the right hand didn&#39;t know what the left was doing.Overall, I think my biggest disappointment is that NOT ONE person mentioned his birthday. I even had presents in hand, which usually prompts the question &#34;what are we celebrating tonight?&#34; Now let me make it clear, I did not expect a free desert or even a candle in our dessert should we order one. A simple &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; from any one of the encounters we had with staff would have sufficed and made the whole experience more palatable."

I liked the decor it clean and modern, not your typical Italian.  Good cocktail list. I&#39;d likely come back here for a drink when walking by instead of dinner.  The pizzas were super quick but so thin you couldn&#39;t grab a slice, fork and knife almost required.  Good but anything special for the price.

Had to get the 2 random dudes running around in Italian suits to check on our order (only random because they did not introduce themselves as the managers, check in, or even smile/say hello.)Food was adequate: pizza was poor.The margarita pizza that I ordered was paper thin, unflavored, and only covered with a thin layer of sauce. Barley any cheese. No basil or greens.Our waiter was so comical. When ordering a steak he blundered by refusing to answer what terminology their kitchen associated with &#39;lightly pink&#39; and when ordering the pizza he made sure to firmly state multiple times that: &#34;I can&#39;t make sure to bring the pizza out at the same time as the salad&#34; per our request.The design of the establishment was delightful.Everything else needs to be reassessed -- and investment from The Prophet wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea."

We&#39;ve been trying for a month to get a reservation for dinner that wasn&#39;t at 4pm or 9pm. We walk in and the interior is very swank - cool booths and the bar is sleek. Although there are literally two other tables in the entire restaurant the hostess seats us at a 2-top next to one of the only other occupied tables. Next our waiter comes by and asks for drinks or questions. We tell him we need a minute, and don&#39;t see him for another 15 mins. This happens throughout the meal. Everything takes forever. The waiter is never around. It takes 30 minutes for a half order of pasta. Vegetable antipasti is the best thing we had. Margarita pizza is undercooked and wet - no.

I have been to Southern Italy many times and my in-laws are from there, so the so-called southern Italian theme is a blatant lie. Between four guests we had a good sampling of the menu. The salads and cooked dishes (pork, beef) were ok, nothing special. And the pizza... A disgrace to call that chewy shapeless blob with ingredients thrown onto it a pizza (we had 2 different kinds). Add to that very small servings of wine and hefty prices, this place is an absolute zero for food when there are great authentic Italian places all around the city. 2 stars, one for the looks, comfort and atmosphere, the other for the pleasant service."

Such a beautiful atmosphere, and I love the light works cocktail, but besides the flatbread the food is absolutely inedible. Not a picky eater here, and I live in the neighborhood, was so excited for the open, have given Coda di Volpe so many chances. I have done the leg work here- the octopus is chunky, no finesse or flavor, the pork pasta special was so oily and tasteless I couldn&#39;t even take 2 bites, the chicken was basic and dry, the mushroom flatbread was the only thing decent. Today was the last straw, tuna panzanella? Try albacore canned tuna on a grocery store spring mix. Go for the atmosphere and wine, then go home and  order take out."

I live in the neighborhood and love the Gage and the Dawson, so I thought this restaurant would be a slam dunk for me, but it wasn&#39;t. My husband and I do plan to give it another try as they may need to iron out some of the kinks. We came for dinner last week Saturday with my parents and nephews, so we had a party of 6. The server took our drink order and the drink runner only brought out 4 of the 6 drinks. Our server noted the error and said he would correct it right away. He returned to the table only to &#39;confirm&#39; the drinks that my Mom and Dad had ordered and not to actually drop off the missing drinks. It took at least 5 minutes for their drinks to show up. Ok, no big deal.. Unfortunately, things went downhill from there on the service. I had ordered a drink and finished it right when the appetizers came out. My husband was also almost finished with his drink as well. No one came by to ask us if we wanted another drink. When the apps were finished, the server stopped by to pick up the plates. I asked him if I could order a glass of wine, he said yes but that he would have to come back. He never came back to take my wine order. I had to flag down one of the managers for her to get me a glass of wine. My husband also had to ask for another drink instead of someone noticing that his has been sitting empty. After we finished our main entrees, our plates were slow to be cleared away. We waited quite some time after our entrees were finished for our server to return with dessert menus. We all ordered dessert, finished the desserts, and were ready for the check. We sat for a good 10 mins. (I checked my watch.) Our server never came by our table and no one even noticed that we were sitting there with empty dessert plates waiting to leave. We had to flag someone down to get our server to come over. By that time, we were all pretty annoyed and my Mom provided her card right away and asked for the check. The response we received from the server should have been something like: Right Away! but he actually asked us if we were sure we did not want anything else.. maybe coffee? Come on. I&#39;m not usually super picky like this, but when your total bill is $350, you expect more than this. I also know that the service at the Gage and the Dawson is fantastic, so I was expecting more. Now I&#39;ll talk about the food. The food was not spectacular. The only spectacular entree was the branzino. My Mom raved about it. My Dad did like the sausage pizza and my nephew liked the octopus. The Insalata Mista was good and well dressed. the Broccoli di Cicco was very salty. My husband and I ordered the margherita pizza. It was ok, but the middle of the pizza was undercooked and totally floppy. My nephews each got the steak. They said it was about a 6/10. They also ordered the braised beef pasta and they said it was bland. These are teenage boys who like meat and potatoes, so for them to say it was bland means it really was pretty bland. We asked which two desserts were the best and ordered the buddino and the cassata. They both were pretty average and nothing spectacular. I want this restaurant to be amazing, so I&#39;m going to come back in a few months and hope that these kinks are ironed out."

We were also impressed by the fantastic wine recommendations we received from Mike Blanco.  Seems to be the best around.  Try the lemon slushy drink as well!!!  Enjoy!!!!!!!!

We live in the neighborhood and *really* wanted to love this place. But, we experienced serious service issues. Wine came out AFTER the first app. Entrees came out BEFORE second app. And, grilled veggies (second course) came out AFTER everything. We waited a few weeks to try this place to give time to work out service kinks, but not quite there yet. In sum, food was solid, but service was nonexistent. Only redeeming quality was manager making his rounds."

Terrific, friendly, and helpful wait-staff. Delightfully unique and intimate setting. The Violet Hour is everything I ever wanted in a cocktail lounge.My only complaint was that the wait to get in was more than an hour long (it was Saturday at 10:30pm). Next time, I&#39;ll come early.The cocktails are amazing and strong. In fact, I didn&#39;t even realize how strong until after my second. Phew! Also, they&#39;re not super cheap ($13 a cocktail) but damn are they worth it. The menu changes seasonally, I was told, so there&#39;s something to look forward to next time I come back... which will be very soon."

This bar is not easily located because the mural right outside is being changed. When I went there last night, some letters of the alphabet were painted on the wall. I didn&#39;t even notice the door, until some people went out... and there was a line right outside.Second, I like how they named their drinks. It was really unique and it makes you think as to why they called the drinks like that.Lastly, I just love that kind of vibe. It&#39;s dark inside but it gives you that intimate feeling when you are with someone.I would definitely recommend this place to my friends back home!"

One time my friend and I were in the area, and we came about 20 minutes before they opened (first in line, YAY!), and by the time 6pm rolled around, at least 15-20 people were behind us.There are many cocktails to choose from at the Violet Hour, and the servers make picking a drink easier.  I&#39;ve ordered from the regular menu, but I&#39;ve also had them create a cocktail for me. One time I was craving a White Russian type cocktail, but there wasn&#39;t one like this on the menu at the time. The server went over the ingredients they had on hand to create a cocktail similar to a White Russian, and the drink was great ! They really can accommodate any drink tastes. The ambiance, cocktails, and service makes this place a true gem."

If you were to extrapolate this theory to Chicago&#39;s vibrant bar scene The Violet Hour (VH) would be that point of singularity. Yes there were bars before VH and there might have even been some that actually used artesianal methods such as freshly squeezed juice-Matchbox perhaps-but it was VH that put Chicagoan&#39;s and the nation on blast that we could be more than just an Old Style and cheap whiskey drinking town. Once that was discovered cocktail bars have been popping up in droves. Lost Lake, GreenRiver, Mezcaleria Las Flores, Sparrow, Arbella etc. being the planets and stars of that ever-expanding universe, were all created by that one point of singularity.Who would have thunk that Chicagoans possessed a more sophisticated palate. VH became the playground for those that were looking to experiment and/or showoff these enhanced palates. VH is often described as a speakeasy, which is difficult to grasp considering speakeasys of the time were often small, cramped, dumpy shoeboxes with barely drinkable liquor. However VH is hidden behind a giant handcrafted mural, using local artists, and you wouldn&#39;t know it&#39;s there unless you know it&#39;s there. Additionally it&#39;s superdark inside so I guess this qualifies enough to keep the speakeasy trend going. Inside you are transported to a more pre-20&#39;s era Parisian style escape from all the huhbub of the close by Milwaukee-North-Damen intersection and the Big Star crowd. Once inside gigantic beautiful velvet curtains, super hi-back chairs, and chandeliers await your thirsty ambitions.Here well-crafted classics along with more progressive cocktails litter the menu. All fresh and top notch ingrediants are used. Currently late August 2016 their summer menu is broken into three columns. Shaken drinks, Stirred drinks, and notable VH Classics. I must say I am more of a stirred drinks kind of fly guy, however the &#34;Sterile Animal&#34; on the Shaken side was quite good. Highlighted by Leatherbee Gin and Rhubarb, it was almost a sour-y drink with a hint of sweetness. Not usually my kind of drink but I really did enjoy it. On the stirred side I tried &#34;Travails of the Swamp Thing&#34; which is a Bourbon drink similar to a Manhattan. Again, excellent but put-hair-on-your-chest strong. Never did try from their VH Classics, however I have been here a few times now and every drink has been spot on.VH may be the point of singularity that sparked Chicago&#39;s cocktail revolution, but just like in the world of Quantum Physics where the moon and stars are studied but not the original point, VH often gets forgotten in Chicago&#39;s high stakes bar game. The new kids on the block with their themed style bars (Queen Mary) and bars with a spirit speciality ( Mezcaleria Las Flores) get all the accolades and attention. I&#39;m telling you don&#39;t sleep on VH, the drinks still rival any bar this city has to offer with an interior that is awe-inspiring after all these years."

I had heard of Violet Hour in conversations about Chicago, but didn&#39;t really know what to expect before going there.First, the door is hidden in plain view. It&#39;s basically just a door-shaped chunk of a wall it&#39;s in. The bar commissions a local artist to redesign the wall every few months and the door is camouflaged within the art. If you look closely you can see the outline when walking by. There are no reservations taken for the bar, so once you get there you must wait. If there are no available seats, you wait outside the door in a line for people to come out. I kinda like this because it helps to build a little bit of anticipation.It&#39;s pretty dark inside and all tables are lit by candlelight, so it&#39;s got a swanky feel about it. There are a few &#34;House Rules&#34; to abide by. No cellphones usage allowed (Why I didnt get a picture of anything), no &#34;bombs,&#34; everyone needs proper attire. This helps keep the feel in there speakeasy-ish and classy. I&#39;m a fan.As for the drinks, there are quite a few specialty cocktails they have made up, as well as an extensive list of classics you can order. I wish I could remember what all was in the drink I ordered but I just know it was mezcal, was spicy, and was delicious. They can also whip you something up randomly if you want! The servers seem to have an excellent knowledge on the drinks they are serving, too. So if you go in there completely blind, they can lead you in the right direction if you tell them what you like.If you&#39;re looking for a fun spot to have a drink that&#39;s not loud, hot, and crowded, this is it!"

Sure a lot of their schtick is kind of the new normal now: hidden entranceways, retro cocktails, dim lighting-they&#39;ve definitely lightened up in there. No pun intended, the lighting was dim but not the pitch black that it apparently used to be.The cocktail list is pretty good, but I asked for something off menu that kind of stumped our server. I gave her the ingredients and she took it and ran, turned out to be a close approximation of what I wanted.I liked it and enjoyed it but having tried other places like this it&#39;s not as the overwhelming experience I thought it would be, it&#39;s still a good place for drinks."

Rather than organizing the drinks by spirit, they&#39;re now organized by vague categories, like shaken, stirred, and &#34;classics.&#34; What&#39;s more, they no longer actually list all of the ingredients in the cocktails, instead giving impressionistic descriptions and analogies like a hip sommelier. Maybe I am being old fashioned, but I would just like you to tell me what you are putting in a glass, and let me decide whether it seems good, bad, or intriguing.On the plus side, if you go from 6-8 on weeknights, they have an absinthe service, which features a fabulous absinthe cocktail (the frappe), and a really really good french absinthe, complete with spider/spoon/sugar/water setup. The french absinthe we tried was so good we didn&#39;t really want to dilute it, but the Colorado absinthe was sort of vile, and we were grateful for the apparatus. (It is fair to ask why we ordered Colorado absinthe, but isn&#39;t it also fair to ask why the Violet Hour served it?)One thing hasn&#39;t changed: the cocktails are still thirteen dollars.Despite my complaints, it&#39;s still five stars."

The door is hidden in a mural which changes frequently with different works of art. Not too hard to find like some speakeasies (thank goodness) because there is a sign outside asking you to wait to be seated - and there was a long line. However, we were seated quickly and the waitstaff was very professional (we had doughnuts and requested that we finished them before we were let in).Service was impeccable here - they were quick and prompt. One of our party accidentally broke a glass and they quickly cleaned and bought out a new one without even being asked (not expected because it was clearly our fault).The one thing that stops this place from being 5 stars is the music. It is SO loud. Hard to hear a few people away which is a problem in a group larger than two. And it detracts from the experience. It is dim inside with gorgeous high curtains which probably absorb a lot of the sound as well. Maybe I&#39;m getting old, but loud music like that gives me a headache.The have an extensive liquor and specialty cocktail drinks which were all priced at 13$. Nice because all cocktails were even."

This is a hidden Chicago bar in that there is no store front or windows; the place is behind a huge mural right across the street from Big Star. To find the door, look for the light above it. Luckily I knew were to go since no one in my party did.Once inside you&#39;re held in a dimly lit waiting room. There is a sign that has all the rules of the place hanging on the wall. Luckily, there was only one group waiting ahead of us; we waited only 7 minutes before being seated. You&#39;re taken through very heavy dark curtains into the actual bar, and you&#39;re immediately hit with the very chill and romantic ambience. They have high back chairs and ottomans for you to sit on around a small table, and they provide you with cold water in a glass flask. The menu lists all the drinks they have, in addition to the small list of foods as well.Drinks: spot on. For what you&#39;re paying, you are getting your money&#39;s worth. I had the Aviator and my friends got an old fashioned and the Juliet and Romeo. All were fantastic. Everything in his place seems slower and laid back, like you&#39;re not feeling rushed to get out of there. This place is perfect for a date night with your significant other.Note: you CAN use your phone in this place, but you&#39;re not allowed to take phone calls. You can take pics or play on your apps all you like, but just don&#39;t talk on the phone. The host (bouncer?) explained that this place wants you to engage in conversation with the the people you&#39;re with, but they respect that your phone is a part of you nowadays.A definite try in Chicago."

The door to go inside seems to be well hidden because it looks just like a common mural, but it&#39;s actually the enterence. FYI this is a pretty classy place so there is a dress code of no gym shoes and other stuff such as no phone calls once you&#39;re inside. But inside starts off pretty dark, but you&#39;ll get use to it and notice the din lighting and the location is really nice. A bunch of seats are also around in the area where ur seated so it nice and comfy with old style rich people chair..Servers came around quiet often to get drink orders and was very nice and polite and answering any questions you may have.The drinks are where it really shines!!

You totally forget about the busy streets of the Damen intersection and even all the partying that&#39;s going on at Big Star across the street. The door to the Violet Hour blends in beautifully with whatever mural happens to be painted and I&#39;ve walked by countless times before I even realized this was where the Violet Hour stood.My friend and I arrived in line at just past 8 on a Saturday night. The wait wasn&#39;t more than 20 minutes so it was very manageable. The way the chairs are arranged kind of made it feel like mirrors at a fun house or something so I thought that was a bit strange. It&#39;s also a little weird that I can hear the conversation of the group sitting right behind me!Drink-wise, anything at the top of each category (gin, rum, whiskey, brandy, etc) is not as strong. I got the pisco kid which was not bad but loved my friend&#39;s whiskey based drink. I forgot the name but it had pear as one of the ingredients and that ended up being quite tasty!You can really get lost in time here as the staff does not hurry you at all despite the line outdoors and when you finally exit, it&#39;s hard to believe that there was a whole different world just inside.P.s.

The door blends quite perfectly with the graffiti&#39;d wall - no windows, no sign in true speakeasy fashion. We managed to avoid a long wait likely because it was a weeknight. You&#39;ll have a better chance grabbing a spot at the bar or a table with 2-4 people in your group. I prefer the bar for the action - I love to watch the bartenders mix up everyone&#39;s drinks. Plus, you might end up with a sip of their punch. It&#39;s still unclear if the drunken man next to us bought our first round or not, but hey! We&#39;ll take it.I had a gin based cocktail - Juliet and Romeo (cucumber, rose water and mint) and a glass of rosé. The bartender was attentive but blasé with his approach to taking our orders - one at a time instead of as a group.This is the perfect spot to let the bartender strut his stuff. Give him a few ingredients or a type of liquor for the base and let him concoct something special. He also let me in on a tasty rosé that was a recent but limited feature on the menu.An exclusive bar experience fit for a fancy night out with the girls or a cozy date night."

I have been here several times and I really enjoy coming on a weekend night where it can be packed and there is a line of people waiting outside the door.The lighting is essentially dark with tea-light candles and can be very crowded in there.You enter the bar through 2 big curtains in a hallway that leads you to the hostess. And by the way there are zero windows to look out of.It is somewhat pricey but I only advise you to get cocktails here it is not a place that is known for their food because the tables are small and the chairs are fundamentally not made for customers to eat off of.Will visit here quite often I love it!"

Sure, there&#39;s a lot of hype around Violet Hour but it&#39;s worth it. These people are passionate about what they do, and they do it well. They are serious mixologists, but I love that it&#39;s approachable to the basic cocktail drinker as well. I took my mom and sister here when they were up to visit and neither of them are familiar with different types of cocktails. Our server walked us through what they could expect from the menu choices and made some great recommendations. I&#39;ve been seated at the bar previously and really enjoyed watching the bartenders construct the works of art that they call cocktails.If you want to go and don&#39;t want to wait, it&#39;s best to get there right when they open. Within an hour or so, especially on a weekend night, there will be a line out the door. The atmosphere here can&#39;t be beat, with romantic, tall back chairs and dim lighting. Would highly recommend it for a date night or night out with girls. They also have an absinthe focused happy hour menu for weekdays, I believe 6pm-7pm."

This is no exception. We went there during the peak hour I.e. 10.00 on  Saturday. And with out any surprises,  there was a line longer than the Great Wall of china.After a 45-60min wait, we finally got into the waiting room. The place was dimly lit. It has extremely high ceiling as if they took down another floor. After another 5m minute wait, we were finally escorted into the restaurent. This place is far from hipster, it was super classy. You have the mini romantic get-away like booths catered towards the couple at the front. And also you have larger booths for the rest of the groupies. And literally everyone was sitting and ordering cocktails. None of those fighting for the bar tenders&#39; attention to get your fix.What could go wrong right? The cocktails themselves did not live up to the expectation. I ordered a tequila based cocktail, it looked like mini pint of beer, except it tasted like bud wiser mixed with liter fluid and tequila. One could argue, it is epitome of Manly drinks. But it&#39;s not worth the wait or money.Also to cleanse my taste buds, I ordered a mojito. I&#39;m mean you can&#39;t screw up a simple classic drink. Oh no. They somehow managed to screw it up. It was extra lemony and there was is little trace of the alcohol.Oh well, bottom line is, I don&#39;t want to give this rating. It had the potential and I&#39;m a sucker for the hidden bars. I&#39;ll give it another shot."

Yes for the quiet entrance. Yes for the amazing service. YES for the amazing drinks. Yes, yes, yes!Not only that, but even when we showed up with 8 people (which tends to be frowned upon usually in places like this in my experience) they barely blinked an eye before finding a place to put us all. So, more yeses even for that.I order the Never Odd or Even which is lovingly crafted with scotch, grapefruit, honey, and St. George Pear Brandy. It was so good I ordered two.All cocktails are $12, which seems reasonable to me. And, like everyone says, you&#39;ll feel 100 times cooler for your time having libations in this spot."

Once inside, it has a cool hipster/slightly bougie vibe. If you&#39;re on a date night here, the vibe lends itself to the rest of the evening going well.All of the cocktails that our group tried off of the summer menu were great, they&#39;re listed from lighter/sweeter at the top of the page and become stronger as you go down the list.  Drinks are $13 each (which doesn&#39;t seem bad but I&#39;m probably desensitized from living in NYC). They also do punch bowls, if you&#39;re looking for something to share with the table.  On our way out (probably 10/10:30 pm), there was a LINE wrapping around the corner to get in, so I recommend starting here. And definitely snag one of the House Rules postcards, if only for the Instagram pic."

She explained the foundations of making a cocktail so we would understand and start to put a twist on how to make our own fancier drinks at home.

Boyfriend and I tried a few cocktail bars in Chicago and they stood no chance against The Violet Hour!Experience #1, a Friday night: We were seated at the bar and service was fantastic! Our bartender offered great recommendations and was made sure that our drinks were perfect before we got to drink them.Experience #2, a Sunday night: So, we enjoyed ourselves so much the first time that we decided to come back for one last visit before leaving. This time we were sat at an actual table, we both still preferred sitting at the bar.Review of the drinks: All of the drinks were AMAZING, we branched out both times and tried several $12 cocktails from their menu.A few of our favorites:Dark &amp; StormyYo, Banana Boy - this was my personal favorite, it was so delicious that I HAD to order two!The AntidoteThe Pisco KidNever Odd or Even - Boyfriend&#39;s personal favoriteFood: they has light appetizers which were appetizing, we tried the Spinach Dip and Deviled Eggs and they did not disappoint.The only disappointment was that their house rules state no cell phone use in the lounge. I wish that they would enforce that policy and politely ask people to put away their cell phones if they are using them. ENJOY THE COMPANY YOU ARE WITH! It was so annoying having 3 phones go off with pictures and videos, it is also sad that some people are unable to stay off of their phones for more than an hour. The are roughly 1,700 reviews with only 300 pictures, that is for a reason. Rant over."

Good tunes though.High backed chairs and long bar with prerequisite hipster bartenders. Needs larger chandeliers and more of those velvet drapes to fulfill the stories I heard about this place.Drinks were of course inventive and there is pretty much something for everyone.

Both of these establishments burst onto the scene with immense popularity and lines for days (or 1/2 blocks, more accurately). Now, years later, I&#39;d say Violet Hour is handling itself much better.Drinks are still great, atmosphere is still intimate and exclusive, without any sort of perceivable jerk factor (not the same to be said about Three Dots). I saw a guy in a t-shirt and shorts, which I&#39;d not recommend, but obviously nobody with the business shamed him or refused him service, which is nice. It was just a nice feeling of him maybe being a little out of place but not unwelcome.The best part is still the interesting and potent drinks. I&#39;d definitely take someone here to show them a nice time."

I&#39;m sure I had some bourbon or rye based drink to say the least.What I do remember was that it was really dim and well covered from the outside world. I was expecting a stand around type of bar, one where you can mingle with other guests or just hang out where ever you want. Instead, we were seated at a table with high back chairs, so it was a bit more of an intimate occasion. This is more well suited for a date night type of outing, so just keep that in mind.All I can say is that it had a nice feel to it, a romantic setting if I may say so."

There were only a few people in line to get seated when my friend and I arrived so the wait was not long; however, I felt that the person in charge of the line was very commanding and made the experience feel excruciatingly long. Every couple of minutes, he would make us move and would tell us exactly where to stand. This was very disruptive. I wasn&#39;t very happy because it seemed like the establishment didn&#39;t put much value in our experience prior to getting seated.Once we got seated, everything turned for the better. The atmosphere was very romantic - perfect for a third date. The seats were slightly uncomfortable but it is tolerable. Our server was very knowledgeable and gave great suggestions. We had the Juliet and Romeo, the Violet Hour Old Fashioned and the I did... Did I? The Juliet and Romeo was refreshing. It is gin-based with a strong lime flavor  and hints of cucumber and mint. There is a complex after-taste that I couldn&#39;t figure out, but I enjoyed the drink a lot. The Old Fashioned here is the best I&#39;ve had. It was very well-balanced and has a viscous texture. The demerara gave it a unique taste. Lastly, the I did... Did I? is a surprising cocktail (it contained Green Tabasco). The drink contained turmeric, which gave it a salty and peppery flavor and Green Tabasco, which made the drink spicy. It is a mezcal-based cocktail with lime and cucumbers. It is both refreshing and spicy, a strange combination that surprisingly worked well.I would say that the Old Fashioned is my favorite drink among the three, but all three were exceptional. I am very impressed with the quality of drinks in Violet Hour. If only they can do something to change how uncomfortable the pre-seating experience is, it&#39;d be comparable to the Aviary or the Office."

My bf and I came on a Sunday for a night cap after dinner around 10:30. There were two people in front of us waiting before entering and it took about 15 minutes til we were seated.Once the door man walked us in to meet the hostess, the atmosphere feels like a modern speakeasy with unique furniture and dim lighting. There were no small tables open, so we were seated at the bar which was totally fine. It was fun watching the mixologists putting together interesting and well made cocktails.I ordered the Carousel Barker which was rye, lemon, egg white, and other great ingredients. My bf ordered the Moscow mule. Our bartender was very meticulous while preparing our drinks and they turned out to be superb. We also ordered a side of roasted nuts to snack on, but they were a bit spicy since they&#39;re tossed with cayenne and paprika.We had only planned to stay for one drink, so we didn&#39;t get to try anything else on the menu. They all sounded and looked very unique and tasty though. They  don&#39;t take reservations, so I don&#39;t think this place is great for groups but do come for an intimate setting (the dim lights after a glass of wine and a drink did get me sleepy tho lol)"

We had just finished up a fun cooking class in the area and since the weather was not great we decided to stick around Wicker Park for a while and take Danny W up on his recommendation.I&#39;m pretty horrible when it comes to directions, so although a native to Chicagoland, you best believe I busted out my Google maps to direct my out of town pals. Good thing I did too, because we almost walked right past this lounge! My map said we had arrived, but there was no obvious bar in sight. It wasn&#39;t until Cindy G found a cool looking wall that opened up to be a door that we realized The Violet Hour had a speakeasy kind of situation going on.When you walk in there are curtains and a host to greet you on the other side. It was a long wait (I assume, he didn&#39;t give a set time) for a table, but spots at the bar were about to open up so we went for that instead. Literally my only complaint of my experience were the barstools themselves. Sure, they looked comfy and cool and were bench-like, but there was way too many of them stuffed up at the bar. It was hard to even sit down or move around.Other than that, my experience was 5 stars! The bartender fit the feel of the lounge and was awesome at crafting cocktails. He definitely made it look like an art! While they do have a very good cocktail, champagne, and wine menu, I was interested in a bubbly concoction. No problem there! The bartender whipped me up something delicious. I honestly have no idea what it was called, but it involved grapefruit, some champs, and other tasty ingredients I can&#39;t quite remember.Our group was also lucky enough to try their rum punch. It&#39;s kind of unclear if the bartender just gave us those drinks, or if the super drunk fellow next to me ordered them for us before he left. Regardless, they were free and pretty good. Not something I&#39;d probably order again though, but that&#39;s because rum isn&#39;t high on my list.I tried a sip of Emily H&#39;s old fashioned and it was on point. Really well done and complete with the classic ice burg glacier to keep it chilled. It&#39;s to be noted that this bar also has crushed ice (which Cindy G was excited about)! I&#39;d say the average price per cocktail was about $13 which is pretty standard for the area and type of establishment.The Violet Hour is dimly lit inside and feels very exclusive. Definitely a fun spot worth checking out and the bartenders know what they&#39;re doing!"

After finishing our drinks we sat dry for a good 15 minutes and the bar was not even busy. It was a Tuesday. Our bartender blatantly ignored us and wouldn&#39;t even bring us our check.

I wonder how they do that.&#34;The cocktails are delicious and they&#39;re $13 each. I&#39;m still getting used to Chicago prices, and I tend to be cheap, but the drinks were superb so this seemed reasonable for a drink or two.The entrance is a little tricky - at first I thought I was in the wrong place.

I&#39;ve tried several of their drinks but I always go back to the champagne cocktail!This is the perfect place for a group of girlfriends to go and get a little boozy before a night out, or for a sexy date night. Love this place and can&#39;t wait to go back the next time I&#39;m in town!"

I&#39;ve been coming here for years, and it never disappoints. For all the haters who have commented about the line outside - yes, there usually is one, get over it. You&#39;ll have to wait a little bit to get inside. Do your research ahead of time and plan accordingly - it&#39;s not that hard to if you plan a little bit in advance.The ambiance is great - the dark room really sets the mood for the evening. The big curtains, dark blue walls and white crown moldings provide for a handsome interior. The candles are also a nice touch as they provide the majority of the lighting - something you don&#39;t see much anymore.Service has always been top-notch at this place. What I love most is that they don&#39;t mind if you don&#39;t know much about spirits; they&#39;re happy to walk you through the menu and provide you with some suggestions and advice based on what your preferences are. I think it&#39;s great to give the server / bartender some rough parameters of what you&#39;d like in your drink, and then they come out with something that&#39;s fantastic 10 mins later.The drinks here are really the centerpiece of the experience, and I&#39;ve had so many over the years and they&#39;ve all been wonderful. The menu is laid out such that the booziest drinks are at the bottom of each spirit category, so you know roughly what you&#39;re getting into for each one. I love that some of their best original drinks from ~10 years ago area still on the menu (i.e. Juliet &amp; Romeo...I&#39;m a sucker for gin).Keep up the good work, Violet Hour. Hope you&#39;ll be around for years to come!!"

It just didn&#39;t sit well with me.But everything was really great.  Reason for the 4 stars.  The service was impeccable.  The drinks were phenomenal...and affordable.  Just the wrong vibe.Note for out of towners: The Violet Hour is conveniently located a few steps from Damen station."

The line wasn&#39;t too long, but that might be because it was snowing. We waited for around 15-20 minutes outside and another 5ish minutes inside. I feel like if it wasn&#39;t snowing though, we would&#39;ve had to wait a lot longer.Love the atmosphere! The dimly lit space and classy interior design creates a casual but sophisticated ambiance. The layout doesn&#39;t really accommodate large groups. I&#39;d go with 3-4 people max.In terms of the drink menu, it&#39;s ordered by category. And under each category, the drinks are ordered by how strong they are, with the strongest drinks listed at the end. My friends got the Juliet and Romeo. I tried it and personally found the minty taste to be kind of weird. I got the OED or Rodeo. Definitely recommend it! Especially if you like fruity flavors. All cocktails are $12.Overall, really enjoyed my experience here."

The menu is creative, the ambiance is cozy and intimate, and I just love that you get transported to an entirely different scene through the wooden door. The artistry in the cocktails is top-notch and both of my cocktails were very well-balanced.If you come around 6pm on a Friday night, you&#39;re okay - and you can order food as well! If you come later, it may be hard to get a seat.Also, the environment is just beautiful to look at. It&#39;s classy with dim lighting and great for one-on-one conversations since chairs are set up that way."

I went to this bar several times in 2015. By far my favorite bar in Chicago. The talent of the bartenders is amazing. And with an ever-changing menu you will never get bored by the options. But what if your favorite drink is no longer on the menu?! If you ask nicely sometimes they&#39;ll make a past drink for you. The Paddleless Raft, a life changing drink is no longer on the menu.The exterior of The Violet Hour is repainted every week. You wouldn&#39;t know the bar was there if it wasn&#39;t for the line of people that is always there. There is however a discreet sign posted near the door. The wait makes you believe you are entering a tiny speakeasy, cozy it is but certainly not tiny. I would say this place can host at least 100 people at once.A magical place this bar is with its throne like seats, soft lighting, and delicate drapery.As far as price all cocktails are 13 dollars. Absolutely worth it. I mean how many times have you been to a restaurant like Red Lobster and spent 10-12 on a drink and have it just be mediocre. Only a couple dollars more you could get a well crafted drink here."

I got lost looking for this place...I even walked along the strip of stores in the parking lot next door (don&#39;t do that).Definitely one of the best places for well crafted cocktails. It has a swanky, speakeasy like atmosphere....the dark hallway with curtains and the tall arm chairs and booths certainly compliment well to the ambiance.Thankfully, there was no wait for 5 people on a Tuesday around 7pm. They do let the group sit even if you are still waiting on 1 more person but you just have to let the host know.I had the nooks and crannies which I grew to like...you certainly taste savory walnut liqueur. The 41 Jane does is a good choice that is more fruit forward. I would certainly go back to try other drinks."

I was pleasantly surprised as my chi was aligned with the house rules. No cell phones use in the lounge, proper attire requested, no baseball hats, no reservations, and only craft drinks. They specifically say no bombs of any kind, no Budweiser, light beer, grey goose, cosmopolitans and don&#39;t&#39; bring anyone you wouldn&#39;t bring to your mothers Sunday dinner.My friends were regulars here and showed me the ropes so I didn&#39;t aimlessly wander for the entrance. Heavy velvet curtains open your eyes to the magic that&#39;s inside. I went on a weeknight so it wasn&#39;t crowded or busy. Not only did I have great conversation with my party, but the staff was very engaging about both drinks/bartender and life. They were happy to try and impress me even more, but I was already sold.The décor is amazing, super tall ceilings, the velvet curtains go all the way up and do a great job of keeping the sound in. It&#39;s actually quite large while keeping it still intimate with lighting and seating arrangements. I liked the PB&amp;J, but thought maybe to swap peychaud&#39;s for molasses or chocolate bitters. They have a very European feel to the menu, but I think it&#39;s because they aren&#39;t so whiskey heavy like Longman &amp; Eagle.It is pricy and maybe not as worth it for cocktails alone, but ambiance is unrivaled. Bathrooms could use some work. It&#39;s actually quite cozy to bring a small group or a date."

The place looks like a wooden box and I could barely see the door until the bouncer opened it up for us. The place is located directly across from Big Star Tacos so that&#39;s a good landmark for newcomers.I have heard that the wait can be 30 mins - an hour on weekends so I am glad I didn&#39;t have to wait at all for a seat. The chairs inside were big and tall, similar to the Alice in Wonderland tea party theme. The ambiance is dimly lit and very romantic. Cellphones are &#34;not allowed&#34; but you can sneak a picture here and there (without flash of course) if you really want to but the lighting is so dark that it&#39;s really no use.For the drinks menu, they divided the drinks up by choice of liquor and each section ranges from lighter less strong drinks to heavier stronger drinks. I just got the moscow mule since it&#39;s my go to while my friend got his whiskey inspired Daisy 17. Both drinks were very yummy and delicious and strong. I was a bit sad that my moscow mule didn&#39;t come in a copper mug like they typically do.Most drinks are $13-15, a bit pricey but it is fairly strong. Nice place to go after dinner or grab drinks with a few friends. I wouldn&#39;t recommend coming here with a big party."

Very creative and tasty cocktails and small bites. We went early (6 PM) on a Wednesday night and were seated right away and served efficiently. 3 Stars simply because the cost-value ratio was slightly out of proportion and also I would have expected a more extensive bourbon selection. The cocktails we tried were $13 and made with common liquors -- so I wasn&#39;t sure what was supposed to be special about them.Definitely a cool stop if you&#39;re in the area.

Unfortunately we did have to wait, from my understanding and the website they do not take reservations, which sucks. But apparently they were on Valentine&#39;s, we had to wait, it would do great wonders if they fixed/added heat in area that they allow you to wait. It was like standing outside. #Freezing.  We were eventually seated, the place is really  different from other places.

However, the line was always moving and it was about a 20 min wait. The wait is really worth it! I liked the variety of drinks offered, and the drinks(I tried three of them) didn&#39;t even taste like the spirit ordered. I liked that complexity of the drinks, without it being too strong or overly sweet. The space is bigger than what it seems like outside, so it never felt crowded. Very upscale, dark atmosphere which reminded me of Patterson House in Nashville. I highly recommend a visit!"

On slow nights, bartenders have even let us sample cocktails on the house, and made custom drinks on the spot while explaining the history/process to us. Pretty cool stuff!That said, I&#39;d recommend coming on a weeknight, or EARLY in the evening on weekends, as the wait can get pretty long. Also, the foyer I mentioned earlier only really holds a handful of people, so committed customers may find themselves waiting in line outside. I wouldn&#39;t roll the dice with a group larger than 4-5 people at this place."

If you&#39;re having a crappy night, or want to treat yourself, or just need a space to get away and relax feel all is right with the world, you come here.I know that&#39;s some high praise, but I stand by it--this is my favorite place for drinks in the city. Yes, you may have to wait outside for a while, but that annoyance will melt away when you walk through the velvet curtains into this serene space. The magnificent staff will start your night off right. They are very knowledgeable, great at giving suggestions, and have a way with customers that fits right into the vibe this place aims to create.The drinks, though, are what make this place the best. I&#39;m no connoisseur, though I do have my particulars about what I like and don&#39;t like. Somehow, The Violet Hour bends those rules. Even if I don&#39;t like the type of alcohol, even though I don&#39;t like certain ingredients, I have always loved anything I or my friends have ordered here. They just know what they&#39;re doing. The Juliet and Romeo is my go-to, but I have always been happy with everything else I&#39;ve tried.It shines in all other aspects as well. The space is clean, with a gorgeous bar and comfortable seating. The food is also amazing. I highly recommend their bacon wrapped dates--best appetizer I&#39;ve ever had. I also need to buy whatever lotion they have in their bathroom.All that to say, everything from the amazing cocktails to the little details push the envelope from &#34;a great space&#34; to &#34;best place in the city.&#34;"

They have a pretty extensive drink menu (that come at a price too)! I forgot what I ordered, but it was really good. It really hits you in the end too.

Violet Hour has no windows and the exterior wall is a constantly changing wall of graffiti. There is a (very handsome) doorman who peaks his head out to survey the line and lets guests in as they are ready to take you. Upon entering you immediately notice that it is extremely dimly lit, a very hip ambiance. There are three different rooms with posh seating and sleek white bars. We were seated in the third room at a cozy table for four. Once we were adjusted to the light you could really enjoy the atmosphere. An extensive list of craft cocktails tempts you outside of your box; definitely go for it! I chose a Big Leap, it was delish, and especially nice that it came with a small carafe of the extra drink that didn&#39;t fit in the lovely coupe glass. Our group was great about sharing so I got to taste all the drinks at our table: the Brooklyn, I Did...Did I?,Cul-de-sac swizzle, the Gold Star and the Reno Loner; I&#39;d order any one of them again! Being from Kansas City I was thrilled to see J. Reiger Whiskey and Gin on the menu, just like home!We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, which were also wonderful. We had a second round of drinks, before heading to our dinner reservation. The second round certainly packed a punch, the drinks are not for lightweights! Cheers"

Both were fantastic and I recommend going for a lighter drink first followed by a stronger one.

Bartenders are not at all attentive.Location is great, right across the street from the L. There is no sign however. You pretty much line up next to the wall directly across the street from Big Star (which is always consistently busy). There is some graffiti on the wall, which helped me find it. When I arrived around 8:00pm on a Thurs, there were about 4 people in line ahead of me. The bouncer came out, asked if I had a reservation, told me to wait a few minutes and then let me right in. I was escorted to a seat at the bar.The bartender couldn&#39;t have been any less enthused to serve me. He acted as if I should have been grateful to be in his presence. Getting his attention even though he was standing right in front of me was very daunting. I think he just straight up ignored me. Meanwhile, he was waiting on the couple next to me as if his job depended on it (and they only ordered one round of drinks). He was having long conversations with them, giving them tastings and even gave them a free shot...while I had to wait 30 minutes for another $14 drink, with my empty glass just sitting in front of me. I started to leave, but I had heard good thinks about the drinks and really wanted to try them.The menu has the cocktails separated and listed by spirit. I tried one rum, one tequila and one whiskey cocktail. The Spanish Margarita (made w. Lunazul Blanco, lime, Marie Brizard Orange Curaçao, Licor 43, Hellfire bitters) was my favorite, which is not surprising since I love tequila. For food, I also got the fries, ham &amp; cheese slider and the pulled pork slider. The pulled pork slider was my favorite. I&#39;m surprised I actually stayed that long to try all of that given the fact that the bartender seemed to loathe me.Also, one of the barbacks&#39; girlfriends was standing there practically behind the bar taking shots with all the bartenders and tasting other people&#39;s drinks. It was weird and really unprofessional. They were really acting like they were at a frat house. The worst part is that the manager started joining in and dancing up on the girlfriend. For this place to bill itself as being somewhat upscale, I think they need to reevaluate the vibe they&#39;re giving off with that type of behavior."

We have lots of great places for specialty cocktails in my hometown of Louisville, KY...but no place like this. The drinks are absolutely amazing. I&#39;ve never had something I didn&#39;t love! However, what really sets The Violet Hour apart is their incredible service. The vibe does certainly feel a bit exclusive, but to me it is not pretentious in the slightest. Every time I have been here, service has been attentive, thoughtful and incredibly gracious. The staff always make you feel very special and cared for, without being overbearing. To me that is the mark of a great service experience.Lastly - I know some people would probably say this place is expensive but...comparatively, it&#39;s really not.

I ordered a Ramos gin fizz which a lot of places don&#39;t make and one of their signature cocktails, both super tasty and not too sweet. They also give your the little mixer on the side of your cocktail for a little extra!I don&#39;t know how it is on weekends, but it was table service only and your entire party has to show up together to be seated.  Finally a bar where we don&#39;t have to crowd and elbow our way around the bar counter to grab a drink!Came on a Monday night as our last outing in Chicago, so I think that was part of the great experience because it wasn&#39;t crowded at all.Violet room is right off the blue line so it was super easy to find except for the entrance. There was no long lines outside to signal us and we were utterly confused by the urgent care sign sharing the same address, but after looking it up on Yelp, we found the door."

The bouncers are snotty, the bartenders are uncomfortably quiet and rude, and the floor is sticky.

Who do you think you are to give peoples&#39; rules?!?!? I think you can be very sophisticated, provide an elegant and upscaled type of environment without being rude, and this place for me it is just rude."

Very intimate, cozy and cool.So anyways, riding solo in Chicago for a few days, I found out about this place and immediately put it on my to-go list. Ever since I saw Anthony Bourdain do an absinthe pour in Paris on that travel show - the name escapes me for some reason grr - I&#39;ve always wanted to do one. I&#39;ve had a few absinthe cocktails, and they were ok, but never the poir. Let&#39;s face it, I wanted to do the pour because it looks fucking cool. Anywho, I came here past the mural, thru the hallway, and behind the curtain solely to do the absinthe pour.When you&#39;re being seated, if you&#39;re waiting on your party, the hostess won&#39;t seat you til your entire party arrives (overheard from another guy in line). I had no trouble getting seated right away since it was just me. The hostess explains they do have some house rules - no flash photography, no overdoing it on the phone talking those were the big ones which she explained to me. Elsewhere posted were no baseball caps, they have no cheap shitty beers, and a few other things. They do take pics for you with the flash if you want evidence of your attendance, so I don&#39;t think that one&#39;s a hard and fast rule.As for the pour, I had two different absinthes and they were both good. They walk you thru doing a pour and w me being a nube, I did the full pour and both sugar cubes. Didn&#39;t order any food, so can&#39;t comment on that. Definitely making my way back when I&#39;m in Chicago again :-)"

Its was as if waiting for the murder mystery to be solved. The reveal was amaing. A cozy high class place with a grandeur which is unmatched. Had 2 cocktails and a cake.

You have to try it.&#34;I kept putting it off because waiting in line is not my thing. Finally caved in a few weeks ago.First off, there was barely a line. We got in about five minutes after standing outside.When you walk in past the door there is a robe before you actually enter. The bouncer had us wait in that small space between the door and robe for a minute or two. I&#39;m convinced they do it to build suspense because once you get in your like, &#34;Uh, this is it?&#34;It just seems like they&#39;re following the basic speakeasy formula. Dim the lights, throw in some odd shaped furniture, create witty, hipster names for your drinks and viola you&#39;re done. There was nothing special about this place that makes me want to go out of my way to get here let alone wait in a line if there is one.I&#39;m a simplest when it comes to drinks so I looked at the menu like it was in another language. Our cocktail waitress was very sweet though. She asked me what I usually drink and tweaked one of their drinks to better suit my taste buds.One of my friends doesn&#39;t drink and got a mocktail. Waitress said she&#39;d surprise him with something and it actually turned out really well. Tasted better than some of the drinks my other friends got.Although I&#39;m not over the moon about this place, I still gave it 4 stars because our waitress was awesome, my drink was good, I didn&#39;t wait in line, and service was quick.If I came on a busier night and spent an hour waiting in line and getting my drink like some reviewers below I&#39;d definitely say this place isn&#39;t worth it."

We had to wait about 15 minutes before a spot open up at a table or the bar.The drinks were pretty good. I had the Daquiri and the Moscule Mule. My date ordered the Old Fashion and said Violet Hour makes the best one in the city. Not too sweet and syrupy.One thing I sort of disliked where we were sitting at cause it had me facing directly into another couples conversation and it was hard to focus on my own. Other than that nice romantic spot.Side Note: Like all Speak Easy spots they try to throw in your face it&#39;s only for the cool kids who know how to get in :) The door blends into the mural and if it wasn&#39;t for my date I would have never found this place. No sign....nada....makes it more fun though.

Unfortunately when we went, there was a wedding reception that reserved 3/4 of the space downstairs so they only had 1/4 of their space left for everyone else. We didn&#39;t get in on the first seating so we ended up waiting an hour. Definitely try to come in smaller groups as your party won&#39;t be seated until all of you are there.I ordered the &#34;much obliged&#34; which was amazing! Very refreshing and easy to drink, knocked this one back in a couple minutes. Also tried the &#34;dark and stormy&#34; and the &#34;pimms cup variation #15&#34; which were pretty good as well but the fave was definitely still the &#34;much-obliged&#34;. Best call of the night was ordering a side of fries to munch on while we sipped our delicious cocktails. We were a bit hesitant to order food since we had a dinner reservation afterwards but so glad we got these. These were probably some of the best fries I&#39;ve had especially paired with the herb aioli. (My feelings about these fries might be slightly influenced by my inebriated state at the time but I promise they&#39;re pretty bomb :P)We got seated at the bar so I didn&#39;t get to enjoy their awesome looking tall-back chairs, but we got the chance to see some of the bartenders in action and they&#39;re definitely very knowledgeable mixologists not to mention personable and friendly. Would love to come back and try more of their amazing libations."

How else am I going to instagram my drink with my bestie?Really though, it&#39;s a nice place for cocktails. They are a very good value ~$15, and the food isn&#39;t half bad. I recommend the fries with garlic aoli to soak up some of the alcohol. To get in, you have to find it first. It&#39;s a bit hidden, since the door is blended into the wall and then painted over with a mural. Some of the recent murals have been kind of weird. I might not just understand hipsters.Usually, though, there is a huge line so just get close and get in the first line you see. Since there are no reservations, your whole group must be there to get in. That means you won&#39;t be able to have somebody else meet with you later at the Violet hour. Alternatively, it makes getting in a bit easier. They only let people in when there is available seating, so a group of 3 might get in before the group of two in front of them just for seating optimization.Once in, there are three main rooms and a bar. The front room has tall chairs which make talking very easy and you can keep it as open/private as you want. The second room has the bar and is where the hall to the bathrooms are. The bathrooms are all larege individual rooms which is great. I don&#39;t really judge places by their bathrooms, but I seriously love the bathrooms here. You could have a secret pow-wow or really reexamine your life in them.The third room is my favorite. I came to the Violet Hour for NYE and we sat right in front of the fireplace here. On either side of the fireplace are L couches with tall backs. It really is very elegant.Despite how dark and sexy the ambiance is, it really isn&#39;t THAT intimate. The huge luxurious chairs make it hard to get close to your date, and the incredible drinks and great selection of music is oddly distracting from deep conversation.That staff is very hipster and they will go out of there way to help you... once you are actually inside. I would recommend this for reconnecting with friends, when you just feel like having a cocktail, and if you want to just drink and relax."

It reminds me of a bar in the roaring 20s.Located in a nondescript building (no sign outside) across from Big Star, you know you&#39;ve arrived at Violet Hour when you see a line around the block.My friends and I waited for around 20 minutes. The reason there is a line is that they only let you into the lounge once they have found seating for your party. I find this very considerate of a bar. Once you go inside, it is dark but they have a lot of cushy chairs, booths, and seating at the bar. The bartenders and servers are charming and they have perfected their craft. My friends and I were very pleased with our cocktails ($13 each).I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking to have a classy cocktail lounge experience / romantic date night. 5+ stars!"

I don&#39;t know why but I assumed it was like any other bar off the blue line and didn&#39;t give it much thought. The other night we were having a drink downtown after work and she suggested we go and I just went along with it.It&#39;s right by the Damen stop and there&#39;s no sign. This instantly made me happy. It reminded me of the Pink Door in Seattle&#39;s Post Alley. When you walk in you&#39;re shrouded in curtains and mystique. A soft-spoken man from behind the curtain asks how many and tells you not to use your cell phone. He then leads you to a high backed chair in a corner next to a small coffee table. When you scan the bar, you see another era. It really felt like a 20s speakeasy and not in a cheap touristy way.My friend and I tried a couple cocktails. I honestly can&#39;t remember their names but mine was a brandy cocktail with beer. They weren&#39;t overdone monstrosities masquerading as vintage drinks. They really looked simple and classic. Just the cocktails in the glasses. We ordered some nibbles. The dates wrapped in bacon were amazing and still piping hot when served. I hate lukewarm bar food. The deviled eggs are by far the best I&#39;ve ever eaten. However, they only serve three halves. It&#39;s infuriating. I know that other egg half was just sitting in the kitchen. I usually withhold a star from places that only give three halves but I just can&#39;t this time. I just can&#39;t! Our server, a tall blond girl whose name I didn&#39;t get, was just so polite and informative. So was our food runner: a guy with a long pony tail. The servers crouch down and get on your level. They smile and you can hear it in their voices. The amazing service made up for the missing egg half and I will be back!"

The line moves fairly quickly, so don&#39;t be discouraged if there is one. Without the line, this speakeasy is pretty inconspicuous.The interior is dim and intimate with all the rooms being separated by floor to ceiling, velvet curtains. All of the tables are lit only by candlelight, which gives this place that very intimate feel. I didn&#39;t feel any sense of pretentiousness that others have noted.The cocktails are perfectly crafted by their mixologists. I sat at the bar once and was blown away by the attention to detail that was put into each drink. Even the presentation is impressive. My personal fave (being the gin drinker that I am) is the Juliet &amp; Romeo, but every bourbon and rye drink I tried were equally as delicious. I&#39;m honestly I fan of anything they make with egg whites! They even made a special Sriracha drink for our table when we asked for something spicy, which may be my new go to drink there.It&#39;s definitely on the pricier side, but you&#39;re paying for great mixologists and a unique atmosphere.

This place is tiny and made a little person like myself slightly claustrophobic. I truly wonder how grown men can sit elbow to elbow like sardines and have a good time. The alcohol probably helps...Only one bartender that doesn&#39;t seem too chipper. He seemed pretty shocked that we ordered straight shots and the concept of shot glasses also don&#39;t exist in his world. He pretty much served us a half a glass of vodka each (equivalent to at least 2 shots). The shot in itself was also warm and did not go down smoothly. We also tried their Dark and Stormy which was AVERAGE and their banana daiquiri which was borderline undrinkable. Wouldn&#39;t go back or recommend.

Portishead.  I actually stayed longer because I felt like I was in a perfect time warp.  A few creepers straggled in, but I kept to myself and then ordered a Please and Thank You.  Rightful moniker too, I would have followed it with a &#34;yes SIR, may I have another!!, &#34; but it&#39;s still mid day and I had to drive home.  It tasted creamy and gingery.  If I had to date a drink, it would be this one.  Bourbon, brandy, apple pie shrub, demerara, lemon, and ginger beer.  Topped with citrus peel, and the straw right through.  I am for sure coming back, probably around the same time, as I&#39;ve seen other yelpers having difficulty grabbing a seat later.  #doyouevenmatchboxbro  Yes, yes I do.  btw, there are no &#34;bros&#34; here, thank the lord."

It looks like a dive, but it feels more like a no-nonsense bar where you go for some drinks. It doesn&#39;t have a specific time or occasion -- it is there for whatever you may need. I don&#39;t know how to explain it, but I just felt welcome here.I&#39;m not big into cocktails, but the cocktails here came in a reasonable end (all of the normal things) and a higher end (fancier drinks). I had something made with jelly and gin that was shaken up and it was delicious and I would get it a million more times.Good beer selection too! Some interesting things, some normal ones, more or less reasonable prices.When it comes to it, five star reviews are reserved for places that force me to give them.

The bar is small enough for patrons to sit at and just enough room behind the seat for ppl to walk by and bump you with their sweaty arms. The drinks are alright, they looked imaginative and the tenders make a large portion. They shake up your drinks and give you the shaker to pour out the rest.

Each time I walked in, I pretty much turned around and walked out. The second time I went, I forgot what bar it was and I had no idea why the heck my friend brought me back there when we pulled up along side of the building to park.When I saw the place the first time, I couldn&#39;t wait to get in because I thought that it was attached to the train car that was located behind it, making it look much larger than what it really was. Inside the train, I could see cozy tables with a candle light on top of each of them. I opened the door and immediately started making my way to the back of the building, searching for a way to make it to the train car. I was so excited! I got to the end and realized, to my dismay, that I was trapped in a space much like and old-school matchbox. Perhaps the space recalls the children&#39;s nursery rhyme that talks about an old woman who lived in a shoe.The second time I went, I was wearing a big fluffy coat (middle of winter) and carrying a larger purse because I had no idea where I was going. I tried to be nice and tolerate the experience, hoping that the place would be less crowded this time. I was wrong. There was nowhere to put my stuff down. The environment started to close in on me. It was then I noticed the thick moist air mixed with the smell of stale beer, hard liquor, and halitosis. Apparently oral hygiene isn&#39;t high on the list of the kinds of patrons who go there. I literally felt like if I stood there long enough, I would have caught the common cold. Had I stayed there and drank, I probably would have left with the flu virus attacking my lowered immune system (drinking does that).Everyone loves this place because the bartender is supposedly epic; and the clientele carry a universal personality of the blue-collar characters showcased in the tv series Cheers. Label me however you want to, but immediately I felt surrounded by old people who don&#39;t know how to dance; or don&#39;t enjoy dancing. I am a Wicker Park Girl, and I love the small dancefloor venues. I am not the kind of girl you&#39;ll find in a cocktail dress at Y-Bar. That&#39;s disgusting. I want to throw on blue jeans and dance and let my hair down.Matchbox doesn&#39;t even give you room to take your coat off.  I&#39;d be lying if I said that the people did not make you feel welcome. They do; but if I was single, I wouldn&#39;t go there to meet a guy at all. The kinds of guys that go, on top of their halitosis, do not hold my interest. Am I too old too handle this place? Am I too much of a cougar for thinking the crowds with rotting mouths are too ancient for me? I don&#39;t know. Perhaps a little bit of both. I am an older woman who is young at heart. If I am going to spend my money, I won&#39;t be wasting it or my time here. I get the sense that this is the place that twentysomething males and females retire to once they have hit their thirties and no longer care to brave Wrigleyville.Go if you must.

Lets not forget that part of it. The cocktails are GREAT and contain all the wonders of fresh juices, top class bitters, large ice cubes and lots of shaking. No, this isn&#39;t a swanky place that caters to the &#34;in&#34; crowd. It&#39;s better than this. It&#39;s a Harley Davidson-driving, black-bearded man with workmans hands and a belly laugh crafting exquisite cocktails in a tiny dive outfitted in knick knacks and paper money collected from around the world.

It&#39;s &#34;smallness&#34; forces you to meet new people.Hanging out at the Matchbox is kind of like drinking with my brother. Like my brother, the Matchbook is dimunitive in size, lives off the blue line, and doesn&#39;t really bat an eye if you fart. Even if you&#39;ve never been there, it has an &#34;everyone knows your name&#34; familiarity that larger, less tattooed, more successful bars (brothers) can match.I like dive bars, primarily because they usually lack the requesite 25 Flat Screen televisions on the Sportscenter loop. It seems to me that the less &#34;entertainment&#34; at the bar, the more human interaction. Well, the Matchbox adds the element that every time that you want to go to the bathroom, order a drink, or turn around, you&#39;re literally bumping into another patron. some might rate this as a negative, but it was kind of cool to be absolutely FORCED to meet the people surrounding you at the bar.Matchbox DOES have a small television right above the door. It was playing &#34;Last House on a Dead End Street,&#34; a 70s slasher movie. The aforementioned restroom is unisex, and at the far end of the bar from the entrance. It was pretty clean.The Box had an incredibly impressive selection of craft beer and spirits. Only 3 draught beers, but a good selection of local midwest microbrews from Bells, 3 Floyds, Left Hand, and Great Lakes. Behind the rail, the Box has 10, 12, and 15 year old Pappy Van Winkle Bourbon... pretty much the most delicious bourbon in the world. You know it&#39;s good because it&#39;s featured prominently on the TV show &#34;Justified&#34; - a drama where a Sherrif&#39;s Deputy drinks bourbon and/or moonshine, slays all of the goodlooking babes in this town, and shoots with impugnity (because it&#39;s justified). Sidenote: if you&#39;re looking for a guilty pleasure TV show, give it a watch.Long story short. it&#39;s a great place to grab a drink if you&#39;re in the neighborhood."

So, the ginger isn&#39;t very noticeable when you first sip this drink. It won&#39;t be overwhelming.

Makes for funny situations and conversations with passersby as you sit there inebriated, smiling ear to ear due to the superbly created cocktail made by yours truly, Cheech from Cheech and Chong. Except this Cheech doesn&#39;t smile, except at ladies and has longer beard whiskers. Cocktails are pricey, but well worth the cost. They are mixed up in front of you and the bartender will leave behind the shaker with some left over you can pour or they will at some point, pour for you.

I arrived first (as usual; I am terminally punctual) and claimed the last two seats at the bar and ordered a glass of red wine.It probably would have been a better idea to order a martini, but I was craving a robust red and wanted a Cabernet. The bartender was only able to scrounge up a Shiraz, but anyone that knows me is well aware that I do not discriminate when it comes to red - I happily drink it all.My friend arrived and ordered a Scrimshaw pilsner. I am not a beer drinker and had never heard of it before so kudos to MB for stocking a hidden gem.We were engrossed in conversation when I heard the opening riff of &#34;Come Together&#34;. Yep, MB was playing &#34;Abbey Road&#34; - the perfect soundtrack.We stayed a while and chatted with the bartender, who was very sweet, and commended her on her musical selection.Matchbox is as good as any place in the area.

There is way more seating outside, if the temp is right.That said, great place to meet friends or even someone new.

The crowd was a little bit older, less frat-boy like and would be more than happy to leave you alone if you left them alone.We found our bartender very friendly and knowledgeable about suggestions of where else to go for drinks and food.I loved that my Manhattan came with a &#34;friend&#34; (the rest of the shaker).

Once we got there....it looked like a hole in a wall southside bar. It was still early to go out so the place was not crowded...but the matchobox is sooo small that it looks like it could get crowded fast.There was an outdoor patio which I was dying to sit at because I felt like an old lady sitting inside this crappy looking bar. Then I looked around and realize that all the people that were there....were 20-30 somethings.So why 4 stars?? Let&#39;s talk about their drinks....the pineapple gimlet is AMAZING. They also have other great specialty drinks that they make from scratch.We got our drinks and sat outside and I would have never felt like I was in the tiniest bar ever.

I guess they are right when they say good things come in small packages, because this place is awesome... but man, is it small. A place this great should be at least 20 times it&#39;s current size, and they could call it Matchbox 20....Nothing? Hmm, well, it you didn&#39;t close your browser window already, then let me just give you a bit of advice. Try to sit close to the front door. If you grab a seat at the far end of the bar, it gets really, really narrow. This place can get &#34;packed&#34; and you&#39;ll be moving forward even 5 minutes for people trying to get to the bathroom in the back. I say &#34;packed&#34;, because a couple groups is all it takes to make this place seem full. So, the total number of people won&#39;t be that many, but it&#39;ll still be wall to wall people. The sign on the wall says max. 29 people, but unless they mean half balancing on the other half&#39;s shoulders, I don&#39;t see that happening. When the weather permits, the outside seating is very pleasant (and obviously adds some much needed space).The service is really great here, and you&#39;ll always get a good drink. This is definitely a good place to come after work or an event (a little early) with a group and just kinda take over the place for a few hours."

They make a mean Pisco Sour and it&#39;s hard to order wrong when all the drinks are made this well. They have a large amount of seating outside and that is much more comfortable than drinking inside. It&#39;s the size of a matchbox so if you are drinking at the bar inside every 40 seconds someone will graze your back trying to make it down the narrow walk to the bathroom. That can be annoying. It gets less annoying the more you drink. The bartenders here are awesome. Inside this bar you really feel like you&#39;ve left the city and are in your own little world.

They smell.  I can hear them.  If you&#39;re reading this and you want a bright, autonomous, creative, writerly type to work for you let me know, because my boss is not only crazy, but she farts.  As you can imagine, this can sometimes be very distressing to me.  Sometimes it is so distressing that I have to stop my commute home half way through and drink martinis alone in probably the smallest bar in Chicago.This happened last Friday after a long week down wind.  I stopped for just 1 dirty martini, and you can imagine what happened.  The gorgeous bartenders at The Matchbox washed me clean of strife and pain, that&#39;s what!! I got a dirty martini that was perfectly mixed and chilled and had no problem sucking it down while standing pushed against the wall watching the window outside while it rained.  If I&#39;d been smoking it would have been a fucking art movie it was so perfect.  Then I got a seat and made nice with some folks next to me and had the Pineapple Gimlet recommended.  I ordered it on a whim because their drinks are SO fucking cheap it&#39;s a crime not to have at least 2.  The nice man with the shaker and the vodka made a HUGE pour and set a pretty, frothy, icy pineapple drink, with a powdered sugar rim down in front of me.&#34;$8&#34; he said, as he set ::THE SHAKER:: on a coaster next to my glass.I looked at him suspiciously, &#34;Is that for me?&#34;&#34;Yeah&#34;, he nodded.My eyes widened.  I proclaimed it &#34;like a milkshake&#34; (the extras on the side I meant), won the lottery, was voted best looking in the bar unanimously, and then the sun came out after 3 days of rain, a double rainbow formed, and leprechauns danced around me tossing gold doubloons my way.  Of course I gave the doubloons to the elderly and less fortunate, having already won the lottery mere seconds before.That all really happened to me last Friday at 6:30 PM in The Matchbox.  Oh yeah, and then my boss called and told me she&#39;d never fart in my cubicle again because it&#39;s a disgusting and disrespectful thing to do to a gem of a person such as myself.All this, on top of getting 3 perfect, delicious martinis, for the price of 2."

From the first bite I was blown away by the delicious flavor of the beef. They season their beef perfectly,  not too overpowering nor too bland. The juice was definitely a perfect compliment to the flavorful beef. The meat was tender, yum. The giardinera was ok, the pieces lacked the crunch that goes along with the flavor, in my opinion. The fries were crinkle cut, not my favorite cut of fry, but they were delicious, especially with a cup of cheese  for dipping.  I am glad I found this place, it will definitely be added to my list of go to places for delicious Italian beef sandwiches."

They have free wifi so that&#39;s always a plus! Plenty of seating for solo work or group work too.Ordered a latte, cappuccino, Pesto sandwich, tomato quiche, and a glazed apple cider donut. Both of the beverages were good and did their jobs, which was to give us both a nice caffeine kick to start our morning. The Pesto Sandwich was very good! The mozzarella slices were generous as well as the smear of pesto sauce and the salami slices added such a nice bite to the ciabatta panini style sandwich. The Tomato quiche came with a side salad of Arugula and some zesty vinaigrette which was nice. The quiche was flavorful and filling. The apple cider donut was very yummy! It was not overly sweet, but was fluffy and fresh!I bought some other Italian cookies to take home, it was hard to choose given the vast selection but definitely check this place out!"

I stopped by here to pick up donuts for Donut Friday at work. I asked for two dozen but when I opened up the box at work there were only 22. I called up the bakery and they said that they would be happy to give me the two remaining donuts the next time I stopped by. It wasn&#39;t really a problem for me but if you&#39;re getting donuts by the dozen, please count them!The cake topped chocolate donut was amazingly gooey and rich without being overwhelmingly sweet, and the cinnamon donut was crisp and paired really well with the free coffee I got along with my purchase.Surprisingly, Scafuri is where I had one of the best breakfast sandwiches I&#39;ve had in a while. The egg and pepper sandwich had perfectly scrambled eggs and well seasoned peppers that didn&#39;t lose their crunch, in a sourdough muffin that held up well and didn&#39;t get soggy.The place tends to fill up fast during the morning rush, so get there fast if you want donuts or cookies. Worth a visit if you&#39;re in the neighborhood!"

I got the in house cappucino, a lemon twist cookie and a fig cookie while my brother got the chocolate chip.  The chocolate chip was big and thick but not as chewey as we wouldve liked but thankfully not too sweet.  The lemon twist was really delicious which a light tart glaze and a cakey cookie.  The fig cookie was also really tasty and was the same cakey type of cookie filled with a mildly sweet fig filling and chopped nuts.  The cappucino was also a prettg good size for the price (around $2.60) and the coffee was not too bitter.  Im just deducting one star for price and low volume of high demand treats (almost ran out of apple cider donuts when i came in the early afternoon of a weekday last year too).  Otherwise, cute place to spend a saturday!"

The free tasting was delicious and we got to try any combination you could think of before deciding what to order. We went with a vanilla cake with raspberry jam filling and a carrot cake with cream cheese filling and both were amazing. We even get a complimentary 1-year anniversary cake so that we don&#39;t need to eat something that was frozen for a year. We definitely recommend Scafuri Bakery for your upcoming wedding!

I ordered a 6 inch version of the cake this past weekend to bring to a small family gathering and sadly to say it did NOT impress and it was pretttty bad.The cake itself was extremely dry and hard even after leaving it out to come to room temp. The only response I got from the 7 people that ate it was &#34;whipped cream is really good&#34; but, who can&#39;t make good whipped cream?? I was so disappointed in the texture, unevenness of filling causing cake to buckle when cut and the overall taste of the cake it definitely was not consistent with what I had tried a couple of months ago.

Picked up a loaf of Italian White Bread,Fig, Pignoli and Chocolate Spice Cookies. The bread was still warm fresh out of the oven and the fig cookies are by far the best I have ever had. And you can never go wrong with a moist on the inside and little crunch on the outside Pignoli cookie. Will definitely keep them on my list for the holidays.

THE DONUTS! Seriously well worth the few miles walk at lunchtime. I ended up getting a Sopressata Sandwich (an Italian dry salami) provolone, hot giardinera and arugula in this wonderful home made biscuit type of bread. I mean although eating could be tricky, I managed to taste it and savored every last bite!If this is what going back in time is then I need a time machine. Incredible! And the fact that I sat in a vintage living room couch and table, it added to the experience. Including not to mention their 1940&#39;s music playing ever so softly as you have conversation with a friend. Oh I know Luigi would be smiling at this, and if you look around the bakery you will notice Luigi and the rest of the family staring back as the family is in vintage photos all over. This in fact takes you to the time that little Italy was in it&#39;s  beginning stages. It felt personal and you were part of the era.Use your YELP check in to get great percentages off items!

Super easy over email. Always phenomenal. We also had them do the wedding cake for my sister in law last year. Great prices, great cake! It was the least stressful part of the entire wedding.I&#39;m also a huge fan of the pignoli cookies and buy a 1/4lb whenever I&#39;m in the neighborhood. They also do homemade pizza dough by the pound, whole wheat or white and whatever you decide to put on top of it will become amazing. Great job rebooting this place ladies, you should be very proud."

We were able to use some very unique flavor pairings in our cake tiers, including balsamic caramel and salted caramel with fresh fruits. We also had bags filled with lemon knot, pignoli, and butter cookies sandwiched with chocolate. Yum, yum, yum. The Italian buttercream frosting is delicious as it is not sickeningly sweet. I usually hate buttercream frostings but was so happy when we fell in love with the work of this bakery. Long live Scafuri, a wonderful part of our neighborhood."

The cake itself is a medium density, and the jam&#39;s natural &#34;liquor&#34; soaks into the cake - creating Mmmmms from everyone eating it.  That&#39;s the ultimate compliment!  Another tasty one is the chocolate cake with cannoli filling.  I think what we appreciate is that the cakes and frostings are not overly sweet.  You can really taste all of the ingredients when your not overwhelmed with sugar!  Enjoy something different for your next party."

Very cozy with antiquish photos on the wall cool music playing in the background. They have a small selection of pastry items for sale( the waitress said they sold out early) but what was there looked good. The olive oil zucchini cake and lemon ricotta cake caught my eye. After much back n forth I chose the lemon cake. They even sell them in a regular loaf size and the baby cake size.The lemon cake was very dense, had a nice chew with flecks of vanilla beans sprinkled throughout the cake. The lemon icing was very good also. When you check in on FB, you get 3 free Italian cookies too.I will return for coffee and the zuchini cake soon."

My favorites included the lemon knots, the chocolate spice cookies, and the walnut cookies with the powdered sugar. My friend was in love with the chocolate toffee bars. The 1 lb. box of cookies was $15.95, and I also purchased a frozen pizza dough for $1.50 to use later at home. I&#39;ve also had a delicious fresh-filled cannoli from Scafuri&#39;s during the Italian Festival on Taylor St. in summer 2014; the filling is the right amount of sweet and a great  creamy consistency.

The crust was a bit tougher than I prefer but still good.The assortment of Italian cookies was tasty and truly provided a variety of flavors. They were good.We also stayed a bit to leisurely enjoy a cup of Intelligentsia coffee enhanced with a shot of espresso. The coffee was very good!We shared 3 scones while drinking our coffee. The cranberry orange was my favorite. The blueberry was very good. The chocolate chip was the least interesting. All three had excellent texture and were very light!

We worked with Kelly, who was incredibly helpful and responsive at every turn. We scheduled a cake and cookie tasting last year and, though we ultimately decided to go with another bakery for the cake, the cookies were delicious and planning was so easy. We ordered 17 POUNDS of cookies in 6 different flavors for pickup the day before the wedding. We bought little favor bags and Kelly was great at making sure to make the biscotti extra short so that they fit. She was crystal clear on pricing and, though we ended up bagging the cookies ourselves, Scafuri offered everything from bagging to delivery for a very reasonable cost!The day of pickup, I had my fiance call first thing in the morning to make sure the cookies were ready. The gentleman that he spoke with was very confused but eventually figured out our order and confirmed it was ready. Then, when my fiance arrived, a different(?) gentleman tried to ring him up for the cookies, though they were already paid for. Luckily, someone in the know stepped in and assured my fiance that he was good to go. The cookies were delicious and fresh! Our guests loved the edible favors and the variety offered was great! Working with Scafuri was so easy, and despite the little miscommunication with the staff on pickup, we had a totally smooth experience."

The people working there are not personable at all. There were multiple uncomfortable interactions with customers while I was there. They don&#39;t play any music which makes it even more awkward when you&#39;re sipping your coffee just witnessing the terse interactions between employees. One woman asked them if they had a mold problem because of the smell of the place. Apparently they have a grease overflow issue in the basement right now. The smell made me nauseous. I ordered a chai (disappointing, but I&#39;ve yet to find good chai in Chicago), a breakfast sandwich (low quality bacon, eggs, cheddar..just a mess), and a dense little pastry (was okay, but quite heavy). It came out to $17. I did ask for a small chai and he repeated it back correctly, then told the woman working that I wanted a large one. I reiterated that I wanted a small one, but he ignored me. I think maybe if you got pastries to go it *might* be a viable option, but I didn&#39;t find anything worthwhile about this place."

All of it top notch.Service was great...even though it was busy, the staff was buzzing around trying to take care of everything.Finally, the mood was great. Something about being on Taylor street listening to the kind of jazz that put Chicago on the map. Music was provided by the 12th Street Ramblers, who had a big band feel even though they were tucked into a corner.The only issue we ran into was seating, in that there wasn&#39;t much...but you can&#39;t fault a place for being popular.Highly recommend it if you are in the area, or if you aren&#39;t in the area but are looking for something different to do on a Sunday."

I went in and was slightly overwhelmed, they have coffee, sandwiches, soups, sweets, and a lot more. I was debating between the ricotta pound cake and a pumpkin bar. The worker was extremely kind and helpful and showed excellent customer service.She helped me decide on the pumpkin bar (seasonal item. Ricotta pound cake is year round!) and it was absolutely delicious. You can tell it wasn&#39;t just pumpkin flavouring, but there was legit pumpkin in there. It was a hefty size too. I&#39;m already deciding what to get next time.Definitely worth giving a try!"

Great find. Cute place, family-owned since 1904, and friendly staff. At first, I ordered a coffee, an almond blueberry cake slice, and a small fig-stuffed cookie. The Intelligentsia Coffee is well-suited for drinking black, my preference. Fun fact: Intelligentsia Coffee originated in San Francisco although they are located in LA, Chicago and NYC now.The cake and cookie were good but not special so my eyes were drawn to the sfogliatelle on the menu. I had decided against it earlier because it looks like a flaky croissant; I&#39;ve never met a croissant that I loved. When I asked the counter person what it was, she described it as a flaky pastry with a lemon custard filling. The description did not appeal to me either since it sounded like a custard-filled doughnut. I purchased it anyway because my next 7 hours would be in an airport/airplane with only greasy fast food and overpriced nuts for food. Best decision ever. Yes, the outside is flaky but the inside is a dense, moist, orange-zest speckled cake. My internet research shows it&#39;s probably a filling of sweetened ricotta and cooked semolina. What is definite is it is delicious. I tried to photograph the inside but my picture was blurry (PEBCAK).  So take my advice and try the sfogliatelle. It&#39;s like online dating : it may not look like you&#39;ll like it, it may not sound like you&#39;ll like it, but you won&#39;t know until you actually try it. Enjoy."

This is by far the best Italian bakery in the city. Everything I had the chance to sample was better than the next - the cuccidati (fig cookies), sfogliatelle (sort of like a danish, pastry with cheese filling), cannoli (filled to order) and the lemon ricotta cake. I feel pretty justified in saying whatever you get is going to be a winner."

Kelly was very helpful the whole way through, from our tasting to finalizing our order (after having to go up a couple of cake sizes as more guests RSVP&#39;d yes than we had expected!). Our guests loved the cake, and we are looking forward to enjoying this same cake again for our first anniversary. (Scafuri includes a small complimentary cake one year later, so no need to freeze the top layer.) Would definitely recommend them, we tasted cake from several other bakeries and Scafuri&#39;s was our favorite. We were really glad we chose them!"

The only thing I would have done differently is to have ordered either another layer or larger cake because all our guests wanted to take home a couple pieces of the cake!  We&#39;ve been long time customers and all their baked goods are wonderful - cakes, cookies and donuts."

The first thing I had there was the Daily Toast, which was whole wheat toast with fresh ricotta and fresh fruit. The toast had strawberries on top that day, and it was finished with honey and fresh black pepper (om nom). The ricotta pound cake is a lemony, ricotta-y (it&#39;s a word, no?) delight. The cannoli are out of this world; they are filled to order and you get to choose whether you want the ends dipped in pistachios or chocolate chips, but no chocolate chips in the filling, which is as things should be!They make beer bread using grains from Revolution Brewing, and it&#39;s fantastic. I finally had one of their sandwiches for lunch today, and it was delicious. This place is a real gem with very friendly staff, and you should check it out!"

We figured we&#39;d try one because it was the restaurant&#39;s namesake. It was... fine. Basically tasted like a taco barfed onto bread - though not a particularly flavorful taco. At this point, we weren&#39;t impressed.We got the Taco Arabe - unusual with its flour soft shell... immediately I&#39;m skeptical - however, the taco packed a punch. The flavor was nice and I, for one, liked it. A bit different, it reminded me more of a fajita than a taco, but whatever, I can dig it. However, that sucker was spicy, so my friend, at the warning of our server, forwent the sauce - this was mistake #1, as the sauce is what provided almost all of the flavor on the taco. Resulting in her basically eating a bulky flour tortilla with flavorless meat. She was not impressed.The next taco I had was the carne asada taco and it was solid - couldn&#39;t find anything to complain about it or necessarily rave about it. Now we are onto my friend&#39;s second mistake: she only got the one sauceless taco because she thought she&#39;d be full after that and the Cemita. So while I had an interesting taco and a solid taco to judge. She had a bland taco and nothing else.As such, on the fence about whether we would recommend.** Quick sidenote - A+ service at this location**"

Went with the team on Taco Tuesday and not just any Taco Tuesday the annual Taco Tuesday. We were concerned there would be a huge line, but there was not. Probably a sign that things weren&#39;t going to be good.First the good. The ambiance was very nice for a fast casual place. And as mentioned previously no huge lines to contend with. Out door seating was a nice bonus. Note this is a fast casual establishment. The last good thing was the guac.Service, we had a group of 7 and we each ordered a group of various tacos. But they didn&#39;t serve them how we ordered them. Instead of serving a plate of Chicken, Vegi, and Chorizo, they served all the Chickens on one place and so on. So we had to go through each lunch size plate and scavenge for our food.And then the food, only one person said they liked the taco&#39;s and would return. Everyone else said the food was boring, dry, etc... They have three hot sauces. Two of which have no flavor or heat. I was poring those two on each of my taco&#39;s to attempt to add some flavor to mine. The third sauce had flavor but it tasted more like a bad BBQ sauce."

The pork is juicy and flavorful and quite unlike any other taco I&#39;ve had. The pescado I wasn&#39;t as much of a fan; the slaw was a bit too creamy for my tastes, and I found the cecina flavorful but a bit on the salty side.Overall, fantastic, friendly service with good food that won&#39;t kill your wallet.

For me, it starts with the bread. Bread is so much more than just the transportation device that seamlessly shovels deliciousness into my mouth hole.  You need both a decent bread to filling ratio as well as something substantial enough to stand up to the filling without overwhelming it.  Next comes what&#39;s in between the bread...I subscribe to the school of keep it simple. You&#39;ve got me with quality ingredients in the right proportion to one another.Cemitas could write a how-to book on sandwich construction.  The sesame rolls are fresh and hold up well even when you over do it with that insane chipotle sauce.  The meat to bread to cheese to avocado to sauce ration is spot on. The Arabe I had today was loaded with porky goodness topped off with lightly melted Oaxacan cheesy perfection. Admittedly, I am heavy handed with my sauce use...but only because it is so good!Long story short, if you&#39;re in the West Loop with $7 in your pocket that you don&#39;t know what to do with I highly suggest you 1) contact me and give me the $7 or 2) go to Cemitas Puebla and gave you a delicious bite to eat."

At 2 pm on a Saturday, I had no issue with a line. I had a milanesa sandwich, which is the breaded pork loin. The highlight for me was the bread. The sesame seed bread is house made and it is one of the best breads I&#39;ve ever had. And as a big time bread fan, that is saying a lot. If I could buy those rolls by the dozen, I would.The pork cutlet was thin, but well flavored. The sandwich also had chipotle sauce, avocado, and a lot of shredded Oxacan cheese. There was so much cheese though, that it overwhelmed the rest of the sandwich, so I had to take some of that off. I also had an Al pastor taco and a taco arabe, which is their pork and onions cooked over a spit fire. I added some of their medium salsa to both, it was a wonderful salsa and added an extra kick that the tacos needed.With a fountain drink, my sandwich and two tacos ran me about $22. The food isn&#39;t exactly cheap, but it&#39;s a unique product and it&#39;s made well. I would likely return if I was in the mood."

It was the perfect fast casual lunch we were looking for. Even though there were lots of great sounding menu options, but we came for the cemitas.My husband and I ordered the al pastor and carne asada and swapped halfway. Both were really large and really good. The sesame seed rolls these come on are great too, rather than just being a carby afterthought. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to order either of these again. The sauces were a hit as well. The smoky chipotle one is obviously their thing, but I liked them all. We also ordered the large chips and guac. Big mistake in that the portion is so big, we didn&#39;t end up finishing it all. Two people will definitely be fine with the smaller size.They sell alcohol at this location, but I opted for the horchata. It was sweeter than I&#39;m used to (not in a bad way) and ended up being a liquid dessert of sorts.Glad we finally made it to Cemitas Puebla, especially since we were able to sit outside at one of their dog friendly sidewalk tables.

We strolled in around 11:10 am and were their first customers of the day. It&#39;s a bright, cozy little place down in the Fulton Market area. It&#39;s not very big so I can imagine it gets pretty busy during other times of day. The people at the counter were very friendly and helped us through the menu and gave some suggestions. I went with the Al Pastor cemita (the cemitas are the giant sandwiches you see in the pictures). For $2.99 you can add chips/salsa and a fountain drink which I thought was a great deal. Everything on the menu is very affordable, which is a nice change from the vast majority of places in that area.The cemita was massive and really delicious. The bun is nice and crisp and they give a generous amount of their house cheese on the cemita (I forget the name for it). They give you three sauces at the table to try and all of them are pretty solid. I didn&#39;t find any of them to be particularly spicy if you&#39;re concerned about that. Lastly, the pork was well cooked and nicely seasoned on my sandwich. I also really enjoyed the chips and guac! You can definitely tell the chips are homemade.

The atmosphere is delightful, the service was quick and cheery, and the food/drinks were divine. And I do not use that word lightly.On warm days (even unseasonably warm days like the ones we had in early March), Cemitas opens up the garage doors that constitute the front wall of their restaurant. Has a patio and isn&#39;t afraid to use it. Check.When we walked in, the service was friendly and helpful. Daily specials were posted on a chalkboard (Mon-Fri happy hour is half off margaritas), and the menu was both on the wall and in paper.We sat down at a table and were brought three salsas in squirt bottles... I was instantly skeptical. After sampling each salsa, the worst part about them was that it was too hard to choose which salsa to put on each bite of chip! They were AWESOME! As an unofficial guacamole expert, I can say this place does it right- the tang, spice, and saltiness was perfect, and the best part was that it was super reasonably priced!I had the opportunity, no, the blessing to try the elite taco de government precioso (steak and chorizo), the cemita de arabe (roasted pork and onion), and just a plain old quesadilla that nearly blew my socks off. Let&#39;s start there. How do they take a tortilla and cheese and make my eyes nearly pop out of my head? I have no idea, but it was amazing.

Their tortas are unlike any I&#39;ve ever tried before. The sesame roll is amazing, the texture is both soft and crispy and holds the delicious meats and toppings very well. So far I&#39;ve tried to the split pork and the milanesa. Both fantastic! I think the milanesa is hands down my favorite. Their prices are a little on the expensive side compared to other Mexican fast food places but the quality is superb. Worth every penny. The guacamole is actually pretty cheap and it comes with a surprisingly large portion of tortilla chips.The three table sauces are also incredible and I love to just pour it all over my torta. I haven&#39;t tried the tacos and I really don&#39;t have any interest in ordering any in the future. I&#39;ve seen other people order them and they just don&#39;t look as good as the tortas. Stick with the tortas, you will not regret it.I plan on returning for happy hour. Between 5-7pm they have half price margaritas!! I really want to try those.Staff is friendly and the decor is hip and relaxing. I will be back for sure."

Out of all the places I dined at so far, this was the most disappointing."

I feel that they are putting less meat and less ingredients in the cemitas at this new location.  I felt like i was mostly eating bread. At the old location it was pouring out with meat and I loved it.  The most recent cemita barely had any meat.  I will give it some more tries but if quality continues to to be subpar then I may stop going here.  My only hope is my last visit was a fluke and the original quality returns as I used to love the food here.On another note getting an order from grubhub is not nearly as good as getting it fresh."

I love their salsas on the table, especially the green one (there are 3 kinds), and it sounded like you could buy them to take home (which I&#39;m now seriously considering). My boyfriend and I also shared the chips and salsa which were delicious too. Everything seemed really fresh and well made and it was a lot of food for what you pay for.

With that being said, I had expectations that their Fulton location would be just as good as the original.The design is sleek, and branding has definitely been focused on. It feels new and hip but still approachable. But looks aside, I was disappointed for a cold, dry sandwich to show up in front of me. Perhaps they are pre shaving meat to save time? I would understand if it was deep into the lunch rush, but it was a lazy Friday night with no wait. The boozey drinks are a welcome addition. Though my spiked horchata was far too cinnamon-y, the price point was fair and I&#39;m sure the other drinks have potential.All in all, I think that if the urge to cut corners is minimized for the sake of food integrity, this location can be just as good as the original."

The plate glass windows at the front of this casual restaurant were opened wide - offering an al Fresco atmosphere and a great view of the neighborhood denizens with their strollers, pooches and hangovers.To start we ordered the guacamole to share - it was exactly what I would expect: fresh with a nice balance of seasonings, served with crisp, lightly salted chips..For the main course we chose the sandwiches that are the house specialty. Caveat: this was the first time I have tried them.I went with the al pastor - spicy pork and onions dressed with the standard toppings that come on each sandwich (avocado, Chipotle sauce &amp; Oaxacan cheese). All in a substantial homemade sesame seed roll.It was a nice combo - but I generally like more kick. So I added a little spice from one of The 3 bottles of sauce on our table (that range from mild to very hot).I also ordered a side of the jicama slaw which was amazing! And thought what the heck - I&#39;ll shove some into the sandwich too! It was delicious.My friends got the pollo and carne asada, sandwiches and they were pleased with their selection.It wouldn&#39;t be fair to compare Cemitas Puebla to a traditional sit down Mexican restaurant.  It defies categorization:  but if you like quick service similar to Corner Bakery but in a nicer, smaller, stylish room;  and sandwiches and other selections featuring distinctive regional flavors &amp; fresh ingredients - then this is a winner!"

Incredibly expensive for barely any food. Tacos were smallest I&#39;ve ever seen (for 3.50 and zero flavor). Al pastor cemita had no flavor as well (which I had yet to encounter throughout the entire city). Save your time and money and go to literally any other place in the city.

It was served cold, almost chewy and raw. Complemented by the green salsa. It was interesting but I would not be ordering it again. I wish it were better seasoned.My friend got the Atomica and loved it.Now they had a half priced promotion on Doordash. I ordered the maximum possible.4: the Al Pastor Cemita was decent. It is a very large portion, the bread is soft and doughy, but most of all, the meat, cheese-string patty, and some avocado are fried to a very nice combination. It&#39;s definitely not quite Xoco&#39;s level, but then again it&#39;s a lot cheaper.2: Milanesa Cemita .. Very meh. The meat was not very fresh, and it did not make my tastebuds happy.3.5:  Veggie Cemita. Zucchinis, onions, green peppers, and button mushrooms. It is overall, done very well and will satisfy many a vegetarian. There&#39;s the right level of umami goodness, and with the green and red salsas, it goes down very well."

Go for their namesake, and get Cemitas here. Specifically the Cemita Atomica. That sandwich alone is enough to warrant the 5 stars.So how do they make their sandwiches here? First, start with a sesame bun which is large enough to hold all the meat, while still being soft and flavorful. Next, a layer of fresh avocado, which brightens the sandwich and adds a healthy dose of fat and creaminess. Then your meat. Of course, at this point you&#39;ve already decided to order the Atomica, which has 3 meats(ham, breaded pork loin, and grilled pork loin). And then top with Oaxaca cheese, the perfect texture between melted and stringy, and another bun.You order at the counter, and then they bring the food out to you and clean up after you as well. They also provide you with 3 house hot sauces, which are all delicious. I like to mix the orange and red one, and spread it generously on my cemita as I scarf it down. The portion is also quite sizeable; you will not be hungry after one of these sandwiches.Next time I come by, I think I&#39;ll give the Carne Asada Cemita a try. Or maybe just stick to the Atomica again. 3x the meat, 3x the deliciousness."

The quesadilla was delicious but you can&#39;t really mess up melted cheese.The margaritas were disappointing.

The cemitas at this location taste like they&#39;ve been reheated and the prices are much higher. The ingredients are different, skimpier on the avocado and the meat was grisly and not freshly prepared. I wouldn&#39;t mind the higher prices for the higher rent location, but the quality has taken a steep decline. I miss the old location where the owner and his son were always there.The bathrooms are a hike to get to, you have to walk down a long hallway and down a flight of stairs that for some reason is so heavily scented with a strong disinfectant that it makes you choke.Parking around the restaurant is pretty much nonexistent."

I chose the popular Arabe which is a spit roasted pork, which was very tasteful. The cemitas is like a size of a burger. The combination of oxacan cheese, avocado, special sauce on the tablet, and the warm soft sesame bun was full of flavor.Quesadilla with chicharron: This is a jumbo size quesadilla that can cover your whole face. The cashier rcmd ordering with chicharron (pork rind). Sounds heavenly and ready for a heart attack. It was delicious with the chihuahua cheese and the crispyness of the pork rind.Minus one star because I was only able to eat half the cemitas and half of quesadillqa.

Which i found odd because they were just standing in the kitchen not doing anything if ur gonna be lazy then at least hide so i dont see u or pretend to work. One good thing though was they exchanged something we didnt like for something else with no additional charge which is good because some places dont care. Regarding the atmosphere its cute i like the skull aspect of the restaurant its really cool and modern i would say a total hipster spot for sure.Ceviche: i was really disappointed with this. Im mexican so i had my share of ceviches in my life and this was nothing special like its basically a pico de gullo ( spicy mexican tomato salad) with tilapia. It says it came with octopus and shrimp i didnt see any octopus at all like none and there was like the tiniest amount of shrimp. The actual taste of it was really bland needed salt alot of seasoning heat and lemon or lime. Then there was hardly any seafood in it. The chips were seasoned good but were old dont ever serve me old chips no eww not im not an animal and they were kinda greasy  too wouldnt order this againCemita pata: pata is either chicken feet pork feet or cow feet in this case its cow feet. Ik ur thinking like omg why would u wanna eat that sounds gross like ewww i would never but the weird things always taste the best always try everything dont be afraid to try new things. Ive had pata before and its really good if done properly that means removing the hair yes sometimes it has hair and seasoning it properly. It tastes better on a tostada i was skeptical seeing it on a cemita and i should have just not ordered it but i did. My mom ordered it and took one bite and was like omg its horrible like she was so happy and excited because she likes this And she looked so sad like a child not getting what they want for christmas so then i tried a lil bite and was like eww no i cant. Something about it was just really off putting like there was no seasoning so it just tasted like straight from the jar which is not a good thing so we asked for something else and god was loving me extra hard today and the waiter gave us something else instead woot woot!Cemita atomica: this was amaizing i was really skeptical about trying a cemita because i never had one before so this was a complete new experience for me. Picture torta bread with sesame seeds and just having a better taste to it like its not bland ver delicous. This cemita comes with jamon, carne enchilada, melanesa. Omg it was huge like literly i couldnt finish it was so much meat!!!!! What i also enjoyed was there wasnt any of ur typical mexican fillers lettuce, tomato, rice, or beans just all tasty goodness! They put so much cheese on here like if u try to squish the sandwhich all the cheese would be acting like a spring which will make u not be able to squish it. All the flavor combinations worked beutifully together like it was so good. The melanesa was cooked perfectly not to thin not to thick not greasy seasoned really well. The jamon was tasty not salty or processed tasting. Only complaints were there was way to much jamon like it was mostly that and i didnt see any carne enchilada(grilled pork loin)?? Just put less jamon snd more of other ingredients and boom best thing ever!Cemita melanesa(breaded pork loin): when the pata was a failure we asked for this instead. Ok the problem is that the melanesa was really thin think like paper thin there were two pieces but for a big torta? Just the meat to bread ratio was off either put more melanesa or another meat or make it into a toco instead because it didnt work still tasty though just needs more meat!Taco arabe(spit roasted pork and onions): be warned if u dont like spicy food dont order this! Because u might get a heart attack its not like omg u eat it and ur head explodes but it is spicy. omg this was heavenly. When i opened it up it didnt look appetizing but omg was it good it was seasoned perfectly not bland at all the grilled onions really enhanced the tacoChalupa: This was not a traditional chalupa it was just 4 tacos covered in cheese lol the carne asada tasted amaizing but some of the pieces were completely burnedCookie: i was expecting that typical dry flavorless mexican cookie polvoron but it was really good not the worst not the best the chocolate however wasnt so tasty tasted cheapRicecrispy not goo"

I had gotten a DoorDash delivery coupon in the mail, and DoorDash also had a special on a couple menu items. I hadn&#39;t known anything about this place, but it sounded interesting.We got one of the specials (Pollo Cemita--AKA chicken for you gringos, and only $2 rather than the regular $8--deal!), another cemita (Al Pastor--yummily-prepared pork, gringos) and guacamole &amp; chips (um, avocado... never mind). (The ordering and delivery experience was excellent, but that would be another story:goo.gl/LE02hN.)Wow, we were very pleased. The bread was tasty &amp; sturdy, without having gotten soggy in transit, and the meat and accompanying sauces were savory and, dare I say, succulent? We added grilled onions to the Al Pastor, and they made it that much better. I&#39;m a guacamole snob--I make it as well as anyone (yeah, I said it, bee-atch!)--and theirs was excellent. The homemade chips were excellent, if slightly greasy (though probably made more noticeable by the wrapping).Voy a visitar en persona pronto.

The cecina was done surprisingly well (4/5), and it tasted very good with their green salsa. The orange-red salsa tasted like it had tamarind maybe, so I do not recommend it unless you like the modern Mexican mixtures of sweet and salty together. (Perhaps this is also a region-specific salsa recipe, in which case, then I could just not be used to it.) Also, the dark red salsa was pretty if you want a smokey and hotter salsa--perhaps guajillo-pepper based. Anyhow, from there the food honestly got bland (2/5). The al pastor meat was a bit harder than I&#39;m used to and didn&#39;t have enough of the distinct al pastor sauce it&#39;s supposed to be prepared with. I could also tell that it wasn&#39;t prepared on a shawarma-like Mexican spit with pineapples and shaved. Lastly, the carne asada taco was very basic. I recommend just going for cecina, trying other tacos, or just do cemitas. I&#39;ll give this place another shot for the cemitas it&#39;s known for next time. The service was pretty fast and friendly, and the place is a clean, modern, small-medium location."

They&#39;re pimped out tortas that start with seasoned meats and melted cheese. Layered with avocado and chipotle sauce then topped with an awesome sesame seed bun which is what really separates them from other sandos of a same family.The carne asada or atomica are solid bets that will fill your belly without emptying your wallet to the extent that XOCO would. Served with several sauce options on the side it&#39;s a pretty spectacular experience for your taste buds if you like awesome bread with your Mexican food.Super nice staff and an owner that&#39;s really hands on always shaking hands and kissing babies. Really happy these guys came down to this hood.

It was a long roundtrip drive but worth every minute of it. I found Cemitas because of Guy F from Triple D and thought I need to eat there. After my first visit, I was not let down. Thanks Food Network for introducing me to a Chicago original. I am a lifelong fan of this place.Fast forward to this week, when my buddy wanted to grab lunch in the neighborhood. Our dilemma was where do we eat considering we have probably eaten everywhere in our hood. I suggested Cemitas and he jumped at the opportunity.This location is much different visually then the original location but what hasn&#39;t changed is how delicious the food is. It is amazing for me to see Cemitas grow up and become hip and cool. The interior is very modern and clean. I love the large community tables. It always reminds me of eating in Europe. But don&#39;t be afraid there are small tables too if you want to eat alone. I love all of the glass which brings in a lot of natural light. The front interior can be opened on nice days. I hear there will be tables outside next summer. This modern design fits perfectly into the Fulton Market area.We ordered our food and grabbed a table. I noticed that they now serve beer which is something the old location never had. I will have to come back another day and try a cemitas with a ice cold cerveza. Hey don&#39;t judge me for not drinking at 1pm in the middle of the week.I ordered an Arabe Cemitas which is basically pork and onions but this meat is special because it is roasted on a spit-fire. As a guy, I just love meats that are cooked on a spit fire. I wish I had one of these at home. When is my local Best Buy going to start selling these? This delicious roasted pork and onions is then added to hand shredded oaxaca string cheese and served on their perfectly toasted sesame seed bread.  It is a fantastic sandwich. I also love their fresh made salsas. They offer three different ones to choose from but I love the green avocado/jalapeño salsa. It adds just the right amount of kick without over powering all the flavors. After my first bite I realize I&#39;m in trouble because this place is now within walking distance from my house. All I can say what took you so long to get here? And welcome to the neighborhood because you fit in quite nicely.My buddy got the chicken cemitas and loved it. I had no idea that this was his first one ever. I would have thrown some confetti in the air. From his reaction I know that it won&#39;t be his last. We also shared a steak quesadilla with cheese and it was really good. The steak was cooked perfectly and full of flavor.Prior to us leaving we also had a chance to talk to the owner Tony. I love how he made me feel like an old family member.  The food business should be personal where an owner should know their regular customers. It may seem old school but I think that&#39;s the best way of building a loyal customer base. It also doesn&#39;t hurt that his food is unique and really good.So if you&#39;ve never had a cemitas then maybe today is the day. It is a perfect step away from the typical sandwiches you are use to. I guarantee you will enjoy the flavor combinations as you take your first bite. I&#39;ll even come by and through confetti on you if you want."

Well, I didn&#39;t really need more meat but it just rolls of the tongue. Another great addition to the Fulton Market hood. They fit in well with their surroundings and fill the gap with their Poblano foods. I was on a mission to get a cemitas and I got my fill.At about 8 bucks for this creation and its worth it. No inflated West Loop prices to my surprise. The al pastor with onions, oaxaca cheese, and the fresh baked bread hit the spot. We ordered a couple tacos along with chips and salsa. The tacos weren&#39;t anything to write home about but simple and authentic. The chips were fresh and the salsa was prepared fresca style. Three bottles of sauce accompany your meal. Not labeled but the chipotle and verde were my favorite.I will visit again for the atomica, quesadillas, and the horchata. The interior is simple yet unique and they have a few picnic tables on the sidewalk along with a standing bar area. Fulton Market is worth the trip alone and is this is a good place to kick it off."

Sad to say, I will never return again.  I will still keep the good memory I had about the original location in a safe place in my brain so I can maybe tell my kids about it one day... To do so, I need to not let these new locations tarnish it!  So this is how Cemitas Puebla will no longer see one another. Good bye..."

I even bought a bottle for home. We have ordered for work events and the food came hot and delicious. The atmosphere inside is very chill and I love that they have a out door area. Great for a quick work lunch or date night. I only wish they had their music up a little higher to set the mood.

I had the pleasure of dining here last week with my WL crew (whoop whoop) and its safe to say we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The restaurant it&#39;s very casual, where as you order at a counter, sit down, and you will be brought your meal. The decor is quite sterile, but not in an annoying way, in a modern chicy way, all complete with a skull cluster. Mad fun!So on to the food and drank. First, the margs are delicious! You can tell they are homemade and not some mixture crap from a bottle. For eats we ordered chips and guac, a chicharon quesadilla the 3 cemitas: Milanesa, arabe, and the al pastor. The guac was freshy fresh and the dilla was banging - the perfect mix of gooey cheese and crisp pork rinds. The cemitas were all quite tasty as well. I would say the arabe and the al pastor tasted similar, but very delicious. The Milanesa was good, although I felt it was lacking in flavor compared to the others. Have no fear - this was quickly remedied by adding one (or all) of the three sauces on the table. One mild, one hot, one chipotle....all so yummy!The only reason this review isn&#39;t getting a perfect rating is because of the price. For one round of drinks+food+tip we were looking at about $75. Make no mistake, the food was amazing but that&#39;s just a little steep when ordering at a counter. Regardless of the price, I will absolutely be back to try their tacos. Cemitas is a beautiful gem in the Fulton River district. :)"

Delivery took a bit but there is no one to blame, besides mother nature.We get the pollo and the milanesa. Aside from the texture, I couldn&#39;t differentiate too much between the two in terms of flavor of the proteins. However, in itself, it was quite tasty. They did not skimp out on the avocado, which was a plus. Bread was surprisingly still toasty when we got it and fit well with the rest of the sandwich. My favorite part was the accompanied salsas. The tomatillo was very nice and tangy. The red one was on fire but had a nice bitter note to it. The orange one was also spicy but not as intense.Enjoyed my first cemitas experience and would like to dine in next time."

My friend went for a hotter option, and my quick sample of it was positive. No, that&#39;s not cabbage piled on -- it&#39;s cheese!This place is casual and definitely off the beaten path, but it&#39;s worth a diversion if you are out exploring or are cool enough to live in the growing nearby neighborhood.

I ate very slowly so it wouldn&#39;t end, but it had to eventually. : (The steak taco was served traditionally with onion, cilantro and lime.

We ordered and shared the Milanese and al pastor sandwiches. Both were good. I chose to eat the sandwiches open faced because it was a bit too much bread for my liking. The milanese is fried breaded pork loin, a bit dry and very flat. Both sandwiches come with avocado spread, definitely not enough avocado to taste. The al pastor sandwich was supposed to be spicy but it was manageable. At the table there are 3 sauces to add to your sandwiches in varying degree of spiciness. Alcohol is available.Bottom line, I will come back for a quick bite but considering this place is seated right next to Publican Quality Meats, only if PQM is packed and I am REALLY craving Mexican food.

Overall impressions - good Mexican food (can&#39;t comment on the authenticity related to the Puebla region because I have not been to that part of Mexico), really good for lunch, liked the feel of the place, tables were being bussed very attentively, don&#39;t care much for the neighborhood (parking is a bitch).  I&#39;d definitely go back."

The place is clean, the tables were solid (I hate rickety tables!), decor pleasant and very inviting, yet modern. Outdoor seating was available, though I opted out due to the weather.The food was great, simple (seemed like only a few ingredients), and delicious. I tried the chicken quesadilla and chicken cemitas. Three different chilled sauces were brought to my table and I had a very enjoyable lunch. I did like that there were cloth napkins and regular flatware, as someone else noted, since plastic is not only annoying but seems wasteful. The staff was very attentive.I guess my only criticism, if you can call it that, was that the dinner knife wasn&#39;t quite strong enough to efficiently cut the cemitas in half like I did. I mean I still managed, so maybe it doesn&#39;t matter.Will definitely be back again."

The arabe taco was unique and different.  It was roasted pork and onions with this amazing chipotle sauce that was very flavorful. The other tacos were good but these two dishes stole the show.  They also had great salsas - a mild avocado, medium chipotle and a hot sauce.We will definitely be back."

Walked in, I wasn&#39;t quite ready to order, so the gentleman at the counter took a phone call. I then stood for over 5 minutes as 6 other members of the staff stood around or were cooking and no one took my order. I proceeded to order 4 tacos and guacamole.With one other couple inside the restaurant, it took 6 humans 25 minutes to produce 4 tacos and guacamole. Pretty disappointed in the level of service as I was excited to try this place and live right next door. Other parties came in and were actually served before me as well (served within about 10 minutes). The tacos were average, guac was great, service was terrible. Will not be back and would not recommend. Management seems to be their largest issue."

I use to go to the original location on North Ave years ago and tried this location for the first time recently and was very disappointed by the portions. The portions of meat and filling have shrunk in my opinion especially for the tacos arabes. It&#39;s a $4 taco but you get enough meat for 1 bite. It even felt like they were skimming on the fillings for the cemitas. I can&#39;t remember the bread to filling ratio being being that bad.  Maybe I went on a bad day, but I don&#39;t plan on coming back."

SUPER fresh guacamole, homemade deep-fried chips, and three sauces at the table. Green (mild), red (medium), and RED HOT (hot). I also got the Pollo Cemita with avocado, lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. Super tasty flaky bread, savory meat, and delightful mixings. Notably, the cheese looks like it&#39;s freshly hand-shredded and piled onto the meat in thin strips--absolutely divine.Definitely enjoyed this high-end little fast food establishment.

Like, seriously, I had an AMAZINGLY FUN time eating this meal!!!First, I ordered the chihuahua, which is a bacon wrapped dog topped with avocado slices and pico de gallo. It came with a side of my choice; I chose tater tots. Gawd. The devil out here taking L&#39;s for this one.The hot dog was so PERFECT I almost cried when faced with the fact that it would soon be a thing of my past; Sad times. I ordered some chili on the side, which I had big plans for once I got the hotdog down. When I did, I poured the chili onto the tots, and BAM! - the second coming!!!!! All of it was perfection.The atmosphere is a hot dog stand; not much to describe there. The place is run by an ADORABLE older couple and they are SO sweet and super personable. I loved them. They checked in to make sure everything was tasty, which it was. The husband even offered to change one of the TVs to whatever I wanted to watch. So sweet!Everything you see came to $13 bucks; what a steal. THIS PLACE IS A GEM IF I&#39;VE EVER SEEN ONE. Exemplary customer service, delicious and thoughtful food and a thoughtful menu.

I love the make your own burger/sandwich option!My only gripe is they always ignore what is written in the specifications section when ordering online. Ask for no tomatoes? There will be tomatoes. Ask for no toppings whatsoever on your sandwich? All the toppings. Not a huge issue for me personally but it could be a massive issue for someone who has food allergies. If someone were to be allergic to something on a burger (let&#39;s go with tomatoes), request it come without it but the burger arrives with tomatoes? Depending on the severity of their allergy simply picking off the tomatoes wouldn&#39;t be enough. At this point you have to call and reorder and blah blah blah.

Simple and casual. Came here with my husband and friend. The three of us ordered abt $45 of food. The hangover, doggie special, mushroom burger and cheese sticks. Everything tasted great. The burgers were on pretzel buns which gave it the Kuma burger texture and the breaded mushrooms on the burger was delish. The service was great.  The guy was very helpful and nice.  Bought our food out to the patio for us.  We tipped, of course. Thank you.Only bad thing is..... the amount of grease smoke inside when they cook.  We originally were going to eat inside but once they start to cook,  the smoke fogged up the whole joint.  We had to retreat outside.

Flubs is definitely a place that has the &#39;attention to detail&#39; that Yelpers like myself and the other 400 some people saw!! I couldn&#39;t see the place as I was walking to try and find it, and all of the sudden noticed the tiny little shack in the basement!!!!! I couldn&#39;t believe when I walked in that THIS place was what all the hype was about!!!But looks are always deceiving, and I&#39;ve learned my lesson to never judge a book by the cover, and to never judge a hole in the wall as serving inferior food.I LOVE that you can chose between a classic Vienna dog (The Flubby) or the 1/4 all beef dog (The Chubby). I came here with 3 friends and we decided to order a bunch of stuff and cut it all into pieces. So I got to try the Flubby, Chubby, the Roe and the Greg&#39;s Hangover. I gotta say the Chubby was my favorite of the dogs, and surprisingly we all agreed that the Greg&#39;s Hangover reigned over the Roe, which is their signature burger. All and all though, the food here is terrific. The meat used here is top notch, and I knew it was going to be special when they asked how we wanted the burgers cooked, b/c you normally do not get asked that at your typical fast food hot dog joint.I guess the only thing I can say in terms of fast food was that it did take a bit longer than a normal. But man was it worth it. We can in around 1pm on MLK day, so perhaps we got lucky b/c there were only two other tables (4 people) in the joint. I could imagine it being quite a wait during the weekends, so be sure to try and come on an off time!!!I also thought the older gentleman working the counter was a very courteous and friendly guy. He steered us in the right direction and was super cool."

During, the weekdays the place is run by a couple obviously in the throes of  first love and the front of house suffers.  If there&#39;s a cook on duty, all is well.  If not,  I no longer go in.  BUT TODAY!  The short order cook was evidently in the throes of a nervous breakdown, throwing things around yelling that he does everything and perspiring profusely.  The cook disappears.  Okay. It&#39;s not the first time this has happened in a restaurant.  The owners are completely ineffectual at handling the situation.  The husband proceeds to shuffle about in the kitchen area and finally an order goes out.   The cook returns, observes  the mess in the kitchen and begins raving again.  He looks at what is evidently the beginnings of my order and makes angrily declares that it can&#39;t go out this way.  In the middle of all this, a problematic homeless man comes in.  Now I&#39;ve observed this before.  It happens in Chicago.  But there&#39;s already a crisis.  What does the wife do? She selects that very moment to ban the guy from the restaurant.  I&#39;m certain it&#39;s deserved, but at that precise moment? Then arrives the calvary, the couple in love.   One is dressed  deliciously inappropriately in  short shorts and the other possesses that happy go lucky.  He briefly attempts to restore order in the kitchen, the cook has disappeared again, but gives up to supervise his better half.  My order sits.  I think the cook returns again. , but he&#39;s certainly  not in a better mood.  I finally decide to leave and I discreetly tell the owner to forget about it.  My goodwill is such that I don&#39;t care about $17.00.  I distinctly hear the wife say, &#34;Don&#39;t follow him, he doesn&#39;t need to be that way!&#34; WTF?  I work 70 hours a week, I don&#39;t need this melodrama.  I&#39;m not shy about demanding my money back, I deliberately decided not to make a bad situation more unpleasant.  The horrifying aspect of this entire situation is that I think they were clueless about how bad the situation could appear to people.  I cant go back now.  Melodrama, love birds, unstable cooks.  It&#39;s the stuff of reality shows and I don&#39;t need it in real life. I really thought I was on camera, and it&#39;s not a pleasant sensation."

So it worked out for me. I definitely enjoyed the Chicago dog - they call it &#34;The Works.&#34; The Bryan burger could&#39;ve tasted better without the pretzel bun but it seems like the trend now to use pretzel buns for burgers and dogs.

Yum on all counts. The classic was exactly what he&#39;d been looking for, the avocado was ripe, and the tots fried perfectly.The service was great - cashier friendly, even the kitchen staff smiled and waved - and the ambiance adorable, with all the hot dog-themed hand drawings made by guests.

It seems like these eggs  were manipulated somehow.I sent the omelette back and asked the waitress what kind of egg whites were used if an egg substitution was possibly used.  The waitress didn&#39;t know so she sent out the owner.  The owner (male) came up to us and rudely explained to me what an egg white is and that it is &#34;the egg without the yellow part&#34;.  I did not ask what an egg white is (seriously?) I asked what he used in the omelette.  We realized we weren&#39;t getting anywhere with him with his sarcasm so we dropped the issue and finished the rest of our meal and proceeded to check out with the other owner (female).  Is this really how you treat your customers?While checking out with this owner we asked her about the omelette ingredients again and her response was, &#34;its a secret&#34;.   I said, was milk or water added?  Again, she said, &#34;It&#39;s our secret recipe&#34;.  As a fellow restauranteur and currently in the industry, that is a completely unacceptable and unlawful.  It is a customers right to ask and understand the ingredients of the food their consuming and it is the restaurant&#39;s obligation and requirement to divulge what ingredients are used.  They are damn lucky I didn&#39;t have an allergy.  The technique doesn&#39;t have to be divulged, but the ingredients absolutely must be.  In this situation, either milk, water, or something else was potentially added to the egg whites to change their composition.  The omelette was clearly manipulated and we didn&#39;t like it  The responses we got from ownership in simply trying to understand what was used was completely unacceptable.Other items:lattes were weak and watered downPancakes were goodHusband&#39;s corn beef hash was &#34;average&#34;Service:  un-welcoming, absolutely unprofessional, and a bit slowWill not return."

Look at my profile, guys - I&#39;ve written exactly two reviews, both on the request of the vendors, so the fact that I&#39;m taking the time to write a review means that it&#39;s serious.Quick timeline: we waited 45 minutes for a table (not necessarily surprising for weekend brunch), weren&#39;t actually seated until we walked in and asked how much longer it would be (they forgot we were standing outside), waited 30 minutes for someone to take our order, then waited another NINETY minutes to have our (bad) food brought to us. Maybe if you only have one deep fryer, let the table know that before three people order fried chicken.Then, the food came out, and it sucked! The fried chicken + crepes were bland, and the egg sandwich was a straight up salt lick. We scarfed our food down out of dire hunger and then left.They recognized that we were saintly patient and comped us a few items, but it didn&#39;t even get close to making up for all the time (total: 2 hours 50 minutes) we wasted there. Just a few updates as to the status of our meal would have gone a long way, but instead we waited there with no knowledge of how long it could possibly take, while people who arrived after us were served, ate, and left.So guess what? I don&#39;t recommend it."

It was the best breakfast item we had while in Chicago. Everything in the bowl tasted good. Eggs, bacon, kale, etc.I also tried the fried chicken with crepes. This is somewhat of a mixed review. They served it with 3 pieces of chicken. The breast piece was too dry. The drumstick was cooked just right, tender and moist in the inside, crispy outside. The wing was also somewhat dry. Crepe was made nicely and not overly sweet. I love chicken and waffles in general but this dish was just OK for me.The deviled eggs appetizer was enjoyable.Waiters were nice. Place is  comfortable and cozy.  Food does take a while to come, but they make it fresh so I&#39;m not complaining."

This is a place you go when you have time - signs &amp; menu ask for patience as the kitchen is small.Food was delicious. - a star due to the bathroom. I made two trips and each time the toilet was running so there was &#39;stuff&#39; in the toilet because people before couldn&#39;t figure out how to make it flush (you lift the handle so that tank can fill).... I had to lift the handle each time and wait. Either a sign or a fixed toilet is needed. It&#39;s a small thing so it&#39;s not a deal breaker.We&#39;re two blocks away so it&#39;s nice to have this close by.

I will definitely order that every time I go there from now on.My friend and I split the Grilled Cheese with Bacon and the Morning Sandwich. Both sandwich breads were perfectly toasted. The bacon was crispy and that aioli... I am dreaming about it.The decor is adorable and very homey. We did not bring alcohol but it is BYOB and I&#39;d like to try the mimosa bar next time.

Take note-cash onlyWalked in around 1230 on a Saturday and were greeted/seated by the chef (owner?) who was very friendly but warned us this would not be a &#34;quick endeavor&#34; as the kitchen is small and they had been bombarded with a rush right before we walked in. We have been wanting to try this place for a while, and on a Saturday afternoon had no rush so we sat down. Service was relaxed, but I had everything I needed. Definitely took a minute for her to be able to take our order but since we were warned when we sat down I didn&#39;t mind at all. I had the works and boyfriend got the chicken with crepes. He loved his, I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of mine but everything was prepared very well, I think I just ordered poorly for my own taste. We also brought a bottle of champagne for the mimosa trays- juice was great and different.Funky vibe, great playlist. Unique space and will definitely be back."

Unfortunately, they are very understaffed. We were told it would be a 40 minute wait, but we ended up having a two and a half hour wait. Their following of health code regulations were off as well. Not only did they literally handle all of the food with their bare hands, but also didn&#39;t wash between touching different foods so cross contamination became a problem. Additionally, we watched the people cooking catch a small animal that snuck into the kitchen using two small baskets--then they released it into the backyard and continued to cook? Lastly, all of our silverware was dirty and there was dirt in my glass of water.I feel really bad writing such a negative review of their cleanliness because the food really was delicious and the people were honestly SO kind! Especially the head chef! But food safety is a concern--but if it&#39;s not a concern for you then seriously that food is amazing!"

Right texture, right flavour. The grilled tomato was also very tasty. Service was great and staff friendly. Manager was apologetic with the small quality glitch that I encountered (see below).The ok- the two poached eggs had different consistency, one was great, one was a bit overcooked.

One is able to see the kitchen from the dining area so I watched as the cook just hung around and talked to the staff taking her sweet time to prepare two seemingly simple dishes.But the food.... I ordered The Works, and it was cold! The egg was overcooked and the kale was dry, and since the dish was COLD, the cheese was all hard and not melted on the potatoes anymore. The only reason I didn&#39;t ask the waiter to take it back was because I had already waited over 45 minutes and was starving at that point but after getting the check and seeing how much I spent on the dish I regret not complaining. My friend ordered the Fried Chicken and Crepes. The chicken was actually pretty good, it definitely tasted better than it looked. The crepes were delicious. I didn&#39;t like the coffee whatsoever, but that might just be my personal taste, I thought it was too bitter.The only reason I&#39;m not giving this place one star is because our waiter was really nice, so that&#39;s that.

This isn&#39;t the grandma Js I use to love and always rave about. This place literally went from being a family owned, predominately black run establishment to a hipster run place since last summer when I was a regular here.But while I would miss John and the older woman I always presumed to be grandma J, who cooked, I was still excited to eat here again.Well sadly, the food is no longer the same either. Most of the menu is, but the quality just isn&#39;t there. The works used to have a savory crispy kale. Today it was mushy and bland. On top of that, the service was noticeably bad too.The new staff, while super nice, was more concerned with socializing and hanging out then running a restaurant. Our food took over a half our to come out when the place was only at half capacity. And they never checked on us to see how we were doing. At least we got sat; the party of 4 that came BEFORE us was left unattended outside for 30 min while the place was half empty.Then FINALLY, after getting our food, we realized the home made jam had mold growing on it. When we showed the server, she just told us our bill was on the house and left unapologetically.RIP grandma Js. You will be missed"

Nice balance between arteriosclerosis inducing and foodie friendly.Nice touch giving us the option to wait inside with a beverage. I can see where being so nice had cost you in overhead.

Recently it seems like the place is kinda going down. The wait time for food is now 45+ minutes so don&#39;t come here hungry. The last time I was there I asked to cancel my order about an hour into waiting and he said my food is already just about to come out. So I waited even more. He knew we weren&#39;t happy with the wait at all and when I got the check I was kind of confused because their house coffee is $3! I realized my usual server Mo was probably giving me coffee free because I&#39;m a great tipper and after all it only costs the place what? 25 cents to make per cup? I think a great gesture customer service wise would be if your patrons are dying of starvation in your restaurant maybe give them their coffee free. It says you care, your sorry about the wait, and you&#39;re really not losing out on money. Either way I don&#39;t feel Ill be coming here after my usual runs anymore."

It sounded like an odd combination but I now think I prefer it to chicken and waffles. The bird was perfectly fried to a crisp and the lemony crepes were tasty. We also had a great big bowl of biscuits and gravy( a favorite dish with my kid). We can&#39;t wait to go back and sit on the patio.

Lovely.We order right away and then sit there....and sit there....and sit there....and sit there.  In the meantime, I saw the main chef leave and saw three tables with no food whatsoever.  After about 25 minutes, the kids behind me got their french toast.  The parents were still waiting.  The table behind them, the kid had gotten their food and finished...the parents were still waiting.  The couple to the side of me had been sitting there for 15 minutes prior to when we got there(overheard their conversation)...So, they still had no food after almost 45 minutes of being there?  A dude walks in, high fives the waitstaff and the other chef (main chef still gone), sits down at the bar, and within 8 minutes has his breakfast sandwich.  Finally, the main chef comes in with a bag of cilantro about 30 minutes after us being there.  The parents behind us finally get their breakfast sandwich, the parents behind them finally get their fried chicken, the couple who&#39;s been there for 50 mins now still has no food and the couple sitting next to us who got there 10 minutes after us has their food.  Uhhhhhh, what the what????  So my husbo goes and talks to the owner and apparently the owner interrupts him mid sentence and says she&#39;s aware of what&#39;s going on.  He&#39;s like, &#34;what&#39;s going on?&#34;  Then she realizes she cut him off before he had said anything and then gets an attitude when he tells her about the gum situation and the food situation.  She then tells him she&#39;s been there the whole time (false...she walked in after us being there for about 20 minutes) and says its under control.  By this time, we&#39;re starving and go to Handlebar where we get seated, get our order, clean dishes, and great tasting food all within 15 minutes.Grandma J&#39;s - I really wanted to love you but after this morning, I&#39;m really disappointed. I don&#39;t know if it was a fluke, but it was too bad to be back."

The interior looked like the second coming of the old Bite restaurant, it&#39;s three blocks from my apartment, and it is one of the few non fast food places to eat in my immediate neighborhood. Sadly, the good things I have to say after actually eating at Grandma J&#39;s end there.Now, I &#34;get&#34; several things about this restaurant. The ingredients are locally sourced so the food is gonna be more expensive. It&#39;s a small eatery with a small staff so I expect to wait a while for my meal. But you know what else was small? THE PORTIONS. If I am going to pay $12 for two chorizo tacos, they better be bursting with meaty goodness, not flaccid, and come with something more than a smattering of pico de gallo. And I had to wait something like 45 minutes for my order! (Fortunately I was having lunch with an old friend from out of town, so we had plenty of catching up to do and the time went by quicker. She was quite happy with her grilled cheese and potato wedges, FWIW.) what really burned my ass about the whole experience was the server, right before she brought my order out, informed me that the cheese fritters weren&#39;t ready yet - um, at 2pm when you are going to close in an hour? When did you expect to make them? - and that I was going to have to have cheese hash browns instead. No choice to substitute before the order was made and not super friendly about it.In short, underwhelming service and overpriced food. Not terrible, but maybe next time I walk across the park and eat at the reliably delicious Flying Saucer."

Recently, though, I have never been more disappointed in their quality of food and service. I&#39;d like to think that a small kitchen/wait time disclaimer on a menu is warranted for a busy brunch boutique, but Grandma J&#39;s is no longer such a location. The loss of their flagship chef (and indeed the heart of Grandma J&#39;s excellence) indicated a lack of management and concern for customer satisfaction.Please get your shit together.. also your outdoor space is full of Yellowjackets during the summer."

The work that is being done in this little kitchen is among the best in the city, especially in the ever important byob brunch space.This is the kind of place that could literally charge double, and you would still be happy. But they don&#39;t, and that is the other half of the charm here. There&#39;s something just so inviting about a local joint, with real people running it, turning out top level food.Owner Layla is always there with a smile of some kind, and along with her warm staff, they make you feel more like neighbors and friends than customers.The Fried Chicken and Waffle Fritters might not only be the best brunch dish in the city, but maybe even the best fried chicken. The breakfast poutine, biscuits and well... everything else is just on point.If you want to go someplace for brunch without a side of pretentiousness, then get your ass to Grandma J&#39;s!"

While there was a 30-40 minute wait this morning and no room inside to wait, the hostess offered us coffee while we were outside. Not a super cold day, but chilly enough where hot coffee was appreciated.Decided to try something new today. Went with The Works and it was amazing. Poached eggs with kale, cheddar cheese, potato hash, hollandaise sauce, a tomato and bacon. I loved it and it was so filling.They&#39;ve also acquired an ATM and two tables that replaced a coach and coffee table seating since my last visit."

I came on a whim and I gotta say, the service was great and the food was awesome!I got the Works which was poached eggs on top of potato hash with Swiss cheese marinated mushrooms , crispy kale, bacon and fried tomato in a bowl comes with toast, and some jam. All delicious! I also paired with some coffee (which they had to keep brewing but always fresh).It&#39;s a small place and it gets packed but it&#39;s very great! I just sat at the bar."

We went on a lunch date and the food was impeccable! When the chef came out to say hi and ask how the food was, my sister even proposed to him bc the food was so good. The place is very cozy and quaint. It had a very nice homey feeling to it; it was like eating at a friend&#39;s house. Since we liked the food so much we decided to go there for brunch on a weekend with some friends.The service was AWFUL. First, we were told there was a 40 minute wait for 5 people, which on a Sunday isn&#39;t bad until the waitress sat her friends before sitting us even though they arrived minutes after the people left the big table. Second, she was rude. There was a minor miscommunication in which an extra order of pancakes was made because she thought we ordered two orders of pancakes when I had asked for two pancakes, not two orders. I very politely sent it back telling her I only wanted ONE order of two pancakes. She rolled her eyes, told me I ordered two orders then proceeded to take the food to the table where her friends were sitting. Next, when our chicken and waffles were ready, we didn&#39;t get the full order. We left there hungry which didn&#39;t happen the first time. We have not been back since because the service was so bad."

Anything with &#34;grandma&#39;s&#34; has to be good!The interior here is decorated so cute! It really looks like grandma collected a bunch of things and left it all here.There are old schools games and books on the shelf for you to play while you wait for your food. Also, gum in jars on every table.Time for the food!The boyfriend had The Works that looked good and came with house made pineapple jam that was too sweet for me but my brother liked.I had the Poached Hamboldt. Poached eggs over ~~~ all over delicious potatoes!! Loved! And the portion was perfect if you didn&#39;t get extra french toast like I did.The texture of the french toast was good but it was a bit greasy and I did not like the white sauce they put on top.I like when places have non-matching cups and this was how the coffee cups were. The water they give you in the masion jar was warm though so it was kind of gross. So I ordered a Peach-Mango juice that my brother said he saw just came out of a V8 bottle.I would love to come back here next time I&#39;m in town and possible try the biscuits and gravy which they were out of. The waitress told us as soon as we walked in instead of after we looked at the menu.They are also looking for burlesque dancers if anyone is interested!"

I&#39;ve got plenty of details and photos to explain my views.We arrived just after 11am to a few open tables. There are just six small tables that would each hold either two or four people, two tables for up to six people, and a small bar-like counter that holds a total four people. Capacity here is limited but the flow for lunch here never exceeded capacity.The waitress (one chef, one waitress) seated us but wasn&#39;t overly friendly. This visit would have likely gone so much better if she had simply asked &#34;Have you been here before?&#34; but we were given no rules or SOP&#39;s and remained clueless most of the visit. I would ask questions that I thought of but turned out I had missed a bunch. Being one waitress she had little time for us and was rarely available to help when needed. Even by the end of the meal the waitress still seemed stressed and unfriendly.Both of us started with hot tea. The tea bag selection was nice but my companion likes a weak tea and when she pulled out the bag to save it for a second cup there wasn&#39;t a saucer and the only place to put the partially used bag was the sticky table. The table didn&#39;t seem dirty but just old and worn.There are a couple menus listed on Yelp. They are clearly outdated and inaccurate. The stuff we wanted (some nice sounding chicken sandwiches) that we picked on Yelp before arriving wasn&#39;t on the menu we got. Check the official restaurant website for the current menu!I LOVE anything made with duck so I jumped at the Duck 3 Way (see photo) and for $14 I was expecting a more traditional confit (seasoned and moist from being stored in fat) but I got a small amount of dry duck meat chunks. The poached duck egg was good and larger than I expected. The potato hash fried with duck fat was under seasoned but the duck fat added good flavor. The Hollandaise sauce was good but more lemony than I like. I wouldn&#39;t get this dish again even if it were priced under $10.My companion had to put together three sides to make a meal since the full menu was a bit limited. Sides of French Toast, Bacon, and Potato Hash. The four small French baguette slices were the best tasting things we had for lunch today. Bacon was good and hash average.Our check was over $30 for underwhelming food and below par service. We knew that it was CASH ONLY prior to arriving so that wasn&#39;t an issue but the cost for what we got was. On a side note for the profit they rake in here could easily cover a credit card system through their bank or even using a Square type credit service with a simple smart phone. Just one way to improve customer service here."

From my paternal grandmother&#39;s plastic yellow bumble bee clock to my maternal grandmother&#39;s loudly ticking wood clock that was always set fifteen minutes fast, there&#39;s something about the zillion clocks on the wall at Grandma J&#39;s that made me feel at home. That, and the fact that the waiter offered to refill my iced coffee for free!I got the Works, which had two poached eggs, bacon, hollandaise sauce, kale, mushrooms, and a fried (red) tomato over potato hash. It also came with a side of toast, butter, and pineapple jam. Part of me worried that this would be too many ingredients for one dish, but it somehow all worked. Even the ever-nutritious kale didn&#39;t detract from the deliciousness of the hollandaise and bacon.My brunch mates got the chicken and waffle fritters and the breakfast sandwich. I tried the fritters and they were kind of dry. I&#39;ll be back to try the French toast sticks and enjoy some BYOB mimosas."

Located across the National Guard Armory on North Ave and Kedzie this restaurant is a real gem. We popped in for breakfast and had the poached eggs on crispy kale and potato wedges. Delicious! I love the ambiance and the food matched the anticipation. It was a little pricy ($14 for an egg dish), but we didn&#39;t realize the size of the dish and could have split it. The owner was charming and we chatted a little about her inspiration for decor. She has a great story worth hearing so make sure to strike up a conversation."

We were immediately welcomed by several staff.  The eclectic decor was fun to look at while we awaited our food.  2 in our party ordered &#34;The works&#34; the other 2 &#34;biscuits &amp; Gravy.&#34;  The place was very busy. We placed our order &amp; had a pretty long wait for the food to arrive but it was fine with us. We enjoyed catching up on life plus taking in the decor made time pass.Upon arrival the presentation of the food kicked in the oh I can&#39;t wait to devour such a beautiful meal. I ordered &#34;The works&#34; with egg scrambled instead of poached. The various textures in the dish gave pleasing bursts of sweet &amp; salty contrasts. The battered tomato atop the dish was divine. The meal was so superb that I announced to our group that this was the best breakfast ever devoured. I&#39;m actually thinking to go back &amp; order exactly the same dish tomorrow.

Went here on a Saturday and it was busy. Reguarless I received my food with-in 20 mins of walking in the door.. I can&#39;t stress how good this place is.. I will be back for sure..biscuits and gravy with 2 eggs.. YUMMY.. my experience here was positive. When I was here the owner (I think) was going around talking to people the best she can (remember she cooks and does other things that keeps her busy) I overheard a guy and girl tell her she is rude because she didn&#39;t talk to them.. hahaha! are you kidding me?! You go here to eat not talk to the owner, dam weirdo&#39;s. Your wife/ gf is with you, talk to her.. I looked at my wife and we laughed at them lol. Can&#39;t believe these dam kids got their butts hurt by this lol... She didn&#39;t talk to me and my wife and that&#39;s fine with us lol. But Honestly if your looking for a GREAT brunch place with decent prices and strong coffee this is your place.. if your looking for a friend or someone to talk to maybe look else where. Lol.. but like I said before, it gets busy.. so depending on times you go, you might have to wait a little bit.. the owner treats everyone like family (the best she can, with smiles and small talk).."

Usually worth it for the food. I don&#39;t think I will ever go back. They were waiting on a delivery most items on the menu were only available with lots of substitutes. I was prepared to leave becasue I didn&#39;t want to order an item with only half the ingredients. The cook kindly offered to make me something and it was fine, not great, and essentially a snack it was so small. I was charged for a full menu item: $13. The waitress came by once, when I was chewing, so I never had a chance to order more food. My teacup was empty when my food arrived, never offered a refill. My water was empty before my meal was over, never refilled. Check was dropped without a word. Two stars only becasue it tasted good, disappointing experience."

I&#39;m so glad I finally decided to look into Grandma J&#39;s because it&#39;s nothing of the sort.It&#39;s super cozy and full of mix and match furniture and table settings. It&#39;s BYOB and they&#39;ll bring you and awesome Bloody Mary mix for you to pour your own vodka (they know the way to my heart). The food is definitely stellar. Bomb brunch.It&#39;s 4/5 only because I think it&#39;s slightly overpriced, but mostly because while the service was attentive, we felt like we were VERY rushed. There didn&#39;t happen to be a wait that day and I realize it&#39;s a tiny breakfast spot, but we were really looking forward to unwinding and enjoying the experience. I know it stinks when people linger and tables extensively, but by the time we left (it was about 45 minutes) I almost felt like we got kicked out."

Charming is the perfect word to describe it. It&#39;s teeny, so you must time it right on the weekend to get a table (pre-normal brunch times, but it is worth getting up early).The food is made to order just feet from you. I enjoy the Morning Breakfast sammich and The Works. A must try? The waffle fritters!I think brunch without booze is pretty much pointless so do make sure you BYO champers or prosecco (any fizzy wine will do) for the Mimosa Tray! 3 juices = lots of fun mixing and matching!"

Perfect comfort all around.Simple and cozy atmosphere. I loved the Grandma J inspired decor--ceramic owl lamp, vintage salt and pepper shaker collection. The silverware rolls placed in a variety of different coffee mugs on each table place setting was a nice detail. The food was delicious. The egg I ordered was the best egg I have ever tasted. I prefer thicker and softer French toast, but if you like French toast sticks, these are great, crispy and buttery.My husband ordered the works. All of it was delicious. The kale is a nice addition. The portions were small for my husband but just right for me.We will definitely be returning."

I&#39;ve actually never experienced such disgraceful service-- or disgusting attitudes-- in ten years of living and eating in Chicago.My husband and I were looking forward to trying Grandma J&#39;s-- despite the bad things we had heard about the owner&#39;s attitude, we were ready to give it the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately we had a bad experience from the moment we walked in and sat at the bar. The owner was berating a couple of her kitchen staff-- very loudly, and nastily-- for taking cans of Coke from the fridge while they were working. She then demanded that they dig in their pockets and pay her on the spot! Chastising and humiliating one&#39;s staff in front of customers is totally unprofessional--and it made us feel very uncomfortable.Nevertheless, we ordered coffee and two breakfasts. And waited. And waited. And watched as table after table (who had arrived after us) were served. For over 50 MINUTES!!! The guy sitting next to my husband at the bar arrived 25 minutes after us...and was halfway through the *very same* breakfast that my husband had ordered when we finally decided that enough was enough.We put down cash to cover the coffee and told the owner that we were leaving because we couldn&#39;t wait any longer-- it had been almost an hour. Instead of apologizing, she turned to us with an insipid sneer and said &#34;You&#39;re wrong-- we bring out orders in the exact order they come in.&#34; When we pointed out all the many tables who had come in after us had almost finished their meals she flat-out denied it in such a bratty, childish way it made my skin crawl.Clearly lots of other Yelp reviewers have had a similar experience. Until this nasty woman cleans up her act, we&#39;ll be telling everyone we know to avoid this place like the plague."

It&#39;s BYOB so we can prepared with a bottle of vodka for bodies and champagne for mimosas.It looked like There were only 3 people working: kitchen, server, busser - so the service was SO SLOW. We had to wait forever just to get our order taken.  I was actually pretty crabby and hungry when the food arrived, but it was SO good I immediately forgave the bad service. Worth the wait. Delicious. Definitely going back"

When ever my husband and I decide we want to withdrawal money for the cash only place we eat here. The service is great the food is great and there is hardly any noise. Will actually be there Saturday. My husband has had the fish and chips along with BLT. He is picky about how the fish is cooked so that is always the first item he orders. He loved it. Every once in awhile they do a burlesque show.

Sure every dish is littered with truffle which makes everything better, but I&#39;m a crazy person. A crazy person in that sense that I thought this was just a restaurant opened by some pseudo-celeb-not-from-Chicago-chef capitalizing on what is the best dining scene in the country. I have watched every season of Top Chef and must admit, if not already evident, I didn&#39;t love Fabio when he was on. Since then though, I&#39;ve only heard good things about the guy and I gotta say - after trying his food, I&#39;m a fan.Bar Siena is an interesting space. In my younger years, I used to come to this location when it was Dragonfly and club the night away. Bar Siena has kept the bones of the building&#39;s structure but completely revamped everything to be shiny &amp; new, giving a very vibrant, music thumping, dimly lit yet comfortable atmosphere for your dining. I could have done with the music being turned down a bit though. Our server was just fantastic throughout our meal, attentive but not overly so, well informed and just super friendly sharing some little tidbits of knowledge here &amp; there.They have a respectable drink list including wines, beers and some cool sounding cocktails. Being the beer chick that I am, I opted for the West Coast IPA ($7) and was pleased with the imperial IPA - delicious!Bar Siena heats their pizzas in a beautiful oven on their first-floor, open for viewing kitchen. Every pizza combination on their menu sounded so great - we decided to do a half &amp; half pizza. On one half was wild mushrooms, garlic, white truffle oil, fontina and shaved parmesan. This left a bit to be desired as we didn&#39;t get quite as much truffle &amp; bang as we hoped for, however it was a respectable pizza. On our other half, we went with their Prosciutto Fig combo. Aside from the aforementioned ingredients, it included spiced pistachio, taleggio cheese, truffle honey and greens. It was so incredibly delicious and makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Our half &amp; half pizza ran us $19. I&#39;d get this pizza again in a second and honestly can&#39;t wait to try more of their ambrosial concoctions.Then the pastas! Holy goodness the pastas. The Sweet Corn Ravioli ($17) was the best pasta I&#39;ve had in a long time, perhaps ever. It was so incredibly creamy with a rich truffle butter base, well done raviolis surrounded by chiodini mushrooms, all just going together harmoniously for my mouth&#39;s complete satisfaction.  We also did their Bar Siena&#39;s Short Rib Lasagna ($19) which comes out in an adorable little pan straight from the oven. Again, a very rich pasta with perfection in ingredients married throughout. Just as with the pizzas, I cannot wait to come back and try other carb loaded dishes.Needless to say, we had leftovers between the two of us. But also needless to say after such a great meal, we saved just enough room in our bellies to try some dessert. We both ordered a $5 gelato and their portions were generous! We would have been plenty fine splitting one. I had the Double Chocolate and it was decadent with pieces of chocolate chipped inside the creamy gelato - I just loved it but couldn&#39;t even finish my portion. My friend had the carrot cake gelato with chunks of actual cake in it and if that&#39;s your thing, you&#39;re sure to enjoy it.Bar Siena, you&#39;ve surprised me! I walked in expecting another ho hum meal that would be good, but forgettable and ended up being blown away by the heavenly food!"

Did not know that the Cubs would be playing that night, so it made for a great atmosphere, but with or without the Cubs playoff game on TV, the bar area, dj music playing in background still would have had a great buzzy sound.  With that said, it is not a steak restaurant or upscale restaurant, but a perfect combination restaurant for co-workers or date night where conversation is not the main priority.Ana - our server was probably the best in Chicago. Treated us as friends, with the upmost respect, was timely on her check-ins and made good calls regarding what to order (drinks and food) when we asked. When you first read the menu before going in, you think it is just basic Italian food, but everything has a twist. For example: Short Rib Lasagna (fantastic). Place gets crowded after 6pm, but when weather is nice, many people will sit outside."

I understand that this place is a hot spot but this wait time and poor service resulted in my lower stars.Food was awesome and drink options were great. I highly recommend the skirt steak with the flavorful salsa verde, the spinach and ricotta calzone (large enough to share if you chose) and the burrata (candied pistachios were a fantastic touch) to start off.I&#39;d like to say that I will return but the poor service has left a bad aftertaste."

It was wonderful.They have a great beer, wine and cocktail list. Love their selection of bourbons.  Not huge, but a great mix of standard top shelf and some craft bourbons. I had the Koval neat, a bourbon made in Chicago. Perfect.We also had their version of an Old Fashion (no. 4) and their version of a Moscow Mule. Really smooth, very refreshing and drinkable.Service was five stars.  Our waitress knew the menu and had great recommendations.   We started with the Burrata which they make and it is fresh and creamy. Wonderful.  We also had the Grilled Octopus which was very good. The flavors were wonderful and the full plate with chili and greens made it perfect. Highly recommend that.We also had their Salumi platter. Their version of a Charcuterie platter. It was good, but I have had a better variety at other locations. If you have a taste, go for it.We split their version of a Lasagna made with braised short ribs.  Although they veered from the traditional, it was amazing flavor. It was also very heavy - and filling. It was really good.And please make sure you leave room for desert. They have these amazing Donuts and a Spiced Cake with RumChata gelato.  LOVED it all.Definitely will be back, even just for a cocktail or desert."

Chopped salad was unmemorable, the pizza was not as good as Forno Rosso which is just down the street... the prosciutto fig was nearly inedible with the huge amount of honey which made it over the top sweet, the gelato wasnt bad but it a touch too sweet and the bomboloni was good but I think we should have gotten a different flavour.Overall, not a bad choice for Randolph but I much rather go to Forno Rosso or Little Goat for a place that isn&#39;t too fancy and more relaxed."

We had the honeycomb gelato and I still can&#39;t believe they make this stuff in house! It was sweet, but not too sweet and the little bits of honey made me smile on the inside!

There is a special take out window for their bomboloni deserts (donuts filled with a custard), but the vanilla bean edition was nothing special, would not order again."

Each small plate we order had an interesting twist. We started with the grilled octopus, which had a great grilled flavor and very tender. The twist was the charred escarole, shishito peppers and Calabrian chili vinaigrette. Nice spicy dish. Next we had the grilled shrimp and artichoke hearts. The twist was the sautéed spinach with blistered tomatoes and chili flake.We then had a pizza with wild mushrooms and garlic, but it was pushed over the top with truffle oil. I wish we had room for dessert because it was very tempting."

For brunch I would recommend the avocado toast served with a poached egg; the order comes with one piece of toast but it is rich and filling. If you have a sweet tooth you should not pass up a bombolini from their Bomobar menu!For cocktails, I have tried No. 3, which is a martini, and No. 9, which is essentially a Moscow mule, and both were fresh without being overly sweet.There are several tasty dinner options, and being vegetarian was not challenging when ordering as the server suggested they could modify several of their dishes to satisfy dietary preference.

There is an upstairs, but I didn&#39;t check it out. My friends and I sat outside and we really enjoyed it.The restaurant was beautiful!Our server was amazing, he literally went through every pizza with us, as well as drinks. Oh by the way, Pizza was only available for the time we went. It was pretty  late, around 10ish! For drinks, I ordered the number 12 and LOVED it. It was so tasty, my boyfriend ordered the number 8, his drink was great as well!For the pizza we ordered the Wild Mushroom and Garlic Pizza, THIS is where the amazing customer service showed again. When out pizza came out, it was extremely burnt. The server knew how hungry we were, so he was extremely apologetic and made sure the chef made us a new pizza. After the server apologized, the manager came out and apologized again and explained to us that the chef got hit with about 20 orders, so he got extremely busy.Next thing you know, we got the new pizza, WHICH WAS SO GOOD! Then, the server brought us out new plates, and said we&#39;re bringing out deserts, enjoy them on us! We had the three bombolonis (nutella cream and orginal) and a nutella calzone. All the deserts were amazing.Although, our first pizza came out burnt, the service and the taste of all the food made up for it. I highly reccommend this place."

The darker the better so you can see how gorgeous it is at night time. The tree is high up, all the way to the ceiling on the second floor, very creative idea and it looks so cool. There is a giant TV screen with no audio hanging on the tree for some distractions(???)Never heard any complaints about food &amp; drinks here but a long waiting line to get in or sometimes up to 2 hours wait on weekends ( no kidding)I love Bar Siena, great time there, always. I miss the Crudo: Salmon-Spicy cucumber relish, pine nut and sea salt, it&#39;s so delicious. One thing that I must do every time when I go there is giving myself an extra  treat with their well known bombolini with chocolate &amp; salted caramel cream, yummy!  I also love the fact that they have so many light beers that I love like, Blance De Bruxelles and more.The service here is spectacular.Wanna be trendy? go to Bar Siena ;)"

I had made reservations and when we got there and on time we still had to wait a little for our table. We got some drinks ordered which were good and it took a little while for our server to approach us.Once she finally did come again we decided to order a couple of things and I specifically asked for all our food to be spaced out and not to come out right at once. Well, so much for listening. It all came out at once. We ordered the fig and procciuto pizza and it was okay, definitely tasty, but not as hyped up as people make it out to be but maybe that&#39;s just me as I&#39;m not obsessed with Figs in general so it was a little sweet for me. What I did love was the corn truffle ravioli, now those deserve a star by itself as they were amazing, rich and the right amount of sweetness. I would definitely recommend those. We were a little put off my the service as we didn&#39;t want everything at once, but what can we do. We also felt a little rushed out of there the minute we were done eating but not drinking.So this place is nice and can be a fun place to grab drinks with your friends but I was definitely a little turned off by their service."

We were seated upstairs on a long rectangular table and it was perfect. The brunch menu consists of 4 sweet options and 9 savory options! Many of my friends got the breakfast sandwich and a few of us ordered the Short Rib Hash.The short rib hash was unbelievable-my favorite from every single brunch spot in Chicago. The portion size was generous- and the fork split the meat so tenderly and the juice flavors were so inviting. Put on top of perfectly cooked seasoned tomatoes and fresh vegetables that were steamed so perfectly- I was in brunch heaven. The presentation is great too. For the egg sandwiches, the potatoes came in a funnel. You&#39;ll make a mistake if you don&#39;t get the Caramelized Waffle for the table- the nutella is warm and melts right in the mouth.Coffee is strong and hot- and it was nice, quiet chatter, bright open windows environment- making it a family friendly and great restaurant choice for brunch."

The area is very cute during such a time, with lots of restaurants with outdoor patios. Even the inside of bar Siena though is well decorated.I had the chopped salad and a coffee. The salad was very good and hearty. Lots of tasty ingredients. I also tried the prosciutto omelet, which was delicious and flavorful. The potatoes were also pretty good. The spinach omelet was yummy as well. We also ordered the verde cold pressed juice- a refreshing accompaniment.The service was great and the atmosphere very pleasing for the family outing this Saturday afternoon. A great find!"

My boyfriend and I started with some meat and cheeses, the Prosciutto and Salami for the meats, and the Grana and Tremor for our cheeses. We ordered those based on our servers recommendations and we were right to follow them. The Tremor is a softer more creamy cheese as opposed to the dryer more dense Grana. The Prosciutto and Salami were both amazing and the salty and savoriness paired well with the raisin bread slices and the little peppers, figs, and candied walnuts. Amazing starter for sure!For our entrees, we ordered the Langoustine Risotto and the Lobster Agnolotti. The Risotto was underwhelming, presentation wise and flavor wise. For a $21 dish, there should have been whole shrimp pieces and not just bits cut up from one shrimp. The rice was cooked to be fluffy and had a great texture and seasoning was balanced. The Lobster Agnolotti was much better and lived up to the hype in the other reviews. There was a good amount of lobster pieces, the béchamel sauce was lovely, and the agnolotti was cooked to perfection.For dessert, we decided to try their homemade gelato, the toasted coconut and fudge flavor. The Coconut flavor was definitely lacking, only the shreds really proved the existence of coconut in this gelato. The fudge was abundant and took over in flavor."

I think we disappointed her a little when we said we were just walking by and came in.My friend and I shared the gnocchi. It was alright - the sauce tasted like it came from a frozen dinner package. :/ We were super hungry at the time so we didn&#39;t really care, but thinking back on it, it wasn&#39;t that great.We didn&#39;t get any drinks this time, but their cocktails looked pretty good.

We got the breakfast pizza, spinach omelette, bombo benedict,  and avocado toast. They were all O.K. minus the benedict, which was awful. The only reason they got 3 stars is because the bloody marys were good and the atmosphere was pleasant. To that note, we ordered an extra shot for the bloodies and it doubled the price of them. Outrageous. We could have just gotten a second one."

That was a pleasant turn of events.We got the Parmesan truffle potato skins to start- yum! Love the garlic aoli it comes with. From there we got the fig pizza, which also very good, but not as mind blowing as other Yelpers would lead you to believe. We also ordered a side of baked shishito peppers because that is my absolute favorite dish at Girl And The Goat... Sadly they did not live up to those. Drinks were solid, a bit pricey.

Despite previous reviews I found their selection to be a disappointment. Ordered coffee. Should have walked out when the cream we were served was sour. It fell  chunks into the coffee. Gross. I ordered a pizza and asked if they could put an egg on it. Brunch right? The waiter seemed confused and when my pizza came it had an egg that was hard. The pizza was definately a frozen pizza. I could totally tell. My daughter had the spinach calzone, like I said before, not many brunch items offered. That was stuffed with frozen chopped spinach. We also ordered a side of &#34;waffle potatoes&#34;. How something can get greasy from a waffle iron is beyond me! It was swimming in grease. I should have gotten the clue when every restaurant on W Randolph was packed, this place was empty. I know why.Our bill was $50!!!!! That is outrageous for what I was served.  INever again."

At first we were told it would be a 45 min wait, but then a table for four opened up serendipitously.I got the bombo benedict. The eggs were perfect, and the pork belly, watercress, and hollandaise complemented each other well. No complaints at all.Didn&#39;t have much room for dessert because I scarfed down the bombo benedict, but wanted to try the bomboloni, so got the mixed berry because it seemed like the best option for a full stomach at the time. It was good. Just good. Would probably try the maple, chocolate, or vanilla on a less full stomach next time."

Absolutely amazing, the sweet and salty combination was so perfect. The only complaint was with the polenta bread, I wish it wasn&#39;t so hard to bite into, kind of took away from the deliciousness.Second we had the chilled avocado chili soup. ... Extremely salty. So salty my mom ended up sending it back. Shame.Moving on to the meatball sandwich. OUTSTANDING. SO delicious the fries were amazing definitely the best thing we had.We also ordered the sweet corn ravioli. It was extremely rich, but again so so so salty. Again, disappointed.So overall 2/4 on what we got for lunch. Seems like a hit or miss depending on what you order.In terms of the atmosphere I like the decorating, the industrial feel is great but a little loud for my tastes, I couldn&#39;t really hear my mom and she was across from me.But it was reasonably priced for what we got and the portion size.The BomboBar is amazing as well the gelato was incredible.

I was definitely surprised by the wide variety of items that they had to offer. I loved the summery vibes that I was getting from this place. The wooden furniture and stringed lights really made the atmosphere feel very open and welcoming. Also, there&#39;s a sense of warm welcome and coziness that I got from it. It&#39;s a very cute place, and I wish I had more time to just sit there and enjoy the environment with a few drinks.As for the food I ordered, I went with a &#34;Puff Pancake,&#34; which was essentially lemon whipped ricotta, with blueberries on top, and maple syrup. I also decided to split the &#34;Parmesan Truffle Potato Slices,&#34; with a friend. Though I&#39;m not an extreme pancake lover, the description of the puff pancake in the menu definitely sold me. The pancake itself was absolutely amazing. It&#39;s served in the actual griddle that it&#39;s made in, so it&#39;s still very warm when you take your first bite. The potato slices, on the other hand, were slightly disappointing because I seemed to taste more of pure salt, rather than the parmesan, truffle seasoning.Overall, it was a wonderful experience, and I will definitely be coming back for perhaps another meal, and definitely for their drinks. I would personally come here with my girl friends to have a girls&#39; brunch/night out, or it would be a perfect location for a date."

I came with my fiance and another couple one fall evening when it was still nice enough to sit on the patio, and we enjoyed appetizers and desserts. The meatballs are perfectly fork tender and plump, and the potato skins with parmesan and truffle are so crisp and tasty. We finished up with mixed berry bomboloni and honeycomb gelato, which is to die for! So fresh, so delicious.I returned last Saturday night with a group of about ten of us, and managed to take over a booth despite the quite happening number of people there around 11 p.m. I really love the giant lit tree that stretches from the first floor bar up the second floor; I haven&#39;t been up there yet but would love to check it out for dinner one day. This time my fiance and I split the fig prosciutto flatbread, and ohmygosh is that good. Salty meat, savory truffle oil, and the sweet roasted fig - we have been talking about that pizza for days. For dessert I went with the salted caramel bomboloni, which gets two thumbs up, and a shoutout to my friend&#39;s dessert, the nutella calzone, I&#39;m coming for you next. Our server did a great job of taking care of our larger group for drinks and making sure we had our kitchen orders in before it closed.There is also a coffee/bomboloni/gelato takeout window on the street, for donuts on the go, how dangerous for my wallet.

For dinner i had the short rib Lasagna after hearing a couple ppl recommend it. Didnt really care for it. The short rib kind of gets lost in the Lasagna. My date had the Gnocchi. That was pretty good. Wish they put a little more sausage in there because the sausage was good. Also tried the Carne pizza it was average. It light, soft and good taste.

We arrived at 5pm which I believe is way before hitting the Chicago dinner rush but despite what I think, they told us we had to finish our dinner by 6:30 or wait two hours... We were already dressed up and starving and decided to agree to their time limit. You all know this place is not the cheapest place on the strip so it was hard to thoroughly enjoy our dining experience with the time constraint on our mind. Not to mention that our waiter pointed our &#34;time constraint&#34; twice. Not cool.As we wrapped up at 6:30, there were at least 5-6 tables all empty around us.Make a reservation--lesson learned.

YES!For our entrée we shared the Prosciutto Fig spiced pistachio, taleggio, local honey. This is my second prosciutto pizza ever and I love it. I&#39;m craving this pizza. Sweet and savory.The cocktail list sounded amazing, but we were in the mood for a bottle of wine...next time...next time.I can&#39;t wait to come back."

Service was good, ambiance inside and the patio were lovely and the food was good too. I would suggest for a lunch or casual dinner.I had the Sweet Corn Ravioli, with mushrooms and truffle butter. Delicious! Slightly salty and sweet. I loved this dish, I just wish there was more of it. My biggest downfall with ravioli, I always want more!My girlfriend had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich. This thing was ginormous! This was two meals in one, I would suggest sharing. Note, the house made mozzarella was a very nice touch.For dessert I had a classic Bomboloni and the Lemon Lavender Honey gelato. This gelato blew me away. So refreshing and creamy. I highly recommend trying this paired with an espresso. Perfection!"

I highly recommend checking this restaurant out and I will definitely be back.First, I want to give a shout out to my awesome server Mariah. She gave us great insight on the menu, what her favorite dishes were and what was popular with the guest who dine here.Second, the location is perfect. Obviously, everyone knows that 80% of the cool restaurants are located in the West Loop.Third, the food is delicious and the desserts are SO DAMN GOOD I probably would have to think twice about sharing if the Big Guy upstairs asked for a bite.Food*Parmesan Truffle Potato Skins - good, but wouldn&#39;t have been worth it if it wasn&#39;t for the lemon garlic aioli which made these good. 3.5 stars.*Meats &amp; Cheeses (Mortadella/Dodge City &amp; Truffle Tremor-Goat/Bad Axe-Sheep) - so good. The Mortadella was my favorite paired with the Bad Axe-Sheep cheese. 4 stars.*Short Rib Lasagna - I would have never thought to mix short ribs and lasagna, but I&#39;m glad the creative minds in the kitchen of Bar Siena did. 4 stars.*Prosciutto Fig Pizza - is a must try. The honey they drizzle over the pizza makes it that much more attractive to the taste buds. 5 stars.Desserts*Nutella Calzone - freaking amazing! Get them get them get them. 5 stars.*Bomboloni - an Italian donut with different filling options. We had the maple buttercream filling and it was delicious. 5 stars."

We came in for a late lunch on Sunday and could only get an inside booth by the bar. Minor quibble - hostess had a real attitude problem: initially she insisted she couldn&#39;t seat us, despite the 2 obviously empty booths immediately behind her station. Somehow seating us immediately ended up being less of an inconvenience for her than taking our names down for an outside table, so we were seated immediately. Everything was great after that.We shared the prosciutto fig pizza (which just about every other Yelper ordered) and a fennel sausage calzone. I was initially skeptical about all the positive reviews, but this pizza really is the perfect balance of sweet &amp; savory. Only tiny complaint is the crust was a wee bit greasy. The calzone was heartier and not as amazing. This place is a carb-lover&#39;s heaven. We were too stuffed for dessert, even though I really wanted to try everything. our server was efficient and attentive, our water &amp; lemonade glasses never less than 1/2 full. The interior was super cool. On the famous restaurant row already filled with excellent destination restaurants, Bar Siena raises the bar even higher."

They have booths, high tops, a bar or regular tables that you can sit at which is nice to have all those options.Food:HIGHLIGHTS:Price point: appetizers and food average $20, dessert averages about $5, wine $9 (not as many options for single glasses though), cocktails $13Appetizer: Grilled octopus &amp; shishitto peppersMain course: Fireball pepperoniDessert: Nutella calzone, smores gelato and vanilla bean custard bomboloni (all good for sharing)Wine: Pertinace BarberaFor an appetizer, one pizza, a beer, a glass of wine and two desserts our bill came to about $65.DETAIL:We came in on a Thursday night since High Five Ramen was a two hour wait. Like everything in the West Loop it had a wait, but for a Thursday at 7:30pm 45 minutes didn&#39;t seem too bad. They can take your name and text you when your table is ready, which is nice since the bar was packed so we were able to go elsewhere and grab a drink. Everything we had was phenomenal, no complaints what so ever. The grilled octopus and shishitto peppers does have a bit of a kick to it. I don&#39;t have a high tolerance for spicy and it definitely lingered, but nothing that water couldn&#39;t tame. The pizza was great, although seemed to be on the pricey side, $18 for a 12 inch thin crust, but I guess it&#39;s Chicago and West Loop right? In terms of wine, I wanted to try something new, I love malbecs and pinot noirs so the server recommended a Barbera. It was pretty good, but only got one glass so I could save room for the most important part, dessert. The dessert, SO GOOD. I&#39;m a huge sweets person so I&#39;m critical of them. The smores gelato came recommended by the server, but I also love smores in general so was already eyeing it. Good for 1-2 people. The chocolate portion of the gelato was really good, not too rich. I wished there was more marshmallow to it though. There was pieces of graham crackers in it as well that added to the unique texture. We also had the vanilla bean custard bomboloni. It was difficult to choose only one, I love donuts and wanted everything. There was the right amount of custard in the donut, enough to get a taste. The donut itself came warm and had a sugar coating to it. Good for 1-2 people. On another occasion separate from all that was described previously, I&#39;ve also had the nutella calzone, delicious, you can never go wrong with anything nutella. The crust of the calzone was nice and flakey and you get two decently sized ones, great for sharing between 2-4 people (depending on how greedy each person is with dessert). I had an order to myself.Service: It was good, for a pizza and an appetizer it came out within half an hour of ordering (probably even less than that). Super quick considering how busy they were.I highly recommend and would definitely go back (especially to try all the donuts and gelato)!"

She served us and the tables around us as though we were elegantly dining. The scene is amazing and I can only image how things are at night.SHARE SHARE SHARE! We decided to order our own appetizers and entrees but ended up eating off each other&#39;s plate. They prepare everything ahead of time. Cocktails are made like everything else, &#34;patch style&#34;, which turns out good because each patch is made with to perfection. Well seasoned (balanced) prepared plates. The chef really took time to outline the menu to meet the needs of advanced diners. If you are looking for a great meal, you&#39;ve found it.Ana M knew the menu well. She was aware of the needs of the table and we purchased things we regularly wouldn&#39;t. Her knowledge of the place is amazing. This place has been open for about a year, and in my opinion it&#39;s because of her.The &#34;mule&#34; cocktails are served in a unique cup outside of the standard bronze mugs. The restaurant keeps the Euro feel and I&#39;m sure travelers would feel at home. The wine list is perfecto.

First of all we went without reservations and were fortunate to be seated within an hour. While the bar area was crowded it wasn&#39;t hard to get a drink at all. Additionally this was our first nice weather weekend so everyone was out and about and it made for a nice crowd. Our waiter was really nice and knowledgeable. The food was thebomb.com( I will retire this phrase at some point in my life don&#39;t worry). We started out with the Taleggio Focaccia and the Grilled Octopus andShishito Peppers. Both were great but I will say the focaccia is the stuff dreams are made of. It was that good! For a main dish I got the Sweet Corn Ravioli which I really enjoyed. All in all a very good meal. I cannot wait to return.

And this location is becoming even hotter. It could be called Top Chef alum row. Fabio Viviani is giving Randolph street diners a new place to dine and stalk for openings that are not extremely early or late at night.I am too embarrassed to give a listing of every item I have tried in the short time this place has been open, but I will say I have devoured 95% of them. I listed my favorite items in the &#34;tip&#34; section and took few pictures too. You will notice a few of the pictures were taken after we started to eat them. We could not help ourselves. Dine here and you will understand why.What I loved about this place:- the decor is amazing.- seating; everything from booths, a patio, bar top seating, traditional tables and bistro style tables.- the music rocks. There&#39;s a DJ!- the staff members are extremely personable and accommodating- portions are small so you can try lots of them. :-)- you can spike the Italian ice for $5!- reservations are available on Opentable.- the no. 5 cocktail! (I&#39;m a lightweight)- and finally but most importantly, the food is very good. There&#39;s something for every palate.My least favorite things:- the fritto misto has too much batter. If you like lots of batter, this is the dish for you. The calamari &amp; shrimp were otherwise delicious.- the patio seating is first come first serve, but it&#39;s that way essentially everywhere."

Having eaten at Siena Tavern, some of the menu items were familiar but overall there was great variety and plenty of option.I had the lobster club and it was stellar! The buttery toasted brioche was a great vehicle for a substantial amount of delicious lobster. The green goddess dressing added such good flavor.  The fries were heavy in the salt for my taste but were perfectly crispy.The pizzas I saw coming out all looked amazing and seeing the gorgeous pizza oven really has me excited for my next trip back!"

We were sat upstairs and were told that all reservations were sat up there. I&#39;d have preferred to sit downstairs but wasn&#39;t a big deal.Food was pretty good overall. We started with the octopus. We were told it was one of their more popular apps. It was good but I would have liked a bit more char on it. I still think the octopus at RPM is better.We shared a pizza for our main course. I really like that they let you 1/2 &amp; 1/2 on your pizza.  We did the fig &amp; prosciutto for one 1/2 and margarita for the other. The fog was really good with just a drizzle of honey.  The margarita was just average.  I wouldn&#39;t order that one again.For desserts we had a bambino &amp; gelato.

I feel this place has so much potential, but it just hasn&#39;t gotten over the hump. The food and cocktails are solid: meatball appetizer is a must, but none of the menu items wow me. Service has varied. The wait staff is awesome. Both gentlemen I had were attentive, helpful and fun. The hostess on the other hand should be more mindful on how they handle situations. The first visit, I had to go up to the hostess after 45 minutes to inquire about our wait and she said she attempted to call and there was no answer. I showed her I had no record of a call and then stated that we were sitting at the bar (which she suggested) and within plain view. The second visit, my group of four was seated outside, but a chair was missing. Instead of grabbing a chair from an empty table next to us, she walked away to find a chair, but ended up still taking the chair from the table next to us. My friend stood up at the table waiting while she figured this very simple fix out. I&#39;m not sold on returning back."

I probably wouldn&#39;t order these again.Then we got the skirt steak - really delicious.   The cook on it was perfect.... the flavours were awesome... the only weird thing.... there were whole cloves of garlic just on the plate..... thought that was a little strange as I would not eat a whole clove of garlic.All-in-all.... another successful meal at Bar Siena!

I think Siena Tavern is delicious and I expected to feel that way here but I left thinking I wouldn&#39;t come back.Stracciatella (sp?) (fried cheese curds) were a bust- no flavor, just dull fried blobs. No gooey cheesy saltiness. Pass.Husband had the meatballs and declared them passable. The one appetizer that was DELICIOUS (and frankly the one item that was delicious) was the parmesan truffle potato skins. Yes- this I would come back for. Maybe.We had a salad that was pretty good- date and walnut, with endive I think. Tasty but nothing you can&#39;t get anywhere else.Lobster agnolotti was not that good. No distinct flavors. I don&#39;t know. I just was not feeling it.It&#39;s pretty loud (I feel like the oldest 34 year old in the world, saying that) but I just point it out in case someone&#39;s looking for an intimate meal- I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place based on volume.

I had the pleasure of dining here recently with my girlfriend. She was visiting from out of town and we wanted a chill yet happening place for dinner and drinks. Arriving at 7pm in a freezing cold Tuesday evening I thought there would be tables a plenty....wrong! Good thing I walked in when I did and snagged the last high top in the bar. The vibe is cool and contemporary and the giant lit tree smack dab in the middle of the joint is different and definitely something you won&#39;t see elsewhere in the city.There were three of us dining so we decided to split a couple dishes. My girlfriend has a dairy allergy so we went ahead and ordered the prociutto fig pizza sans cheese (based on our waitress&#39; opinion). We also ordered the sweet corn ravioli and poached pear salad. Food arrives, pizza looks delicious EXCEPT dunn dun dunnnn...there is cheese on it. My gf pointed it out to the waitress and she apologized and said they would make another one pronto. Ok great thank you....then the manager (or so I thought) comes over to apologize again and see if my friend was ok. He was very professional and extremely nice! He even sent over a free drink to her. To top it all off, they let us keep the faulty pizza with cheese for no charge....which hello I was in heaven because come on who wants pizza without cheese. The kitchen&#39;s mistake quickly became my cheesy gain.Oh the ravioli is an absolute must...so very rich and flavorful. A great comfort dish. The salad was equally delicious!Bar Sienna exceeded my expectations with their phenomenal customer service and tasty food. I will most definitely be back when the weather warms up to hopefully snag a seat on the outdoor patio. PRIME Randolph St. location ladies and gents;)"

Yummy.Finally, the burger.   I consider myself a burger connoisseur of sorts, and it takes something extra to impress me.  Two things set this apart... the bun seemed like it had just come out of the oven, and the roasted garlic mayo gave it a very distinctive taste.  It&#39;s not the best burger I&#39;ve ever had, but I&#39;d place it in the top ten.  The fries were great, too.By then we were full, but I rarely pass up dessert, so we split the mango Italian ice.   There were chunks of fresh mango, but the overall taste was blah.  And before we could get half-way through it, the ice had melted into a solid chunk.  Not worthy of the restaurant.Mariah, our server, was exceptional.  She was not only friendly, but also very knowledgeable about the menu.  Mariah made sure the food came out of the kitchen at the right times, and she checked in with us often to ask if we needed anything.Already have plans to return for dinner in a few weeks.  I&#39;m going to leave room for a Nutella calzone!"

The No. 1 (gin based) is so light/refreshing and its got a sour tang to it too! My boyfriend loved his No. 8, and thought the number 2 was just okFood:  Delicious! Seriously, I was very impressed. My boyfriend and I ordered the Fig Prosciutto Pizza. It has honey and figs, but also has thinly sliced prosciutto, which combined gives it this salty, yet sweet flavor. We ordered it because our server recommended it, but there were also a lot of good Yelp reviews about it and I totally agree! We also ordered the Burrata Wedge - it has creamy Burrata and crispy prosciutto. The dressing is also amazing, just an all around splendid salad!Dessert (yes we saved room):  We ordered the Truffle Tremor Goat Cheese (which is actually on the dinner menu), it was creamy, yet strong. Mmm mmm  but the best thing was the Maple Buttercream Bomboloni (donut) - a really delicious salty and sweet dessert, I could have had a few more! We got the gelato too, but I&#39;d stick with the bombolonis!I&#39;m really excited about this new restaurant and I think it&#39;ll be a great winter bar/restaurant!"

Place was already quite busy.We got the white tuna crudo and octopus with shishito peppers to start. Both were very good, especially the octopus. I got the gnocchi and friend got the skirt steak. Everything was very tasty and fresh. I thought the dishes I had here were more memorable than ones I had at Siena Tavern. While understanding that the plates are on the small side and meant to be shared and obviously a nice place on Randolph, I still thought the prices were steeper than need be or if portions were just a tad bigger, I&#39;d be more content.Our service was good. Food came out when they should and our server was friendly and helpful. She had a trainee on her side and she was delightful as well.Overall, I would recommend for late night bites with some friends and not really as a dinner destination. Ambience was nice. It was a tad loud but still able to converse (at least in the upstairs). Friend also noted that there was a line for the bathroom as there was only one stall at least for the guys, so that&#39;s certainly not ideal..."

Definitely was not impressed with the food presented. The taste was inconsistent in some of the dishes. The only dish I was impressed with was the gnocchi.

Another because one of my appetizers was pretty good. But it stops there. I was looking forward to trying Bar Siena to enjoy some dinner and drinks in west Loop. But everything seems way more &#34;big box&#34; than anything in the area. For example, when I asked for a very traditional mixed drink I was told they couldn&#39;t do it (even though they had all the ingredients listed on the menu) because their dozen signature drinks are all BATCH made. So don&#39;t order outside the list. The food was what I would expect for a pub bar type feel with an Italian twist, but lacked the added touch of care that you can really feel from the rest of Randolph street. If you need a quick bite this might be your place, but I won&#39;t be back."

I explained to the friendly waiter that I&#39;ve been to Siena Tavern and he was very honest that although some of the dishes used similar ingredients, I should not expect the same quality with certain items. Still we decided to try our luck with the Meatball sandwich and Chx Sandwich.Perhaps it&#39;s because he set my standards low but I thought both were incredible. The meatballs were obviously smaller than the ginormous one they serve at their sister restaurant but the texture and flavor were equally delicious! The chx was seasoned nicely and juicy especially when wrapped with the mozzarella.Our bill was right around $35 which is a bit pricey for a casual lunch but definitely a nice treat. I would return again to check out their dinner menu."

It&#39;s basically a wood fired pizza place with River North prices.Recommend:-mushroom white pizza-kale salad with green apple and cheeseDo not recommend:-carpaccio - too small and arugula purée on top threw me off, it completely over powered any taste of the beef-oysters - warning that they come pre-garnished with raw onion and a spicy aioli, did not like it as onion over powered all flavorStaff was friendly and apologetic that they were slammed with tables.

The venue is gorgeous! This is the perfect date or hang out spot for large groups. The lower level is more of a casual bar atmosphere, and the second level is a little more intimate and has a beautifully lit tree as the center piece. We sat at a rounded large booth right in front of the All Star Game (how did they know?!). It was just perfect.Our server explained the menu and was as kind as could be. The plates are all family style, yet you can probably finish a dish with just one person if you were truly starving. We ordered the lobster ravioli, the grilled chicken, a pepperoni pizza, spaghetti and meat balls, a side of both mashed potatoes and the Brussels sprouts. I was too busy stuffing my face to take pictures :(  The lobster ravioli won first place for the entire table, and the pizza may have come last (even though it was still very tasty).

It is a beautiful place for a quiet and intimate dinner both for date night and group meals. Their house pinot noir that I had was great and my friend&#39;s cocktail was sweet with a good kick! These are the dishes that I have tried at De Quay:TRUFFLE MAASDAM CHEESE DUMPLINGS(appetizer) $12 - the mustard sauce and the pickled peppers were delicious, sweet and sour...the dumplings were good but not great.TAMARIND &amp; SWEET SOY BARBECUED DUCK BREAST SALAD $26- the duck was seasoned and cooked perfectly and the sweet mangoes mixed in gave a great fresh flavor to the dish.SUMMER LAMB DUO $31- Perfection. Tender and perfectly cooked rib chops and lamb sausage, on top of flavorful goat gouda mashed potatoes. My fave dish of the night.BRAISED BEEF SHORT RIB $24- Delicious and very tender meat in shitake red wine sauce.ALMOND SPEKKOEK - Almond cake made to look like slices of bacon were beautifully presented and delicious at the same time.

We also loved the mussels.The entrees were also delicious. I can honestly say that I do not like duck. Due to the recommendations of the staff and yelp reviews, I took a chance and ordered it.

The muscles was covered in a sauce that tasted like coconut milk. I&#39;m not a huge fan of coconut milk so I only ate a few; the rest of my party on the other hand devoured it - they loved it!.I had the eggroll as my (restaurant week included) starter which was pretty good. My main course was the Nasi Gorang which was the popular fried rice. It was full of flavor and had a strong kick to it - beware to those who aren&#39;t into spicy food.

We started with potato gouda dumplings as our app. They were interesting but had far too many peas and too little cheese, the sauce was very nice. Then we had the the tamarind duck and butter chicken as mains. The duck was done well, it had the right texture, but the glaze didn&#39;t stand out at all, neither did the side of apples and greens. Frankly, I enjoyed the chicken more, it was perfectly tender, but again lacked flavor, which was compensated for by the side of rice and curry sauce. While all the dishes were fine, nothing really stood out, so I think they need to work on elevating the spices to add more flavor to their dishes.The service: 4/5. The sat at the bar and while the bartender was very helpful in explaining the menu and checking if we liked the food, the drinks weren&#39;t made well. She also never checked on us to ask if we wanted the second round. The manager stopped by twice for a friendly chat and that&#39;s the reason I didn&#39;t want to give a mediocre rating since he tried to go above and beyond, but that still couldn&#39;t compensate for the lackluster menu.Overall: 3/5.

The shrimp chips were good, and crunchy, those were fine.The staff was spot on, no complaints, great service from smiling servers. The people were wonderful.

Excellent starters.For the entrees, we ordered the short ribs, and lamb chops. For both, the meat was so tender. It fell right off the bone and melted in your mouth.

Make a trip to de Quay."

It also got good reviews here. It didn&#39;t live up to the hype.We started with the shrimp and mussels.Tasted exactly like a Thai  curry I could get anywhere but all sauce and no substance.My wife had the short ribs. They were fine but, once again, a dish I have had better in 100 different French and Italian restaurants. They were served with a bean fritter I rather liked though.I had the De Quay &#34;Nasi Goreng&#34;. It&#39;s an Indonesian rice dish and I believe a house specialty. It was basically the rice you get in every Mexican restaurant although the Mexican rice doesn&#39;t overuse cumin in the recipe. The egg on top didn&#39;t really belong even if it is traditional. I did like the pork belly because, ya know, it&#39;s pork belly.Service was lackluster. Parking was difficult but that&#39;s not really their fault."

The fusion of Dutch comfort foods with the influence of Indonesian traditional flavors really makes this restaurant stand out.

Indonesian-Dutch? As far as I know, pretty rare in Chicago. And literally a 4-minute walk from home? A dream come true for a convenient date night spot.And yes, the food was delicious. And it&#39;s a great date night spot. A solid four stars. I just don&#39;t think it blew my mind.Service was really great from the beginning. The restaurant feels very casual and neighorhoodly, but they really pamper you with the service like you&#39;re somewhere rillllll fancy. The manager went around checking in with diners and offering tasting pours, they wipe your crumbs between courses, and you get an explanation of the ingredients and components when the food is brought to the table. Everyone was super sweet and made our experience really fun.Kitchen seemed to be a bit backed up when we went on a weeknight, so it took a while to get our food. We had a smoked trout salad and nasi goreng as appetizers. The trout salad was nice and refreshing. Nasi goreng came with condiments that on their own I could nibble on forever, but the rice itself didn&#39;t have much flavor except for spicy and a bit sweet.Our entree pork chop was awesome. Delicious and hearty and the chop was cooked to a nice tender pink inside. Our shrimp entree was ... really freaking tiny. For almost the same price as the chop, you get literally a little salad, 4 pieces of small shrimp, and an eggroll cut in half. Even though that lumpia was definitely the best thing we ate all night, I would feel completely ripped off if it took me literally 8 bites to eat my dinner while my dining companions were enjoying hearty pork chops (or looking around, delicious looking short ribs).I would definitely recommend people here to try for a casual date night with your SO. But Chicago is so big and full of good spots, it might not make my &#34;return soon&#34; list until I&#39;ve made rounds to a few of the others."

I found the restaurant from couple of magazines on chicago&#39;s new &amp; hot list. Service was great. Food was just ok (very average for us)We started off with nasi goreng for appetizer (indonesian fried rice). It was nothing like the one i had back in indonesia. Having some shrimp crackers on top of fried rice didn&#39;t qualify it to become a nasi goreng. The dish was very much like a hot veggie fried rice at ~$13 (no meat in it: pricey!). It had a good flavor but we were disappointed as it was not nasi goreng as what we expected.I had the duck for my entree. It was ok. My husband had the braised beef short rib. It was very salty, so salty that we couldn&#39;t eat it. We asked them to remake it. They were very nice and asked us to pick some other dishes instead. My husband picked the chicken curry which was tasty &amp; comforting.We had panda ice-cream and almond cake. the portion was small. the cake was dense. You really need to eat it with ice-cream in every bites. I can&#39;t really taste pandan in the ice-cream. It was just an ice-cream with a strong green food-coloring.The place was not terrible, but clearly not 4-5 stars. We won&#39;t go back there again"

Lamb chops were awesome and the two apps (a rice with sing. spices and Gouda goat fondue) plus sides (mashed potatoes with Gouda and a type of kale salad) were all great hits with us.I am definitely going back and will leave enough time and room for dessert."

The staff was a bit icey, which I understand no one likes a late reservation, but then again why was that time slot an option on Open Table if you want to close right at 11:00 on a Saturday night?The manager was the exception, he was warm &amp; very inviting and even sent over a couple of drinks.We had the dumplings, which I thought were just okay.  Boyfriend had the chicken with curry and I had the duck.  The entrees were wonderful and saved the whole experience.Go for the food, but not after 10:00."

We thought the combination of Dutch and Indonesian would be interesting but were a little disappointed to find the brunch menu with mostly typical brunch dishes with a hint of Dutch influence and one or two Indonesian entrees. We both decided to go with the Nasi Goreng since it seemed to be the most unique. We both agreed that it was quite good and filling but it wasn&#39;t amazing. In terms of service and ambience, we both enjoyed it but shared the opinion that it was a tad too dark.

No treat for the eyes and a tad bland. The next night I headed to an Indonesian restaurant (a former Dutch colony) where a 25 dish rijsttafel (rice table) is served. This meal could not have been more different--exotic, spicy, and varied. Now, here in Chicago, we have De Quay, whose chef aims to unite these two polar extremes of Dutch cuisine on every plate.And to a remarkable degree he succeeds. My entree, flavorful beef short ribs in red wine sauce, came with a rendang croquette and pea shoots. Rendang I gather is an Indonesian spice mixture that provides a nice degree of heat and makes the croquette memorable. Gouda mashed potatoes were on the side. For dessert there was a stroopwaffel with vanilla ice cream. Stroopwaffels are as common in Holland as oreos are here and twice as delicious, a combination cookie and miniature waffle with a caramel filling. The version here is addictive.There is a great beverage program at De Quay. Guided by the terrific bartender, I sampled The Woodsman, a Manhattan-like cocktail that combines whiskey, walnut bitters and several other high quality ingredients. When it was time to choose wine, Terry recommended riesling. What&#39;s even better, he organized an impromptu tasting of several varieties to let you choose the one you preferred. As many have stated, the service here is exemplary.Now if only they would add herring to the menu (but not eel). They could even have a herring festival come spring and fly in new herring from Holland like the Oyster Bar in NYC does in June. One can only hope! Meantime we welcome De Quay as it is."

Rewind to 3pm this afternoon when I&#39;m chatting with a friend about grabbing a low key dinner, I offer to find a few suggestions from which to select for tonight. Wanting to checkout something i haven&#39;t had I peruse Chicago magazine&#39;s Hot List and see a few suggestions, one of which is this very random sounding &#34;Dutch Indonesian&#34; restaurant.Imagine my surprise when my friend&#39;s response is &#34;oh yeah, believe it or not I&#39;ve been saying Dutch Indonesian would eventually become hot in the US&#34;. She&#39;s enjoyed it in Amsterdam before, whereas I was a naive soul in 2006 when I visited A-dam and had no idea it existed.Scoring a reservation online was not a problem and we were seated promptly. It&#39;s a nice space with good energy - not crazy loud but not quiet either. Would be a great date spot or a dinner with a few friends.They have a great selection of rieslings, we enjoyed one from Alsace that was on the drier side. They actually recommend sweeter rieslings than we selected to pair with it due to the spices/seasonings.The food was delicious all around, but I would have given it a 4.5 stars if I could instead of 5 - taking a .5 demerit for the food not being quite as uniquely flavored as I might have expected.Chicken Satay starter - Super moist and tender, not dry like most satay. The peanut sauce was really interesting and there was a nice slaw served on the side.Braised Short Rib Entree - I was told by the server this was one of the more unique dishes, but I actually found the flavors to be pretty similar to most braised short rib dishes I&#39;ve had over the years. It was delicious with very nice meat, extremely tender but not overly fatty and a beautifully balanced sauce. There was a croquette that came on the side that was more uniquely seasoned (Indonesian seasonings) that I liked a lot too.Side of Gouda Mashed Potatoes - These are reminiscent of Rubochon style mashed. They were a nice pairing with the short ribs.Dessert - the waffle cookie thing with vanilla ice cream. This was sooooooo good. Perfect for sharing with 2 people and not too heavy.Overall a great meal, prices felt reasonable. Nice, attentive service too. It wasn&#39;t as unique as I expected but is a nice addition to the Lincoln Park food scene. I loved not having to head all the way south or to Lincoln Sq for a great meal."

When our original plans fell through, I took to the Yelps to find us a suitable alternative. Enter deQuay.deQuay caught my attention based on their cuisine alone. Dutch-Indonesian sounded like such a random pairing; turns out it is not, kind of like French-Vietnamese cuisine. deQuay&#39;s cuisine is not the only thing that is unusual; it sits in a stretch chock full of sushi joints, bro bars, and carry out places. I&#39;m not sure what used to occupy the space, but my money&#39;s on some form of bro bar.We arrived without reservations, but bar seats are first come first serve. I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t get a table, we learned so much about the restaurant from the staff behind the bar. I never caught our main bartender&#39;s name, but he was fantastic; extremely knowledgeable of the food and drink menus and not afraid to point out his favorites. His descriptions and recommendations were not only spot on, but so eloquently phrased that it often made our decisions harder. We chatted up a few other staff members during our meal as well; everyone was so friendly and welcoming. Even if the food hadn&#39;t wowed us, the service did; it was flawless - friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.To start we ordered a few drinks and gravalax starter. They have a nice selection of beers, craft cocktails and spirits. The dish came with the salmon wrapped around the beets and the creme fraiche and radishes adorning the top. It was recommended that we take a bite of just the salmon to savor the flavor of the house smoked fish. The salmon was excellent and the pairing of all of the ingredients was delicious and well balanced.For our meals, he went with the short rib and I went with the mussels and a side of the gouda mashed potatoes. If I had one knock on the place, it would be that the menu is very meat heavy (but that&#39;s my issue, not theirs). The mussels, generous in portion, were good and the sauce flavorful with sliced chiles and lime. The mashed potatoes sounded so good that I couldn&#39;t pass up ordering them; I didn&#39;t think mashed potatoes could be improved, but the gouda proved me wrong. The creaminess and saltiness is divine; they could be a meal on their own. We finished our meal with dessert; per usual many of the items sounded tasty, but we went with the stroopwafel - mainly because the manfriend loved the name. The dessert was simple, but good - a large, flat waffle cookie with caramel in the middle accompanied by homemade vanilla ice cream.deQuay is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood; perfect for a nicer meal and a good stop before seeing a show at the Apollo. Just don&#39;t forget to make a reservation."

Chef David de Quay brings a unique style of fusion with Dutch and Indonesian ingredients and spices. We started with Black Pepper Gouda Dumplings which had potato, peas, bacon and a side of mustard sauce which was amazing. I know I could eat just the Black Pepper Gouda Dumplings all night long. We also had the Nasi Goreng which is a fried rice with vegetables and tons of amazing Indonesian spieces. The Nasi Goreng does have a little heat to it and comes on slowly. Though it sounded amazing there was just something that seemed missing from it like some texture to the dish. The mains we had the Buttermilk Marinated Chicken and Tamarind and Sweet Soy Barbecued Duck Breast and Leg. The Buttermilk Marinated Chicken was perfect. Cooked just right and the Indonesian spices along with the basmati rice and curry sauce was a great combination. The Sweet Soy Barbecued Duck Breast and Leg with Asian pear, fennel, and ginger croutons was good but not great. The flavors were there but the duck with slightly overcooked. It was not horrible to send back but if you are going to serve duck to an Asian specialty Chinese, you better get it right. The drinks were good as well. The one that stood out was the Bee Sting which was Chairman&#39;s Reserved Spiced Rum, Bull Run Temperance Trader Bourbon, Honey Syrup, Lemon, and Ginger Beer. This is a small space so large groups may not be easy though the tables can be placed together. I did feel like we were placed on a spotlight as the 2 way tables are all in the middle of the restaurant. It is still a quaint place great for dates. I know there were a few other things I wanted to try including the Grilled Pork Chop and Smoked Rookworst, Braised Beef Short Rib, Stroopwafel and Almond Spekkoek. I will be back and maybe GM Terry McNeese would avoid running into my chair the next time. There are some tweaks I would recommend but great early start for being one of Eater and Zagat&#39;s top anticipated restaurants of 2015.Food - 4Décor - 4Service - 5"

Confused? It doesn&#39;t really have an effect on the restaurant, so don&#39;t worry.Things didn&#39;t start exceptionally well when we forgot the parking pit of hell that de Quay is a part of. Honestly, the 2400 N block of Lincoln is just a miserable place to try and park a car. After dropping off Meg L and walking 4 blocks back to the restaurant, I was greeted by a restaurant that seemed to think 80 degrees was an appropriate temperature.But...that&#39;s all the bad stuff. And, to be honest, the temperature found its way down to normal as the meal went on.The cocktails were inventive and well made. The wine and beer list are very solid. The food was interesting and terrific all around. At the table, we tried some dumplings made with gouda and a chicken sate. Both excellent, and the dumplings were like nothing any of us had ever tried before. As entrees, the pork chop was terrific (and fairly Dutch-seeming) and the fried rice (apparently the national dish of Indonesia) was unique and outstanding both as dinner and as my breakfast the next day. The spice level of the fried rice was about as perfect as is possible for a dish of that ilk.It&#39;s not a huge menu and likely not somewhere you&#39;ll end up going frequently, but we&#39;ll definitely be back."

If this is Indonesian Fusion, it outright sucks. The overbearing condescension here is off-putting. I&#39;m Dutch. I grew up on this stuff. When I get a hard time about wanting Sambal Ooolek for undercooked Basmati rice with odd things like zucchini in my Nasi, my eyebrow gets ticked. Doing it wrong, not coming back. The service was terrific overall, but the product is not. They do make good kroupeouk, but a six year old with a vat of boiling oil can make that. Trust me. I know.

It&#39;s gezellig - those that are Dutch know what I&#39;m talking about.After living in Amsterdam and understanding the cuisine, this spot delivers on the right combination of flavors. We started with Gouda filled dumplings which were creamy and perfect for the rainy day. The short rib was delicious as was the duck with gingerbread croutons.Overall, neighborhood gem for date night or dining alone (there&#39;s a nice bar to sit at as well).  The banquet could use some pillows to soften the back, but otherwise really enjoyed.  We&#39;ll definitely be back for another date night."

Our server gave us the rundown: some dishes are exclusively Dutch, some exclusively Indonesian, and others a very well calculated mix of the two. We discovered this to be the case; we started with the very Dutch black pepper dumplings. They were quite tasty and the mustard sauce added a nice touch. For the main course, I had the tamarind glazed duck breast and leg, with a pear and Dutch breakfast bread crouton salad. The flavors all married well together, although the duck could have been a little more rare than it was. It was not dry, but there was little pink left in the center. My date also enjoyed her dish, the braised beef short ribs with an interesting Indonesian take on croquettes. All in all, a delicious meal with some pleasant and subtle surprises; I&#39;ll be back!"

The staff was super knowledgeable about the ingredients going in to their foods and the flavor profiles of each dish. Everything we had tasted amazing and was such a unique combination of flavors.I had the lumpes - like an egg roll - the lamb curry and the peanut butter/chocolate dessert (obviously missing the real menu names). I&#39;m usually hesitant to order curry because while I like spice, the particular flavor usually doesn&#39;t do it for me, but this one I loved. It was subtly spicy and flavorful.Our waitress was sure to make sure we enjoyed every course and was super attentive.  Thanks, de Quay!"

Partner had the lamb chops, a new addition to their menu as of 12/29/15. Cooked really well with a delicious glaze and served with special Indosian spiced rice which highlighted flavors of peanut and coconut in a balanced way.Had the curry chicken which was cooked wonderfully moist and well seasoned (not too salty or bland), only negative would be the sauce lacked the bold flavors that I think of when I think of Indonesian.Owner (or manager?) was very friendly stopping by throughout meal to check in and making suggestions for the menu and chit chat.

We ordered the dumplings both times we were there, they are just great.The first time he had short rib which he liked but he liked my dish better, Nasi Goreng which I got again this time and it was, again, excellent. He got the Sumatran Chicken Curry and loved it, the sauce was coconut curry-ish... very savory and flavorful.The best part was their staff is all participating in your experience so you are never waiting for someone to be attentive.

Chicago is overloaded with ultra high-end restaurants or trendy joints made to look like Edison-era industrial lofts, so de Quay stands out for its combination of modesty and ambition. There&#39;s nothing else like it in the city. I&#39;ve had Indonesian food before served at warungs in Bali and a random spot in Philly, but I&#39;ve never had Dutch food and certainly not in concert with the former.Why on earth did chef/owner David de Quay hide his talents at the Hinsdale Golf Club of all places?! Good God, I want to believe he was trying to raise capital to open this gem of a restaurant. If so, the wait was worth it.For appetizers, a friend and I ordered the frites, crispy and light and that come with a peanut satay sauce and mayo with dill; the nasi goreng, spicy fried rice packed with heat and roaring with flavor; and the black pepper gouda dumplings, rich and creamy and gone in two seconds once you taste them they&#39;re so delicious.We decided to order one entree to split because of all the appetizers and we were happy with our choice. We got the buttermilk-marinated chicken on jasmine rice with red curry. It tasted like chicken, whereas chicken typically tastes like nothing. Considering how tender and juicy it was, it made me question the quality of chicken I&#39;ve been eating all my life. The dish was divine.For dessert, we got the stroopwaffel with vanilla ice cream, a light, perfect confection to top off a heady meal.Service was lovely and attentive throughout the evening. I&#39;ve rarely encountered people who were more excited to work at a restaurant. It&#39;s clear they&#39;re passionate about the place from our waitress raving about taking her friends there to the general manager who brought us free glasses of riesling. We felt totally at home.Our total bill, including two beers, came to $71 before tip. Super reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber, underpriced even. I tipped generously. So should you.I don&#39;t know how much longer this restaurant will remain low-key before word gets out as to how outstanding it is and reservations become a pain. Go now."

The short rib itself was outstanding, but the croquette was just OK.For our dessert, we shared the almond spekkoek, which was great with the pandan ice cream.Drinks:The highlight of the meal was the Bee Sting. It was a great balance of flavors, and surprisingly not too sweet for a ginger beer drink with honey. We also tried the Woodsman, which was good but nothing exceptional, and an orange juice based gin drink (the name is escaping me) that was good on its own, but a little sweet for my tastes.

I don&#39;t get it.  The food quality was bad at best.  Only 5 entries to select from off the limited menu.  I got the &#34;Nais Goreng&#34; or it should be renamed the &#34;Nazis Goring&#34;. This is basically fried rice with a two poached eggs and 5 1&#34; square  pieces of pork belly for $19.  Come On, My local Chinese restaurant could do better for $5. The scallops for $28 were hard to find on the plate, There were like 5 sliced in half. I also got the &#34;Gado Gado&#34; salad. Once again miss named it should be be &#34; God oh God where is my salad&#34; It was 5 thin strings of greens with a peanut vinaigrette dressing that was non existing.  We had to ask for some peanut sauce to add some favor.  All this for only $10. In general stay away.  poor quality food, over priced with micro sized portions. It also took over 60 minutes to delivery this feast from the time our drinks and salads were delivered."

During that time, the undergraduate student fell in love with frites met satesaus (French fries with Indonesian peanut sauce), which she could purchase for a mere five guilders (about $2.50 at the time). Upon returning to the United States and graduating from college, the young woman searched and searched for frites met satesaus throughout West Michigan where many Dutch Americans live but to no avail. Although she was able to order French fries with a side of peanut sauce meant for other dishes on occasion, it was not until she discovered de Quay more than twenty years after her return to the States that she found one of her favorite flavor combinations on a menu in America. When she visited de Quay with her husband, they created their own rijstaffel (rice table) by ordering the frites met satesaus, nasi goreng (Indonesian fried rice), Gouda cheese dumplings, and a homemade stroopwafel (syrup-filled waffle cookie) with ice cream. The frites were crispy of the outside and soft on the inside, and the satesaus was perfect! The peanut sauce was just as the now-not-so-young woman remembered. The nasi goreng was flavorful, fluffy, and moist all at the same time. The Gouda cheese dumplings were unusual as well as outstanding, and the stroopwafel was warm and gooey in the most tantalizing of ways. Lekker! (Luscious!) In addition, the service was outstanding, which means that this food fairytale was a dream come true. To de Quay, the hero in our story (me) says, &#34;Dank U wel!&#34; (thank you) and to her dear readers, she says, &#34;Eet smakelijk!&#34; (Enjoy your meal!)"

As we looked at our menus, I noticed the top right hand corner had &#34;Happy Birthday, Ashley&#34; printed on tonight&#39;s dinner menu. I&#39;m a sucker for personalization and I really enjoyed that I was able to take the menu home. This is all about the service, I haven&#39;t even started on the food.My boyfriend had the duck, and I had the salmon. The salmon was prepared in a fall style, with a butternut squash base. The duck was very tender and flavorful as well!!Thanks for making this experience a memorable one!"

I cannot say enough good things about the food, and the people who make you feel welcome and comfortable to be there. Described as a fusion of Dutch and Indonesian cuisines, the flavour combinations are just sublime. Sophisticated comfort food with as sophisticated of a palate. Noel behind the bar is knowledgable and eager to help with your drink and meal pairings, Terry working the floor and front of house makes you feel at home. Tonight we feasted on  the lamb curry and the pork chop and it was just divine. For desert the chocolate peanut-butter mouse pave was decadent as well as delicious.  For us this is an exquisite addition to our neighborhood and soon to be a second home."

We also had the gouda dumplings and tamarind bbq duck, both of which were delicious and well prepared. Service was fine, but after reading the rave reviews I was a bit underwhelmed.

I started out with the Black Pepper Gouda Dumplings which came with an ample side of mustard sauce. This were not my favorite item of the evening, but they were good. I like my dumplings to be soft, but al dente and these were hard and somewhat crunchy. My next course was the Nederland Winter Salad with Shaved Butternut Squash, Frisee, Raisins, Cumin-Chili Spiced Pecans, Granny Smith Apple with a Mustard Vinaigrette and this was delicious. My entree course was Grilled Salmon with a Shrimp Sambal Vinaigrette with Roasted Winter Vegetables and Toasted Curried Pumpkin Seeds. I loved this dish. I also had the Vegetarian version of the Nasi Goreng which is an Indonesian Fried Rice. This dish is quite Spicy with the Indonesian spices that is in it. This was my favorite of the evening and unless their menu changes drastically it will be ordered each time, even if most of it is going to be packed up to take home, as was on the night I was there. What would New Year&#39;s Eve be without dessert? For the finale I had the Almond Cake with the Pandan Ice Cream, which is reminiscent of Pistachio Ice Cream. The manager came be my table a few times to check and see that I was enjoying my dinner and even offered a glass of sparkling wine on the house. This is a wonderful neighborhood restaurant that offers a unique blend of two cuisines Dutch and Indonesian and I highly recommend dinning here."

I hope this will not be my experience with de Quay, because it seemed very promising on a recent weekend dinner visit. We loved the food and beer, the cordial &amp; attentive service from both our server and the manager, and the cozy Dutch ambiance. But I fall in love too easily, and I can&#39;t bear the thought of heartbreak...We liked the compact menu -- it features a blend of Dutch and Indonesian choices that I haven&#39;t encountered before. The gouda dumplings were a tasty start -- and comfort food of the highest order. My pork chop entrée made me happy; possibly brined, sous vide and flash grilled, it was tender &amp; delicious in a Dijon sauce served with gouda mashed potatoes, smoky rookworst sauage, napa cabbage slaw, and fried kale. Great combo of flavors and textures. My companion&#39;s short rib was simply the best I&#39;ve tasted -- so tender, so flavorful -- and nicely plated with a couple of short rib croquettes and a fluff of pea shoots. Our plates were clean and we were all grins! Dessert was OK, if a little low-key: we had almond spekkoek (like a dobosh torte filled with almond paste) and pandan ice cream. The coffee was excellent, fresh &amp; flavorful (nearly as good as Julius Meinl). There&#39;s a nice selection of beers and wines, too.I am already planning to return. This could be the real thing.

Dinner was definitely the better meal due to its options -- we had the Nederlands salad, the mussels, the chicken curry, and the dumplings.

But, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth all the rave reviews.For about $6 you get a cup of soup (maybe 10-12oz) and a hunk of bread. The soup is always scalding hot. It takes at least 5 minutes for the soup to be an edible temperature (don&#39;t come here if you&#39;re in a hurry to dig in). I&#39;ve burnt my tongue and the roof of my mouth every single time. The restaurant is also always blazing hot.However, the soup is good. And the staff is always nice.

Any way, the soup is usually always good, I appreciate the vegetarian and vegan options. I only have 2 concerns, as a vegetarian I would eat always taste the tomato before I got it because more often than not it seemed very watered down. Also the soup is a bit under seasoned some times... But to add to that they have a complementary spice wrack so you can add some zest! I just wish it was not so pricy, I know it&#39;s the Gold Coast, and everything is pricy, and I know they &#34;home make&#34; the soups, but I paid 9 dollars for 1 bowl of vegetable soup today... That&#39;s crazy to me!  As a vegan now the veggie chili is great, the bean soup is good, the fire roasted veg is excellent and the chipotle sweet potato was the bomb. I like that you can mix soups also. If you ever want extra bread, they will give it to you, the staff is super friendly, those items make the price seem a little more legit."

There was maybe two veggie soups of their ten or so soups available, so I went with the veggie and bean soup. They give you one free topping and bread or crackers with your soup. I went with onion for the topping, thinking it&#39;d be caramelized.I got my soup to go and brought it back to my hotel room a block away. The soup was just okay, not a lot of veggies or beans and quite oily feeling. I opened the onions and saw they were raw, so I was only going to add a few. By mistake, most of the little container went in, and the soup was pretty much just overpowered by onion. With each soup, it would be nice if they listed a recommended topping.Overall, service was friendly enough, though not super attentive. The place itself has a salad bar-type area too, but it didn&#39;t feel as nice or clean as a Hale and Hearty, for example. It was overall a 2.5 or so, but I was generally underwhelmed."

It tasted very fresh and fruity. The only thing I felt could be better was to serve the salad on a plate rather than putting it in a small plastic container.Overall, we enjoyed the food, as well as the homey and cozy atmosphere."

I&#39;d recommend adding turkey for an extra $1.Each bowl comes with your choice of cheese and complimentary bread.  You can buy grilled cheese sandwiches with any soup for only $2.99 too.----Conclusion: A fantastic concept that would be a hit across the US! During those Winter months, this place would be a godsend.  At first taste, you&#39;ll easily see why it was voted the best soup in Chicago by locals.Extra Notes:-Accepts credit card-Brilliant and extremely patient service-Decor could use some changing as the floors are dark, and walls need to be repainted--Kind of seems like a dreary and gloomy place-Tables are uneven and rock, be careful-Located on top of Streeter&#39;s Tavern.  A small flight of stairs will lead you to SoupBox.-No restrooms"

The lobster bisque was also really good...Only thing, there were NO lobster pieces in it!I just looked it up - bisque do not have chunks, chowders do, so that falls on my lack of soup knowledge! So, no loss of stars there. I give four stars instead of five simply because the price seems way too high for a cup of soup.

I&#39;ve tried five different chicken noodle soups around my location of River North and both Pret a Manger and Cosí were MUCH better. It had a very strong onion taste and not many chunky vegetables. I paid extra for the bread bowl which was soft and fresh. But there was no butter. I guess I had to specify that I needed butter with my bread.Also, my husband had the clam chowder which was fishy. Yes, I know clams are seafood. But this was fishy to the point where I questioned it&#39;s safety. Even my husband commented that it was really fishy and he eats seafood soups all the time.

Bread is not. I&#39;m definitely gonna go back and try the other soups. Also I wish they had bigger sizes. The bread bowl they offer is def not happening, &amp; the &#34;large&#34; isn&#39;t big enough. When I eat soup usually that&#39;s all I eat so I like to eat a lot of it. I guess I could just get two next time..."

Came here on vacation with friends and we were so full from lunch that Soupbox was a snack for us. Super HOT soup that made my heart super warm :)Environment - Although this restaurant is small, it gives off a very good vibe when you first step foot into it. There is one counter when you walk in and there are literally barrels of soup right in front with a server in the back. There are plenty of chairs and tables for you to sit comfortably. There&#39;s even a nice bathroom for you use when you drink too much soup :)Service - The servers give good recommendations when you ask them. There was always a smile on the workers&#39; faces and never did they seem impatient while my friends and I were making our decisions on which soups to get.Food - I don&#39;t think you can go wrong with any kind of soup here. Whenever I am given the option to have soup as a meal, I ALWAYS choose chili. However, since I already had chili earlier today, we got other of their many fine options:- Lobster Bisque - although there weren&#39;t chunks of lobster or any for that matter, there was very good lobster flavoring in the soup. It was very smooth, creamy and flavorful. It wasn&#39;t at all too seafoody nor salty. It tasted really good with sourdough bread of course. Although this one is on the more expensive side, it is a very good one to share with a friend :)- Broccoli White Cheddar - two words: light and smooth. I think if you&#39;re to eat a soup alone, this would be the perfect choice. There was a good blend of both broccoli and cheddar, not one over-powering another.-Tomato Florentine - I don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever had a tomato soup that went wrong. With that said, this soup was perfect and the chunks of vegetables inside were very soft. I ordered the grilled cheese with the soup because, come on, why wouldn&#39;t you eat them together. Add a grilled cheese to any soup fro $2.99 I took advantage of that.- Grilled Cheese - on first glance, the sandwich looked a little greasy.... but I looked past that. The grilled cheese was super soft when I bit into it and the butter and crunch from the toast were the perfect touches that topped the whole meal off.In conclusion, eat here.The end :)"

A few coworkers recommended Soupbox, and so despite the 6-block walk (which is long enough to Divvy) I decided to give it a go.I sampled the clam chowder, which this day was served Manhattan-style. It was good but I prefer my clam chowder white, so I went with the wild rice and cream of chicken soup in a breadbowl.The breadbowl is excellent. I grabbed a sourdough breadbowl (I can&#39;t remember if there&#39;s any other type) and it was fine-crumbed, for a sourdough, and very flavorful. Then soup itself had discretely chewy rice and good chicken chunks and flavor. Better than anything I could pull together at home, that&#39;s for sure.Next time I&#39;m feeling under the weather, I&#39;ll be willing to give Soupbox a spin."

There&#39;s so many different soups, and they let you try before you buy! But don&#39;t burn your tongue on the samples like I did :PI sampled the potato/leek and lobster bisque. Both were good, but I went with the potato/leek because the bisque was just liquid and I needed some texture. Comes with a piece of bread, and the sourdough was really good! Also, had a side salad which was decent but nothing special.There&#39;s an option to mix 2 in a bowl which I will do next time. The regular size (which is their smallest option) was actually pretty big and I got a little bored eating one soup. I ended up adding cayenne at the end to jazz it up.Tip: Do NOT sit at the tables with your soup! All of the tables are not balanced for some reason and can dangerously rock at any sudden movement. I almost got doused with my piping hot soup before I even ate. Eat at the bar stools or take it to go."

The soup was nothing special. Panera Bread and Marie Callender&#39;s are much better and taste more fresh. Soupbox is also really overpriced which I guess is to expect in the city.

Well, it wasn&#39;t too chilly on the day that I visited Soupbox, but I was still satisfied by the experience nonetheless.With a dozen or so soups to choose from, you probably have to worry more about deciding which one soup you are going with rather than being able to find a soup that fits your tastes. From the creamy to the stock based and the meaty to the vegetarian, this place has it all. There are also vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options. These fresh soups come in three sizes: regular, large, and bread bowl. One downside of Soupbox is that the prices are a bit steep (ie, my bread bowl clocked in at over $10), but I reckon you can argue that these price tags are on par with other spots in downtown Chicago and the bread bowl is a lot of food.For my visit, I went with the vegetarian chili and was definitely pleased. Fresh, hot, and just the right amount of spiciness, this most certainly hit the spot. Combine the soupy goodness with the fresh and voluminous sourdough bread bowl and I was heading straight towards a delightful food coma.Note to the customer: Once ordering at the first counter and receiving your food, then proceed down to the register at the back end of the store to pay.The only other negative of this spot is that there could easily be a lack of seating when it&#39;s poppin&#39;! And I do believe this place gets busy. So it may be wise to snag a seat as soon as you can or take your food to go when the crowds dictate so.Soupbox also offers salads, grilled cheese! (which I definitely would have gotten if not for the bread bowl), and gourmet cookies for your dining pleasure.If I lived in Chicago, I know I&#39;d be a frequent visitor attempting to try as many soups as possible!"

The burrata is wonderfully soft and literally melts in your mouth.My husband and I also shared the Farmhouse Club, which was spot on, exactly what I needed and craved.I&#39;ll definitely be back for more of some o&#39; that Blue Door country home pizazz."

The Brussels &amp; Kale salad is a standout.On the sandwich front, the grilled cheese menu is so much more than its name suggests, and this season&#39;s flavors have the restaurant turning to pies for inspiration. The Pumpkin &amp; Sage is BDFS&#39;s take on pumpkin pie, while Apple Pie &amp; Bacon draws on its namesake&#39;s classic flavor.While BDFS is an ideal lunch spot, it also has a coffee, tea and juice counter that serves up beverages from two other Chicago businesses - Bow Truss Coffee Roasters and Harvest Juicery - making mornings a little better, too."

It&#39;s one of the best I&#39;ve had to date with the perfect blend of herbs. I also really loved their turkey sandwich, though the one I had isn&#39;t on their menu anymore it seems. It is a bit pricey for the amount of food you get, but quality is top notch so I guess you are paying for that. The front of the shop has some local items for sale if you are interested in that."

Definitely a little herb-y but sweet enough that it was still very tasty.My friends and I sat at a small table and chatted for a good hour and a half or two hours and there was a constant bustle around the place.

After some confusion, boo and I realized we had to order first and then seat ourselves, in which servers brings us our orders. After ordering, we waited a bit but luckily snagged two seats at the bar top, in front of all the sandwich-making. I like the idea of the communal table they have there, but probably not for me. Space overall was very inviting.I got the tuna sandwich while bf had the gouda and ham. We also split an apple pie and bacon sammie. Sandwiches took a tad long to come. Since we were close to all the action, we saw some confusion amongst the servers, so that was unpleasant. We finally get our orders and they messed up boo&#39;s sandwich. However, the lady was nice and offered to box that one up, as she gave us the correct order, so we got a free sandwich.I enjoyed the tuna and everything tasted fresh. I like that it was a little different and had some string beans in there. The ham &amp; gouda was pretty good too, as with the butternut squash soup. The apple pie &amp; bacon one was quite yummy and not overly sweet, but definitely more a dessert imo. I also very much enjoyed the accompanied potato salad.Overall, I really enjoyed the place itself. Sandwiches were pretty good, but think there are betters options here, in which we would like to try. Definitely interested to see their new location on Halsted."

I heard two staff members talking about a third, have heard staff complaining about customers and also staff members fighting with each other about duties/yelling at each other to get things done. If the employees can get their act together and present a better front to customers, this place gets 5 stars no question. That&#39;s just stuff that needs to be dealt with off the clock.

The dip on the side provided a lot of extra flavor and moisture-Blue Door Chicken Salad SandwichNot like your typical chicken salad. Still good but not exactly mind blowing.-LatteWe ordered this with a pump of hazelnut. The entire latte was flavorless. I could neither taste the espresso or the hazelnut. Would definitely not order again.Total price: $28All in all, incredibly overpriced. The Roast Beef French Dip sandwich was very tasty but it did not justify the price. It was $12 for a small sandwich with a tiny little tin of potato salad. I could not get over how bland the latte was.Overall this place is decent.

The soup was amazing: fennel, sweet potato and chicken. The salad looked great but was very bitter. It could have used more dressing or seasoning to combat the bitterness of the kale and sprouts.My soup and salad combination cost $10, which I thought was a fair price considering the quality of ingredients. I also considered purchasing one of the cold pressed juices until I saw that they cost the same as my entire meal: $9.50!

The Cobb Salads came in tiny little boxes, but when I put it onto a separate plate to mix it up, it ended up being almost a whole meal in itself. They certainly do not short you on take out salads!

You can do half of each for $11, but I regret not doing a full one of each because that&#39;s how good it was.The grill cheese was very savory, that fig in it was the best, and now I&#39;m going to start putting fig jam in my grill cheese.I don&#39;t like Brussel Sprouts, but the Brussels and Kale salad was amazing, w/e dressing they put in it was awesome.The cool thing about this place is they have a map of IL and MI where they where all their food comes from. It&#39;s a very rustic feeling inside, wood tables, homely bathrooms,  big bottles of glass water. The only problem with this place is the heat. It was like 15 degrees warmer in here than it was outside and it was 65 degrees out. Their kitchen gives off a lot of heat, and I left smelling like a kitchen, even 1 day later my coat still smells. Oh well. #worth.Also for dessert we got the carrot cake and split it 3 ways. It was amazing, can&#39;t go wrong, and it&#39;s all MASSIVE, so you definitely need to split it multiple ways."

But with ample seating and plenty of staff, there was no worries of not having a seat. I decided to try one of the grilled cheese sandwiches, a sandwich I don&#39;t often eat. I went with the &#34;Grown Up,&#34; which had gruyere, havarti, and swiss, plus basil and tomatoes and a rosemary honey. The sandwich was OK, really only OK, despite the terrific array of cheeses and bread from Red Hen Bread. The only flavors I really could taste were of the herbs, and the single, small piece of tomato was very flat. It&#39;s tomato season, and this is a farm-to-table themed place; how did I get a listless tomato??Completing the nostalgic lunch, I got a cup of the tomato bisque. The soup was quite tasty. Lots of flavor, a bit of spice, and a terrific creamy consistency. I wouldn&#39;t have minded it being a little thicker, so that it stuck better to the bread of my sandwich. But the flavor profile made up for the light density, and I scraped out every last drop.The cafe itself has a bunch of other fun things to try: pastries, cheeses, meats, juices, coffee, and so on. I did not have any of those things today, though I will note with approval that they had Nordic Creamery butters and cheeses--a terrific brand. I think if I had time to go back before I left the city, I&#39;d try a coffee, a salad, and a different full sandwich. I still trust that the meats and vegetables are fresh and high quality, I just was less than thrilled with my particular sandwich. Maybe I should stick to not getting grilled cheese."

Initially, I thought the food was great and easy to pick up on my lunch breaks. However, some of the managers seem to think it is ok to bark orders at their employees, and treat them with disrespect in front of customers. I find this extremely rude and it puts a bad taste in my mouth. I don&#39;t like to see when a manager only delegates tasks that they could obviously do themselves. I hope this changes because I enjoy the grown up grilled cheese and their sesame chicken salad.Definitely avoid this place on weekends as well, because it is a zoo filled with tiny crying children who throw their food on the ground, which employees leave there for hours. I&#39;m pretty sure this is considered unsanitary.I hope in their new Halsted location that the quality will go back to what it was when I discovered this place in June."

Think flowers in mason jars, water in mason jars, empty mason jars....and tons of quirky gadgets in all the right places. So while the food was alright, I have some reservations:1. The breakfast menu is rather limited, and ends by noon! Pretty sure the brunch gods mandate that nobody be at a restaurant before 12 pm.2. The sandwiches are pretty good, but I ordered one with a coffee and ended up paying $18--whaaaaa?Although these two things rather irked my brunching experience, the staff was super friendly and we spent quite some time there without being bothered. This place seems to be more suitable for lunch, for which I likely would have been more satisfied...thus, 4 stars.However, if you&#39;re looking for some traditional brunch without paying for a pretty penny, I&#39;d look elsewhere."

The neighborhood really needed something that was affordable, healthy, and quick. The answer? Blue Door. I&#39;ve tried everything from their salads, soups, sandwiches, and yes the occasional &#34;slice&#34; of carrot cake. If you&#39;ve never had the carrot cake, try it just once, I double dare you. My only complaint is that this place is forever and always crowded (typically with strollers and blonde moms, as they can smell kale from 10 miles away). Overall a great experience and good value for the quality of food! Will continue to be a regular!"

Came in on a Sunday morning with Sunny H. for some grub. I do wish Blue Door had some more breakfast options, but we ended up going with lunch. The restaurant is located in a very convenient spot on Armitage in an old house. The interior is decorated so well, like straight from Pinterest. They even have a map in the back outlining where all of their food comes from which is so cool! Sunny and I ordered at the counter and sat down to wait for our food.I have one complaint and reason for my deduction of a star. We waiting a reeeeeeally long time for two sandwiches. I think they might still be working out the kinks and not have enough runners, but we were both feeling very impatient by the time our food finally arrived. Blue Door&#39;s menu has a plethora of very appealing sounding items. While we waited, we saw large, colorful salads going by, and hearty-smelling soups. Sunny and I decided to share the turkey/cheddar sandwich on multigrain and the chicken salad. The turkey was fresh and the sandwich was melty and so tasty! The cheddar was tangy as well as the preserves on top. The chicken salad sandwich was even better. The chicken salad itself was smokey and phenomenal! I can&#39;t wait go to back and have this again. Both of our sandwiches came with huge kale chips that had some parmesan sprinkled on top, such a nice touch!Overall, I can&#39;t wait to come back to Blue Door. The interior is really pleasant and their menu is full of locally sourced items that sound fantastic. Definitely recommend as a lunch option in the area!"

I don&#39;t blame them and it was silly of me to be disappointed by that. Fortunately, they rebounded so fast. I got the chicken salad sandwich and slice of pumpkin bread and I was in heaven! The whole cafe is adorable and such a cozy place to be. They have so many good bakery treats and a diverse menu that I&#39;m sure you&#39;d find something wonderful to eat.

All of that being said, the french dip sandwich that I had really wasn&#39;t that great. The restaurant&#39;s got a very &#34;hipster&#34; feel. You drink out of mason jars and eat on cutting boards.

I live around the corner and eat here all the time. Recently, there have been a couple of situations that literally, don&#39;t make sense to me.First of all, do not order soup as your entree at this place. Especially not to go. I ordered soup to go, which was 8 dollars, and received my small container of soup without bread. I asked if it came with bread and the manager said that it did not, that that is just something they have never done. I asked if it was possible to get some bread with my soup. He asked me if I wanted multigrain toast or a crostini. I said crostini, and he then asked me for $2.21. I literally thought he was joking. What kind of place charges 8 dollars for a bowl of soup and doesn&#39;t give you bread, crackers OR a spoon??? Offensive. I told him not to worry about it but that they should consider serving bread with their soup, LIKE EVERY OTHER RESTAURANT IN AMERICA, and he says, &#34;Ok, thanks, have a good day!&#34;Another time I ordered their most recent sandwich special, the avocado grilled cheese with tomatillo jam. It arrived, sans tomatillo jam. I asked one of the employees if I could have it on the side since it was missing on my sandwich. The same manager as the first incident came over and says, &#34;Oh, we ran out of tomatillo jam 45 minutes ago!&#34; I said, &#34;Ok, but it kind of makes the sandwich. What you gave me is just a few slices of avocado and 2 pieces of mild cheese? I&#39;m pretty sure the reason the sandwich is interesting is because of the jam.&#34; and he said &#34;Yes, it&#39;s too bad.&#34; Clearly sensing I found this offensive, I HAD TO ASK if I could get something else instead. He asked me what I wanted and then replaced it. He apologized only when he brought the other sandwich, and very quickly. Another patron at a different table leaned over and goes &#34;That guy is an asshole.&#34;You can eat here, because the food is great, but GOD FORBID you have a problem or ask for anything additional or you will be made to feel like you are SO demanding. For a place with such high prices, you expect a little customer service. Not sure what&#39;s going on here but I hope this changes because this place was a great neighborhood addition."

They figured out the perfect mix of deessing, greens and other goodies. I liked it so much at lunch I actually ordered 2 to go. One for me and one for a friend who I knew would love it. Who craves salads?? I do now. Call me crazy but I actually crave that salad...so fresh and so delicious.I love that you can do a half salad with had soup or hard sandwich combo. The grilled cheese sandwich is super awesome and the perfect 1/2 with a salad.I brought my kids one day for lunch and they cleaned their plates. I have to mention the giant piece of carrot cake we saw being delivered to a table. Omg. It was as bug as my head and was ONE serving.

Reminds a homesick country girl of home!The decor is rustic, typically with folk music playing. You grab your own silverware, cups, and water there, not much unlike Native Foods.I ordered the Grown-up Grilled Cheese and a side Citrus and Kale salad. The kale salad was crafted with love, the dressing perfectly complimenting the fresh fruits and vegetables. Produce is key at Blue Door - they take pride in many of their locally produced and delivered fruits and vegetables. In the salad alone, you can taste the quality.My sandwich blew my mind. Who would have though brushing the bread with rosemary honey would be so delicious? It was a sweet and salty combination to die for, a sandwich I&#39;d honestly kill to replicate.So if you&#39;re a homesick country girl like me looking to get some local grub, come to this hidden little restaurant with a little blue door. Bask in the farm pictures. Listen to the folk music. Order the grilled cheese and bask in that country glory."

It comes with a side of potato salad, which is great, but the portion is pathetic. It basically comes in a one oz. shot glass. It&#39;s so good, so serve it in a bigger bowl or something!I also got the sweet potato hummus, which comes with carrots and sweet crackers. I will definitely get it again - cheap ($7) and quality!They also sell various kitchen accessories, like cheese and cutting boards, utensils, books, etc. Another perk to this cute place is the staff.

I expect any restaurant to do a crowd at lunch, and this was no exception. However, we stood in line for upwards of 20 minutes before ordering. Be prepared to wait. They move at a snail&#39;s pace in everything they do. We also waited what seemed an unusually long time for the food to come. Do realize that some of this place (not all) is a communal seating concept, so if they are busy, you will very possibly end up sitting with strangers. We had some personal stuff to discuss over lunch, and had we known this, would have certainly opted for a different spot this time.That being said, they have some really healthy offerings and the food was pretty good. I&#39;d give the food 4 stars overall, so without all of the waiting, the review would get the same.

BF wasn&#39;t impressed with his food either and I felt bad for choosing this place for a lunch date.Also, I ordered their housemade juice and was given an expired one.

The employees are very friendly and helpful. The food is great and fairly priced--large portions, fresh and great presentation. I had soup and petit salad, my friend had a sandwich. It was the best sandwich he&#39;d had.There are 2 issues I can point out.A minor one--the menu boards are on three walls. The food board is behind the counter, the drink board is closer to the entrance on the opposite wall, the soup board is at the end of the counter on a different wall.The more annoying issue is you leave smelling like smoked bacon and the grill. They need a better exhaust system. I&#39;ve experienced this at other cafes in Chicago. I certainly would take the food to go  if I needed to return to work or be somewhere important after the meal. I still smelled it in my jacket and hair late that night."

Things were pretty busy, but we don&#39;t mind waiting in line to order, and know eventually we&#39;ll make it to the food. . . except when we finally get to order, the cashier tells us it will be about 30 - 40 minutes to get out food out.  But, we really wanted to try this place, so we get some banana bread (so good) to snack on while we wait.After awhile, we start to notice that although food is coming out of the kitchen, no one around us is getting their orders; things in the kitchen must have been seriously backed up.  Then, oddly, one of the bussers tries to take our silverware and napkins, even though we are clearly still waiting for food (we have the little cafe number right in front of us).  After I tried to stop him, he gave me back my knife and fork, but since he had grabbed them by the tops instead of the handles I would really rather he had just taken them - I&#39;m not going to eat with that fork now.Anyway, eventually (I think the wait actually ended up being more like 45 minutes) we got our sandwiches, and they were pretty good.  And I have to say I really enjoyed the Red Bell Pepper juice.  But, not quite enough to make me wait that long again.  Maybe I&#39;ll come back at a less busy time of day."

The place was so cute with this rustic farm vintage feel.My fiancé and I ordered the grown up grilled cheese, cauliflower soup, the Brussels and kale salad, and the kale and artichoke dip. The grown up grilled cheese was the best grilled cheese I&#39;ve ever had. It wasn&#39;t too heavy on the cheese and it was sweet which I thought would be weird but was amazing!! The cauliflower soup wasn&#39;t overly salty like some soups can be and it had a ton of flavor. The salad was good but didn&#39;t blow my mind- the dressing was what made it really good. Places like these can be hit or miss i.e. the atmosphere is great but the food is bad or vice versa, but this place really had good food.We spoke to the manager Chauncey (sp?) on the way out and learned that they had opened Feb of 2014 and that they always change their menus with the season and the food. We will definitely be back!Tip: for the mothers and fathers out there, they have a koala kare changing station in the bathroom and have high chairs as well!"

They also have a cute retail section where you can buy special jams, sauces, cute plates, etc. I stopped in for lunch, so I had the turkey and cheddar sandwich and it was sadly pretty underwhelming. The highlight of the sandwich was the apple and bell pepper preserves (which was fantastic). Outside of the preserve, it was a standard, run of the mill turkey sandwich. Also, the kitchen also lost my order so I had to wait at least 5 minutes for my food after my friend got hers. However, my friend ordered the chicken salad sandwich and hers was fantastic! Full of flavor and a surprise of dried cherries. I had a bite of hers and I&#39;ll go back just to order my own!  I think they are still working out some of the service kinks, but I look forward to stopping in again."

The prices are pretty high for the quality. Grilled sandwiches are way too crunchy for my liking and juices were not as tasty and refreshing as I thought they would be (and crazy expensive!) Was a little disappointed they charged me for a full salad and full sandwich when I specifically asked for half sandwich and small salad. Since I didn&#39;t realize the mistake until the food came out, I decided not to make waves (I was with other people including two children) and just kept it.  Wasn&#39;t offered an apology and was instead handed a to-go box for the extra food I was bound to have after my meal...

Decorated like something from down south with a bit of class. I had a number 3 green juice, really good and oh so fresh. I also had the gouda and shaved ham sandwich, in place of the original Brie and ham, to be honest I wasn&#39;t too fond of it, mainly because of the Dijon mustard that I was told was actually a fruit jam, but I guess she just confused it with the old sandwich. My friends were highly satisfied with their meals. I&#39;m going back to try something else, somebody that likes Dijon would have probably really liked the sandwich.

Granted it was a holiday, so we knew it would be crowded, however, the service was so poor that it affected my rating. We arrived around 12:30, and the line was all the way back to the door. Why? 1 person at the register. We then waited for a seat, not because there weren&#39;t seats open, but all the seats that were open had dirty plates and cups on it because no one was cleaning them up. Eventually we just took a spot and after 15 minutes they cleared the space. Gross. Finally, after 25 minutes of waiting for a tuna sandwich and turkey sandwich, my husband&#39;s was delivered. 10 minutes later, after he had finished his, my meal showed up. No apologies, just thrown on the table. The food was good, but nothing to get excited about after waiting so long. I won&#39;t be returning, unless maybe its like 3pm on a week day when even the worst service should be able to handle the off-hour."

SpauldingWhere else can you find commissioned pieces of art**, delicious breakfast potatoes, and the world&#39;s best banana smoothie?  If it&#39;s somewhere other than Janik&#39;s Cafe then I&#39;d really like to know.On the heels of a couple very unpleasant breakfast experiences, I was more than a wee bit hesitant to try this Ukrainian Village hangout.  But Anna T made a handful of claims that this spot was the bombdiggity, and after eating here on 3/19/16 I&#39;m inclined to agree with her.Once we got seated at the only unoccupied table, a waiter came by and I immediately decided on the banana yogurt smoothie.  HOLY LORD was it good.  Fresh, fruity, and fantastically filling.  Sitting there and gradually sipping away at it (I didn&#39;t want the goodness to end!), I felt that it was the tastiest smoothie I&#39;ve ever had.  Sitting here and typing this all out, that still holds true.  Best.  Smoothie.  Ever.  #nobullIn no time at all the food arrived and I feverishly ate my order.  The ham &amp; cheese omelette wasn&#39;t much different than one I&#39;d make at home, but it had plenty of meat, so that&#39;s something.  It came with toast and breakfast potatoes that were masterfully seasoned and almost didn&#39;t need hot sauce.  Almost.  But with so many choices of stuff in the condiment caddy--2 types of salsa picante (green &amp; red), 2 types of ketchup (regular &amp; spicy), along with butter, sugar, and an assortment of jelly--it seemed rude *not* to use them.  Major kudos for the variety.If I&#39;m eating before 11am, it&#39;s going to include bacon.  So I was a little taken aback when my side order of bacon came out all meager-looking.  But then I realized I&#39;d asked for &#39;extra crispy&#39; (contents may shrink by 80% during cooking), and they delivered just that.  Anna T&#39;s Belgian waffle was superb, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to order that on a future excursion.Bread = 4.5Circuses = 5**You&#39;re probably wondering why I leadoff this review with a Marx-ist quote (Groucho, not Karl).  I was inspired by a piece of art hanging on Janik&#39;s wall of the 2nd-most well known Marx brother, Harpo (the mute one with the top hat and curly hair, always doing sightgags).There were landscapes, surreal paintings of eyeballs, other random stuff, but a portrait of Harpo Marx instantly caught my attention.  I said to myself....&#34;I absolutely have to have this.  This is going in my apartment.&#34;  Our waiter gave me the guy&#39;s business card, and a few hours later the artist and I negotiated a price (his name is Brett Whitacre, for those that are interested).  As of this writing, I now have a 1-of-a-kind piece of painted glass pop art proudly displayed in my entryway!   :)BIG thanks to Janik&#39;s Cafe for a wonderful breakfast (especially the smoothie and potatoes), Anna T for the outstanding suggestion, and Brett W for being a gifted artist in his own right.  Don&#39;t worry my man, your work went to a good, appreciative home.  I figure since I started this one off with a Marx brothers quote, I might as well end it with one:&#34;I could dance with you &#39;til the cows come home. On second thought, I&#39;d rather dance with the cows &#39;til you came home!&#34;  --Rufus T. Firefly"

But the space is not functional and or comfortable. Customers picking up orders are awkwardly standing over dine-in patrons and wait staff are always bumping into each other and avoiding accidents.But because I am sleezy Chicago foodie that has a weakness for restaurants that allow you to have sausage and eggs with your waffles....I keep going back. Like 3 times a month actually. The Cheese grits are undefeated.What&#39;s an hour of bumping elbows with strangers when the food is good right?

That would be the least of your concerns at Janik&#39;s, your typical community cafe with the unpretentious breakfast and lunch entrees. Grab any available table, seat yourselves, and order.With five famished adults and a ridiculously inexpensive menu, we recklessly pointed our fingers across the menu like children, &#34;I want that...and that...and this...and that!&#34;1) My corned beef sandwich was served on rye with lettuce, tomatoes, pickle, mustard, and Swiss. For less than $6, my sandwich was packed with generous slices of corned beef. To complete the meal, I also had a small side of standard potato salad.2) For $2, you can have a plump piece of french toast served with powdered sugar and condensed milk. This can easily be shared between two people, especially if you want to have enough capacity for other items.3) A good portion of the menu is composed of Mexican-inspired items. Our chicken tostada had two sunny side up eggs with a pile of shredded meat, lettuce, tomatoes, rice, and sour cream. It was served slightly warm but the flavors were standard.4) I like how a lot of breakfast items can be easily turned into a dessert. The pancakes with nutella and bananas are a perfect example. This platter had three thick pieces of pancakes that were crispy on the edges and fluffy in the center. In between each pancake was a generous spread of nutella and the whole stack was decorated with banana slices.Overall, I think Janik&#39;s was well worth the visit. We ordered over 10 items in total and it didn&#39;t even damage our wallets. If you want to keep it simple, Janik&#39;s is the place to go."

They had both outdoor and indoor seating available. The staff was extremely nice and the place was clean. The food was amazing. My hubby had the chilaquiles w/ chorizo. I had the breakfast bowl w/ turkey sausage and a side of French toast. The food was amazing. The portion size was more than enough. My only recommendation: I wish they had half orders of their speciality pancakes. Other than that, I would definitely come back."

They have plenty of items on their menu. I really prefer their soups!// chicken lime tortilla soup - $5 - very filling and limey! Great for a morning after drinking.

The manager/owner by the name of Felipa is one of the rudest person we have dealt with. She did not let us speak and explain the issue. She said she was not going to sit there and go through what happened. Excuse me? How would you not want to go through an issue with a paying customer. Just plain ignorant. Now let me me explain what happened to yelpers because I am sure they would like to know...I placed an order through yelp for pickup. My order stated it was going to be ready at 11:51am. My husband gets to the restaurant on time and asked for the order. They said hold on and some time passed and no one brought up the order. There was a line of people (one paying with multiple credit cards) and they told him to wait until they finished ringing up other people&#39;s order (my order was prepaid via yelp). He finally gets my food and places it inside a hot bag. He gets home and I have a  missing item and the food is cool. Obviously it was sitting there for a while. And since they were to busy charging other people they let my food get cold. I contact yelp and they refund my missing item. They call the resturant and spoke to Felipa. She told them the food was cold because we picked it up late. What a total lie!. My husband calls her and she gets an attitude and says &#34;I am not going through what happen&#34; do you want a credit or refund&#34; RUDE!  Now why would I want a credit? I will never buy from here again. Over a million places to choose from in Chicago..Keep your credit..give me my refund!FYI...Food sucked!

For starters, they make an *excellent* Bloody Mary- it also appears that your server is the one who makes the drinks (sometimes it can lead to a wait because they have tables to take care of, but this is totally excuse-able), so you don&#39;t get the exact same one every time but I found the variety fun, and have not had a bad one yet. The food is extremely good. I&#39;ve worked my way through most of the menu, and you can&#39;t order anything sub par.Just be aware, they are very good and very popular, if you get there at peak brunch time it will be crowded. The wait is never terrible, though. The only reason I took a star off is that it can be frustrating to get your check sometimes if you&#39;re sitting outside. Not really that big a deal, you can always go find your server if you&#39;re in a hurry. Also, they have El Yucateco as their standard hot sauce, which makes any omelette extra delicious. Have brunch here, trust me."

I&#39;m a Chef and don&#39;t eat out much but when I do I am VERY critical. So this review is well deserved. I had the day off and while cleaning and doing laundry I got hungry. I was craving Lox and Bagels. I am originally from NY but had my first Lox and Bagel about a month ago in Chicago. I know it&#39;s not the best option to order from a cafe, especially take out but I was prepared to not be overly wowed. I ordered delivery on one of the coldest days in Chicago and my order arrived more than 30 minutes before the estimated delivery time.First off, everything was packed Really REALLY well. Everything was separated, hot separated from cold, etc. My bagel was wrapped separately, I got a container of cream cheese and then a platter that was packed and air wrapped really well with Lox, capers, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, mixed greens, and feta. The spread was fresh, veggies were crisp and I loved the addition of feta crumbles. I really enjoyed Janik&#39;s Lox and Bagel platter...really good. The only thing is..I wish the Lox was sliced thinner...but it might just be my preference.I also ordered a side of breakfast potatoes and a slice of french toast with mixed berries to make my minimum. Now I got the potatoes because I read good reviews and they did not disappoint, great flavor. I am NOT a pancake or french toast fan at all but I thought I&#39;d get something savory so I got a slice. First off, the mixed berry compote didn&#39;t come from a can which I thought it would be. It was perfectly balanced with sweet and tart and was not overwhelmingly sweet at all. I french toast was delicious! I literally ate the whole piece right away.. usually that&#39;s not be at all.I am so satisfied that I think an omelet or Benedict is in order for next week from Janik&#39;s. They&#39;re whole menu looks amazing and it&#39;s totally affordable. Great job Janik&#39;s!"

This is a decision I absolutely do not regret (even if we did try milk &amp; honey first, which had a 40-minute wait). We walked into the cafe and were immediately greeted and seated. The place was happily bustling with people, but they still found a place for us. I abhor waiting, so Janik&#39;s immediately left a good impression on me.The menu is filled with a lot of really delicious options, so it was hard to choose. I knew I could not ignore the banana Nutella pancakes, so I gave into fate and ordered them! The wait was pretty short, so again, I was a happy camper. My banana Nutella crepes were really delicious. There were three substantially-sized pancakes with a healthy topping of bananas and Nutella with powdered sugar on too. The part that impressed me the most is that there was a spread of Nutella and banana slices between each later. I had leftovers (yay for big portions!).The only thing keeping me back from five stars is that service wasn&#39;t particularly attentive and my water was empty for the majority of the meal. I&#39;m forgiving, of course, because I know it was busy. Perhaps they were able to bring the food out so quickly because servers weren&#39;t filling waters and making small talk.We noted that they also have milkshakes and fresh-squeezed juices. These definitely will be on our to-try list for the next time we&#39;re here! What a wonderful local cafe to have so close to the boyfriend&#39;s apartment and prices are very reasonable for what you get.

Luckily we only had to wait about 5 minutes and we were able to score an outdoor table. Side note: this area is perfect for people watching :)Service and price point are great, but food is pretty mediocre. I ordered the French Toast. Tasted like I could have made it from one of those frozen food packages. The eggs were also really bland. Although I wasn&#39;t impressed you did get eggs, French toast, sausage and bacon...all for $8.95. Not too shabby on the wallet. However it left me craving good French toast I&#39;m use at other places. This is where quality over quantity comes into play. I probably won&#39;t be coming back here.

We were seated right away because someone was just leaving as we arrived. This seems like the kind of place where you don&#39;t linger too much with conversation. You order quickly, they being the food out pretty quickly, and they bring you the check quickly. This had it&#39;s positives and negatives. I enjoy sitting and savoring my food, maybe enjoying some conversation after I&#39;ve finished eating. Here, I felt a little bit rushed to get or of there and free up a table. That&#39;s really the only thing keeping this from five stars. It wasn&#39;t fast food quality, though. Not at all!My girlfriend went with the Nutella pancakes, which I enjoyed sampling. I was  perfectly pleased with my substantially portioned skillet, though. The hash browns were perfectly browned and there was a good amount of cheese without being overwhelming. I didn&#39;t notice there were fresh juices on the menu until right before we left. I would definitely try that the next time I come here.Janik&#39;s has great prices for what you get, especially for the city. It&#39;s a solid brunch option in Wicker Park especially.

The pancakes were fluffy enough, but I tend to like mine a little sweeter (so I don&#39;t have to smother it in maple syrup), and the bacon and sausages were both very small portions, and basically what I could have gotten from a grocery store. Same with the eggs.It&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t enjoy it, but it&#39;s definitely not a food I would crave."

The Florentine came with a generous portion of potatoes, and was fairly good for the price point, although the spinach was on the soggy side. I was definitely pleased with the $5 Bloody Mary.The staff was very attentive. My only qualm would be that I was given the check shortly after my meal arrived, which I felt signaled unnecessary urgency to finish since the place wasn&#39;t full.Overall decent quality for good prices."

We called at like 10:30 to see what the wait might be - they said they had open tables but was first come first serve. We finally got there around 11:30 and got a table no problem. It was full but the tables turn over quickly. I&#39;m a neighabor but relatively new to the hood and had not yet tried Janik&#39;s cafe. This place has a huge menu - so it&#39;s great to accommodate a lot of different eaters. It can be your local diner with a layer of hangover grease if you so wish or it can be perfect for the vegetarian in your life with all the fresh breakfast &amp; lunch items listed.I had the breakfast quesadilla - I don&#39;t usually order this at places but I was of the &#34;diet starts monday&#34; mindset. It was fantastic! Huge portion that I couldn&#39;t finish. We shared two chocolate chip pancakes. perfectly fluffy and amazing. My boyfriend had the huevos rancheos which he loved and devoured.It took everything in my power to not insist we go back the next morning!! But I will be back... probably next weekend!

Nothing on the menu disappoints. My bf and I have been coming here forever. We have moved out of the neighborhood and have started to try other breakfast places but they just never satisfy as much as Janik&#39;s. We always come back for some awesome pancakes, which are my favorite. My bf loves the eggs Benedict. Breakfast bowls are great. Serving sizes are either just right or you will have plenty of leftovers to take home.Sometimes crowded, but you can usually get a table pretty quickly. Artwork on the walls is for sale. Prices are very inexpensive. Owner is super nice and always walking around to make sure everyone is doing ok.Love this place!"

I&#39;ve never been a fan of pasta salads before, but this really was delicious. It wasn&#39;t overly creamy, and the perfect amount of light.The buffalo chicken wrap was equally great. The tomato wrap that it came in was great. I wasn&#39;t skimped on the chicken and the buffalo sauce was good.We sat on the outdoor patio. It was a gorgeous day so we had that going for us. It&#39;s always nice to be able to watch the traffic on Division as you eat. I always appreciate a place that has outdoor seating.Service was prompt and polite.

I very politely went to the front and told the waitress I would be happy to sit in the least desirable seat by the door, since I was by myself and it was cold out and I could see people shuffling away from that section. I like to make it easy on servers - especially breakfast servers. I&#39;m pretty sure they forgot about me, and proceeded to waited on the other tables as more people came in after me.  I watched as the staff stood around as if they were lost and clueless. After about 10 mins I waved a staff member down. I asked if they had forgotten about me since I hadn&#39;t placed and order yet. He looked blankly at me, said nothing, walked away and got a server. When the server came over he just said, &#34;you ready to order?&#34;  I&#39;m pretty easy to please, but he really didn&#39;t acknowledge me.  Ordered the sausage bowl and was surprised how fast it came out. Bowl was good, what I expected. I never question tipping, but here, this time, I see no reason why I should."

We were greeted immediately and menus brought out.  We sat outside on the patio and there were some tables filled but they definitely weren&#39;t slammed. Reviews from Yelp enticed us to stop in and try the suggested items: French toast, tortilla soup, &amp; shakes. The issue is just that...they looked good on paper. A server walked passed us 4 times, not once acknowledging us; no water, drinks, nothing! We just sat there waiting for 10 minutes, feeling ignored. We looked inside and saw 5 staff members sitting down eating/drinking. I worked in the service industry for years; yes, everyone needs to eat and take a break on shift. However, you shouldn&#39;t have most of your staff on break at the same time while customers are waiting to be served. This poor service will unfortunately delay us from trying Janik&#39;s for a while longer. We&#39;ve lived in the neighborhood for 3 years now and we&#39;re always looking for new places to check out.

He absolutely hates avocado and even though he hesitated I told him to just call and tell them they mixed it up.

The Janik potatoes were good! I also ordered their cobb salad which was also okay. Decent food. I have no complaints. My husband ordered their french toasts and two eggs with meat.

With all the bad weather in Chicago and the holidays, I ran out of all my staple groceries to make breakfast. We finally broke down and decided to order breakfast delivery. I used Yelp to find Janik&#39;s and was excited to see the high ratings. We used the online ordering system offered by Yelp. I will have to give kudos to the system as it is very easy to use.My husband ordered a bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and I ordered a steak and cheese omelet with mushrooms. Since we were under the 15 dollar limit, I also ordered the cheesy hash browns.Aaaaaand here&#39;s where the low ratings come in. When we got ready to eat our food, there was no bacon in my husband&#39;s BACON, egg, and cheese sandwich. Then, my pet peeve. The hash browns were NOT hash browns but rather breakfast potatoes (which I personally am not fond). To top it off, there was NO cheese... sigh. Oh I also forgot to mention that they had a strange after taste which led me to believe that the oil they used was quite old. I also would not have ordered the potatoes if the description of the omelet stated the inclusion of potatoes.The positives were the delivery service and the omelet. The delivery was on time and the guy was very nice. The omelet was standard.Moral of the story: do groceries proactively."

My boyfriend enjoyed his meal, but they forgot his side of berries and his side of hash browns. The waitress brought the hash browns, but forgot the berries.The customer service here is lacking. I wanted to get hot sauce for my food, but I couldn&#39;t find the waitress, so I got up and grabbed it myself.

Maybe it was both....But as the old saying goes - never judge a book (in this case, fucking amazing brunch place) by its cover!!!!!!Err mah gerd!! It was a chilly Sunday morning and their patio was packed, we opted to sit inside. Big space, cool art and hipstery Chicago feel. Also packed.Get the menu... Options for days!! I can not even effectively sum up the menu.In short, I went with the breakfast quesadilla and cheese grits. I ate every last bite.

The food was great and the service was average.This final visit:FIRST, I had ordered a salad. Upon arrival, the salad had 20-30 rotten prices of lettuce on the plate. I could deal with a bad piece or two, but the kitchen staff knew this and continued to serve it to me. That is unacceptable.NEXT, after removing the rotten food, I noticed there was A HAIR in my salad. Attention to detail at this restaurant is spectacular.AFTER THAT, we had zero follow up from our server or acting manager. It became clear later that there isn&#39;t an actually manager on duty.I was not looking to get any of the bill comped in any way. None was even offered.This sort of action would never take place while I was running a shift at my restaurant.While I was finishing my meal, our very own waiter began closing our outdoor seating section. The section was well covered until that point. I then ate the rest of the meal in the blazing sun.CUSTOMER SERVICE:I then asked to speak with a manager about why our experience was so poor. This was the first time I saw the &#34;manager&#34; the entire time. She did the absolute minimum to resolve the issue. All I received was a blank stare and a meager &#34;sorry&#34;.It seemed like, for now $10/hr., that was the acceptable level of customer service for them.Shocking.With over 30 other well-established restaurants on division st, we will have no problem not returning to Janik&#39;s Cafe.Janik&#39;s Cafe has just lost my business.(Those are the last words a business needs to hear in this economy)BUYER BEWARE!"

We got a great big booth on the back wall facing the entire restaurant and bar - great for people watching! (My guy almost lost his cool when Denzel Valentine walked in, lol)Everything we ordered, from the oysters and carpaccio for starters, to the filet and lobster tail for dinner, to the mushrooms and broccolini to accompany, it was all just to die for. The lobster tail specifically was some of the best lobster I have ever had. Even compared to that of places I&#39;ve been in the Northeast. Drizzled in this miso butter sauce, I could&#39;ve eaten literally like 3 more tails - if they weren&#39;t like $40 a pop that is. But oh my god was it worth it. SO delicious.After dinner they come out with a huge plate of pink cotton candy which we loved. We also got a dessert which was so-so, I&#39;d recommend just sticking with the cotton candy. Unless you&#39;re really craving chocolate, it&#39;s perfect to help curb that sweet tooth I always get at the end of a meal.Service, as expected, was perfect. The minute your plate is empty, someone is there to pick it up for you. Silverware is changed frequently, and your drinks are never empty. Staff is very knowledgeable and does a great job assisting you in ordering.The place has kind of a speakeasy vibe, lots of rich woods, leather, great lighting. The Windows on to the street are completely covered in beautiful curtains which really transports you into the moment.Overall I would highly recommend RPM Steak for anyone looking to celebrate, or even just looking to treat yourself. It&#39;s a nice change of pace from other Chicago steak houses like Morton&#39;s or Gibson&#39;s."

I decided to throw a party for my boyfriend&#39;s birthday at RPM Steak after drooling over these photos. We had a room on the 2nd floor looking over the main dining room. It was a great set up because we still had the ambiance of a restaurant. Nothing has really wow&#39;d me about the food... But to be honest, you can&#39;t appreciate food when you&#39;re distracted; therefore, we would love to go back and try it between just the two of us.Our servers were attentive and super sweet. They helped me with our spontaneous change to an after party too.Big shoutout to the coordinators who helped me plan this dinner. I was all over the place... unsure what I was really planning.

I was still skeptical, but the boy and I finally had a big celebration planned and I caved. I couldn&#39;t be more pleased we went back. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t order any of the same things, so I can&#39;t tell if the food has gotten substantially better or if I just ordered well this time. But here&#39;s how to do it right, apparently:We started off with the beef carpaccio. I was nervous. The last time I had carpaccio (at another establishment), it made me sick almost immediately and the texture was awful. Not so this time. This had a great almost salami-like flavor (with more beef undertones, obviously) with a delicious salad inside and great aioli on top. It was fantastic.For dinner, I went with the steak frites, upgrading the frites to a millionaire&#39;s potato and a shared side of Brussel sprouts. I don&#39;t even like sprouts and I loved the curry Brussel sprouts. They were like the world&#39;s healthiest curry potato chip. Delicious! The béarnaise sauce on the steak was fantastic, and the steak itself was fine. The millionaire&#39;s potato was a bit of a letdown - I didn&#39;t think the truffles on top added as much flavor as if they had been worked in, and I wanted a bit more flavor (garlic? Scallions? Basically anything).On the beverage side, I went with an autumn sour and it was delightful. Sweet and a little tangy, I could have kept drinking those all night. Our server (a Mr. Dritan according to me receipt) was a delight - very attentive and funny. It&#39;s definitely a special occasion sort of place, but I&#39;ll happily put this one back in my rotation. The menu definitely isn&#39;t bulletproof, but we had a decidedly good experience."

I think this is the best steakhouse I&#39;ve ever been to.We ordered the parker house rolls which are a must- especially because I don&#39;t think this restaurant has a complimentary bread basket so it is a good starter to get! The bread is extremely fresh and the rosemary butter it comes with is the perfect compliment to the sweet,buttery rolls.We got filets as our entree and the steak was extremely tender and perfectly cooked!For sides, we ordered the millionaire&#39;s potato is a must (it looked funny in pictures so we were a bit hesitant at first but it is absolutely the best potato dish I&#39;ve ever had - basically smooth mashed potatoes in a crispy potato skin topped with cheese and truffle shaving. We also got the trumpet mushrooms which were extremely good as well.To end our night we got the chocolate cake which was super chocolatey and definitely satisfied our sweet tooth!All the portions here were big (even the chocolate cake) and the service was excellent! our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly!"

Yes, copious amounts of corn fed cattle farmed and raised in the mid west. RPM was one of three steakhouses I attended while visiting the windy city. Also, I&#39;d like to add that I rarely eat red meat so at the end of this trip I wanted to die. Ha.Anyway...RPM is a swanky steakhouse that differs from many others in a &#34;traditional&#34; sense. Not that it&#39;s a bad thing, just expect a different experience when dining here. I was impressed with the level of service and management definitely knows what they are doing.We started with the popovers and the burrata/heirloom tomato salad. Both were pleasant, light and great options before the main course. I opted for the 12oz. filet (bone out) because, it&#39;s just an easy cut of meat. I went with the &#34;Allen Brothers&#34; prime, which is a local beef and boy was it great! Cooked to perfection and one of the better pieces of beef I&#39;ve ever had. Seriously, really good. To accompany this hefty helping of beef, we had the shaved black truffle twice baked potato. Holy mackerel was it rich :)All in all, a successful dining experience and I&#39;d go back in a heartbeat. Stay tuned for the next Chicago steakhouse review."

(Side note, we have had this reservation for 6+ months and were really excited) We were told as we entered that we would be seated closer to our reservation time, which we understood and had no issue with. 20 min later, we were still not seated and had yet to receive an update. My boyfriend and I truly felt we were being judged by our younger appearance to be honest. We received no sorry or even update. We began to count the couples / parties that were seated ahead of our party of two. In the end 9 parties (two being parties of 2) were seated ahead of us. Some being 7:45 reservations. Although we were excited to celebrate our big anniversary there, we began to browse to see if any other places around us had open reservation times because we were so frustrated. Sure enough, at 22 min past our reservation time (and 3 potential other restaurants chosen) we were told it was time for us to sit. This did not sit well over with my boyfriend who sits here next to me, still frustrated and pouting to my right, over the situation.Moving on, we walk to our table and see Giuliana &amp; Bill sitting in the corner table. I won&#39;t spend much time on this cause everyone knows how perfect and amazing they are.Anyways, let&#39;s start with the decor. The dim lighting and the half oval cushion booths along every wall are the most elegant design that created the perfect romantic setting. As the booths align each wall, more tables fill the center. My boyfriend and I were lucky enough to get one of the large booths that allowed us to have a gorgeous view of the entire restaurant.The staff: Although we had a very sour start, our waiter David was one of a kind. SO attention detailed, intelligent, attentive and kind, he turned our night around instantly. Constantly getting to know us and make sure we had a great anniversary, this detail was very much appreciated and noted. Thank you David for making our night so special!Now the food- the best part .The appetizers: We started with the Parker dinner rolls, the hamachi and the wedge salad. The Parker dinner rolls were soft and delicious, but in all honestly weren&#39;t any different than the dinner rolls you can buy frozen at Costco. They are a great thing that&#39;s easy to start with to nosh on, but not bursting with flavor. The hamachi however was elegantly presented and loaded with both spicy and clean/fresh flavors. The dish was very small but incredible. Finally the wedge. What comes across as a very simple and boring salad can easily be a disaster, but this one was incredible! The wedge was dressed with square chunks of blue cheese that were delicious, large tomatoes, and thick square cuts of bacon. Yum! With our appetizers, I ordered one of the best dirty martinis with blue cheese olives I&#39;ve ever encountered in Chicago, and my boyfriend had an old fashioned. What rpm steak constantly presented was the attention to detail in every item. The ice cube in the old fashion was even branded with RPM on it and the drink itself was flavorful and smooth.The entree: I originally was going to play it safe and order the 8 oz filet, but David (our amazing waiter) suggested the lamb chops and WOW was he right. They were so delicious. Crispy yet tender at the same time. I had separation anxiety letting my bones being taken after licking them clean. I needed more of that amazing flavor!! My boyfriend got The Duke and loved his as well. It was like cutting soft butter! With our steaks, we ordered the Hen of the Woods mushrooms. Like the Parker House Rolls, they were not the best thing honestly, but a nice side to add to my dinner. Personally I don&#39;t know if I would get those again. They just didn&#39;t have that much flavor or pizzazz like everything else I encountered before in the meal.Finally: the dessert. After watching countless tables get the baked Alaska, we figured we should join in on the fun too. The presentation did not fall short. It was gorgeous and even came with some homemade cotton candy!Overall, our anniversary dinner was extremely special and was saved by both the delicious food, the attention to detail, and the wonderful waiter David. I am still a bit salty about how our meal began, but happy the night overall ended to well."

From the food to the service to the ambience, my dining experience at RPM Steak was excellent and therefore I can&#39;t wait go back! My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our 5 year anniversary and we loved our experience from start to finish.Parking: there&#39;s valet parking available but there&#39;s also paid street parking a block away if you don&#39;t mind the walk.Location: RPM Steak is by Epic Burger, there&#39;s a ton of restaurants and bars in the area.Decor and Ambience: loved the decor, it was dimly lit inside and I loved the booths and the white loungy chairs in the dining room area. I loved that it felt romantic due to the dim lights. The ambience was great, it felt chill and loungy. I honestly thought it was gonna be uptight and too posh since this place is in downtown but it was the opposite! I saw couples, families with kids, and coworkers eating there and it felt more relaxed and chill than I had expected.Service: Service was excellent from the beginning since we walked through the doors until the end of our meal. We were greeted by smiles by the hostess and she wished us a happy anniversary. Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered our food based on his recommendations and we were so happy that he recommended the best items on the menu. He was very attentive, refilling our waters, asking us if we wanted more beer or drinks, and cleaning our table once we finished our food.Food and Drink: I ordered the Good Night and Good Luck, which had tequila, strawberry, and lemon. This was strong and it tasted yummy. We ordered the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio as an appetizer, Parker House Rolls, Roasted Summer Corn, the Millionaire&#39;s Potato, the Duke, and the Cowboy for our main dishes.The Wagyu Beef Carpaccio is raw beef wrapped with arugula and parmesan. I loved the flavors and it had a little kick with the peppercorn. We wanted more, it was so good. The Parker House Rolls were nice and warm and buttery and we loved the rosemary butter that it came with. The Roasted Summer Corn was a little spicy to me because of the peppercorn but it was great. I especially loved the Millionaire&#39;s Potato, one of the highlights of my meal. I loved the cheese and the truffle potatoes, I couldn&#39;t stop eating it!As for the steak, I got the Duke, a 10 oz ribeye filet. My boyfriend ordered the Cowboy, a 24 oz steak. The server was awesome for recommending these 2 dishes and even better for asking us if we wanted our steak to be sliced! Our steaks were perfectly cooked medium done. I wish I liked my Duke better but it was a little too salty on the edges. I do appreciate that it was perfectly cooked because my boyfriend and I ate all of it. I enjoyed my boyfriend&#39;s Cowboy Steak better and it was so juicy and cooked perfectly. We ate all of our steaks because we enjoyed it so much!As for dessert, we got complimentary cotton candy since it was our anniversary. We ordered the Baked Alaska, which was prepared at the table. This was yummy, it was like ice cream cake with a smores taste on top.Verdict: I loved the food, the service, and the ambience.

We saw a menu with food and just said yes. To everything.Parker House Rolls with rosemary Nordic butter? Yes.Thick-cut bacon with this donut-y (bourbon-vanilla) glaze? Hell yes.Alaskan king crab? Oh, yes.Miso-broiled black cod with sesame? Is it OK if I lick the plate?Bone-in KC cut? Seriously making my mouth water right now just thinking about it.Millionaire&#39;s potato? Fluffy, buttery, truffle-y goodness. Yes!Crispy hasselback? Actually, the only &#34;just OK&#34; thing we had.Donuts with whipped Nutella: sugar-y donuts were fresh and delightful, the whipped Nutella... meh.Watermelon cotton candy: the perfect ending to a meal (of this size) for two.Fantastic wine selection with tasty cocktails (the rye-based ones are delicious[ly strong])!Three bills later, we waddled outta there slightly tipsy though entirely satiated."

This was mostly due it being owned by reality tv stars. However, I will say that it exceeded my expectations. The cherry on the top was the service - extremely attentive, helpful and didn&#39;t rush our dining experience. I would say the wait staff was the best I&#39;ve experienced in the city.The decor was nice. It&#39;s a mix of old school and modern. Not my taste personally but tastefully appointed.We started with cocktails at the bar. The grapefruit mule and old fashioned were good but the standout was the good night and good luck. So good and so dangerous :)Now the important part: Dinner! The lobster in miso sauce and the steaks were really where it&#39;s at. I will say that we had to return our Kansas cut twice because it wasn&#39;t cooked properly. When they finally brought it back, it was overcooked (but I thought it was still good). We also had the rib eye prepared tournedos rossini (basically the richest thing ever). It&#39;s a divine chunk of foie gras served on your steak with a truffle demi-glace sauce. Definitely have your steak prepared this way! In addition, we also ordered the Cobb salad and tuna tar tar- definitely something to skip. Don&#39;t miss out on the calamari (best I&#39;ve ever had), the spicy broccolini and the thick bacon (O-M-G)! We paired dinner with a Chianti and a Malbec which were both fantastic recommendations.And then... The dessert! This alone gets all my stars and votes. We ordered the cotton candy (hello childhood), the cheesecake (which was quite delicate), the donuts (nothing special) and then the baked Alaskan (best I have ever had).Would I go back? Yes! If you have a special occasion or just want a great meal and kind service - make yourself a reservation!"

First, the atmosphere is very different from a traditional steakhouse. It has a contemporary design with modern music and a sort of hipster vibe coming from the waiters. They are super nice, accommodating, and knowledgeable about the food and cooking process. The portions are large enough to share so we got to try a lot of items without stuffing ourselves silly. Love it and will be back!"

This review is for carryout only, as I have yet to dine at the restaurant. I ordered the 8oz filet and roasted sweet potatoes. The filet had no fat, was cooked medium as requested, and was soft to cut through, all a plus. For whatever reason, they decided to douse the top of the filet with salt. I&#39;ve never actually seen that before, but needless to say it definitely affected the taste, not in a pleasant way. The roasted sweet potatoes also would have been tasty, but for the container being drenched in some kind of oil or liquid. The roasted sweet potatoes themselves had a nice tangy taste to them. Won&#39;t be ordering in from here but would definitely try dining in next time. Prices were relatively market rate for the area."

It is a very classy ambiance and service was amazing.Between the two of us, we got:-Parker house rolls - They don&#39;t give free bread like many other restaurants do. The parker house rolls were buttery with a nice crust.-Thick cut bacon - Good, but overplayed. The outside was sweet and crispy. Inside was tender. It tasted like there were some Asian-inspired flavors such as soy sauce, brown sugar at play.-8 oz Filet Mignon - Above average. This filet had flavor and was melt-in-your-mouth. Also cooked perfectly - medium rare like I requested.-10 oz &#34;The Duke&#34; Above average. Had all the flavor of a ribeye cut without the bone. Also cooked perfectly medium rare.-Roasted Sweet Potatoes (side) - Average. There was a bit of a kick to the roasted sweet potatos and a sprinkling of cheese on top. Would have preferred the potatoes without the cheese.-Curry Brussels Sprouts (side) - Above average. Crispy, perfectly seasoned with a spicy kick to it.We opted out of dessert, but to celebrate the birthday, they gave us free cotton candy, which was a nice touch.Definitely a good place to try out for special occasions, but it can be pricey."

However, the manager approached us to apologize for the wait and our server treated us to an appetizer and dessert! That really blew us away.For dinner we had the bone in ribeye and 14 oz strip steak- both were amazing. The Ribeye was the best I&#39;ve ever had. We also got a few sides (spinach and sweet potatoes) that were delicious. ANOTHER thing that blew me away was that, when going over the menu before ordering, our server Drew mentioned a seasonal side of squash that we should try. I forgot about it when it came time to order, but when our food came out, he brought one for us on the house anyway because &#34;you guys seemed so enthusiastic about it but then didn&#39;t order it, and I wanted you to try it.&#34; What!? Ha! That was awesome. We ended with the s&#39;mores dessert, and it is amazing also.Shoutout to Drew for being an amazing server. I really wish I caught the manager&#39;s name who was so kind to us in our wait as well- I really liked him. This was a great experience for us overall!"

The donuts were light and fluffy with delicious Boston creme sauce to drizzle on top.  And the cotton candy-- well, it was randomly awesome and brought me immediately back to my childhood."

We got there an hour early and checked in and tried to find a seat at the bar. This place was packed with people! We ordered drinks to wait for bar stools. My husband had some fancy beer and I tried the imperial spritz. My Spritz was a little bitter, but the vodka made me happy while waiting for our table.There were a lot of people waiting to be seated, in fact. At some point we moved toward the hostess table to wait for our table (about 25 minutes after our reservation). There were so many people coming up to complain to the hostess regarding their wait time, but those people irritated me more than the wait did, and when we were seated (45 min after reservation), I figured out WHY we waited so long for a table! The restaurant itself isn&#39;t very large, and there are only so many tables. With an extensive wine, beer, and liquor list, it&#39;s not surprising that you just want to sit and enjoy your meal with some drinks!Before we were seated, all the ladies at the hostess area were just incredible and polite. They were great at diffusing difficult situations with people who were irate that they weren&#39;t seated. One of the managers did have to comp a round of drinks for the very vocal complainers. There was even a round of champagne coming around to everyone waiting! Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t get a chance to grab a flute, but one of the hostesses (I unfortunately didn&#39;t get any of their names) went out of her way to grab us two!Our waiter, Scott G, was warm, inviting, and very knowledgable! He let us know the prices of the specials upfront. He didn&#39;t have to try very hard to sell us on the white truffle risotto (the managers come out to slice the truffle onto the risotto at the table!). Omg it was the most rich delicious risotto of my life!Our appetizers (comped for our long wait!) were the cheddar popovers (themselves dry, but the prosciutto butter was delicious!) and the thick bacon. Now listen, bacon lovers, this is unlike any bacon you have ever had. It had this delicious maple tasting sauce on it, and it was so tender and melted in our mouths. I only wish there were more of it!For our entrees, hubby had the Duke (10 oz ribeye) and deemed it very delicious. I had the 8 oz filet mignon with bearnaise sauce and it was also delicious - though not anything extraordinary. We split the risotto and the Parmesan spinach (also amaze balls).All in all, this is a great restaurant with long wait times (which isn&#39;t surprising, since I wish we were able to sit longer with drinks and food. But I needed to relieve the sitter...). We were too full for dessert, but everyone around us who had dessert looked like it was delicious and smelled amazing!"

After hearing many positive reviews of RPM, I decided to try the &#34;new school&#34; Chicago steakhouse. Trying to make reservations one month in advance means a 5:30pm dining time on a Saturday night. No matter, we gladly skipped lunch to save room in anticipation of our early meal. Valet is offered, but we parked in the garage next door ($21) so we could walk around the neighborhood after dinner.I won&#39;t dwell on decor or ambiance, and instead say this is a definite date or business dinner spot. While at the early hour of our visit there were some diners in khaki shorts, I recommend more refined attire to match the white linens. Ladies, please be careful in your heels! I was slipping and sliding in my stilettos and another female patron fell right beside our table in her wedges. The painted wood floor in the dining room is especially smooth. I have to give kudos to the staff for trying to immediately clean up an invisible puddle though. In fact, service was top notch at every level.Food was equally impeccable. For the first time ever, my boyfriend said he could see why people like oysters. We both enjoyed the jalapeño and sherry with the half dozen we started with. The Caesar salad was also exceptional, and I appreciated it&#39;s lack of croutons. The real winner of the meal was my man&#39;s Allen Brother&#39;s filet. It was seasoned and cooked perfectly. My halibut was similarly done well.It couldn&#39;t be a birthday without ice cream cake, right? The baked Alaska is finished tableside and drizzled with rich fudge. In case you&#39;re wondering, it&#39;s probably meant for four, but the birthday boy ate 3/4 of it himself. You only live once you know.If you&#39;re on the edge of visiting RPM Steak, I say what are you waiting for??"

Friend had his birthday here  and we got a private room. The place was packed with fancy people. Wasn&#39;t expecting a prefixed meal with 10 courses. Thought I was going to just order something simple off the menu. Felt kinda guilty eating 1/3 of the snow crab appetizers it was pretty tasty. There was only 3 pieces but don&#39;t think anyone noticed or cared. The bill end up being $2500 without tips. There was 15 of us and 9 bottles of wine and shots going around.

When we checked in we were told that our table was not ready. We waited patiently at the bar. While we waited a manager stopped over to introduce himself (Admire ) and ensure us that our table would be ready shortly and he apologized for the delay. After discovering that our daughter was hungry, he brought chips over for her to snack on which was very thoughtful. Once we finally got seated our server Steven was fantastic, already knowing we were starving he brought over bread right away. He made great suggestions for steaks . Later the manager Admire stopped over again to make sure we were taken care of which was a nice touch. My daughter said it was the best meal she ever had which was worth all the wait. Will be back again.PS. we asked for business cards for Steven and Admire and the host stand had neither."

This time the temperature of the steak was PERFECT.As for service, it was just as great as it was the first time. Sam, our server was very witty and genuinely a nice guy. He ensured our glasses of wine matched the other (even though our drinking patterns are different) which was no small task.Our ChoicesGuiliana Chopped Salad - 5/5 (amazing)Cheddar Popovers with prosciutto butter -3/528 day dry aged Kansas City Cut -4/5Bone in Ribeye  -4/5Oyster and Wild Garlic Mushrooms - 4/5Charred Cauliflower - 4/5Champagne Grapefruit Sorbet - 3/5Recommendations-If you are dining with someone else and you enjoy similar type wine, it is best to share a half bottle or bottle. It is economically better than ordering by the glass. If ordering red, it also ensures you have a newly opened bottled.- As for valet parking ($15), it seriously takes a while (more than 15 minutes) for them to bring vehicles around. I would suggest parking at a meter close by or car service.-If celebrating a special occasion, let them know. Your server will bring out flavor of the day cotton candy for the table to share.- If you are visiting on a date or romantic evening, you should request a booth or table along the wall."

We went to RPM on a Saturday night to celebrate my boyfriend&#39;s birthday. Our original reservation was at 5:30pm, but based on traffic we weren&#39;t able to get there until 6pm. We called around 5:30pm to let them know, and even though they said they could only hold the table for us for 15min, we were still able to be seated immediately once we arrived and the hostesses were very friendly. So that was a great start.The dining experience was as equally wonderful. Our server was very friendly and helpful, making suggestions on drinks and food when we asked, and even taking a GREAT group picture of our table. He served the birthday boy an AMAZING Old Fashioned (pictured), and pouring it at the table was very nice touch!Lets get down to business: THE FOOD WAS AMAZING!Started out with appetizers: the Thick Cut Bacon and Tuna Tartare (both pictured)-the bacon is SO thick its crazy. My boyfriend LOVES tartare so we will order it as an appetizer anywhere we go. It was average in comparison (we&#39;ve had better).For our main entrees, we all ordered different cuts of steak. My favorite by far was the RPM Signature Steak Frites (which keep in mind is literally $20 less than the NY Strip which was what my mom and I ordered). So tender, so juicy, so melt in your mouth-everything you want in a steak! It also came with its own special fries-I would DEFINITELY recommend ordering it.For side dishes, I would recommend all the ones we tried: Hand Cut Fries (nothing too special but good for fries), Curried Brussels Sprouts (very crunchy and flaky in a good way), Roasted Sweet Potatoes (BEWARE of the red peppers in them, they are HOT!), but the table favorite was the Millionaire&#39;s Potato!!!! (pictured) It is literally truffled potatoes served inside a potato skin as the dish with nothing other to be described as amazing-ness on top! It is FANTASTIC!!!!Lastly, my favorite part of any good meal, DESSERT! (all pictured) We ordered the Baked Alaska, a medium-sized cake to be shared, prepared table side and lit on FIRE! Who&#39;s excited!! But our amazing server also brought us the Vanilla Sugar Donuts (my new favorite) and Happy Birthday Cotton Candy on the house! What an amazing way to end an already spectacular dining experience!"

The hostess asks if you are celebrating anything and you make small talk until you settle into your seats. You open the menu to reveal options upon options of sides and steaks, desserts and drinks. Where do you start!? Well how about the smoked pork belly bacon with a nice salad? Sounds promising. Your drinks arrive and shortly after your appetizers come, the delicious combo of the bacon and salad get you ready for your meal, then it arrives...you dig into the beautifully presented plate of high quality cut meat and enjoy every last morsel of food until your belly is full and satisfied.It&#39;s simple to guess that I love this restaurant and the food is great.

They serve some of the finest risotto I&#39;ve ever tasted and the &#39;Baked Alaska&#39; for dessert is a must try. My friends were raving about the 14K cake - i can&#39;t fault it.The look of the restaurant is beautiful and I would give their service 6 stars out of 5 if I could.We were a group of 9 on Friday night with a 9:30 reservation. We arrived on time and the restaurant was packed. We were seated as soon as the first larger table was freed up. Some people are irritated by stuff like this. I don&#39;t think it is a big deal.I ordered the &#39;72oz Tomahawk Wagyu&#39; which is basically a Kobe Beef on-the bone Rib Steak - with the entire rib bone left. This was a $195 item which tasted about a 97/100. I was a little surprised by the portion (it was on the smaller side) but after dropping $$$$ on food one tends to be hyper critical.My heart tells me to give RPM steak 4 stars but my mind can&#39;t think of a good enough reason to. Let&#39;s just say that if the food was a 4/5 overall, the atmosphere and staff was a 6/5 - and therefore RPM steak gets a 5 star review."

He gave personal suggestions, offered honest feedback about how many people a portion serves (i.e. The hassleback potato easily serves 2-3), and seemed genuinely interested in making our dining experience pleasant.Drinks: We had a glass of Rosé and the &#34;Good Night and Good Luck.&#34; When we ordered, the waiter specifically told my boyfriend &#34;the cocktail is going to look like something you&#39;re not going to believe you ordered because it&#39;s so pink, but you MUST because it&#39;s one of the best on the menu and you&#39;re manly enough to handle it.&#34; Was it pink? Yes, you totally spotted it a mile away. Was it superb just like he promised? Absolutely!!!Food: The short version... PHENOMENAL. Seriously though. The Parker House Rolls (deliciously buttery and crunchy on the outside), Filet Mignon and &#34;The Duke&#34; (cooked EXACTLY how you ordered and melted in your mouth in the most delicate manner), Hassleback Potato and Jumbo Asparagus (PERFECT accents to the steak), and let&#39;s not forget the most amazing piece of 14K Chocolate Cake in the world (fudgy, rich and surprisingly huge!). Honestly, we walked out of there feeling like we probably shouldn&#39;t eat for the next week. So worth every penny.Ambiance: It&#39;s not too loud or too quiet. Plenty of couples, families and groups of friends, so you won&#39;t feel out of place no matter who you&#39;re dining with. Best of all, it&#39;s not overly dark where you feel like it&#39;s a struggle to see your food; every table has a light directly overhead that lights up your space beautifully.Definitely a great steak house experience! There wasn&#39;t a thing we would change! Can&#39;t wait to come back again."

It&#39;s definitely a more modern steakhouse with more modern dishes...but geezzzzzzzzzz everything is stellar from the service to the food to the awesome atmosphere.My friend and I started with the parmesan popover bread special for $10. Excellent option to start the meal with a warm and filling delicious cheesy carb explosion. Plus it came with prosciutto butter. Uh....yes, puhleese.The tuna tartare ($15) was good but the least memorable course of our meal. I think this is something that can be skipped but if you are looking for a protein filled app, this will get the job done.We shared a Cowboy Steak for $72 cooked medium rare and wow was it tender yet hearty. We did something blasphemous and had them pre-cut it for us but that made eating it much easier for me, plus made it easier to share. I highly appreciated that! We added the side of bernaise sauce for $3 and that was a great compliment to the beef. Oyster mushrooms ($12) were a side we went with and although tasty, I&#39;d go with another of their mushroom sides next time. They had three different options and the oysters came with a lot of greens &amp; such. I want all mushrooms, all the time.Based on everyone&#39;s recommendations, we ordered the Millionaire&#39;s Baked Potato for $18. Topped with fontina cheese and black truffle, it sure is a classy gal. I&#39;m normally not a potatoes girl but this little doozey changed my mind on that. Indulgent, rich and still great the next day.I was insistent on ordering the Macaroni &amp; Cheese ($17) even though my buddy kept questioning if I was sure. Am I sure?! Psh. I never pass up a good mac &amp; cheese on the menu. This creamy dish had bacon &amp; mushrooms thrown in - two of my favorite things! There&#39;s no way it could go wrong. Loved it and it&#39;s another leftover I loved eating the next day.Although full, we pulled through it and had the 14k Chocolate Cake ($12) for dessert. It was so rich &amp; decadent, made me feel like I was splurging on any every bite. It&#39;s a must get dessert! #TreatYoselfI can&#39;t think of a time I saw a beer list that included such rare and amazing beers. They had 6 years of BCBS as well as many other higher priced bottles that are hard to come by. I ended up having a bottle of 2010 Bourbon County Stout for $18 which was big enough &amp; strong enough to last the entirety of my dinner. I&#39;m very impressed by their current on draft list, as well as rare &#39;special&#39; beers as they call them.Just had a magnificent time at RPM Steak in every way possible. I left full beyond belief and so satisfied. Even after we left and started driving away, our server chased after the car with our leftovers! I&#39;m so forgetful and so thankful for such an awesome lady!Pro-Tip: Download the Lettuce Entertain You app so you can earn reward points."

I have visited on several different occasions. I&#39;ve have tried the Boot Steak, the 22oz Bone-In Kansas City Cut, and most recently the 16oz New York Strip. Out of these three definitely the Kansas City was my favorite. I am a pretty big fan of Dry Aged steaks. I had to look this one up but from what I&#39;ve read the Kansas City Cut is just a New York Strip with the bone. But I found it to be much more flavorful. The bone makes a difference!For sides and what not, I recommend the Giuliana&#39;s Chopped salad and their Calamari are two of my favorites. Aside from the food being absolutely delicious, the service at any RPM is always top notch.My goal is to splurge one day for the Lone Bone Ribeye ($125) or the Mishima Tomahawk ($195) just to see how it compares to a Tomahawk I&#39;ve had at Mastros back in the day. One day, one day... Make sure to book a reservation in advance! &#39;Til next time, cheers!"

The bf started off with an old fashioned, which was poured table side. He mentioned it was quite strong, just how he likes it. I had the pamplemule and it was light and refreshing, as expected.We had the popovers as an appetizer and they were light and airy, so don&#39;t worry about it being too filling. I ordered the boot steak medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. And the bf had dry-aged new york strip. I didn&#39;t hear any complaints from him. I was very impressed by their side dishes. We had the hasselback potato and the top was amazingly crispy, I loved it. We also had the oyster mushrooms &amp; wild garlic, which was also very good. They gave us a huge complimentary bowl of cotton candy with a happy birthday sign in it. I was so excited (I love cotton candy). We still ordered the baked alaska just to try it. It would have been nice if they had smaller portions so we wouldn&#39;t have had to waste half of it. The baked alaska was fun to order for the presentation, but I wasn&#39;t crazy about the flavors.In conclusion, this place is now my favorite steakhouse. I highly recommend it!"

Nice portion for 4 ppl to get a big bite. Very rich and fabulous flavor.Popovers with prosciutto butter - light and buttery and the butter has great flavor.Short ribs - huge portion! Huge flavor!

We found the servers to be polite, gentlemen and ladies. It&#39;s a great place for special occasions, birthdays, homecoming, or any other such celebration. It is a bit pricy though, so I don&#39;t think I would come here regularly, as there are other equally fantastic (some even better) steakhouses in the immediate Chicago area.That said, we had a great time!

Salad had a light, tangy dressing and I couldn&#39;t believe we enjoyed the kale as much as we did. My guys are meat &amp; potato men, so them enjoying a kale salad was a surprise. The only appetizer I wasn&#39;t in love with was the carpaccio.Now entrees.We had the special 60 day, dry age bone-in ribeye ($175). It was 40 oz and was prepared medium rare. They sliced it in the kitchen &amp; presented it on a platter. The flavor was all there. We couldn&#39;t be happier with our choice, well the brother wouldn&#39;t mind a larger portion, but that&#39;s not the point.We also had the mashed potatoes &amp; a side of mushrooms.Wonderful."

I was excited to check it out, after so many good experiences at RPM Italian. I&#39;d perused the menu prior to arriving and was already preparing for a bit of a splurge, money-wise, but I was very impressed with the quality of the food.I had steak frites and the meat was cooked well and to my liking (medium). The frites were different than what I&#39;m used to--almost as if they were julienned--which I really enjoyed.My friends got salmon, cod, and the 8 oz filet, and everyone really enjoyed their meals. We shared a few sides--the Parker House rolls (a must, they&#39;re divine, and come with a yummy duo of butters), the bleu cheesed whipped potatoes (very tasty), the roasted sweet potatoes (not a fan of this, as they&#39;re topped with a salty cheese, but everyone else loved them), and the mac and cheese (okay, but I didn&#39;t get seconds, though I&#39;m not a huge mac and cheese fan anyway). As it was my friend&#39;s birthday, we had to get dessert, and this is where things get seriously delicious: the 14K Chocolate Cake, which I&#39;d been dying to try, paired with the Baked Alaska. There are no words for how good these were, so save room!My one critique: the prices of wines by the glass are too high. I Googled a few of the reds before dinner and they sold for $9/bottle at Binny&#39;s or online. So, I couldn&#39;t validate paying $13/glass. I tried the Tuxedo cocktail, which was okay, but not exactly what I was looking for.Overall, would definitely go back--perhaps split a nice cut of meat and a side or two, splurge on dessert and a drink, and enjoy the environment."

I went with the &#34;Good Night and Good Luck,&#34; which was very refreshing.Given the waiter&#39;s suggestions, for dinner, we ordered a large filet mignon, macaroni and cheese (which had mushrooms and bacon), a variety of mushrooms, and garlic potatoes. Everything was phenomenal, but the macaroni and cheese was the best I&#39;ve ever eaten anywhere! It&#39;s different and somehow surprisingly light! If you order one thing on the menu, order the Mac and Cheese. You won&#39;t regret it!For dessert, we ordered the 14K Chocolate Cake. We were underwhelmed.

He was very attentive, but without being annoying. He was also great at helping us pick out the best things on the menu to try. I ended up trying the wagyu A5 Miyazaki, which was fabulous.  The steak basically melted in my mouth.  My dining companion had the ribeye, which was also really good.  I also highly recommend the macaroni and cheese.  It could be an entree on its own (and costs just about as much as one) and is filled with bacon and mushroom goodness.  Our waiter also totally hooked us up with dessert.  We couldn&#39;t decide between two desserts - the cheesecake and the baked Alaska - so our waiter brought them both out and gave us one on the house!  Neither dessert was particularly memorable, but the presentation for the baked Alaska is awesome.  Another Lettuce restaurant for the win."

Apparently it&#39;s packed in the evenings just like its Sister Restaurant, RPM Italian - which is my favorite restaurant in the city.This place is expensive and the menu is a little limited, as we were in a hurry we skipped the appetizers and went straight into entrees. I had the steak frites and the steak was to die for - really tender and juicy and perfectly cooked with a great sear on the outside. The bearnaise sauce was a great compliment also.The reason I am dropping a star is because their &#34;frites&#34; or &#34;fries&#34; are awful. They are basically strips of chips that would be a nice appetizer perhaps but have no place on an entree plate. You couldn&#39;t stab them with your fork as they&#39;d break and you couldn&#39;t really scoop them up either as they just fall off so you really have to use your fingers - not something you really want to do in a high-end steak house.For the prices I&#39;d also expect some nice bread and dipping sauce or an amuse bouche but instead there was just a bowl of what could have been Lay&#39;s potato chips which didn&#39;t taste all that fresh on the table when we sat down.Ultimately they&#39;re a steak house and they nailed the steak so I am giving them a 4*, but if it wasn&#39;t for that it would probably be a 3."

The waitress was very knowledgeable on the food and water glasses were never left empty. I also should note that I make steaks at home quite often in many different methods and it&#39;s rare that I find a steakhouse have mind blowing steak, so don&#39;t take it as a bad point if I thought that the steak was good but not out of this world.On the other hand, the potato? *Insert thumbs up emoji here.* Pretty much half of a potato roasted and prepared in a mashed potato like texture with melted cheese and truffle on top. Definitely my favorite thing here. Actually, the sides in general were pretty good. Carpaccio was very simple but good as it was wrapped in arugula and topped with shredded cheese. Seared foie gras was interesting as well but I felt that the balsamic reduction was so sharp that it took away a bit of the &#34;essence&#34; of the liver.All in all, great date joint. Bottom line below.For the boys: Ambiance is great, dimly lit=romantic, boogie, ladies will love it.For the ladies: Bring your man here and it is more than likely that he will be pleased.For everyone: Wallet buster.

I was surprised, very pleasantly, that it is in fact a Last Word. It happens to be one of my favorite cocktails.We had brought our own wine and they charge a corking fee and decanted it for us. For an appetizer, I got the yellowtail ceviche. It was refreshing and seasoned well. A little bit salty, a little bit of heat, and the crunch of the cucumbers. For dinner I got the 8 oz filet medium with the Yukon potatoes and asparagus. The steak was cooked perfectly, the potatoes were outrageously good, and the asparagus was tender and had a slight lemon flavor. I was very satisfied with my meal choice.For dessert, I got the bread pudding. I normally do not care for bread pudding but it had Nutella and banana ice cream. It was not the best dessert, there was far less Nutella than I had hoped for but it was still tasty."

We arrived 15 mins early when the hostess told us the restaurant was running 15-30 mins behind on reservations but we could grab drinks at the bar while we wait. We were able to order drinks but after waiting 15 mins beyond our reservation time, my fiance notified the hostess that it was our engagement dinner and asked when we could anticipate being seated for our reservation. She said we would be &#34;next.&#34; After waiting another 30 mins with no further communication from the hostess, we left disappointed and hungry. At no point did any of the staff offer to provide us the drinks my friend called in and paid for in advance.I know the night was not special to the staff but what is the point of having a reservation system if you have no intention of honoring the reservations.  Aside from just being decent to your customers, there are way too many amazing restaurants in Chicago for this to be smart business practice."

My wife and I went for a date night Friday night to see what the buzz was all about. I&#39;m not going to lie... best restaurant in the city! Hands down.First, I would like to say how amazing our server was. Rob Potter made our experience great. He was so generous and kind, and was so knowledgeable on all of the meats. Also, I talked to Joshua Waddell who was awesome and got me set up with a reservation so easy, and got me a table upstairs which was awesome. Rob gave us the whole background scoop as to where the different types of meat come from (the steak, the Bison, etc).My wife and I decided to get the calamari and bacon thick cut for appetizers. Oh my gosh was it good! Everything on the menu looked delicious, so we asked Rob for suggestions. Since I never had Bison before, I was feeling adventurous to try it out. We went with the Bison and boot steak. I couldn&#39;t believe how great it was. I literally eat chicken and steak everyday, but as soon as a tried the bison, I asked my wife where can we go to buy Bison. Also, since we don&#39;t drink, Rob recommended the cucumber water which was out of this world. The way they prepare it beats me, but it&#39;s a really cool design.We couldn&#39;t stop there, and decided to get the 14k gold chocolate cake and cheese cake and watermelon cotton candy (yes were fatties) Haha just kidding, but it was delcious. It was by far the best date night I&#39;ve ever went on, and the staff here at RPM made it great! Definitely recommend to everyone to come try this place out at least once to get the same experience I did!"

The customer service? top notch.But I had heard good things and as a Lettuce member, was willing to give this place another try.Our amazing waitress Kristen started off the evening asking if we had been there before. My date and I looked at each other and smiled, &#34;Yes, but the last time we came here there was a mixup in our order and the replacement steak was far from good.&#34; She frowned and said, &#34;Oh no! And you guys came back?&#34; Timidly we responded, &#34;Well, we&#39;ve heard good things and we&#39;re Lettuce Entertain You members..so...&#34; She smiled and said, &#34;Well, we promise everything will be perfect this time to make up for it.&#34;We had: the roasted beets salad, the coal-roasted king crab leg, the 24 oz kansas city 28 day dry aged steak (medium), the 22 oz cowboy cut 28 day dry aged steak (medium-rare), the brussel sprouts, the hen of the woods mushrooms, and the peanut butter popcorn chocolate dessert..oh yeah and a bottle of wine.The roasted beets salad was perfectly composed - some arugula to balance out the beet taste...but it was outshone by the king crab leg! oh dear goodness that crab was good. get it get it get it! I will warn you though, it is not the biggest bang for your buck (3 precut portions).As for the steaks, this time they were cooked perfectly!I love mushrooms and the hen of the woods mushrooms were delicious.I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the brussel sprouts but they were decent. They aren&#39;t traditional cut (in half) but rather kind of fanned out. There is a good portion, but it was just too well seasoned for me. As a side to steaks, it was overwhelming. I think i had one bite.The peanut butter dessert though? Man oh man that was yummy! I&#39;m not a huge sweets person but sure do love my ice cream! While obviously sweet, this dessert was not overwhelmingly kick you in the mouth sweet. A perfect ending!"

It&#39;s not often that I get to a restaurant for a 5pm reservation. We started out with the delicious bacon and the popovers as appetizers. I then had the Duke ribeye steak and the Yukon potato sides, the brussels, summer squash, broccolini were great compliments. My meat was cooked perfectly. The Baked Alaska table side was very cool and it was a nice treat to get the cotton candy. I would love to be back and try some of the seafood options as well. Service was good, but a little slower for my taste. I think we were ready to order a few times and my boss had to leave early and didn&#39;t get to have dinner and only just appetizers."

Service was impeccable the whole way through. Our water glasses and drinks were constantly refilled and plates and silverware cleared. Timing of the courses was also great. Our sever was knowledge  and a pleasure to deal with.For appetizers we ordered the bacon which was literally a large slab of sizzling bacon. Yum! We also had the popovers with the most amazing herb butter ever. Omg! Delish. The butter made the order worth it. Otherwise they were well seasoned and crispy and tasty. We also had the fondue which was crispy sourdough with cheese fondue. Yummy but not wow. For my entree I had the 8oz. Filet. It was cooked to perfection and was tasty but not the best I&#39;ve ever had to be honest. The burger my man&#39;s brother ordered looked amazing and he said was very very delicious. And was literally more than half the price and came with tasty pomme frites so I was jealous and wish I got that instead. Next time!My steak was large but came with 2 pickled peppers and a sprig of parsley. All other sides are ala carte and say are sharable but I would say are still rather small. We ordered the millionaire potato which is a double baked potato w/fontina cheese and truffles. It was heavenly! Highly recommended. We also had the Mac and cheese which was the lightest and tastiest Mac I&#39;ve had in a while. Amazing! Again. And it came with the most amazing tasty crispy maybe hen of the woods mushrooms on top and mixed in. For a cheese and mushroom lover this is ideal.For dessert we had the Nutella bread pudding with ice cream which was great and watermelon margarita flavored (yes it tasted just like it) cotton candy which was graciously on the house as a bday treat. Over all tasty tasty place. Would def come back."

Good, fruity drink. As for the food, we got the Fondue that came with garlic bread. I thought the bread was average but the fondue cheese was a great complement with the garlic.The star though was the coal-roasted king crab (2 orders in my picture). Already cut for easy eating, the king crab was smooth, soft, not overcooked. It was really delicious. Tasted fresh and great for sharing between two people per leg."

We had the Parker house rolls, which were very good--the butter is the star of the show and the octopus, absolutely delicious, the crema amps it up for sure. My only complaint with that is that the portion is small. The bacon is also great.I had the Japanese Waygu which was fantastic. Melt in your mouth tender and flavorful! The guy I was with had the rib eye, which was good but we had to get sent back because it was way under cooked. I had the millionaire&#39;s potato and he had the hassleback. Personally I preferred his to mine as I found the millionaires to be too rich.For dessert we had the donuts and the staff was kind enough to bring us cotton candy also.Overall dining here was a nice experience.

Bone-In Ribeye, Broiled Black Cod,  Millionaire&#39;s Potato, Broccolini, 14K Chocolate Cake, Blueberry Cheesecake, and the Birthday Cottoncandy!The Kale Salad was great, generous portion, dressed nicely and had little cubes of delicious bacon. Octopus was well seasoned and cooked, crispy exterior and tender in the middle.The ribeye has always been my favorite cut.  It was very well seasoned, and had a good amount of char with the perfect medium pink in the center.  They also brought out extra seasoning if needed.  The cod was fresh and cooked well, but I was not a fan of their sweet glaze.  I guess I don&#39;t usually eat fish with any sweetness.  I prefer it to be savory. Wouldn&#39;t order the cod again.For sides, the broccolini was good and I would order it again.  The millionaire&#39;s potato.... it&#39;s an $18 potato... should we order it?  YOLO! We&#39;re ordering it!  It&#39;s like a twice baked potato, with a crispy skin, and topped with black truffle.  I hate to say it&#39;s soooo good, because truffles with carbs is like cheating, at the same time I would have eaten 3 of these (if I could afford it) and passed out in the booth, and would have been the dreaming about the pigs searching for the truffles. We ended up ordering one and made it back home on the 8:35 metra train.For dessert, the cheesecake was very light and blueberries were fresh.  The cream with lime zest was also a very nice touch.  The chocolate cake arrived with a little happy birthday topper, dressed in gold leaves.  I&#39;m so fancy, so baller, so chocolaty.  It was so good, I had to save half for a pre-workout meal the next day. FYI, I killed it at the gym the next day.  Musta been all that gold!  Now I know why this places gets such good ratings."

RPM Italian never disappoints, and RPM Steak is just as good.The ambiance of this place is great: dark, elegant, and trendy. It can get pretty loud inside, which is why I&#39;m glad my friends and I scored one of the coveted patio booths outside. Yes, I said BOOTHS. This is patio dining at its finest, people! Service was excellent and we had a fabulous time.The drinks were great: I stuck to the Cobbler all night and had a few of them because they were so tasty. But the FOOD!!! Every single dish was outstanding. We ordered the cheese fondue bread, thick-cut bacon, and octopus to start with. I had &#34;The Duke&#34; entree signature steak, along with the brussels sprouts and papas bravas sides. Everything was heavenly. Somehow we made room for dessert and opted to share the chocolate cake, which was divine. It was also covered in flakes of 14K gold. HOLY. CRAP. So fancy, so excessive, so fabulous.Our bill was pricy but reasonable considering the high quality of everything and the generous portion sizes.

Wow!  After first walking in we hung out at the bar for our first cocktail since arriving early.  Atmosphere was cool and elegant and not as crowded and chaotic as RPM Italian where we got seats at the bar no problem. My extra dirty martini was made perfectly which really set the stage for our upcoming dining experience.  We were seated at a nice booth that was still part of the bar area elevated above the actual dining room.  I would have preferred sitting in the dining room as it was a really cool modern space but where we were was still ideal as it included a number of nice comfortable booths and couples dining together.  Our waitress suggested we start with the coal roasted crab leg appetizer that was crazy good.  I am not a fan of crab but this dish was absolutely out of this world.  We then split the bone-in Kansas City cut done medium rare.  I thought the steak was perfect.  My boyfriend also enjoyed it but made just a small comment to the waitress about it being a little chewy due to a strip of tendon within the cut.  Due to that feedback, a manager came out to apologize and asked if we wanted another steak done for us.  Because it was really no big deal and we thoroughly enjoyed the meal, we mentioned that wasn&#39;t necessary.  So instead, our waitress brought out her 3 favorite desserts that were on the house (incredible cotton candy, blueberry cheese cake that was luscious and light and beignet like donuts with vanilla and chocolate anglaise).  Now that was above and beyond superb service!  With the bottle of red wine we ordered our dining experience was so enjoyable.  Top notch service, excellent food and atmosphere perfect for both a business dinner or romantic date, RPM Steak is a fabulous choice that shouldn&#39;t be missed."

A lady, and what looked like her daughter sat down next to us right after. They ordered two waters and right away we could tell the older woman was highly intoxicated. She fell asleep at the bar a few times while we waited. I was shocked they didn&#39;t escort her out. Didn&#39;t bother us, but just a bit surprising. We got sat exactly at our reservation time in a nice booth. Waiter came out and was great with recommendations. Appetizer crab leg was the best part of the meal! After we ordered dinner, our waiter seemed to be less attentive to us. Steak was a bit overcooked, which really took away from the flavor. It was our anniversary, and I was a bit surprised they didn&#39;t acknowledge that. Overall, for the price and quality, I don&#39;t think I would go back. Disappointed for sure."

So I ordered the 8oz filet mignon and brussels sprouts as a side. The brussels were not what I was expecting. I thought they would be made the more traditional way (oven roasted), but these were flaked and curried. Still fantastic and extremely flavorful, but just not what I expected when I ordered them! The filet was cooked a perfect medium rare consistency the whole way through, and I was very pleased with the quality of both the meat and the way it was prepared.What really made me give RPM steak 5 stars was the fantastic desserts! We had cotton candy, champagne sorbet (very palette cleansing), a chocolate cake with gold flakes (a little too rich for me but then again I&#39;m not a big chocolate cake person) and these AMAZING doughnuts that in my honest opinion could beat many of the doughnuts made in various doughnut shops around the city. To be fair to these specialty doughnut shops, I am a big fan of yeast-risen doughnuts and not so much the cake ones, which seem to be a more popular variety. So sadly I don&#39;t get my fill of yeast risen doughnuts very often. When our waitress brought out these warm, airy, sugar-coated, square shaped doughnuts with the consistency of a beignet but the size of a doughnut WITH a marbled Boston creme on the side, I was in HEAVEN. Every bite is like putting your teeth into a delicious sugary pillow of dough, and I really could not get enough.Originally came here for the steak, but will definitely come AGAIN for the desserts. And probably also to try out the risotto! Thanks RPM for a great experience and let me know if you ever plan on opening RPM doughnuts because I will be your first (and most loyal) customer."

All three were stellar.  I loved the sweet and salty of the bacon--and it&#39;s not just strips of bacon, these are hearty portions of the bacon belly. The Ocotopus was perfectly char-grilled, set with some crispy potatoes with a very nice spicy Jalepeno Crema. The bread was freshly baked, soft, warm and served with a tasty herbed butter.For the mains, we each got steak--grass fed for the mister and dry aged for me.  RPM also had a carving station with prime rib and lamb chops and we opted for a couple of lamb chops to share at the table too. I found my steak to be overdone a bit.  I ordered medium and I found areas where it wasn&#39;t pink like our server said it would be. The flavor was good and the bernaise sauce I ordered amped up the flavor a bit.  But it was also a bit tough, my steak knife worked hard.  But when I ate my leftovers at home, our steak knives worked just fine.  Weird. The lamp chops were tiny, but did have a very good flavor and cooked to a perfect medium rare.  They were served with a delicious mint creme sauce and it complemented it well.Sides for sharing: Cauliflower--divine! it&#39;s char grilled so it&#39;s not over cooked or mushy and it&#39;s served with a delicious citrus aoili on the side. This was my favorite.Hen of the Woods Mushrooms--loved this too. Fresh, earthy, a bit of a crunchy texture.Millionaire&#39;s Potato--excellent!  The truffle was not overpowering, the texture of the potato super creamy and the Fontina just made it extra rich.Spinach--very good.  Creamed spinach.  It was good, nothing better than what i can do at home, but we always have creamed spinach with our steaks so this was a must.Dessert.  You bet my son was eyeing the complementary cotton candy that was brought to other tables and he loved that we got a bowl for too.  Such a fun whimical touch. We also ordered the Baked Alaska, Because who wouldn&#39;t love having something flambeed tableside?  The presentation was really pretty and the ice cream and meringue were mighty tasty.Service was impeccable.  We had our server and his two assistants and they worked really well as a team.  Our server was spot on with his suggestions and really good about describing and suggesting wines for our tastes.The space is sleek and upscale with just the right volume of clubby music playing in the background.  Conversation friendly.This place is not kid friendly, but if your little one can behave during a nice dinner and doesn&#39;t need chicken nuggets on the menu then they might enjoy this place.  They treated my son like a little adult and he loved it."

Cocktails were enjoyable, and the  sommalier made a perfect recommendation for an obscure wine I was looking for.The Bad: The $125, 60-day dry-aged tomahawk ribeye was both undercooked and under-seasoned. We ordered it Medium-Rare Plus, and it came out Rare to Blue. While they gladly took it back to warm up, there was no apology or concession of any kind. I&#39;ve had several dry-aged steaks before and like them very much. That said, this particular steak had the consistency and flavor of a New York, not the melt-in-your-mouth ribeye you might expect. To his credit, our server said this would be the leanest of the ribeyes on the menu, but I didn&#39;t expect it so dry. Sorry, but if you&#39;re charging $125 for a steak, it needs to be 100% perfect or you make up for it somehow.The Ugly: our party of two shared 2 cocktails, 1 salad, 1 app, 1 steak, 1 dessert, and 1 modest bottle of wine and the total was $320+ without tip. I&#39;d have no problem with this if the steak was amazing, but considering the steak was average at best, I&#39;d say this place was overpriced substantially."

Home run.Two of the dishes I would put on my &#34;Best dish in Chicago&#34;list - the coal roasted crab appetizer and the steak frites. The crab will blow your mind. Just get it. The steak frites which is actually a ribeye cap cut, is cooked perfectly, has just the right amount of fat and it&#39;s so tender you can cut it with your fork. And the donuts for dessert are a winner. How could they not be, they&#39;re donuts. Service was excellent throughout the meal.RPM isn&#39;t cheap. You&#39;ll spend some hard earned cash for sure.

I loved how thin the frites were, and the steak wasn&#39;t too fatty and cooked exactly how I asked.When it was time for desserts, I didn&#39;t need to hear anything else as soon as I heard Baked Alaska.Even for lunch, this place fills up quickly, so reservations are recommended.

We made early reservations on a Sunday. The restaurant is very open and modern inside. Not a dark cave like Maestros where you need night vision goggles to maneuver the place. We had a booth by the bar which was very comfortable.A few things we had... Started with the octopus app with was great, cooked perfectly, and all the flavors worked well together. Next I made a mistake... I ordered the special king crab tempura... Now I love king crab and I love tempura. But I know that 90% of places that serve &#34;tempura&#34; have no clue how to make it properly, this includes Japanese restaurants!! Was it bad, no. It was just a fried crab nugget in a thin batter served with avocado and a spicy dipping sauce. I would skip this especially for $24. After feeling foolish for falling into the tempura &#34;made by a white man&#34; trap, I had another martini and felt a little better...On to the rest of the meal... So of course you cannot visit an RPM without paying for some bread, right? So we got our own loaf of mini buns. I have to say it was very good and the cheapest thing on the menu!!Next a lobster tail flown half way round the world for mom to enjoy! Sometimes she&#39;s just in that lobster mood... I will say the meat was sweet, cooked perfectly, &amp; excellent to eat. It didn&#39;t need any butter at all, perfect as is.Dry aged bone in strip. Very good. I am normally a rib eye fan but went with something different. A great char with a light salt flavor which is perfect to me. I hate anything over salted when I am paying for a quality product to start with. They do give you a tiny bowl with a salt herb blend to add if needed. I did use it on a few bites and liked it very much.The side I had were the Hen of the Woods mushrooms. I have to say this is one of many things that make RPM the better steakhouse. Most places will have the mushroom caps, Giant asparagus, and some baked or mashed potato. There were 4 different kinds of mushrooms I could choose from, plus 4 other vegetables, plus potatoes. It really makes a meal when you can have additions past the generic...Our server was great. If there was something she didn&#39;t already know she would find out for us. Even on a Sunday it was a full house but the time we left at 7:30. So having been to a few steakhouses over the years RPM is something to look forward to compared to the rest. If you just want a steak and potato then it probably doesn&#39;t matter but for that little extra that makes a dinner better it&#39;s here.The one odd thing was my coffee was weak like diner coffee. It felt out of place, more fitting with some bacon &amp; eggs... Maybe just made wrong...?"

I wish I lived in Chicago so I can go to RPM all the time. While visiting Chicago, my mate and I were looking for a tasty steak place to take his mom to enjoy a great time with great food!!! Due to all the touring, we lost track of time and RPM was open till 1 AM!! We were greeted by a friendly staff and great energy! The staff were in white blazers and just looked extremely classy! Our waiter Joshua was knowledgable of all of the dishes and recommended so many! Such a complete sweetheart and such bubbly personality. The ambience is so sassy and chic! Fun to go with a bunch of friends or a sexy date. The rib eye was to die for. You have options with or without its fat! The rib eye was flavorful and just delicious and tender in every bite! The potato was so uniquely made and veggies were just right! The alcohol was definitely made with love and the wine was 2 thumbs up!!! My taste buds were having a party in my mouth with the chocolate cake sprinkled with 24k gold. The banana pudding was almost the best I&#39;ve ever had!! The whole experience considering getting there very late was a 10 star rating!!! Please bring RPM to LOS ANGELES!!!  Thank you RPM for a great taste and experience in Chicago!!! LA steak houses has nothing on you!!!"

The food was outstanding from the bison steak to the delicious Hen of the Woods mushrooms and curry brussel sprouts. Most of all, however, the service was impeccable. Brian Neely (not sure on spelling) was our server and his recommendations were spot on, as well as he consistently made sure we were taken care of.  We sat outside in one of the crescent-shaped booths, which was the perfect spot to enjoy time with my boyfriend while people watching. The sommelier identified our tastes and also make the perfect recommendations. Highly recommend this place and Brian!"

We were celebrating our third anniversary amongst other things and this seemed like the place to do it.The space is very modern. Reminded me of NYC or LA. Large, minimal, black and white, full of fancy people.We showed up a bit early so grabbed a drink at the bar and then got our table almost right away.The service here is on point. From the moment you check in to leaving, they are on their game. It&#39;s wonderful.We treated ourselves to a few things: bottle of wine, oysters (incredible vinaigrette), the $18 potato (amazing), foie gras tower - they should serve this with some bread - pointer: 2/3 is fruit, brussel sprouts, Duke steaks, the donut-Y dessert. You&#39;ll get a massive ball of cotton candy at the end so be ready for that sugar high.So why 4/5? I was surprised to see that given we were celebrating a few things, nothing was gifted. Even at the nicest places around the country, they tend to do something (a drink, a dessert) to really class up the experience but they didn&#39;t here.Guess Giuliana and Bill are pinching pennies!"

Had the oysters, octopus and the woodgrilled cap. The octopus and oysters were a solid 3 stars, nothing that would blow you away in terms of flavor but still good and the cap was a 4 (altho it comes out sliced for some reason which led to my steak getting cold pretty fast).I&#39;m glad I got to check it out but was expecting to be blown away. Overall its another solid steakhouse in Chicago, but for the price I&#39;d probably go with another spot."

I came in with my lady on the late night and I got who I think was the last server in the joint. The food was awesome, the drinks and wine list were off the chart, but he took it to the next level and seriously made the night a memorable occasion.Right when we sat down and was greeted I knew we were going to have a great time, I am not gay, but was charmed. The menu was not huge but big enough to feel a little overwhelmed and needed to choose what to have because I wasnt  trying to blow my load all over Chicago and had already pre drank at pop&#39;s (nuf said).Bobby explained the menu with confidence that not only showed knowledge but also an appreciation for what he was serving. It was clear to me he was truly proud of this menu. Bobby led us in the right directions after I subtly explained I didnt want want spend a ton of money but wanted to taste the best. He picked up on my Incognito &#39;im not trying to brake the bank but still want eat right.. and get some of course&#39;.I started out with a spot on manhattan at the bar and my date and I each had two glasses of wine that were delicious. For dinner I tried the Rib eye, which is my favorite cut, and was perfectly cooked mid rare and seasoned perfectly. The potato sides were on a new level! Everything was worth the money, be careful though its easy to rack up the bill.In the end it was well worth it and a great experience. I dont know if I will be back anytime soon, personally, but if you can throw down some decent cash I would recommend this place every night of the week. Great food, atmosphere and especially service.Thank you for reading ;)"

Ambiance was not as elegant. Waiter seemed rushed. Bacon appetizer was delicious! Moscow mule was a bit watered down. Lobster was excellent. Millionaire potatoes were tasty. I want to say they were overpriced at 18 dollars, but they were really really good. Friends got the filet and it was good, but they weren&#39;t blown away. Donuts lived up to the hype. With so many steakhouses in the city, will not be back unfortunately, but would visit RPM Italian again."

The hype here is real and this place exceeded my expectations.The restaurant is large, modern, and has great ambiance. There are a lot of tables and every table was full at dinner. However it never felt too crowded or like you were sitting on top of the table next to you.We ordered the octopus appetizer and it was probably the best cooked octopus I&#39;ve ever had. It was so tender and cooked to perfection. We also ordered the Parker House Rolls. They are freshly baked in house and they were light, soft, and had great flavor.For dinner our table of six ordered 2 filets, bison filet, black cod, wild king salmon. We also order the following sides hasselback potatoes, whipped bleu cheese potatoes, bacon, hen of the woods, and brussel sprouts.  The steak ordered rare was outstanding. I was very pleased with the quality of both the meat and the way it was prepared. The fishes were also very flavorful and moist. Very impressive for a steakhouse. The thick cut bacon appetizer was awesome. It was savory/sweet and it was melt in your mouth delicious.We ended up with the house made donuts, 14k chocolate cake, and Baked Alaska for dessert. The house made donuts were light and airy. The chocolate cake was very rich cake but really good. It was served very cold which is my favorite way to have cake. The Baked Alaska was fun to order for the presentation, but I wasn&#39;t crazy about the flavors.Our waiter Bobby was friendly and personable. He checked on us several times through the night and made sure everything was to our liking. Service was exceptional. There&#39;s a fleet or servers, food runners, and bussers working. All of our entrees and sides arrived at the same time so no one was kept waiting. Bobby was attentive throughout the night. I just wish he waited for everyone to finish eating before he sent his crew to clear the table.Everything about RPM Italian is excellent and I highly recommend dining here when in the Chicago area."

Their old fashioned was superb. The giant ice cube barely melted, but just enough to balance out the flavors and didn&#39;t water the tasty bev down as I&#39;m a slow sipper.The vibe of the place is really cool too. Like a 1920s experience, but upscale. So consider dressing to impress unlike us. Note to self for next time. The bar area overlooks the whole restaurant and is set slightly above the dining room so you get a great view for people watching. In the bar, the walls are lined with leather-lined booths in a semi-circle shape -- very intimate, very chic.I could have spent hours here and wish I could afford to spend $15 per cocktail on the reg. But alas, it was time to hit the hay.I will admit it is my dream to run into Giuliana and Bill at one of their Chicago restaurants. Perhaps one day."

No more. Either tell your customers you do not serve basted eggs anymore or hire a cook that can baste an egg. Sending out over medium eggs with the explanation &#34;this is how we baste eggs here&#34; is just awful and let&#39;s me know the person in the kitchen never went to cooking school.  They should look up the word &#34;baste&#34; in a dictionary.The really toasted rye toast I asked for came out as warm bread.

It&#39;s cozy, local (North Park) and servers treat you like they&#39;ve known you forever. You&#39;ll get great service and delicious, hearty food.To all the breakfast-lovers like myself: GO. Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club provides you with purpose. You will see hungry folks lined up outside but hakuna matata, there is a nice bench on Kimball to sit on. Staff do their best to keep everyone happy.I&#39;ve been here twice. Once with my friend Meliss and another with my Aunt from the East Coast who was visiting for the weekend. I&#39;m sure I will keep coming here with friends and family.I&#39;ll get a steaming mug of coffee and add a few creams. When the food arrives, I will slowly, purposely devour whatever is front of me. Usually I&#39;ll get a taste of whatever my dining parter is having, but we are unable to eat everything because the portions are huge and definitely shareable (2:1 person/dish).I always get something savory and with chorizo or avocado. Meet you at BMBC where you order something sweet and we will be a perfect pair?Things I have ordered and/or stole from someone else&#39;s plate:-Mayan Benedict: bean cakes, chorizo, poached eggs, cheese, salsa, avocado-Cubano Guava Hotcakes: guava sauce, sweet marscarpone, graham crackers, pecans-Chorizo Skillet: chorizo, onion, tomatoes, black beans, avocado, cheddar, sour cream, chipotle sauce-Caribbean Omelette: jerked shrimp, cream cheese, avocado, cilantro, mango chutneyYou can get half orders of some of the sweet items (French toast). From my experience, your server can make an excellent recommendation if your stomach allows!  Many orders come with a side of toast.It&#39;s cozy (crowded) in the restaurant, but it&#39;s so lovely; the hustle-bustle of servers/greeters, the chatter of people, the clanging of silverware. The ducking under trays of food and zig-zagging your way to the table. The fresh flowers in a mason jar by your mug. It&#39;s a euphoric breakfast at BMBC every single time."

And our server said on weekends they are jammed.One of the reasons I came here was because they had some kind of pancake with bananas and I think carmel.  It looked really good!  I&#39;m not an adventurous eater (chocolate chip pancakes is about as adventerous as I get).  But those banana pancakes fit within my boring tastes.  Well it ended up they were a daily special and they were not on the specials for this day.  There was another pancake that sounded good with cherries and peaches.  I was going to tell them to just put the cherries on it, but I was willing to step out of my comfort zone so I just ordered them as they came.They ended up being one of those meals that you wish would never end.  The mixture of the cherries with the peaches blended perfectly.  And the pancakes were different (read &#39;much better&#39;) than most places I&#39;ve been. They were light and slightly sweet. Once I finished the meal I had to compliment the cook (truly more like a chef) for creating such an amazing dish.  I want to come back soon!"

The wait was relatively quick but I did see some people lingering, so I suspect as the morning gets later, the waits go up.The menu looked great and I had a hard time deciding. So, I obviously had to try more than one thing. I had pancakes and a breakfast torta. They both were delicious. The torta was light even though it had chorizo in it (which sometimes skews heavy and greasy).  The pancake was huge! Also delicious with fruit.Nothing was overly done. The ingredients were fresh and made well and also somewhat simple.Worth a visit for the wonderful food. Also, great staff and they take credit cards now."

When I came here to have breakfast with my girlfriend we weren&#39;t sure what to expect. We came here because she said they have huge portions and she was correct on that their portions are pretty well sized for there price. We got what other people have reviewed over and said was delicious, which was the crab cake benedict and another benedict that include salmon in it(forgot its name). MM the flavor was alright really enjoyed the salmon benedict, but only complaint about it was the eggs in both benedict. I guess in my past experience for me benedict is suppose to have a runny egg, but our were more well done you could say. that was the only bad part.

I was happy that they serve uncommon coffee which i just read about their news online.Bread pudding French toast was just amazing!!! Sour of fresh strawberry and sweetness of marmalade were perfectly matched!! My husband got omelette which I think it was good, but I wish the egg was more half cooked to give more smooth and silky texture. I felt it was a little bit overcooked.We got a high table seating spot and very uncomfortable with the high steel chair. You could adjust the height, but it was still uncomfortable.

This place and m.henry are probably my 2 favorite spots for breakfast/brunch.I got the pancakes with berries and cream and my husband got the acorn squash and tofu plate. The kids got pancakes and we added berries and cram for them as well. Everything was delicious! Literally my son wanted to kick his plate because it was that great. The last time I came we ordered the bread pudding French toast, French omelet, and Oreo pancakes for the kids. Again it was amazing! I have no complaints about this place! The service is awesome and street parking is fairly easy! In terms of coffee they brew uncommon coffee roasters which is based in mi. It&#39;s good coffee but not my favorite. If I had to give them a con it would be on the orange juice. The fresh squeezed orange juice doesn&#39;t really taste fresh squeezed but maybe I read the menu wrong and assumed it was fresh.This place is super kid friendly because we have 3 little ones and it was no problem with them. They have high chairs.Also the restaurant is not too big so there is a wait but it usually isn&#39;t a long wait.

The inside is wayyyyy tight, not sure that I would seat groups larger than that on a Sunday brunch service because of how tight it is in there.The food was OK. I had the strawberry-rhubarb french toast, it was sufficient. I did like how they represented Cubano culture with lots of guava usage. They also use a TON of fresh fruit which is AMAZING. Kind of silly though that they have trickier ethnic staples such as scallion pancakes which can in no way be properly represented in a short-order brunch service spot. The menu seems a little too vast for such a small spot. My iced tea was fresh and delicious, the staff was always present to refill when needed.Cost was about normal for a neighborhood brunch spot in Chicago."

The wait wasn&#39;t too bad, and the ambiance of the restaurant was modern and welcoming.The food varied, however. I ordered the multi grain blueberry pancakes which were disappointingly dry. More blueberry sauce would have made it better, but as it was, I had to add butter and maple syrup.My husband&#39;s savory stuffed French toast was much better, with excellent home fries. I recommend trying the dish with maple syrup.Our server was competent, but surly at best. I actually empathize with him, however, as I&#39;m sure I would be the same if I had to serve in a restaurant that was so warm. This place is in DIRE need of air conditioning.

I&#39;ve never even heard of this place, and the word &#34;club&#34; had me thinking there was actually some kind of membership required. Well, luckily there is no membership.The place is not that big, but it&#39;s apparently pretty popular, because there was a 30 minute wait when we got there on Saturday morning at 10. By the time we left, the line was just as long. I checked up Yelp to give me some guidance, and even though there weren&#39;t that many reviews, most were pretty positive. Problem is, I didn&#39;t really know what to get, since, like most breakfast places, their menu is pretty big and everyone has their own favorite.CHORIZO SKILLETThe item with the just slightly more mention than most on Yelp was the Chorizo Skillet, and on top of that, the ingredients were really close to the Mexicana Skillet at Wildberry in Schaumburg, which is one of my 10/10 dishes. Obviously, since I love that dish, every bite of this was going to be in comparison to that.Let&#39;s start with what&#39;s in it: chorizo, onion, tomatoes, black beans, avocado, sour cream,  chipotle sauce, roasted potato hash, 2 eggs, and cheddar cheese. I replaced cheddar with Chihuahua cheese in mine, which is what I do at Wildberry too. Now, a few of the differences here were the addition of black beans, diced potatoes instead of hash browns, and chipotle sauce. It also was missing the jalapeños. They did give a few leaves of cilantro, but it was more like garnish than it was for actual flavoring, which was a problem. Cilantro really helps flavor the dish with a flavor of freshness that only it can provide.Now a thing about chorizo...it&#39;s salty. It&#39;s delicious, but too much uninhibited chorizo and it just because a salt mine. It&#39;s the job of everything around it to balance it, but not to snuff it out (like omelettes usually do). The loss of cilantro hurt it a bit, but the black beans, while I think of as sort of a neutral addition to the dish, cut it a bit too. The potatoes I think were seasoned great to eat by themselves, but if the goal was to cut the saltiness of the chorizo, it actually made it worse. The avocados and sour cream helped quite a bit too, but there was just a little too much chorizo at the end of the day, and it ended up being a bit too salty for my taste.Now the biggest thing is this chipotle sauce. Wildberry gives you the spice in the form of jalapeños and salsa. That gives you a nice clean spicy kick. The salsa and cilantro in Wildberry&#39;s skillet give you the air of freshness and the salsa and jalapeños add a little bit of sour instead of salt. The chipotle sauce here gives it a little too much bold and salty flavors and just sort of ends up dulling the peaks of the chorizo, but again, adding salt.I can probably explain it like this. If you like the taste of Tabasco (clean, spicy, pointed, sour, sweet), you&#39;ll like Wildberry&#39;s better. If you like Cholula (bold, salty, smoky, steady) then you&#39;ll probably like Bryn Mawr&#39;s. I for one am definitely still Wildberry!BISCUITS &amp; GRAVYI only had a taste of this, but while I can&#39;t say a whole lot for the gravy, I can say that the biscuit tasted too doughy for me. Not really a fan of that flavor. I want more buttery and creamy flavors. McDonald&#39;s biscuits I think are pretty top notch.BEING BAD FEELS PRETTY GOOD, HUH?I dunno...not so creative right now. That&#39;s a line from the Breakfast Club. Anyway, the place has a lot going for it. The menu is pretty decent, so I&#39;m sure you can find something to eat here. I definitely wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to come back, but if we happened to meet here again, I wouldn&#39;t complain. I&#39;d definitely try something else though."

It was a long wait, almost 30 minutes. Honestly, the food was just okay and wasn&#39;t really worth the wait.I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of anything on the menu (which was a little limited, in my opinion), so I just got the two egg breakfast. Two eggs, scrambled, with breakfast potatoes and toast. I subbed pancakes for toast. They charged an extra $4 for this. I&#39;ve never been up-charged for subbing pancakes for toast at any breakfast place I&#39;ve ever eaten at before...Like I said, food was just ok. Eggs were ok, nothing special. The breakfast potatoes were pretty good, but mine were cold by the time I got them, which was a little disappointing.The pancakes were super delicious! Very light and fluffy, served with a few fresh blueberries and some powdered sugar. However, was 2 small pancakes worth an extra $4? Probably not.Overall, I wouldn&#39;t go again. My meal was $15, and I don&#39;t think it was worth it. My girlfriends said the same thing, that their food was just okay but nothing super special.Overall, probably not worth a long wait on the weekend."

My friends and I made the voyage over to North Park after eyeing Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club on Check, Please. And thank goodness we moseyed in because it was a phenomenal experience.Making it to Check, Please typically pushes an establishment to the brink of collapse due to the onslaught. However, the entire staff handled it with such grace that I was truly astonished.  We went on a Tuesday late morning and it was reasonably packed. We were greeted immediately and grabbed seats at the communal table in the rear. Before sitting down, I took a photo of the specials board at the front, just in case we didn&#39;t get the entire spiel. Service was on-point: coffee/water was promptly refilled, waitress was highly knowledgeable of the intricacies of the menu, and appropriate condiments were delivered to the table before even asking for them.We got the chorizo skillet (overwhelming amount of deliciousness), chilaquiles verdes (yummy, perfect for hangovers), and rancheros borrachos (literally demolished in mere minutes). The first and last dish features chorizo and it was marvelously seasoned and hot. The rancheros came with a side of the plantains and they were just luscious. Price point was perfect. Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club is an international diner-esque food in a wonderful setting."

Drove in from Naperville to find the restaurant locked and unoccupied by anyone at 7:15 am. Assumed they changed their hours, but called later to learn the hours didn&#39;t change. I found Pannenkoeken nearby was open, it was a blessing in disguise. We&#39;ll see if I give them a 2nd chance, after looking at the expensive menu. You would think they can afford an alarm clock."

I had a hard time choosing from the menu but got the biscuits and gravy--definitely the best I&#39;ve ever had. My boyfriend got the pancakes with peach and cherry (possibly seasonal) and said it was phenomenal. Not sure what kind of coffee they served but it was also delicious, and I really dig the retro style mugs they serve it in.We went later, around 1:00pm and got the last table, so be prepared to wait if you&#39;re going at peak times.

So Im looking on Yelp to find a breakfast place and I see Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club. The menu looked great. So I&#39;m about to tell her that I wanted to go there when she tells the cab driver to go to the corner of Bryn Mawr and Kimball. I&#39;m thinking &#34;Hey, that&#39;s where Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club is!&#34; So we stop and sure enough, this is where she wanted to go too!The place is pretty small, but the food was grand! I had the skirt steak breakfast skillet. It was great! It had juicy strips of skirt steak, fried potatoes, pico de gallo, Gorgonzola cheese, avocado and tour choice of eggs. I chose poached. It also came with your choice of toast. I chose sourdough. Delicious!I would highly recommend this place if you want to take visitors to Chicago for a great breakfast.

This is the best thing you can get here. Me and my cousin decided to try other options on the menu for a change... The steak and eggs was the best plate we got... On my previous visits here, they can&#39;t seem to get the potatoes right! However, this times some of the potatoes werent as well done! The salmon plate club was alright not salty smoked salmon although I wasn&#39;t crazy about the capers and the Sourdough stuffed french toast felt like a &#34;grown-up Mc Griddle&#34; but wish they didn&#39;t have the arugula which was probably too mature since it was extremely bitter! Of both dishes, I&#39;d say as with the last time I came here the best part might have been the orange slice and pineapple wedge both of which were sweet! They weren&#39;t packed but it felt busy since it took a long time for them to prepare our food... Maybe next time I&#39;ll have to get my favorite Bread pudding french toast to go!"

My friend Linda and I wanted to try something new, and I told her how well-reviewed this place was on Yelp. She agreed to try it, based on the Yelp reviews, and we are glad we did. We had absolutely delicious, very filling breakfasts with good service in a cute place.The restaurant is on the corner of Bryn Mawr and Kimball Avenues. Writing in April 2015, I&#39;ll warn you that Bryn Mawr is undergoing construction, and is a great big mess. We came up Kimball and parked on the street, just north of the intersection. Until construction is completed, you may encounter traffic delays and parking challenges. Bryn Mawn Breakfast Club is good enough, though, that you should consider those challenges as testing your appetite. Pass the tests with patience and diligence, and you will be rewarded with good food.There is a standard menu given to everyone, and a list of specials written on a chalkboard in the front area, just north of the kitchen. The kitchen/cooking area is located in the middle of the restaurant, along the west wall, so you can clearly see the cooks at work. This is good for those customers who are nervous about food preparation. The food is cooked where everyone can see, so you can be confident that food is prepared properly.The coffee is listed as coming from some place in Michigan. It tastes just fine. The Michigan provenance doesn&#39;t mean much to me. Maybe it will to you.I ordered an omelette with leeks, asparagus, mushroom, and gruyere cheese. It typically comes with spinach, too, but I hate cooked spinach, and the staff was absolutely willing to forego that ingredient for me. It came with fried potatoes and a choice of bread; I took the sourdough, based on the server&#39;s recommendation. Wow! That was a fabulous omelette, and very filling. I ate the whole thing, and, no lie, I had no appetite until the evening, when I had an apple. I probably (probably???) overate, but it was so good, I just kept shoving the fork in my face.Linda had the panjo pancake with scrambled eggs. This is a Korean-style item. She thought it was made with rice. It had loads of scallions, and some kim chee in it. I took a bite of it and didn&#39;t care for it, but that&#39;s just me -- I really don&#39;t care for the flavors of Korean food, and this was Korean food. Linda, on the other hand, likes Korean food, and she ate her breakfast with as much alacrity as I did. At one point, I got up to use the washroom, and Linda was saying she&#39;d probably take half of her breakfast home with her. When I returned -- and I wasn&#39;t gone very long at all -- she&#39;d finished all her food. The next day, she called me and said she&#39;d been full until dinnertime, too. It was that good.The only odd element was an elderly man who was wandering down the street in front of the restaurant. He&#39;d stop, look in at us and stare, and then pace back and forth again. At one point, he came in as far as the entry, and just stood there for a moment, looking around. He didn&#39;t appear to be homeless or lost, and the servers just ignored him. All he did was stare and hang out, but still, it was kind of weird. This is nothing to do with the restaurant itself, of course, but it was part of the experience we had. For that reason, I include it here.Prices are pretty standard breakfast prices. When we were driving back to our homes afterward, we drove east on Montrose and passed a couple old-Chicago style places that advertised a full breakfast for $6.95. That&#39;s not what you&#39;ll get or pay at Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club. Our entrees cost either $9.75 or $9.95. We got a lot of food for that money.Bottom line: we loved Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club and will come again."

Food is fresh and delicious.  I ordered the cinnamon pancakes and a side of hash browns. The pancakes were nice and light and nice and sweet but not overly so.  You could tell they used more natural ingredients rather than artificial sweeteners.  The potatoes were great as well crispy and very flavorful.  Service was friendly and attentive as well.

Be forewarned that the portions are substantial.Mini hotcakes with berries. Chorizo skillet.The hotcakes are so moist that you may think they are not cooked fully. And not only are they moist, but they are so fluffy. The chorizo skillet is indeed a heavy dish. Either you tackle it on a completely empty stomach, very slowly, or in part with some to take home.There are no complaints about the services, given the time I went was not overrun with patrons. There isn&#39;t anything fancy about the breakfast offerings, so don&#39;t expect chi-chi dishes coming to the table. Noticing how breakfast spots tend to pack fast in Chicago&#39;s, I recommend going early to avoid standing outside or right at the door if the restaurant gets too crowded for immediate seating. The restaurant seems to be accommodating so far since it&#39;s relatively new. But once words get out, there will be a wait in the near future."

We sat at the counter and watched the chefs face to face. &#34;Manny&#34; the owner was most definitely the ring leader. He read the orders off in Spanish and his assistants to his left and right were fervently yet precisely creating meals.I ordered chilaquiles with green sauce. The flavors and toppings were typical of the central region of Mexico or Potosino meaning from the state of San Luis Potosí. A tasty interpretation. I enjoyed the sweet Plantains which are traditional fare.I asked to try the Sausage gravy as I was surprised to see see this being served here. I think most folks will appreciate their biscuits and gravy but I&#39;ll have to say that the absolute best gravy I&#39;ve enjoyed is at The Town Baker in Idyllwild, California.As we sat right in the trajectory of all meals I did lots of interesting plates. Id be interested in their French toast pudding bread.This is definitely a tasty joint worth checking out. I&#39;ll add that their location is perfect. It&#39;s an authentic Chicago neighborhood.

Definitely off the beaten path, the boyfriend and I were incredibly pleased with our experience. The menu is much more unique than the average brunch restaurant and we couldn&#39;t wait to try it out. There was no wait on a Sunday morning and our waiter came over right away to give us menus.After much deliberation, I went with the skirt steak skillet and the boyfriend had the pajun pancake. We were both incredibly pleased with our dishes, mine was a large portion of skirt steak over a very flavorful potato hash. The eggs, pico de gallo, avocado, and salsa rounded the dish out perfectly. Definitely order this is you&#39;re feeling hungry, I had no shot of finishing it. The other dish, the panjun pancake, was pretty phenomenal. The scallion pancake was cooked perfectly and provided a great base for the eggs and pork belly. Additionally, the brussel sprouts that came on the side rocked. They were in a soy/garlic sauce that added tons of flavor and made for a great pairing with the rest of the dish. If you&#39;re looking for something other than the typical breakfast fare, panjun pancake is the way to go.At the time that we visited Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club, it was cash only which is important to know. Prices are normal, maybe even a little below average with each dish coming in around $10.50. I anticipate that word will spread about this new spot and there will surely be a wait on a Sunday morning! Overall, I highly recommend brunch at Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club!"

Sat at the counter. Once again, a perfectly delicious experience. This time we had the lemon crab cakes (which are more like an eggs benedict) with fried potatoes/bacon and the root vegetable hash with chicken sausage/polenta. Again the fresh squeezed orange juice was incredible. Both breakfasts were perfectly cooked, lots of interesting flavors. Hash was heavy on the beets and combined well with the sausage, crepe, and sweet polenta. Crab cakes were moist and flavorful. Perfectly poached eggs. Bacon was great. Keep it up, BMBC.

The coffee is solid and they provide an appropriate amount of cream so I never had to ask for more. And refills were provided in a timely manner. I had eggs, bacon and potatoes. Yum!

We were the first people waiting, and it was a mess as they just tell you congregate around the host stand/entrance/exit.  This is poor planning and as we left it was a crowded mess. The servers showed little urgency to clear tables to drop off checks, it was annoying as there were lots of tables ready to leave.There are too many items on the menu, I felt like I was at a mini Cheesecake factory. It leads to confusion.  Brunch, breakfast, sides, lunch but on Sunday, etc, not well thought out.The content of the menu seemed interesting as there was a lot of unique blending of ingredients and styles.  However, the looks were deceiving as nothing tasted as good as it sounded.The steak skillet was a bountiful amount of food, but in the end was just kind of forgettable.I asked the server for help between the pajun pancake and the sweet potato hotcakes. The sweet potato was described as sweeter over savor so I chose that. What a let down. Literally the most boring hotcake I&#39;ve ever had. They were basically grain flavorless pancakes with chunks of sweet potato in them. Terrible dish.  The blueberries and pecans didn&#39;t go with this.  Total miss. The apple maple sausage was pretty good, but too expensive at over $1.30 per link.Maybe we got the wrong items but this is nothing more than the average generic brunch spot in Chicago, except its at least a 20 minute drive north of Chicago in the middle of nowhere.This is a skip."

Bryn Mawr Breakfast Club did not disappoint and was probably just as good as Lula Cafe.I noticed that a previous reviewer described the ambiance as &#34;urban rustic.&#34; I definitely agree. The restaurant almost looked like a modern barn.I ordered the bread pudding French toast. It was the perfect serving size. It was on top of delicious orange syrup that was probably the highlight of the dish. The French toast was covered in fresh berries and powdered sugar. I think the flavor itself was sweet...but not overpowering.My boyfriend ordered the sourdough French toast. It is a must if you are into savory breakfast dishes. It came with potatoes.The staff was very attentive.

Me trying to get her attention, her passing right by, waitresses chatting and ignoring customers - slow service-.As for the food it was typical bar fare, but very salty. Fries where lukewarm when they arrived and didn&#39;t do any better throughout the meal. 21 day burger was cooked as designated (med rare) but not with the cheddar requested (standard American) and in a standard burger bun, despite being sold as brioche, very salty. It tasted like it may have been good if it was not so salty. I&#39;ve had better meals at Burger King.On the positive the beer selection was good  (in appropriate glasses) and there was plenty of TV&#39;s with multiple games on.They were packed (likely because the slow service), but most were drinking and watching the game.I will not be back, unless it&#39;s the only place open (there&#39;s a 24h subway and dunk&#39;in doughnuts across the street)."

The jerk chicken sandwich was not very flavorful and the chicken was so dry.The mac n&#39; cheese side was not bad but not a reason to go back.

However, when I tried to order them, I was told they were out.Great, so then I asked if they had any drink specials, which they didn&#39;t have, even on a Thursday night. So I ended up paying $9 for a small glass of cabernet.I ended up ordering the buffalo wings, which was pretty standard, as well as the fried Brussels sprouts. I expected the sprouts to be breaded, but was pleased to find that they weren&#39;t; they were actually pretty good!Unfortunately, that was pretty much the only notable part of the visit.

I was introduced to First Draft by a good friend of mine. We grabbed a hi-top and had dinner as I finished moving boxes in my new place. I had a chicken parmesan sandwich that was recommended by the server that wasn&#39;t on the menu and it was good. They also had one of my favorite Belgian tripels on draft; Tripel Karmeliet!

It was last Friday around 6 PM -- we decided to get some food and beer after work. We once again got off to a rocky start -- there was nobody at the door and the place was a little over half full, with plenty of open tables, so we grabbed one. It took about 5+ minutes before anyone acknowledged we were there. We didn&#39;t complain, but the server was apologetic about the oversight. I didn&#39;t catch her name, but she took our drink order and explained that our server (Bree) was just about to begin her shift, and would take over soon.Bree was a great server and checked on us often. We ordered honey sriracha chicken wings, mussels, and beer cheese soup. The wings were very good -- hearty and not too spicy. The soup was simple but good. The mussels were a disappointment. The meat inside each mussel was much smaller than other mussels I&#39;ve had. Also the mussels were very gritty. I mentioned this to the man who cleared our plates and he apologized and said they would try to do a better job of cleaning them in the future. I had also previously asked him to put a specific baseball game on the TV nearest our table, and he went out of his way to ensure I got the correct game--I really appreciated that.I enjoyed all the beers I tried. My girlfriend tried to order a Bockor Kriek Des Jacobins, but Bree returned to our table and told us they were out of it. We explained that she liked sweet beers, and Bree recommended the Lindeman&#39;s Framboise. That turned out to be an excellent recommendation -- I&#39;ve never seen her drink a beer that fast.By the time we left, the place was quite busy, with a line at the door. People pounced on our table as soon as we stood up. I&#39;m not sure what the solution is, but I think this place needs a better system for seating. Servers are busy and can&#39;t always keep track of who just sat down. This has been a problem all three times I&#39;ve stopped in here, so I feel confident that these weren&#39;t just isolated incidents. The food is definitely a step up from typical bar food, but works better as appetizers than a full meal. But the beer list is where this place really shines. This is definitely a bar first and foremost, so I probably should manage my expectations about the food and service. The employees really are great despite seeming a little overworked most of the time, so I&#39;ll give it 4 stars despite some of the frustrations I&#39;ve outlined here."

Moderate hoppy nose.  Intense piney Chinook, Mosaic, and Simcoe hopping well balanced against toasty malt.  The producer describes the effect as &#34;dank,&#34; a description which wouldn&#39;t have occurred to me."

Everything I&#39;ve ever eaten from here has been delicious, ranging from Sunday brunch, to late night pizza and wings. They also have a great selection of draft beers that literally has something for everyone.One problem I have with this place is it is SO loud. Like, all of the time, but especially on game days. I have been here for Bears games before and it&#39;s literally like so loud you can&#39;t even here the person sitting next to you talk unless they yell in your ear. Even my boyfriend who is die hard sports anything and would choose listening to any game over listening to me thinks it&#39;s too loud. And not to keep hammering, but it&#39;s loud in the piercing kind of way.Now that I&#39;ve made myself sound like a crotchety old geezer, let me continue the trend by saying that prices are pretty steep here. While you do get good quality of food, and there are many craft beers here you may not find everywhere, I still find it kind of crazy that every time my guy and I come here for pizza and beers we somehow always end up spending $70+ after all is said and done.Service goes either way. Sometimes it&#39;s really great, sometimes it&#39;s less than stellar, and generally everyone kind of seems to have an emo attitude - not that they are bitchy or rude, just they don&#39;t exactly seem excited to be there.All in all, definitely good food, and could be a great place with some changes, but regardless, since it&#39;s in the &#39;hood, we continue to visit First Draft for a change of pace."

That&#39;s mostly on me. The fries were excellent and crisp.This is not a huge place but there are TVs literally everywhere you could possibly move your eyes. So if you&#39;re looking for a place to watch a game, or just have a great beer and chill, you could do a whole lot worse, especially in a rather nondescript area of Chicago."

Needless to say this place has it all, even the buffalo chicken sandwich of my dreams! Their beer selection is definitely the best of the bars in the immediate area, and everything on the menu looked great.

I&#39;m not sure if they thought i was waiting for someone (i went solo), but it took a good 5-8 minutes till i even got a &#34;hi&#34; and offered to get a drink.Not sure if they did this on purpose, but under the bar has outlets!

The food wasn&#39;t very good. We both chose a Cobb salad, which sounded great on the menu. The salad was small, and had a large pile of very raw, very stinky onions.

We arrived around 5:00 and found a half-full, welcoming space with plenty of room. We were offered a window seat and quickly got full menus, which boasted day-of specials for Bulls and Hawks games. Several TVs showed a variety of sporting events, and our high-top table was surprisingly roomy and comfortable. The bar filled up later, so I recommend grabbing a table before 6 on Friday nights.Our server was friendly but confused not only about when the specials happened (she wasn&#39;t aware there was a Bulls game that night) but which beers were offered at $4. We asked her to list them and she mentioned a few then vaguely pointed to our menus. Most of her sentences ended with sound effects. She seemed to infer that any 16oz beer would be offered at $4, so some of the ones I ended up ordering were full price. Not only that, they were served in 12oz glasses, which was confusing and disappointing.The food was worth our time, though. The honey-sriracha porksicles were tender and lovely with just the right amount of heat. Our salads were packed with spinach instead of what most restaurants do - iceberg - so they were a really great pick. And the pizza came out fresh and hot - they even modified it slightly so we could get the spicy condiment on only half!Overall, this is worth a try. Just do some hard-core investigating on the specials so you&#39;re not surprised when the bill comes."

Normally we&#39;d wander and see where we ended up, but it was pouring outside with no sign of stopping. We ducked under a construction awning and pulled up Yelp, and First Draft sounded like an excellent place to kill time.When we arrived, there were only a couple people at the bar and a large table full at the back, so we didn&#39;t feel like we needed to rush at any time to clear the table.We started with a couple of drinks and poutine - fries, beer gravy, queso, and brisket. The fries were a bit undercooked but the rest of the dish was tasty. We had another drink and chit-chatted and watched the ten TVs in our vicinity - this would be a great place to watch a game. After another hour or so we decided to put in our dinner order. My boyfriend built his own burger, and I went with the Southern Fried Chicken sandwich, subbing cheddar for American.Delicious. The chicken was moist, the cheddar melty, and the pickles crisp. The fries were much better this time, though I only ate a few due to my previous poutine gorge and being full from the large sandwich and drinks beforehand.Customer service at First Draft was great - our server was attentive but wasn&#39;t pushing us to order or move along. On our way, I flagged down a bus boy and asked if he could get us two large trash bags for the rain. He did, and they were a life-saver until we found ponchos (and, frankly, a boon even after - the poncho/garbage bag combo ended up being crucial).If you have time to kill, First Draft is first choice."

If that&#39;s truly the case then it doesn&#39;t speak well for Chicago, as where I&#39;m from in SE Michigan there are a number of bars with more extensive lists. With that being said, the list here WAS quite solid and the prices were reasonable considering the location. I would not hesitate to drink here again. In fact, I drank here no less than three times during my recent weekend long trip to the Windy City.The service was always cordial and one late night bartender was extremely friendly. The kind of guy you could easily shoot the shit with all night if things were slow. I dug the decor as well. Kind of like an unpretentious sports bar with lots of hard woods a la a converted prefab Irish pub.I ordered some lunch one day of the food menu. The &#34;first DRAFT&#34;. By the menu description I thought it was going to be some sort of BLT-like creation with a fried egg and beer cheese and some other over-indulgent crap on it. As soon as I ordered it the bartender asked how I wanted it cooked. Then it dawned on me I had just ordered a freaking 1/2 lb burger loaded with everything but the kitchen sink. It was pretty darned tasty but truthfully would have been better suited to the end of the night, too soak up the tail end of a bender, than it would have been as a lunchtime gut bomb. Duly noted for next time."

So, thanks yelpers! This is a really fun bar! There are TVs everywhere, and on a Saturday night I didn&#39;t know where to look there were so many games happening at once. A host took our name down for a table which is better than most bars where you have to stake out and fight for a table. While we waited we grabbed a few beers. Bar was a good amount of people, but not people on top of you so it was fun but comfortable. There was a huge beer list to choose from, like several pages, but was surprisingly affordable with lots of beers in the $5-$6 range.Once we were seated, the waitress was super nice. We ended up ordering a few more beers and got the wings and brussel sprouts. The wings were very good, they fry them and grill them I guess so they have a good semi crunchy feel. I&#39;d recommend the Chicago flavor, kind of a sweet bbq. The brussel sprouts were pretty good, but I dunno I thought they were pretty average contrary to popular yelp opinion. The waitress suggested Wisconsin spiggetes (spelling?) which are a fried cheese type thing, so you might wanna try that.I&#39;d definitely recommend this place, especially if you are a sports fan.

I really like that their menu is broken up by styles and what is popular in the bar at the time. Also the beers are served in specific glasses for the style of beer which will enhance the flavor and experience.The only food item we tried were the fried cheese curds and they were pretty good.  Large curds with a heavy batter but it was suitable for the size of the curds.  Decent ranch but not spectacular.If I end up in Chicago again this would probably be my Sunday sports bar of choice."

The beer selection of &#34;draft&#34; beer is amazing. I was here in December and enjoyed a couple off their 12 Days of Christmas list. Santa&#39;s Little Helper was a perfect draft to enjoy the ambiance and glace over the menu. Once my food order came,  I switched over to a very refreshing Christmas Ale.The special of the night was a Meatball Sandwich with a side of Mac-n-Cheese. I was in the mood for a burger, but being a fan of MnC I choose the special for my dinner. The sandwich was a fairly typical meatball sandwich. It was five hearty balls on a lightly toasted hoagie bun with marinara sauce and melted mozzarella cheese. The sandwich was so filling, I finally had to give up on eating the bun and just pick out the balls with a fork. Very tasty. I normally don&#39;t order a meatball sandwich, but I wouldn&#39;t mind having this one again.The star of the nightly special was the side of Mac-n-Cheese. I knew ahead of time and the waitress told me, they are known for their MnC. Once it was in front of me, it had me with the noodle they use. Skroodles as I call them, the curly spiral spared noodles are my favorite. They were heavily and evenly covered with a cheddar cheese sauce. The noodles were done al dente and served up in a black cast iron dish. This was what I think of when I want Mac-n-Cheese.The staff was attentive and friendly.  Which truly gave First Draft the old school, neighborhood feel.

Well, I would have if the server could have been bothered to serve me.My group of friends went here on the Fourth of July after our Booze Cruise. I know, I know, drunk obnoxious idiots on a holiday. The worst. I completely agree. However we are in our 30s and have learned a thing or two about booze and sun and day drinking. That being said, we came in waves and sat at different tables. The owner approached me and three of my friends and pointed out that one girl was too drunk and couldn&#39;t be served. I agreed with him, said I&#39;d put her in a cab. We seemed to have a dandy understanding and went about our business. He also mentioned another two friends of mine looked over-served too, which I brushed off because they hadn&#39;t even had as much to drink as me, yet he saw me as the reasoner.With McDrunky in the cab, my friends and I joined another table of friends and chatted. The owner comes over to me and says he told me my other friends were suppose to leave, too. Sorry, but I don&#39;t work in your bar, bud. I&#39;m not your bouncer, and don&#39;t think for a second I&#39;m going to be. I sent my drunk friend home because I&#39;m a good friend and she needed to leave. But my other friends were fine. He started raising cane and said they wouldn&#39;t be served. Well no problem there, sir, because no one could get served!My friends at the table had already ordered food, so I flagged down the server and asked her if I could place an order. With the snottiest attitude she could muster, she responded, &#34;I already took a bunch of orders.&#34; Okayyyyy.... congratulations? What the actual hell. I mentioned I got to the table late and would appreciate putting in another order and said I didn&#39;t mind if my food came out later. No silverware, no water, no drinks, and no check back to see if everything was okay later, and I was dying of sodium intake because all of the food was so overly salted it was inedible.I checked with friends at other tables, and they all agreed their meatballs, pizza, sandwiches and fries were all grossly over-salted. We took that as a sign were not welcome there, paid our tab, and hit the door.The South Loop comes up scarce on good bars, and the corner of Clark and Harrison is just as desolate in my opinion."

Then, we waited almost an hour for our entrees, a sandwich and a salad. No one was really ordering food, and there wasn&#39;t much of a crowd, but all of a sudden four tables worth of food just come pouring out of the kitchen. Including one table that ordered their food maybe ten minutes before their food was delivered.To top it off, his sandwich was not cooked properly. Our waitress could tell we were disappointed and took it back. She came out abut five minutes later with a totally fresh sandwich. Not sure why it took an hour the first time.The manager was drinking at the bar. The servers and staff were sipping from Starbucks cups, standing around. And we never got a decent apology.It was our second time there after a very pleasant first trip.

First Draft has tons of beers on tap that will please any pallet. In addition to all the beer (as if any place could ever need much more than copious amounts of beer), their food was delicious. I went with the meatball sandwich and a side of mac and cheese, while my buddy tried the fried chicken sandwich and fries. Generous portions, tons of flavor, and everything arrived to the table nice and hot. To me, that&#39;s a very underrated aspect of any meal. Get it to me hot, please.Fun atmosphere, rivers of beer, and excellent food. Job well done, First Draft."

The place itself was clean and the large windows allowed for some great street watching. Why did i give this place 5 stars? Because the bartenders. 2 females behind the bar offered great conversation while we were there. i wish i could write more but like i said only stopped in for a Bloody Mary.

Perhaps other locations are like this in the south loop but I haven&#39;t ventured in this area so I can&#39;t really say. All they have is a small flip folding sign on the ground in the front. The front of the building is unassuming and does not stand out amongst the buildings. I would suggest a larger sign with some moving lights or something. This will help draw more attention.Once I found this sign I was quite nervous. Looking from the outside it did not look like this would be the place where I would want to watch the Triple Crown attempt and game 2 of the WCF.I will admit I was wrong.Once inside, I realized that this was a legit sports bar. They had a modern open interior with plenty of televisions for viewing. Bar space and &#34;booths&#34;/tall boy tables are inviting for groups. I didn&#39;t have anything off of the menu but others in my group seemed to be happy with the selection as well as the drink options. Bud light and a round of fireball shots was good for me.A couple notes for improvement:The audio for the live sporting events was slightly off and this is something that didn&#39;t ruin the experience but was noticeable. Audio for the horse race started late and the audio to and from commercial breaks during the Hawks game was not smooth. These are things that  a sports bar should be good at. But maybe they are not a sports bar on the regular and I have this place completely confused. If they were a regular bar acting as a sports bar then I could understand and I would say the did a decent job.Service was good but I felt like it could be a little friendlier. It was above average but it took a while for the staff to get involved with us through friendly banter. A shot loosened them up but it only benefits the bar if you get people having a good time and wanting to come back to see familiar faces."

Been wanting to go here for a while and just got around to it tonight. Atmosphere was good and the beer list was more than anyone could ask for.There was a slight accident with our pizza (not the restaurants fault) and they made us a brand new one even though most of the other one was fine.They also have a really good special for when the Blackhawks and bills are playing!

The new owners stuck a sports bar in it and kept all the draft lines, adding some windows and removing the cheesy rock n&#39; roll decor. Minor improvements, and they also put in a nice custom back bar.Service at the bar was a bit of a hassle. It took almost 20 minutes to get a drink when the bar was half empty. They were out of the first 2 beers I ordered, then weren&#39;t sure if I could order a beer smaller than a pint just to try it. After seeing a flight of beers on the bar, they remembered they do flights, so i&#39;d have to order 4 beers at a time. I asked for 3 and a dealer&#39;s choice, which turned out to be Founders Project Pam, which was not good. Maybe they were new, i&#39;ll give the frazzled bartender the benefit of the doubt.Didn&#39;t try the food, but it looks like your average fried pub grub. The beer selection was good, and i&#39;d return another time but my experience didn&#39;t make the greatest first impression. 3.5 stars."

They are seriously underseasoned and soggy and bland AF. Very disappointing  for someone who misses that delicious East Coast flavor!!The poutine is super delicious and really enjoyable.  Classic poutine with a twist.  So yummy.The best part is definitely the amazing beer selection.  The servers and bartenders are well informed on the beer, so you can ask questions about it if you can&#39;t decide form the MANY, frequently rotating options on draft.  It&#39;s a lot of fun to pick and try new beers!The service is good, the servers are friendly, but it&#39;s always busy which means it can be hard to get the attention of your server when you need it."

It has a gemload o&#39;unique &amp; craft beers on draft, many from local Chicago breweries. If ya can&#39;t decide which draft to try first, ya can&#39;t go wrong with my local fave brewski, Cross of Gold brewed by Chicago&#39;s own Revolution Brewing Company. It&#39;s a golden ale, &#34;RB&#39;s Bud Lite&#34; with a nice lil hop, skip &amp; a jump &amp; is $6 an ice cold draft at First Draft. If beer isn&#39;t your preferred poison, don&#39;t fret ya can still have a gem time &amp; get tipsy cuz FD offers a wide selection of spirits &amp; other liquor too.First impressions count &amp; I heart the window display at FD which is a lil shrine o&#39;memorabilia in honor of the late, great former Chicago Cubs player, Ernie Banks aka Mr. Cub (see my pic). RIP Mr. Cub &amp; brownie points to First Draft for making a gemriffic 1st impression!The interior of FD is pretty spacious &amp; has a very charming modern, art deco kinda decor with a wooden bar &amp; wooden high tops, tin ceiling &amp; my fave: exposed, Chicago brick walls. FD is a nice, pretty laid back/chillax kinda bar &amp; is super clean, including the bathrooms! There are also lotsa TVs throughout the place, gemtastic for viewin&#39; your fave Chi-sporting event!I&#39;ve only had drinks at FD but the menu seems pretty gemmy with your standard bar fare of burgers, pizza, wings, various sammies &amp; assorted apps. Looks like yummy grub as a late-night snack, HH app, or game-day meal!Service at FD is pretty first-rate based on my drinking experience here. Our server was friendly, quick &amp; capable of making beer recs off the beer list! Only gripe I have was the group at the bar that was shouting loudly! They were playing some kinda game?! This friggin&#39; obnox-ass screamin&#39; shoulda been ix-nayed! This isn&#39;t a dive bar where I would tolerate or expect such annoying BS nor was I in the mood to listen to it!Sans the gamers&#39; shouting, I overall enjoy First Draft. It&#39;s gotta great cozy, neighborhood feel to it with lotsa gemmy booze &amp; character without bein&#39; a dump! So if you&#39;re in Printer&#39;s Row o&#39;Chicago or you&#39;re headin&#39; back to da burbs &amp; ya need a cold one but don&#39;t know where to go, I recommend stoppin&#39; by First Draft for your 1st, 2nd or last draft!"

On Tuesday they have half price wings, which come in three flavors (all excellent).

We were lucky to score at least one chair at the end of the bar for the wife while I stood to enjoy my beers. She opted for a bourbon, knob creek, if I remember correctly. The bourbon selection was fairly standard with no real great finds for two bourbon snobs. I was there to try some local beers hopefully and they were up to the challenge.Overall, they had a good beer selection and at decent prices. The first local beer that I had was described as a hoppy Belgian style saison. It fell flat on all those descriptions. My next beer more than made up for it. It was call Morning Wood from Local Option and had this great coffee flavor to an Amber/Red ale. Overall service was a little chaotic, but I will say that the atmosphere was lively.

Yeah, definitely. (Though I just wish they had opened before I moved out of the dorm across the street, but alas. I&#39;m sure my wallet&#39;s thankful that they didn&#39;t.)They have a truly mind boggling amount of draft beer on their menu in a wide variety of styles and will even mix beers for you (which I definitely recommend in some cases. They don&#39;t have Lagunitas&#39;s cappucino stout right now, but when they did, mixing it with a vanilla porter was my go-to if I didn&#39;t want to try something new).

We waited 20 minutes after we ordered our drinks to order our food---meanwhile, our waitress went to another table at least 5 times while we sat and waitedThe food is also very sub par. The fried pickles are pickle spears which is the worst. The pretzel bun I received was completely ripped in half so I had to eat my burger with a fork and knife!Everyone raves about the draft selection---two beers that I ordered were no longer served!It was just one thing after another here. Do not recommend.(Bus boy was lovely)"

We were looking for lunch at a bar near a conference we were at, and we sort of went mostly based off of location. But wow did we get lucky!The bar looks really clean, it has a great vibe and they played good music. The waitress/bartender was super friendly and attentive! They had an amazing beer list and the bartender was knowledgeable about them to boot.Now on to the food... Which was delicious. I had the first draft burger, and let me tell you, that beer cheese is amazing! My boyfriend had the 34 Hanger steak sandwich, which he practically inhaled it was so good. I think the best part about the food was how well the burger and steak were cooked. We like our meat on the medium-rare to rare side and it&#39;s hard to find places that actually cook it like that, and First Draft certainly did!I would definitely recommend this place! It was the first place we went to eat at in Chicago and it definitely started the trip off right!"

I&#39;ve been told 20 minutes and waited over an hour for a bigger table, been told 10 and waited 40 just for 2 of us. Often no wait for a table at all, though, and there is a long bar for seating as well."

That&#39;s it. Yet despite its short menu, this restaurant is quite popular and enjoys a steady clientele.Every item in the menu is carefully chosen, each and every one I tried was great! But great in a simple, non-sophisticated way: a rare gift nowadays.All starts are fabulous and would confidently suggest any, but if I had to choose I&#39;d go for the lamb hashwi. The steak salad had a great spicy kick, totally unexpected but well appreciated. The burger was great too!In a restaurant with so little options to choose from, the kitchen takes a big risk.

It was our first time and, while we enjoyed ourselves, there were a few opportunities for improvement.To begin, the hostess never really greeted us properly because she was on the phone. Granted, she was on with a potential reservation but I think people who are actually there in person always take precedence over someone on the phone especially when we had reservations also.A server spotted the situation and walked over to help so the restaurant deserves some kudos for him. Once we were seated, we were introduced to Martez, our server, and he was great. He knew the menu and made some good recommendations.We had a hummus spread, steelhead trout appetizer and split a burger. The burger was amazing for me but undercooked for my lady although she enjoyed the hummus and trout quite a bit.We were in a bit of a rush (dinner and movie night) and Shane, the manager, came over to check on us a few times, which is always appreciated!Prices were reasonable and the atmosphere is nice so we will definitely give Bernie&#39;s another shot."

We were lucky enough to get a group table on the rooftop for our early Sunday afternoon meal. Their brunch menu is pretty lite on option but the options look pretty good. I went with the Fried Egg Sandwich which was decent and a pretty nice portion. The sandwich included avocado, bacon, cheddar &amp; hot sauce on farm bread. I washed everything down with some grapefruit mimosas...nice!View is nice...not too high up but still nice and good for pics! Music playlist was nice as they had some hits rocking.

I also love their rooftop dining. I also really adore their happy hour menu. Beyond those features, though, Bernie&#39;s was just ok in my book.A few of my girlfriends and I made a reservation at Bernie&#39;s for a nice catch up dinner a few weeks back. We enjoyed a $5 happy hour drink (I went with the Moscow Mule - a tastier choice that the bubbles or the white) and then headed upstairs where we shared a long table with another group of ladies. We were asked beforehand if this was ok and we said sure, we&#39;re friendly.Our server was enthusiastic and helpful and we ordered a variety of eats to share among the three of us. Here&#39;s where things went a little south - throughout the night we were constantly getting the wrong dishes put in front of us or moved between our group and the other group at our table. I&#39;m more than fine sharing space but the number of times things were incorrectly set down and moved back and forth was comical. The food itself was hit or miss. The burger was fantastic - flavorful and substantial. The hamachi was Barbie sized at best. The falafel desperately needed more sauce. The patatas bravas were delightful. The avocado salad was mediocre and could have used more pizzazz. The rooftop is on the loud side, but it&#39;s rooftop dining - I expected that.If you&#39;re headed to Bernie&#39;s - grab a seat on their beautiful rooftop and order the burger. That would be a delightful combo!"

I am very picky with sangria and it was honestly the best i have ever had. I want to take jugs home with me regularly.Food wise, my group order 6 (seriously) rounds of french fries (So great and comes with a mayo dip), the eggplant dip, and the tomato toast.All were amazing.

Still heard dinner is better. But brunch was awesome. We had a group of 10 on a Sunday morning with reservations- which I do recommend making ahead of time! We saw groups with kids, groups celebrating a baby shower, so many families and friends gathered! Nestled in River North- I was happy to enter the ambiance of natural lights, beautiful brass displays, and teal furniture. With a hipster 50&#39;s feel with vintage decor, the restaurant was so inviting. Our waiter began talking about the chef, the restaurant group, Detroit and it&#39;s Mediterranean influences brought to Chicago, and his history of working as a server and you can see his delight for serving us and repeating the menu on both sides of the table in the loud and chatty restaurant.Don&#39;t let the &#39;small plates&#39; and &#39;large plates&#39; fool you on size- all the plates are graciously perfect in size the large is like extra large and the small is like a good medium size entree. We got lamb hashwi which seems to be popular in other yelp reviews for the table. The small minced pieces of lamb were paired perfectly with rich and velvety hummus and soft and thick pita bread. The potatoes bravas added a homey comfort as we also shared that at the table. I got the ciabatta toast with guacamole and it was nice, heavy in a good way, and a healthy way to start my morning. Service was excellent! I thought it would be slow reading the other Yelp reviews but as they are a new restaurant and working on their perks- they may be getting better! A great visit."

So, we all decided to give it a go this past Sunday. We met for brunch, had reservations, and were excited about the prospects.The excitement quickly turned to frustration, as the meal was truly just a comedy of errors.I&#39;ll start with some good: the restaurant has a great atmosphere. I loved the open kitchen in the back, the hip industrial-ish interior, the bar. That&#39;s where the good ends, unfortunately.Our waiter was kind, albeit a little slow. The four of us ordered a smattering of everything on the menu, which I thought was kind of limited, and the folly began.Drinks came out fast, but they were not--for the duration of the two hours we sat there--replenished. 90 minutes in, we had to stop someone and ask for more coffee/refills on our cocktails.My wife ordered a latte, but she was told that only decaf lattes were available that day.We ordered fries, which were plentiful and came out relatively quickly.Then, we waited nearly an hour for the rest of our food, growing hungry and impatient. There were lots of staff in the wings, but there didn&#39;t seem to be much attention being paid to the tables.We saw tables seated after us get their food. And we waited.Finally, food started coming. First, we got my friend&#39;s omelet, which she ordered without cheese. It had cheese. She sent it back and it wouldn&#39;t reappear for 25 minutes, despite our asking about it numerous times.I should mention that the omelet had sat under the plate warmer for a good 10+ minutes, which the runner admitted, flippantly.We got the bacon. It was limp, room temperature, and super fatty. Sent it back.We got the fruit and whipped ricotta, based on the waiter&#39;s recommendation, and the fruit was far from prime. Unripe pineapple. Citrus.We got the burger, which my friend asked to be served on a salad. The waiter even repeated and confirmed her request. It wasn&#39;t served on--or with--a salad. They corrected that pretty quickly.We got the tomato bread with cheese and ham. It came out without ham. &#34;Doesn&#39;t this have serrano ham on it?&#34; I asked the manager who&#39;d begun trying to troubleshoot our order. &#34;Oh yeah, let me get you some!&#34; She replied. Minutes later, she brought ham on a plate.We got the French toast, which they forgot to bring and which arrived 10 minutes after all of the other food. It was room temperature, too.The general manager finally arrived at the end of our meal, and he was very apologetic. At that point, though, so many things had gone wrong--and without much graciousness or acknowledgement from the other staff--that our brunch was spoiled, and we were all convinced we wouldn&#39;t be back.I have to say, the most disappointing factor was that, even once all of the food arrived--and was corrected--it was underwhelming. At the end of the folly and waiting, I wish we would have at least been rewarded with a delicious meal.In all fairness, they did end up comping a good portion of our meal, but we still paid around $60 for what was essentially a wasted 2 hours, and we left hungry.I hate to write such a bad review of a new-ish place, but our experience was truly packed-full of just about every single thing that could have possibly gone wrong."

An entire weekend at Bernie&#39;s!! This place, though. Insert heart emoji here.We walked in @ 5:15 on a beautiful, sunny, 65 degree Thursday evening. It was empty inside and I mean EMPTY. I asked for a table for two in the patio and they said all the tables upstairs were reserved but they had space @ the upstairs bar. I decided to give it a go. The hostess took me up there. There were like 10 open tables and no seats at the bar. I then asked the server, &#34;umm, ALL of these tables are for reservations?&#34; She said yes. Dumbfounded, I was like, wtf? and agreed to go back downstairs to sit and eat in a completely empty restaurant. But the relentless Cuban b*tch in me wasn&#39;t going to give up that easily!I opened up my OpenTable app and saw that there was a 5:30 reso available. I booked that ish with the quickness and walked back up to the server. I told her that I now had a reservation and that I&#39;m requesting to sit at one of the tables on the patio. She laughed at my slick move. Lol. I get what I want! This pissed me off because I know damn well they could have seated before I made the OpenTable reso. But the reviews are so good here that I was determined.Okay, now to the important stuff:DRINKS - white sangria: MUST. best I&#39;ve ever had, hands down. And for $5 (during HH) I sipped on quite a few that night! Great deal.FOOD - lamb hummus: DO IT. that bread alone is superb.Pan con tomate: PASS. Not bad just nothing extraordinary.Chicken: WOW. rarely and I mean RARELY do I order poultry @ a pricey restaurant. I feel like poultry is for pu**ies in these instances. But their chicken, man, oh man!  WOW. just wow. MUST ORDER. So juicy and flavorful - the only way this girl eats her meat bruhaha (insert dirty joke here).Service was slow as we had a server-in training. Pain in the butt but I felt bad for her so I gave her the benefit of the doubt.Crowd was awesome! I would say mostly everyone here (during HH at least) were in their 30s or 40s, looking to relieve work-related stress, in business attire. I loved that it was a sophisticated, older crowd. No 21 year olds welcome. Ha.In short, just go! Get that damn chicken thigh in your mouth STAT."

And with the cute interior and fabulous roof top, you should do more than look, you need to stop in and enjoy some friendly service, very good food and people from the neighborhood who are clearly thrilled that Bernies is in town.I brought a gang of 10 for brunch so we had the opportunity to try most of the brunch menu as well as some of their fabulous crafted cocktails.  I sat at the bar to wait for the group and had a spicy Bloody Mary which was rich in horseradish and packed a wallop.The brunch menu has a good mixture of breakfast and lunch options.  If you order nothing else, order the maple sticky bun.  I am still drooling for that thing which we cut up into tiny pieces to share with my inner voice screaming the whole time, &#34;It&#39;s mine . . .It&#39;s mine&#34;!The winners at our table seemed to be the fried egg sandwich with avocado and parmesan, the croque madame (although there was a little too much sauce on mine), the burger, the eggs benedict and the torrija (a take on fresh toast but better!).  Each is served with a salad  and each is a very good sized portion.The specialty cocktails all come with cute names (so cute I can&#39;t remember any of them or was it because I had too many of them?  Hmmmm ), and we sat at the bar after brunch to catch up while the guys watched the game on the TV that was there.The ambiance is light with huge factory style windows letting in plenty of natural light.  And the open kitchen in the back as well as all the little touches (like the belt buckles on the bar shelving) let me know that there was a ton of thought that went into building Bernie&#39;s.Parking on this side of Orleans is always easy so if you drive you should be able to find street parking.  And I&#39;m hopeful that they have a vestibule on order as we were seated by the door on a perfect Indian Summer day, but I would hate to be in that same seat in January!  And the prices are reasonable, brunch with drinks ran about $30 a person.Now if I could only get my car to stop trying to turn into Bernies to get another one of those maple sticky buns . . . . . . .hmmm . . . .I see a parking spot.  Perhaps I&#39;ll just stop in just this once."

I made a noon reservation for Sunday brunch for two friends and I. I arrived late, but my friends were seated, and had already chatted with our waiter. When I arrived, he came back to the table and took our drink orders--we all ordered coffee. Our waiter was friendly and excited that it was our first time visiting the restaurant. He told us a lot about the sister restaurant, Gus&#39;s Chicken, which I thought was funny since we weren&#39;t dining there, but alas, back to Bernie&#39;s.I ordered the Croque Madame, and though I&#39;d never had one (at least not one that was memorable), I figured I couldn&#39;t go wrong, as I like all the ingredients. My friends had the egg sandwich and the wedge salad. When my dish arrived, I was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of gruyere that was melted on top of the sandwich. It was drowning in a cheese sauce and though it didn&#39;t make the sourdough bread soggy, it was just too much.My friend enjoyed her salad, but my friend who ordered the egg sandwich was also a bit overwhelmed in how to eat it, as it was so large. He ended up taking it apart and eating it with a fork, but he seemed to enjoy it.What was perhaps the most concerning was the amount of time that we had to wait after we&#39;d received our orders. Our water glasses were empty and our coffees were cold before our waiter ever returned to our table. I understand that we weren&#39;t the only table he was taking care of, but it was a bit unnecessary to have to wait as long as we did.Overall, I would go back to Bernie&#39;s and get something entirely different at brunch, and I&#39;d even try dinner there, as many items on the menu sounded good. I&#39;d just suggest easy on the sauce for the Croque, cheaper coffee, and more attentive service."

They have, what I consider the best Happy Hours (from 4 to 7) in River North. I uploaded a photo of the menu. The food is different and outstanding. Order the Lamb Hashwi. It&#39;s like Hummus on steroids....or steroids (in the form of delicious lamb) on Hummus! Their rooftop patio is big and offers outstanding views of the city. The patio is partially covered so it can also be enjoyed even if the weather is less than great. Bernie&#39;s location is in the heart of River North, so it is definitely a popular spot. The patio fills up fast, so get there early if you want a seat."

Bernie&#39;s Lunch and Supper does not play around with a dozen fancy ingredients to make some new and innovative combination of flavors. Instead, chef Zack Sklar&#39;s relatively compact menu offers simple, delicious food - executed perfectly.Example: the roasted chicken with patatas bravas was perfection. Chicken was ridiculous tender and juicy, the potatoes were crispy on the outside with a very tasty tomato sauce.I don&#39;t want to talk about the ambience (which is lively), nor the staff (which was friendly and helpful), nor the the cocktail list (which was excellent). I just want to implore you to come here to get perfectly executed, deliciously simple food."

They have great happy hour food &amp; drink specials with everything under $5. The lamb hashwi, which was essentially hummus and lamb schwarma with toasted pita, was a really great app to start with.Other highlights of the menu were:- The sweet potato gnocchi: gahhhhhhh, I am not usually a gnocchi person (low on my list of favorite pastas) but this gnocchi was like eating clouds (and combined with the mushrooms and truffle sauce, DAMN).  Favorite dish of the night.- Veal meatballs: I am always on the quest for the perfect meatball and this one was pretty fantastic. The meat was tender and flavorful and paired with a great red sauce.Our server was pretty cool too and contributed to the overall laid-back vibe of the restaurant. The space is versatile and would be great for friends/parents/bringing your boo out.Would definitely come back to try more of the menu at Bernie&#39;s! Oh and they are based out of Detroit too."

It is so gorgeous upstairs, we could have sat there all day. We were seated at a large 4 top, 3 people to start and then a couple more joined later.We started with mimosas, and we did not receive menus. Our waitress came over and asked us very nicely if we wouldn&#39;t mind moving to a smaller table, they had a larger party coming in that would fit better at our table, no problem, we were happy to move. She told us as she helped us move that she would send us a complimentary round of drinks for the trouble, awesome. And the new table was in a better spot, so that was great.Once we moved, it was like we didn&#39;t exist. Our drinks never came and our water was empty, we were chatting and didn&#39;t notice at first until I looked at my phone and realized it had been 25 minutes since we moved tables and we still didn&#39;t have drinks or menus.I went up to the nearest waiter and asked for the manager, they immediately came over and apologized for the error, the waitress told our new server that we were his table, but the new sever forgot we were in his section. Even after this it still took a bit for menus and drinks to arrive. We were a table of girls, we would have already downed about 4 mimosas each at this point, so they delay was a bit costly to them.Our new server was a bit off, not a bad attitude, but just socially awkward. He had a difficult time taking our orders, didn&#39;t have any suggestions for us, and he wasn&#39;t very fun. Not to be too picky, but come on, it was a sunny day and a table full of girls that want a boozy brunch, have fun with it.Now for the food, it was good, I ordered the fried egg sandwich, the bread was way too greasy, and it was wayyyyyy too hard for an egg sandwich. I couldn&#39;t actually take a bite of the sandwich, I had to cut it up because it was so greasy and too hard to bite with out egg splattering all over. Also it was super messy. But the flavors were nice.Overall it was a nice time, we&#39;ll def be back for the roof deck, but the experience wasn&#39;t great. I think they may be relatively new, so maybe just a few more tries to get it right."

Thankfully, we were not.I used to ride the bus by here all the time, last I recall it had been a recording studio for awhile  before it was vacant. They&#39;re really transformed the space putting in windows and brightening it up. This place is billed as Mediterranean, but it&#39;s not what one typically thinks of as Mediterranean food.We started out with a round of drinks. I enjoyed a tequila cocktail, the Fernweh and later a sangria with my dinner. I didn&#39;t like the sangria as much as my cocktail, but it was decent. I will say the cocktail menu is priced on the high side with at least one $18 drink. For our meal, we decided to do a variety of small plates; with one pescatarian and one vegetarian in the group, we made some modifications so that we could all try as much as possible.We ordered the hummus with the lamb on the side, falafel, avocado toast, beets and burrata salad, crudo, cauliflower, and veal meatballs. The best dishes we ate were the hummus,  falafel, meatballs (so I&#39;m told), and cauliflower. The &#34;bread&#34; served with hummus and falafel was delicious; I think we all would&#39;ve devoured a basket full of the stuff. The crudo was average with the salad and avocado toast being C dishes at best. The avocado toast was bland; a dish I make myself when I&#39;ve got some avocado I need to use up, I think I do a better job. The common refrains heard while we ate the salad were &#34;where are the beets?&#34; &#34;did we get any burrata?!&#34; For a salad called beets and burrata, both ingredients were noticeably scant. If you&#39;re considering this dish, I recommend you pass on it.To finish up our meal, we got two desserts - the bananas foster sundae and the warm cookies with sea salt caramel gelato. Neither dish was perfect, but the cookies/gelato was the stronger of the two. We were warned the sundae was small, but for $8 it was a joke of a portion. I had a small taste and it was good, but again the price was mismatched to the portion. The cookies were an assortment of chocolate chip and peanut butter; we got 6 cookies and our table devoured them with gusto. The peanut butter ones went so fast, I didn&#39;t get to taste them. The gelato wasn&#39;t great. One of my favorite flavors of gelato and ice cream is a sea salt based one; this lacked the pop of saltiness I&#39;ve come to expect.Overall, Bernie&#39;s is a solid dining experience. It&#39;s not a place I&#39;d rave about and say is a must go, but the service was great and they&#39;re putting out some solid food and drinks. 3.5 stars"

I went here on a Friday night and I would suggest making a reservation cause it was rather packed. We did make a reservation and were seated right away. I didn&#39;t realize that they have happy hour here Monday - Friday from 4:00pm to 7:00pm. We chose to stick to the $5.00 happy hour menu and we left rather full. I would definitely recommend getting the Lamb Hashwi. The pita bread it comes with is AMAZING. We also had the Pan Con Tomate, which was pretty good. I stuck with the $5.00 cocktail libation and the special that night was Sangria. It was delicious although it did have a cinnamon taste to it, but I&#39;m not complaining."

It is kind of an upscale industrial chic style.My 2 girlfriends and I were quickly whisked to the elevator and up to the rooftop where we once again were not disappointed.  The view was great and the stringed lights over the tables were beautiful.  We were not there when it was dark, but even at dusk it was an impressive view.Now for the food - yes!  We all ordered the white sangria which was absolutely beautiful.  It was unusual and seemed to have a hint of cinnamon.  Next we decided to order an assortment of items and share. We instructed the helpful waitress to have them sent to the table as they were ready. We started with the avocado &amp; goat cheese toast. The presentation was beautiful and the flavor was spot on.  These were quickly devoured.  Next came the french fries - these thin cut fries didn&#39;t look like they&#39;d pack much punch, but the first bite proved us wrong.  They were the perfect texture and full of flavor. Accompanied by ketchup and some kind of aoli - they were good.  Next came the Fattoush salad - this was probably my least favorite item we ordered but not bad by any means just less flavor than the rest.  For our main course we ordered the paella.  It came with full shrimps and delicious muscles. The seafood was cooked to perfection and the rice with the pickled onions and peppers - oh mah goodness - I swear we didn&#39;t leave one piece of rice on that pan.  We finished off the meal with warm peanut butter, chocolate cookies and salted caramel gelato.We took a couple pictures of the view and of the 3 of us under the cute Bernie&#39;s sign and were on our way.  A wonderful evening over all!  I will be back for sure!"

There were a number of great choices. I really recommend the roasted chicken as it was prepared perfectly. The group also tried the Bernie&#39;s cheeseburger and it was perfect for the group and it was great to share. The sweet corn was a group favorite as well as the Pan con Tomate, Lamb Hashwi and Falafel &amp; Peas.  The service was awesome and we actually took everyone of the waitress recommendations and were not disappointed. The food was enough for 5 of us to share and I assure you no one left hungry. The drinks were a group favorite with a number of options.  This is a place that I would keep going for the atmosphere and the food and of course the service .  Need a couple of better dessert options!

The food was simply amazing, it&#39;s a mix of mediterranean, spanish and french food, their warm pita with hummus and lamb was delicious, decent portion sizes and prices.The restaurant inside is gorgeous, nice decor and ambience and service was superb considering it was a busy Sunday brunch.

They take reservations so that was great! Unfortunately, their rooftop wasn&#39;t open yet... even though it was 70 in Chicago all weekend. Seriously disappointing.We were seated right away. We had to ask for the Happy Hour Menu, which seemed odd. The Draft Cocktail is a sangria. Super flavorful and delicious! I switched over to the Cocktail of the Day which was a Smirnoff Moscow Mule and it tasted like water. Disappointing. The beer choices are really cheap for Happy Hour.We also tried the Lamb Hashwi, which tasted like hummus with ground meat. The pita/bread that it came with was the highlight. Also really enjoyed the Pan Con Tomate. Fries were pretty average.Overall, great Happy Hour specials. Great vibes! Decent service. Just wish they&#39;d open up their rooftop already!"

Come with an expectation that it&#39;ll take a bit longer than you want. That is also because the happy hour deals are killer. You should basically order one of each food item and be quite happy.The food really kills it. Roasted oysters, the much-touted lamb hummus, and a minimally reviewed tomato bread are all perfect foils to the modern cocktail. On the other hand, the drinks vary. The draft sangria was delightful and punchy. The cocktails off the regular menu just lacked the strength of flavor I&#39;d hoped for.Service is also reasonable. When said backed up bartender realized he&#39;d messed up an order, he had the courtesy to comp a drink. They&#39;re clearly trying.Overall, I&#39;d give it a shot again."

More so than the avocado toast but that&#39;s because the avocado toast at The Winchester is my high bar and this did not beat that.Ive tried the egg sandwich and the corque madame - both winners.Service the second time I went kind of sucked.

I had a drink with beet, gin and rosemary and it was absolutely killer. I loved it.They had a daily special on for drinks too and I had one of those, also really good.I wanna say their happy hour menu started at like 4 or something and we ended up getting a couple of things which were all good as well.

I visited Bernie&#39;s twice in one week- the first with family and the second with friends.The first time, the service was sub par. I went with a group, made a reservation on the roof, and arrived on time. We were promptly escorted up (which was great!) but we were disappointed when our waitress knew absolutely nothing about the menu. They were out of the wine we chose and the beer one of us chose, and it took 45 minutes (we timed it) to get our final wine selection.For some reason, I came back.This time, we made a reservation with friends. It took ONE HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTES to be seated. We were naturally upset, but also understood - they were busy, right? Upon asking for the manager, and sharing our story in hopes of something (anything!), he shared no resolutions or sincere apologies. So much so, that one point, I said, &#34;so pretty much were shit out of luck?&#34; And he said &#34;yes.&#34;I am so disappointed because I love the food and drinks, but this was ridiculous.

The happy hour menu is fantastic: $5 for tons of drink options and food, and lasts til 7, AND on a gorgeous rooftop. What more could you want? BUT both times, getting up to the roof has been a nightmare! They claim to be at capacity and will only let one person in at a time, even when there are empty tables, and the rooftop is about 50% full.Yesterday we had a friend arrive at 3:30, before happy hour started, to make sure she got us a table for 4. When I showed up at 4:15, it took a lot of explaining and convincing for the hostess to let me upstairs because of &#34;capacity&#34;, regardless of my friend literally having 3 empty chairs for us at the table. The rooftop has at least 6 empty tables (I have a picture for proof) and the bar area was barely crowded. When the next of our party showed up, te hostess refused to let her up to our table, and my friend had to go downstairs to talk to them about letting her in. Our final friend showed up around 5, and same thing. When I went downstairs to get her, I got into an argument with the hostess becaus Mage absolutely refused to let her in. WE HAD A TABLE FOR 4! I tried to explain that wthe literally had her empty seat tray and she said something like if they let her up, the Fire Marshall would come. Again, I took a picture to show the empty tables and how not full it was. It took 15 minutes for the nasty, rude, hostess to roll her eyes and finally just let my friend in. I get not letting people in because of the fire code, but don&#39;t be rude, especially when you&#39;re nowhere near capacity and we&#39;ve had a table for this exact purpose.Don&#39;t even get me started on how long it took to get drinks, and the fact that my friend ordered to well vodka drinks and they used top shelf and charged her for that.Bernies, you&#39;re adorable and have great happy hour... Don&#39;t ruin it with this ridiculousness."

Came here on a whim with two girlfriends on one of the first nice, warm days in the city and was able to score a rooftop table- much due to the help of the lovely staff here- they were so accommodating and seated us as soon as a table was available. The downstairs dining room is lovely, but the roof is where it&#39;s at. As far as food goes- it&#39;s great! We ate a variety of things, but would definitely recommend the avocado toast and strozzapeti pasta! Both were so delicious. We washed it all down with a bottle (okay, two) of albarino and soaked in the sunshine and people watched! Overall, a great place to add to a list of terrific rooftops and food.

Really such a beautiful space, and especially the bar is such a modern-looking focal point that catches your eye when you first enter. Loved the chairs and seating options for dining tables as well.Service is super friendly and attentive! Very accommodating to special requests and questions.The Brussels sprouts side dish is delicious, and the olives starter is nice to munch on while waiting for your main. The meatballs are amazing, with whipped ricotta on top and a tomato sauce on the bottom , the three meatballs are perfect to share.I had the roast chicken main dish and it was great. Very tender and juicy meat with the skin full of flavor especially za&#39;atar. Yum! And the potatoes that come with the dish are the star of the show. Small whole potatoes that are soft on the inside and crispy on the outside covered with a drizzle of a garlic sauce. Soo good.I would come back here."

The food, while not having a huge selection, is unbelievably good. Once I found out they started doing happy hour though, it was game over for every other place I had previously had happy hour. Their happy hour prices are beyond reasonable, and they have lamb hashwi (my absolute favorite thing on the menu) for only $5! The staff are some of the friendliest, knowledgeable and most helpful I&#39;ve ever had in Chicago. In particular, my friends and I LOVE Jordan the bartender. Shes always attentive and super fun to talk to when it&#39;s not too busy. 5/5 for Bernie&#39;s. Oh also, the rooftop is lit."

The hostesses are so rude it is baffling- be prepared to feel judged ESPECIALLY when asking to be seated upstairs on the rooftop. The food is good. My go to is usually the &#34;build your own&#34; salad, which consistently comes out lacking a couple of the ingredients I marked off on the checklist.

Well, I&#39;m here...right now...sitting at the bar and just finished my dinner share with my friend (we were hoping to sit on the roof, but it&#39;s not open yet).For starters, the drinks and the rather limited food menu are overpriced. We shared the pasta main coarse ($21) and the scallops ($30). Both portions very small; the scallops had four pieces to the order with a total of (no joke) a full tablespoon of broccoli florets decorated in total on the plate, arranged in super tiny pieces next to each scallop.The ambiance was very loud and difficult to have a conversation...the adult contemporary / 80&#39;s music seemed inappropriate and made me feel like I was in a club or bar than a fine(er) dining establishment.I&#39;ll consider coming back for brunch and give that a whirl...but, I won&#39;t be back for dinner.One good point, the service was great!"

In all fairness the only thing that stopped me from a 4 star review was that service was on the slower side, and they weren&#39;t busy, and the heirloom tomato salad was not good. I think that had more to do with the flavor combination for me.I liked the meatballs along with the bass, sans the creamed corn. Both dishes were a hit, very well spiced and full of flavor. The drinks were very well made and wow they were easy on the purse! I haven&#39;t seen drink prices this low in awhile!

Husband and I tried it this past weekend for brunch and it did not disappoint. I have to say...I feel as if many new restaurants in Chicago seem to go through &#34;growing pains&#34; their first few months of opening....things seem to be a little haywire and unorganized etc...but Bernie&#39;s does not seem to have these pains.We had an 11:00 am reservation and as soon as we walked in (first people in the restaurant) everything seemed to be running smoothly. The atmosphere is wonderful...a nice combination of old diner and a trendy brunch spot.  The servers are friendly and the food is yummy. All cocktails are priced at $13. Hmmm...feels a little pricey but I won&#39;t hold it against them.I had the Fine Herbs Omelette and my husband+2 in laws had the fried egg sandwich. They pretty much didn&#39;t talk to me or anyone else as they finished their sandwiches in a few minutes (it seemed amazing). My omelette was very good but definitely on the simpler side. Not sure I would run there to order the omelette again before trying something else. Thankfully, there are many things on the menu I want to/need to try!The atmosphere is definitely the thing that stands our most about this place...it&#39;s so cool on the inside.

I&#39;ve walked by this place numerous times and finally got to try it out. We ordered items from the HH and regular menu. We had to ask for the HH menu which made it seem like they tried hiding it. I learned about it b/c i browsed through their website the night before. The HH menu was outstanding. There were 5 dish choices; we got the roasted oysters, olives, and pan con tomate (bread with cheese). Cocktail of the day was a vodka mix, so we opted for cocktails from their reg menu since we were feeling fancy. My friend got the Komorebi - a Japanese whiskey drink. It was blended very well and so refreshing. I got the Vorfreude - a gin based drink with a number of ingredients; it was delicious and also refreshing. Every Yelp review praised the Lamb Hashwi, so we went with that even though we were wary of the lamb. We don&#39;t like the gamey taste that normally comes with it. Now that i think of it, the dish was also on the HH menu so we must&#39;ve had a brain fart for not realizing it, but i&#39;m not sure why our server didn&#39;t point that out and charge the HH price instead. Note: everything was $5 on the HH menu. The portions are smaller, but still enough. For instance, there&#39;s 3 pieces of oysters vs. 6 on the reg menu. The amount of food was just right for two. Flavors were robust and food was finger smacking good!Warning: i really wanted to give this place 5 stars for the food and cocktails. But, not being forthcoming about the HH menu was a turnoff and not pointing out the dish we ordered was also on the HH menu is poor service. Keep in mind you may need to ask for the HH menu or they&#39;ll let it slide. I think that&#39;s just bad business/service ethics."

I went with a big group and tried a handful of dishes and they were hit or miss. Some were really good but others were just weird.The good:- SWEET POTATO GNOCCHI: This dish was the highlight of the meal. The mushrooms were really well cooked and went great with the truffle and sweet potato. Very truffly. Mmm mmm.- LAMB HASHWI: This dish comes with pita bread that you dip in hummus and a lamb mash. Super good. But also didn&#39;t go well with the other dishes we ordered. This place is supposed to be Mediterranean inspired but this was the only dish I had that tasted at all Mediterranean.The not so good:- ROASTED OYSTERS: Topping roasted oysters with a mushy chorizo sauce kind of defeats the purpose of roasting them at all. Texture was very bizarre.- BRUSSEL SPROUTS: These had so much potential to be great but were just WAY to sweet.The way that our waiter paced our meal sort of bothered me. We ordered a handful of small plates, medium plates, and sides to share and nearly all of the dishes came out at once. It was overwhelming and made it hard to enjoy each dish individually.From an ambiance perspective, this place nails it. Gorgeous interior. High vaulted ceilings with retro lighting fixtures. Very cute.Would maybe come back. And only order the dishes that i know are good. But am in no rush to do so."

Clancy our waiter was very friendly and provided us with great service. We ordered the veal meatballs and the falafel plate. The food was delicious however the reason I&#39;m giving this place a 3.5/5 stars is because of the prices. We paid $18 for a normal falafel plate. Again the food was good just a bit overpriced.

The beets/burrata was decent - you can&#39;t really go wrong with either of those ingredients - but for my veg sitch, I preferred the carrots/avo (romesco, almonds, grilled scallions, spinach) - the romesco was a nice, hearty touch.Despite the fact that we were all fairly stuffed by now, Ghill demanded that the table finish with the french onion sando, which was apparently v heavy on the mustardy/horseradish - for $19 it was petite - $15 would have been more fitting. The aforementioned fries also came at this point - a mound no less than 6inches high - could have been more consistently fried, with some flaccid and others quite crispy - two words that should never be used together - too salty to be enjoyed in servings larger than 7-10 potato bad boys.Ended with truly sad cookies (ginger spice, choco chip) - hard and luke warm, I didn&#39;t even want to nibble. Hard no.Service was aces - Jeff was an absolute star - super friendly, made good recommendations - though as the place got busier he kind of ghosted, but made up for it in spades when he did pop over.Ample din for 4 with 7 drinks, 9 dishes, and 1 dessert clocked in at $270ish - could be done less expensively, but when dining on the Greenhill meal plan saying no to the 7th course is never an option.Small plates $8 (olives) to $23 (gnocchi) - the $19 for the crudo was steep - should have been $15-17 - salads $11-15, veg sides $9-12 (patatas bravas, sweet corn, fries, crispy chokes), large plates $18-30 (pea falafel, striped bass, strozzapreti, roasty chicken), sandos $15-19, wood fired plates (salmon, prawns, oysters) $16-29, desserts $9ish. Overall, maybe I&#39;d return for brunch, but for din it&#39;s too all over the place - there is probably no reason that a turkey burger, cote de boeuf ($90), pickled mussels (chevre, jalapeno, basil), prawns w/ black rice, and any dish with labneh belong on the same menu. Needs more focus before I&#39;ll return for anything other than a drink and to tattoo watch on all the artfully inked waitstaff. Oh, and gets loud. Leave grandma at home."

The Heirloom Tomatoes were good but at $14 I thought it was a little pricey for a dish that was over 60% tomatoes. The Hand Cut Fries are $7 and the oversized portion did little to help with my self control, I left the meal feeling like fry oil was coming out of my pores.I hope that they continue to grow and learn, I didn&#39;t love either of the dishes we tried, but I will give them another try if not only for a glass of Rose and some rooftop hangs."

This area of RN needed it (there isn&#39;t a whole lot west of Orleans). Bernies turned a once abandoned looking black building into a hip, bright and exciting atmosphere. With summer ending and the last of the warm nights winding down, the hubby and and I decided to dine al fresco at Bernies rooftop this past Thursday. We were seated right away, to a table with views of Orleans and Erie. The rooftop not only had tables for dining, but also a full bar. Unfortunately, our weather took a turn and it began to drizzle. Luckily we (and a few other tables) were able to just move over to the bar located under a roof. Food can be described as eclectic Mediterranean. We had the lamb hashwi &amp; the heirloom tomatoes on burrata. Wow- both amazing!! For dinner we weren&#39;t too hungry so we split the cheeseburger.

The meat was chunked a little too big and the flavor was missing something- bass crudo - another one that was good but not great, flavors not distinctive enough, but the plate looked very pretty- tomato salad - winner with creamy burrata tossed with a bread and heirloom tomato salad.  Flavors were bright, well seasoned and great combination of creamy/chewy/crisp textures- ricotta gnocchi- liked but didn&#39;t love... Flavors were a little tame but the gnocchi were light and the crunch from the walnuts were a nice contrast- roasted oysters - very good, decadent, definitely one to share- roasted brussel sprouts- yum! These were a great side dish, crispy and tender- roasted chicken - ftw... surprisingly delish, simple but very flavorful and served with a side of patatas bravas that were also great- cheeseburger - so good burger, but not what I would go to bernies for ( ordered it per waiter&#39;s reco)... Cheese was nicely melted and even the bun was pretty good- chocolate cookies, blueberry cobbler sundae, olive oil cake and pie were all good and ranked in the same order as listed...Nice addition to river north, just sad i missed the rooftop, will have to add it to the list for next summer..."

Very rude, completely unwelcoming. We&#39;ve been here at least 5 times and each time the host staff has been terrible. I&#39;m not sure what their deal is, but it&#39;s always the same miserable style that seems to want to do anything except help you.Once you get past the hosts....it&#39;s a great rooftop! Happy hour deals are rock solid, $5 mules, $5 wine, and a selection of $3 beers - both craft and Hamms/High-Life. And a $3 draught cocktail.Wait stuff upstairs is pretty efficient, and although they not all that personable either, they are certainly better than the hosts.If management gets around to reading this, you should talk to your host staff because it&#39;s a very bad first impression for your establishment."

Well, we weren&#39;t planning on it but that was just an off way to be greeted.  She said we had to wait because they had to find chairs.  That was strike number two and I&#39;d been there for about 14 seconds.  So we went upstairs and she went to another group that must not have had a reservation (and in all fairness I&#39;m sure they were warned that when the reservation came in, they&#39;d have to give up their seats, which they likely conveniently forgot) and advised that she would need to take their chairs.  So we needed two more chairs; she took one.  We stood there waiting for another, which never came.  So one of my companions walked over to another large group where there was an empty chair and asked if he could take it and they politely obliged.  The other group was clearly not happy about the chair situation.  Fast forward to now we all have seats and are comfortable.  We ordered drinks, which took a while but about the expected amount of time for how crowded the place was.  What was strange is we got the happy hour menu and decided on some snacks and got the lamb hashwi, fries and chicharonnes.  The chicharonnes showed up in about 2 minutes before we even had our drinks.  The fries show up a few minutes later, once we had drinks; but the food came so fast that it seems like they are trying to get you out of their quickly and I didn&#39;t care for that.  Then two other servers tried to bring us fries, and we told them that we already got our fries but we were waiting for the hummus.  That finally came.  So the service was very spotty and disorganized.  The food was actually very good though.  I&#39;d put that at a 4, service at a 1 and ambiance at a 1.5.  The ambiance took a bad turn when I got up to go to the restroom.  You know the type of place where every single person there thinks they&#39;re better than every other person there and lacks completely common sense and courtesy?  That&#39;s this.  If you say &#39;excuse me&#39; because you are trying to get by, this is the crowd that won&#39;t apologize, won&#39;t move, won&#39;t even give you an eyeroll as if saying &#39;how dare you interrupt me when I&#39;m blocking the only route to the bathroom?&#39;  They literally won&#39;t even acknowledge you.  I can&#39;t stand that type of crowd and have only encountered it at a hand full of spots, thankfully.  It&#39;s such a disappointment really because the food was really good.  The lamb hummus is outstanding and the fries are better than average.  And you can&#39;t go wrong with chicharonnes.  If only the service and crowd matched the food..."

I&#39;ve been wanting to try this place since it opened last month, and this past Thursday evening was my first opportunity. I made a 7:45PM reservation, grabbed my boyfriend and headed over.When we arrived, Bernie&#39;s was packed! The entire place was bustling and actually quite noisy, like a diner would be. For this reason, I wouldn&#39;t necessarily recommend it for a more romantic or date night kinda thing. Instead, it feels more relaxed and upbeat, could be a fun dinner before heading out on the town actually.  The space is really cool-- big bar in front, and one large dining space further back. Ceilings are high and kitchen is open, which makes for a fun experience. There&#39;s also an upstairs patio which looks great.We arrived early at 7:20PM and checked in with the host. The greeting needed some work-- neither host was thrilled to check us in, and when we asked about sitting upstairs, their answer was unclear leaving us confused. Not to worry-- there were plenty of open stools at the main bar and we were immediately greeted by bartender &#34;Felix.&#34; We ordered the whiskey drink with blackberry and this was delish and very creative.Eventually, we were seated about 15 minutes after our reservation time. Hosts made no apologies. However, our server Justin made up for it entirely. This dude was awesome, obviously passionate about the restaurant and it&#39;s food and very well informed on ingredients. We followed his advice entirely and ordered the tomato and burrata salad, the veal meatballs, lamb, and pan con tomate. Everything was very very good and more importantly, unique!The star of the night was the tomato and burrata salad. For starters, I was very impressed with both the quality and freshness of ingredients but also in the large quantity served. Really unique spin on a burrata salad as they also incorporated sliced apples, basil leaves, and the most incredible homemade croutons ever. Second favorite was the veal meatballs, which just melted in your mouth. Throughout the meal our server Justin checked in on us and was attentive and friendly. Loved it!I&#39;m giving them 4 stars, as we loved the experience overall but felt there was room for improvement from the host stand (mostly from a training perspective and how to politely great guests and answer questions). I will definitely be back, next time with some girlfriends!"

Unfortunately the service was just that bad.Lets start with the good things: the food was spot on and we loved each dish we got.1. Fries-- huge portion and delish. Thinly cut, salty and came with a great aoili2. Lamb and hummus- tasted just like israel. so fresh, amazing spices and the bread/pita was tasty also3. Heirloom tomato- just perfect. We got 2 for the 6 of us and that was the right decision4. French Dip- bread was perfectly toasted, meat and ju were amazing and had a great mustard or horseradish on it5. Chicken- i never order chicken out and this was incredible. so moist. skin was perfectly crispy. also large portions.6. Ricotta Gnocchi- this was good too, but our least favorite. Pasta was a bit dry. Good flavor.7. Blueberry cobbler- tasty and different. good texture8. strawberry-lime sorbet- so refreshing!To sum-- food was surprisingly large portions and everything was fantastic.Service.... well it was 90 degrees outside and somehow it was hotter in the restaurant. While I know it was unexpected and the staff was upset by it as well, absolutely nothing was done to make the experience more enjoyable. We were served lukewarm water (which i usually prefer) and had to wait to have it refilled for long periods of time. We said multiple times how we were incredible uncomfortable. They kept apologizing,  yet did nothing actually for us. We thought they would comp dessert, but no not even that. They also added another drink to our bill which was already paid for previously at the bar. Just a lot of hiccups. At the end of the meal, the manager continued to apologize when we finally blurted out-- &#34; you know we live around the corner and would like to come back here...&#34; They got the hint and handed us a gift certificate for small amount. A little can go a lot in these types of situations. I do plan on coming back because the food was perfect. I hope the service improves. Our waitress, Anne, was very nice about the entire situation we just felt like they should have done more from the beginning."

Sitting on the corner of Erie and Orleans, I imagine this is a tough place for a restaurant. I&#39;ve lived a block down the street for a couple of years, and it&#39;s kind of an unwritten rule that people looking for dinner and nightlight in River North don&#39;t cross Orleans - hence the demise of places like Pranzi, Zocalo, etc. But Bernie&#39;s seems to be cracking the code and winning the neighborhood over!Here&#39;s why - the FOOD! It&#39;s amazing. A few of my favorites: Do not go to Bernie&#39;s without having the lamb. It&#39;s an appetizer sized portion of lamb and hummus with naan on the side and it&#39;s to die for. The paella is amazing, rings true as a Cuban dish. My favorite recently has been what&#39;s listed on the menu as red snapper, but for the past few months has been subbed with sea scallops. Scallops on a bed of cauliflower and farro makes you think you&#39;re eating healthy even though deep down you know you might not be.Great service, always. Brody is one of the best servers in Chicago and the team always remembers us as locals. Nice to have in our neighborhood!"

The menu is quaint and inventive, the decor is fresh, service was attentive and friendly. The ambience at dinner was a little confusing for what was assumedly meant to be an old-timey &#34;supper club&#34; while a hockey game played on tv and The Clash&#39;s &#34;London Calling&#34; quietly raged on in the background. Otherwise, if not for dinner, it&#39;s probably a solid choice for a drink or two during the week. The drinks (pronunciation guide included, only somewhat side-eye inducing) were good, mine featuring a sour Japanese whiskey concoction that did not disappoint. There was a &#34;Z&#34; somewhere in the name.The food was excellent. Per the recommendation of &#34;Zac&#34; our lax yet amicable server, we started with lamb hashwi; a hummus-like dip with warm pita. This was an excellent precursor to the rest of the night&#39;s dishes. Fried oysters and beet/burrata salad to follow. Curious among Zac&#39;s recommendations was the cheeseburger and roast chicken, which, at first glance seem rather plain dishes amongst a menu with what we imagined were well-rounded and robust options like sweet potato gnocchi or red snapper. The cheeseburger was a solid choice, as was the paella we eventually ordered. We finished with a simply satisfying &#34;s&#39;mores&#34; dessert.I&#39;d go back; it&#39;s classy and bold yet accessible enough that you aren&#39;t puzzled by the options you have or left wishing you&#39;d gone elsewhere. Good for a party with varied tastes. Not exorbitantly priced or stuffy either, though, just filling enough with the right balance."

I had heard the burger here rivals au cheval so naturally most if us went with that. A few of the burgers were a little undercooked but delicious none the less! I ordered a medium rare but would probably get just a medium next time. We also ordered the warm cookies for desert which was a great call! This place is definitely worth checking out

I was greeted and seatly promptly by the hostess, and was quickly greeted by our server. I ordered a Bloody Mary before my party showed up, and was extremely disappointed when I received. The Bloody Mary was watered down and tasted different than every Bloody I&#39;ve ever had (and I&#39;ve had a number of Bloodys). I sent it back since I would not drink it and ordered a mimosa instead. The waiter said they could try to fix it and seemed upset when I sent it back and ordered something else. Once my party showed up we ordered food, and I ordered the friend egg sandwich which was delicious.My only real complaint is the bloody Mary and that fact that I was charged for the Bloody. Most restaurants typically take off the item if it was not to the customer&#39;s liking, but not in this case.The ambiance of the restaurant is really neat, but overall I thought it was definitely overpriced for what it served. I&#39;d come back if my friends wanted to go."

It does get loud and the tables are packed together, but that&#39;s part of the fun.I&#39;d love to try more things on the menu, but the lamb hummus dish we tried was exquisite. Also tried a seabass dish, which was very tasty and interesting but not what we expected (served cold with cilantro and mint, as a small plate to share). Wine menu offered plenty of great options, of which we took full advantage. Service was excellent, friendly and attentive and happy to explain the menu and offer suggestions.Came in the wintertime, but would love to be back to try new dishes and check out their rooftop patio, which looks like a lot of fun also!Bernie&#39;s is worth a shot if you&#39;re looking for a new place to try for a small group or romantic date - you won&#39;t be disappointed!"

As we left I (politely) checked in again with an offensively unapologetic host who simply told me it would be another hour or two before they could seat us upstairs.At the very least, Bernie&#39;s, don&#39;t trick patrons into spending money at your bar under the guise that they will soon be given a table you never intended to have available in the first place.

Sadly, it misses the mark. The menu is geared towards small, shared plates which, in theory, means that your party can sample different flavors and tastes. Unfortunately, the small plates ($9-15) are so small that with a party of 4 people you&#39;re each getting just a bite or two. The small plates are probably 30-40% too small to be practical. Then on the other extreme are entrees sized portions that are $25 to $30. But there are very limited choices of full entree sized plates.The food was pretty good but very skimpy on things like meat.  I was just kind of left feeling as though they were out to maximize profits and push drinks rather than give you a good meal. For a table of 6 people we ended up spending $250 and we each had only two drinks. I came home and had to hit my fridge because I was still hungry.Try it once sure. But you&#39;ll find yourself going to better value places in the neighborhood such as the Franklin Room."

You get a big empty bowl, fill it with all of your favorite contents, and pass it to the chef. BE STRATEGIC. Fill your bowl to the tippy, top; I&#39;m talking to the point where one more kernel of corn would make your whole tower of veggies fall over. Throw on a couple ladles of sauce (or five) and let the magic happen. I always have enough for leftovers the next day so I&#39;m a happy camper!The reason I think flattop is 4-stars instead of 5 is because of their pricing. Charging $9.99 for lunch is totally reasonable and worth it. Charging $12.99 for dinner FOR THE SAME EXACT BOWL AND PORTION is a disservice to your customers. There&#39;s no added benefit except coming before 4pm for lunch prices, or after 4pm for dinner prices. Charge a flat price for the bowls all day.Other than that, I&#39;m sad to see so many closing down around the city! I loved my neighborhood one and don&#39;t frequent flattop as often since now the only one near me is downtown."

Anyone who has been to downtown Chicago knows that parking can be a chore, parking fees are a beast and the personnel writing parking citations take their job seriously.There are lunch specials for food and drinks as well as a military/fire/police discount if you qualify.Some areas of the restaurant are kind of dimly lit and others brighter. There is eclectic art boasting the local teams as well as the how to if you are a newbie to Flat Top Grill.Previously you could add your protein (meats such as fish, chicken, sausage, or vegan options) to your bowl. To cut down on cross contamination they ask at the table and you go up to the cold bar and fill your bowl w/rice, noodles, veggies and many of the other yummy items. Pick a few sauces based on your flavor profile and take it to the grill to have it returned to you piping hot with a serving of roti bread. That roti bread is life! I got some to go and it goes great with honey and peanut butter as a snack with some tea.The options here are always fresh, the establishment stays clean and the waitstaff are fun to be around. A few of the staff are animated but it made the experience that much more enjoyable.Plenty of seating so you can sit for a while and catch up with old friends, dates or your lunch crew.I haven&#39;t been let down yet by Flat Top Grill, it&#39;s a solid option for lunch or dinner."

There are better places to spend your money. But, meh - if you&#39;re indecisive, it&#39;s not the worst place to be.It&#39;s similar to mongolian BBQ except that they now no longer let you physically pick up your own meats/protein. Additionally, they got rid of the filipino sausage and replaced it with androielle sausage - bummer.Anyhow, for $9.99 at lunch, or $12.99 dinner, you get to pick upward to 3 proteins: I normally go with beef, chicken, and sausage. You then get to go to the veggie/carb bar and load up in this small bowl with toppings and various sauces. They got rid of their &#34;all you can eat for the same dinner price&#34; option so if you want a second round, you can get it for $4.IDK - it was just OK. The veggie selection was whatever, the garlic spoon had fallen in, the service was lacking, there was a layer of dust on my beer bottle - It just seemed like the plethora of minor things just the whole experience blah."

I&#39;m not a fan of buffets, but I gave it a shot anyway.Basically, when you get seated someone will give you a wooden paddle to write your name on. The waiter will ask you what kind of protein you want after which he&#39;ll hand you a bowl. I ordered three proteins: white fish, chicken and andouille sausage. You then go over to the buffet with said bowl and load all of the veggie ingredients and sauces into the bowl. Stick your wooden spoon into the bowl and leave it at the cooks bar (I thought that part was gross, seeing as how folks off the street are leaning over and around your food in order to place theirs on the bar, too). After about 10 minutes they&#39;ll bring you your bowl all stir fried up (unless you got tacos or something).The ambiance was casual. Dress as you would at a food court in the mall -- i.e. nothing to get dressed up about. I noticed that when I went to the buffet table it smelled like there was a WOMEN&#39;S bathroom nearby that had the door opened. I&#39;m trying to think of a classy way to say it smelled like a woman with a not so clean cat. I swear. As far as I could tell, though, the only door wide open nearby was the main kitchen. That was a tad unsettling to think about. Were one or more of the female staff hanging out in the kitchen the ones with the sour cats? Ew. I hurried past the area closest to the kitchen and made my way to the end of the buffet table with lighting speed.The total price for this entree and a coke was $18. The waiter sucked. He didn&#39;t come by to refill my coke not once and was nowhere to be found until it came time to collect them coins.Would I return? - not sure. The cat smell was off putting."

For $10, you get a huge stir fry! You can choose one, or a number of meats which include Filipino sausage, pork, beef, calamari, chicken, and shrimp/ fish (these last two will cost you extra). You then get a plastic bowl where you fill it to the brim with veggies, rice, quinoa, noodles, and whatever sauces you like.I came today for lunch at around noon with a friend and got a bowl with sausage and calamari with a bunch of veggies and noodles. I also added in eggs and a side of their roti bread, which is so good! I love that everything is really fresh- none of the veggies I saw were frozen.I double checked the menu today and I believe it has been altered slightly. Instead of having the choice of unlimited bowls, you are limited to two bowls for an extra $4, so be mindful of that if you were planning on coming to this location for the all you can eat option.Other than that, good service, friendly staff and tasty food!

Be prepared to make choices here!If it&#39;s your first time, you probably won&#39;t have a clue what&#39;s going on. I think initially this place started out as a Mongolian BBQ spot, but if you&#39;re indecisive like me or have no idea what you&#39;re doing you&#39;ll end up with a jumble of styles of food. I had originally been to a flat top grill in Old Town before it closed, but it seems like they do things differently at this location. For meats, you no longer pick and choose from the bar area but all of it is handled by the cooks in the back which means you preorder which meats you would like in your bowl. All you have to worry about is the assortment of veggies, rice, noodles, sauces, etc you would like to accompany your selected meats. MAKE SURE TO PILE THAT STUFF AS HIGH AS YOU CAN. GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH. After this you can choose to have it served as a burrito, roti tacos, veggie wraps, and additional assortment of styles. Hard to pin point what kind of food I&#39;d even call this place but maybe Asian Mediterranean fusion?Judging from my one pic I snapped while I was there, I&#39;m still kind of scratching my head at what I had assembled last night. I remember beef, chicken, and sausage with noodles and potatoes an array of veggies and spices/sauces half of it assembled in roti tacos and the other half left as stir fry to consume. For $12, it&#39;s probably good for two meals, but some how I consumed all of it in one sitting. I think I was motivated not to have to carry around leftovers to the Sox game. For drinks, they slang some pretty fruity lookin&#39; cocktails as relatively reasonable prices ($8~) and bottles of beer ($6~). I&#39;d probably pass on ordering drinks and just come for the arsenal of food. Come hungry!&#39;Til next time, cheers!"

Granted, one bowl is usually enough for me, but it was kinda fun to think that there are endless bowls of food you could potentially eat..It&#39;s still a good meal, especially if you&#39;re picky about what goes into your food.

Pile on as many veggies, starches, and sauces as you can. They also had tofu, which was unique. Once I set my bowl in the cooking line, I received it relavitely quickly after returning to my seat.I know the restaurant also offers soup, appetizers, and other entrees.

He even had the nerve to tell me, &#34;hey brother, sign the check for me would ya&#34;? I was so in awe that I almost said something to the manager, however, I figured this review would be enough. Even as I&#39;m writing this in the restaurant, I can see he&#39;s wondering why we&#39;re not leaving yet. He wasn&#39;t done for the evening as he was taking more tables as we were sitting there. This literally was only 5 minutes after we finished eating that he wanted us to leave!! I&#39;ve never seen such an attitude from a waiter!!In addition to this, the host and the cooks barely spoke English and it was all we could do to understand and figure out how the process works. It was more of a Mongolian style where you put a plate of food together from a raw buffet bar, gather your sauces and then give it to the cook where they make it in front of you. However, this place didn&#39;t seem to understand anything I was asking in plain English!! It also wasn&#39;t a very smooth process. They make you leave the food and they bring it to you instead of letting you watch them make it, unlike most places of this nature. Also the decor was dark and such a confusing process from the moment we entered the place, even the layout of the restaurant was frustrating!The food was good, but not great! I didn&#39;t feel as if I&#39;d want to go back again. It was really just ok. I&#39;ve had so much better at other places and the fact that they could not communicate in clear English and we were treated so horribly by the waiter, this was enough to give it 2 stars."

She has a peanut/soy allergy so our first step was to see if they could be accommodating to that and they assured us they could be. Now I consider both of us to be very bright individuals, but the whole time here I was very confused. We sat down and our waiter asked us if it was our first time. We said yes....and from there on it felt like we were speaking a different language with the instructions we were given. I will apologize in advance, but this will be a lengthy review...First we were given a stick and a pencil with our menu. We were told to write on the stick our names and up to 3 meats we would like to come with our meals. Simple enough I figured (I chose sausage, shrimp, calamari). Then we were given this huge explanation on how things worked. They come back to your table with a bowl and then you are set free to navigate the ridiculous array of sauces, veggies, rice/noodles and basically put the meal together yourself. We held on to our little bowls and gave each other reassuring looks that we got this.So first stop we had to decide rice or noodles and then fix up your bowl with whatever condiments. I went with the brown rice, noodles, and added broccoli, mushrooms, onions. (There were seriously about 15 other items, but I tried to keep it simple). Then there are about 10 sauces to choose from. I went with the garlic black bean.After that it&#39;s time to &#34;Transform your meal&#34; You go over to this area where you are met with another set of sticks to choose from. You can Transform and add to your creation. The transform sticks you can choose between having them change the items you have in the bowl into either a burrito, wrap, soup, roti taco, or stuffed sandwich. I went with the roti taco. Also you can choose from the other side of sticks to add to your creation tofu, eggs, cheese, or a white stick to mean you have some form of allergy.Once your done with all that it&#39;s time to hand them your bowl so they can &#34;create&#34; your meal. By that point we were exhausted and went back to our tables praying we did somewhat well in choosing the right items. I also needed a drink by this point (I know it&#39;s lunch time...but I felt I worked hard enough for it ). I went with the FTG Punch...sweet and fruity and I couldn&#39;t taste the alcohol so I liked it. About 5 minutes later we get our creation and honestly we didn&#39;t do a bad job in our item selections. The problem to me is it tasted like something I could have ordered someplace else and had the chefs do all the work. I&#39;m not big on specialization of my food and having to pick so many options, but if you are this is a great place to go."

I ordered a vegetarian stir fry with Chill Garlic sauce, hot sauce and some veggies with Noodles. And ordered their Naan for bread, oooh and Naan is AWESOME, but eat it hot, it is made of all purpose flour so might become rubbery if you wait for too long before you eat it.The service is good, I&#39;d say they manage crowd very well, atleast when I went there during a weekday lunch. The wait was 1.5 hr but it was well worth it. Edamame for starters is very good too.As for the decor, it is pretty decent, casual and nothing you would not like. It is very clean, cozy.

The concept of the restaurant is great though especially if you&#39;re the type who loves picking and choosing for yourself!I&#39;ll start off with the positives in that it still has a great selection of fresh vegetables, meat, sauces, and toppings; ranging from cilantro and garlic to squash and zucchini to literally over 20 sauces.Onto the not so impressive. Our waitress asked us if we had been before and we said yes but it had been a while so a refresher would be great. She didn&#39;t tell us that now you aren&#39;t able to go up for seconds/thirds for the same price (used to be $15) so we just assumed that hadn&#39;t changed. A friend of mine is vegan so she wanted to try small portions of different stirfrys since it was all included in the base price and didn&#39;t get tofu the first time around so she got a relatively small bowl. After we found out going up again would be an extra $4 (which is a great deal if you already had a full meal especially because you can get it to go) she had honestly felt a little cheated.Just be aware before you go but other than that miscommunication it was pretty decent!!"

Chang&#39;s and a club (both are good things!). There is a lot of space, a bunch of tables, and even a small bar area for loners like myself. The food stations are very well lit and very well labeled so you know exactly what you&#39;re getting. They have changed things a bit from when I have dined at a Flat Top in the past (for example, the meat no longer sits out...) but much has also stayed the same. Everything, given the style of dining, is kept very clean as well, which is nice when you think about it.Bathroom: a typical bathroom that continues the décor of the main restaurant, nice and cleanStaff: My waiter left a bit to be desired as he was not very present after I started eating my main course. However, the cooks were great and my food was fantastic.Food: I started with edamame (it was pretty good) and then moved right to a build-my-own-bowl, which I loaded up. To be honest, I was a bit worried to discover that the meat is no longer &#34;self serve&#34; but they gave a healthy serving in my bowl. Everything tasted fresh and delicious!Value: It&#39;s not expensive by any means, but it is, when all is said and done, just a bit too pricey.

Also, it&#39;s not like other Flat top Grills that are 1 bowl for a price then it&#39;s all you can eat for a couple more bucks. THIS one has a charge for 1 bowl then it&#39;s  $4 more for 2bowls... that&#39;s it.Our server, Ms. T. P. (I don&#39;t want anyone to loose her job... unless I go back and the service doesn&#39;t change), made us feel mostly abandoned. Especially since we had to ask multiple times for our children&#39;s drinks and I had to seek out a manager on my own to address a couple of promotional issues (Which he took care of VERY quickly). I&#39;ll admit, we had a large party but I&#39;m used to having a little more attention when that&#39;s the case.  We saw our server when we made our order and when she brought the check and even then, it seemed like either she really didn&#39;t want to wait on us OR maybe her day wasn&#39;t going well because a few of the people in my party felt like she had a bad attitude towards them. Either way, I hope the rest of her day was better.To sum it all up, the combination of our server&#39;s attitude, her absence, and how different the flow is at this location vs ALL other locations I&#39;ve EVER visited...

I&#39;ve been to other places like this one (Genghis Grill) but never this place. The major difference between them is that at Genghis put the meat you want in the bowl and they cook it, whereas at Flat Top you put the starch in the bowl. I feel like that might prevent the diner from getting as much meat as they would otherwise because they fill the bowl up with noodles. The also offer soup, burrito and salad options, but I&#39;m nor really sure how those would work out.Overall, the food was good and the portion was more than I could eat.

I still love the idea of filling up a bowl with tons of veggies, meats, and sauces and having a fresh hot bowl of chow customized to your liking.Unfortunately there have been changes implemented here (maybe because it&#39;s in the Loop so they have higher traffic) that put it below the bar especially compared to other locations of theirs.Before, you got a little bowl to pile your proteins into, and you were limited only by your ability to stack. It was great because they had a large variety of them so you could mix and match beef, pork, chicken, fish, squid, longganisa...No more here. Now you can only get up to three different ones, and if you want to &#34;double up&#34; on one of them, they&#39;ll charge you $4. Oof.They&#39;ve also removed their hot and sour soup option which was pretty darn tasty and my girlfriend&#39;s favorite. And to top it off, our service last night was pretty lacking. You&#39;d think at 8:30pm in the Loop you wouldn&#39;t have to be waiting around to get water/get the check/pay the check.I really hope this doesn&#39;t extend to other Flat Top locations, but looking on their website it seems that they&#39;re showing the same $4 upcharge and lack of soup options.

Love the concept, love the food, veggie-friendly, etc.However, I did not have a good experience the most recent time I was there, however. I put my allergy aware stick in my bowl, like I always do, because my body freaks out every time I eat shellfish. This is supposed to mean that they cook my food in a separate wok to ensure that there is no cross-contamination between my food and other people&#39;s which may contain potential allergens.  My food came back, it was delicious as always. HOWEVER, maybe a half-hour after I finished my meal my intestines made it abundantly clear that I had eaten shellfish with a very specific type of pain that I only get when I have consumed it (or something contaminated with it). I was in pain and on the toilet for several hours.Now, I know that they were busier than they normally are that night, and that mistakes happen, but it was just lucky that I do not have an anaphylactic reaction to shellfish. I understand that it is harder to keep track of these things when they&#39;re busy, but in my opinion, it&#39;s not okay. For me, cross-contamination just meant a miserable few hours, but for someone else it might have meant an epipen, a trip to the ER or worse. It&#39;s just not okay.I feel bad writing this, because before this visit, I have loved Flattop. I still do. But I will be very carful in the future, especially when they&#39;re busy."

Terribleness is that despite having a hundred signs about allergies an the ability to specifically make your bowls as allergy issues, the guys behind the lines still use just one set of utensils to stir everyone&#39;s food. I don&#39;t know about the flat top cleanliness but the sharing of utensils definitely bodes ill for us with allergies especially since the sauces have components of egg, peanuts, and soy.Flavor was okay but it was an overpriced and allergy problem experience. Service was also terrible--grumpy servers and really slow considering the kitchen was finished cooking and plates sat at the pass for 10-14 minutes before being served."

The waiter was nice and patient to introduce. It suppose to be a great start but the truth is the second which is probably be the last time I will go. We felt &#34;cold&#34; when we got problems about the payment. I understand they may be tired to serve too many guests but when we ask for bags for boxes. We will told to get it in the front desk... absolutely different from the first time. But anyway, our waiter is good. BTW, I ordered two eggs but they didn&#39;t show up, at all!"

And coming from SF, a $9.99 lunch seemed incredibly cheap, especially when you can really get a giant bowl out of it!They&#39;re good at explaining how it works if it&#39;s your first time, but it&#39;s also useful going with friends who&#39;ve bene before so they can tell you their own tricks of the trade.Here are some tips:- Stack even more in your main bowl but doing veggies first, then putting the noodles on top. The noodles act as kind of a net that holds everything in place. Then the sauce just soaks into it.- Add PLENTY of sauce. Even if it seems like overkill, your bowl will taste really bland without enough sauce! I did about 4 scoopfuls (between the tomato, thai peanut, and a curry one. It was fantastic).- MIX your sauces! Test it out by adding your combos into the little plastic containers getting it mixed thoroughly by and pouring back and forth between to containers. You can ask someone to help you out with choosing a sauce, and that&#39;s what they do to taste it!- GET THE ROTI it&#39;s delicious!!! You have to add an extra stick.- The lettuce rolls are a nice option - you just get an extra plate of lettuce and you can wrap some of your into those and eat it in a different style!- MEATS: The Filipino Sausage was fantastic. The beef was really great too.Here&#39;s my delicious bowl:yelp.com/biz_photos/flat…"

My friend and I were told to wait 10 minutes. When our table was finally ready, I noticed there were a lot of empty tables as we walked in. So...why the wait? Do keep in mind, most people only get an hour for lunch.We quickly picked up our bowls and went to the buffet section. Select your rice and/or noodles and top it with a bunch of vegetables, sauce, and meat. It&#39;s the same price no matter how much ingredients you toss into the bowl. And here is where you need to be extra cautious! The staff are refilling the containers as they find necessary. They pour the sauce in while neglecting the customers&#39; presence. I was wise enough to back up two steps before they splattered the sauce across my white blouse. Beware of your surroundings!We left our bowls by the grill for them to be cooked and returned to our table. It was another 10 minute before we finally received our food. The Chinese yellow noodles were good and the roti prata bread is a must-order. That&#39;s where I applied my two stars! The rest of the contents were slightly charred and overly salty. The meat was rough and dry.The check also takes a while to arrive. My tip to lunch diners is to immediately ask for the check when they arrive with your bowls. This will get you out of there in a more efficient manner!"

The nice thing is that for protein options they have seiten, tofu, chicken, beef, pork, fish, squid, and of course they&#39;ve longanisa!!! For those who don&#39;t know, longanisa is a Filipino pork sausage that is mighty tasty!!  Helpful hint: mooshu wrappers are huge...I mean personal pan size pizza with the thickness of a pancake.

I went during dinner, and instead of having both side of the buffet open, only one side was open. I waited for over 10 minutes just to fill up my bowl!  It has gotten a lot pricier, so I try to make the perfect bowl on my first try, and avoid the unlimited bowl price. Which is sad, because that ability to attempt a perfect bowl with unlimited tries was the reason I loved this place to begin with, but not that costs too much and isn&#39;t worth it.But I&#39;ve mastered my perfect bowl and this is what I will be doing from now on:White Rice Noodles White Onions Green Onions Red and Green Peppers Bean Sprouts 1 ladle of Korean BBQ sauce 1 ladle of Vindaloo sauce 1 ladle of Coconut Curry sauce  Scoop of filipino sausage Scoop of chicken 1 ladle of Vindaloo sauce in the meat pinch of garlic pinch of cilantro pinch of jalapeno Mushrooms  Sticks: 1 egg 1 roti"

The food line was clean, everything was filled and at a place like this, it&#39;s your own fault if you don&#39;t like your meal....for the most part.Now, on to my experience. My friend and I went here for lunch this afternoon, it was later in the day, around 2:00pm, so it wasn&#39;t overly crowded. The hostess sat us down at a high top and asked us if we have been there before. We have. Our server came, and at first we thought he was nice. He took our drink order and said we could go ahead and start.My friend and I made our bowls, she is gluten free, so she loves places like this. I got the mushu wraps and 2 roti breads. When we went back to our table, our drinks still weren&#39;t there... fine, no big deal. A little while later, our server finally brought out our drinks. We knew our food would take longer because hers is cooked in a wok and mine have to be wrapped up into delicious little burritos.A food runner brought our food out and no roti bread. Our drinks were near empty and there was no sign of our server.We continued on, cautiously sipping away expecting our server to show up at any moment to ask how our meal was or to refill our drinks. After about 15 minutes, he finally arrives. I ask for some roti bread as they had forgotten and refills on our drinks. He quickly ran from the table. 5 more minutes go by and the manager brings by the bread. We ask her for our drinks and she said she would have them out right away. Never happened.We were abandoned. Left to deal with a liquid-less lunch. Another 10 minutes go by and our server magically appears, we ask for a third time for our drinks to where he pulls out a pitcher and just fills our now empty cups with water... we didn&#39;t have water, we had a lemonade... and he rushes off into oblivion before we could make a sound.At this point we are just annoyed and want to get out of there. Our bowls are empty and our water almost gone. What seemed like forever, our server appears with the check. I give him my card and again, not to be seen for another 15 minutes!Now I would understand if they were busy or if it was during a lunch rush, but it wasn&#39;t. There was no excuse for this server to keep playing this disappearing act. Sadly, it ruined it for me. What we thought would be a 30-45 minute lunch turned into an 1:30 minute magic show....that we didn&#39;t ask for.What a shame, because like I said earlier, the food is good, but you dear server, sucked!"

The last time I had been at this location had to be two years prior. It has gone downhill.While the following information doesn&#39;t impact the rating in any capacity, you should know some changes the company has made. First, Flat Top Grill has changed their business model. The bowls you receive to add your food into seem smaller and you no longer add your own meat, instead you add a stick indicating the meat choice you&#39;d like. Probably saves money from people overloading in the meat part. I get it.But that&#39;s not why this place got 2 stars. This place got 2 stars because the service was spectacularly awful. It was noon on a Saturday. Barely anyone was at the restaurant. Wait staff was everywhere. And despite all that, I had to wave down a waiter (not our waiter) twice to get a refill. And then I had to flag down the manager for the check. Ten minutes passed from the time we had visibly finished our meals until we got our check.The wait staff were mostly goofing off not paying attention to customers. I love me some Flat Top, so I&#39;ll be going back ... I just won&#39;t be visiting this location again."

This is unfortunate because it is now up to the chef(s) to choose the proportions of vegetable to protein.  Our food had the veggies over-cooked on this last visit.  Also, I have forgotten how bad the music is here.  The station they use features whiny pop music with screaming lead vocals.  This is a problem in a lot of restaurants, so I don&#39;t mean to be sarcastic.  It&#39;s just so unfortunate to be irritated by annoying music!Similar to another review, we found it odd that the &#34;sticks&#34; are first hand-delivered by the server, then the customer writes on them with pencil, then the server hand-delivers the sticks to the counter, then the counter staff probably handles the sticks, then gives the sticks back to the server who hand-delivers the sticks back to the table and in our case placed the sticks onto the (not clean) menus.  After all this, you are supposed to bring these sticks with you to the food counter and place them inside your bowl of raw food."

I&#39;ve been to Flat Top many times and I find that it is the most cost effective, healthy option in downtown. I went to Brightwok Kitchen weeks ago and while I liked their food, I didn&#39;t think it was worth the 4 dollars I paid. Here is why:1) At Flat Top you get to pile on as many different kinds of veggies,fruits, noodles and some proteins.  I saw some because the only ones you can are the veggie based proteins as long as it fits in their tiny bowl. An if you are as skilled as I am, you can make your bowl huge.  You can pick what meat you want and while they used to let you pile on your own meat, it&#39;s not something to gripe about because they really do load up on the meat.2) The quality is as great as Brightwok.3) There are way more veggie options at Flat Top and way more sauces to choose from. You can even mix and match4) For about 11 dollars, you get a portion that is twice the amount that brightwok offers. I have enugh to cover two lunches.5) you can add tofu, egg, and roti by using sticks rather than it weighing it as part of your bowl make your protein intake massive."

The Menu has tons of good items no matter what your diet is.  I was able to get a great breakfast with chorizo while my gf was able to get a lighter and healthier meal.  My dad enjoyed the taste of the local brunch place and I would strongly recommend to anyone looking for a fun spot to try on a Saturday morning.  Show up early though, or you&#39;ll have to wait."

When did Bucktown become home to such an extortionate diner? My breakfast burger with prosciutto, arugula, and an egg is probably the best-value item on the menu. I get it though, the place is called Toast so they like to serve breads and griddle breads (pancakes). Plain &#39;cakes start at $6 so I still can&#39;t digest the markup for basic breakfast. There are way too many options around Roscoe Village (and all of Chicago) for me to make the trip here to wait for $11 pepper and eggs.But, hey, Metropolis coffee is always appreciated."

Surely if people are waiting outside the food is good, right??Anyway, it was 10:30ish on a Saturday when I got there with my two friends. We were quoted a 45 min wait but were seated after about only 20 mins. Very nice! I think the April snow/rain/hail storm going on outside kept people away. Started with some Bowtruss Coffee and an OJ. Only $2.50 for coffee and $3 for OJ! Our waiter was very friendly throughout the meal and the staff did a great job refilling waters and coffees. I ordered the stuffed french toast orgy and opted to get one of each flavor (dark chocolate, strawberry puree and mascarpone). They come with  a huge amount of yogurt, granola and fruit piled on top. Really good dish! Tons of food, lots of great flavors and some really fresh fruit to top it off.Toast is a great little place for brunch in Bucktown. Good food, good service, and very fairly priced.

Convenient location if you&#39;re in around the Bucktown neighborhood. I like restaurants where they will text you rather than call out your name especially when there is no place to really hang out indoors, they don&#39;t do that here but it works. When you order if you wait and watch as food is served your mouth will be watering by the time you decide what you want to eat. I had The traditional French toast with berries along with their chicken sausage which was absolutely amazing. It&#39;s stuffed with Gouda cheese and taste like pure heaven. The French toast was great as well I loved The combination of berries and the inclusion of grapes was actually good. I don&#39;t like it when a restaurant serves pancakes or French toast with berries but does not have berry syrup and that was the one thing I wasn&#39;t thrilled about, i.e. Is maple syrup only at Toast. Otherwise though, a really fabulous experience the day and will come back!"

My eggs over medium were perfectly cooked but room temperature, as was my Applewood bacon. The potatoes were cold and rock hard with a solid black crust (like they were days old and had been reheated).My friend had the veggie omelette and ate about half of it. We split an order of the pancakes with bananas and pecans, and they would have been much better if warm when brought to the table. Two bites of cold pancakes were enough for me. And I didn&#39;t like the coffee... it was way too bitter.Our waitperson was good, but our busser was excelent. He had a smile on his face the entire time he was at our table. He filled our water glasses several times, brought us fresh cups of coffee (as bad as the first cups), and asked us if it was okay to clear the table. (I hate it when they take the plates away before everyone is finished eating.) I almost didn&#39;t mind splitting the $40 check for such a mediocre meal. He&#39;s the only reason I didn&#39;t give this place one star.Can&#39;t understand why this restaurant gets such good reviews. Perhaps it was just an off day. But there are far too many places for a good breakfast to over-pay for this quality of a meal. (I took a photo of the black crusted potatoes but decided it was too gross to post.)"

It took about 45 minutes before we could get a table. The place was small and cute and very cozy with a diner style bar. He had the french toast orgy which consisted of three french toast, vanilla? strawberry, and chocolate. In my opinion, it was extremely sweet for breakfast, but with its portion, it can definitely hold you over until dinner! He liked it as he finished the entire dish. Personal preference I suppose. I had eggs benedict with artichoke hearts and spinach. The eggs benedict was a bit too tart for me, I think too much lemon juice?, and the artichoke hearts did not pair well with the spinach and the tartness of the eggs benedict. Again, it&#39;s my personal preference to not have sour with eggs. But it is a cool place if you need somewhere to have breakfast, but if on a weekend, make some time for yourself because you won&#39;t get seated right away. Staff are also very attentive and sweet. The guy who seems to be the manager/owner (or just a hardworking busboy) is VERY hardworking and always finds something to do within the dining room floor.Overall, come here if you are looking for good breakfast!"

Olive salty salty prosciutto on its own but in an omelet with some hot sauce on top was even better. My boyfriend loved his crabby benedict; he loved it so much he ordered a side of chorizo to put on top. He said his potatoes maybe weren&#39;t cooked as much as they should&#39;ve been and didn&#39;t finish them, but otherwise this place was on point.

Had a short wait to be seated. The bar was offered so we took it. You can request a table if you prefer a little more comfort. We had the smoked salmon omelette and the scrambles with pesto and prosciutto. Both were amazing. I&#39;ve never had such a great omelette before. We were so impressed we actually went again the next day to the other branch in Lincoln Park. Both times we sat at the bar and the service was excellent. I could happily choose anything from the menu here. You will never leave hungry!!

Before I could finish my sentence, she said French Toast Orgy, so French Toast Orgy it was. I must say, the French Toast Orgy here is AMAZING and I&#39;m glad she recommended it. It comes w/ 3 pieces of stuffed french toast: strawberry puree, mascarpone, and Mexican chocolate, all topped with vanilla yogurt, granola, berries, powdered sugar, and a drizzle of honey. There&#39;s a lot going on on the plate, but it all works well together. It was plenty sweet (in a good way), so I didn&#39;t even need to add syrup to it. The berries are fresh and the yogurt and granola add great texture to the stuffed french toast. All 3 were good, but my favorite was the strawberry puree, followed by the mascarpone, and then the Mexican chocolate. Toast Two is close to my house, so I definitely want to come back to try the Pancake Orgy and Pesto Scramble"

Our wait was about 40 minutes on a Sunday at noon and then it was probably another 20 minutes before we got our food after we ordered. A little lengthy for me.I got the French toast orgy with one of each flavor - dark chocolate, marscapone, and strawberry. I thought I would like the dark chocolate the most but it turned out it was my least favorite. It was kind of mushy and stuck at an awkward in between of trying to be sweet, but not sweet enough. Turns out the marscapone was my favorite! The regular stuffed french toast is basically the same plate but just without the yogurt and granola toppings.The service was okay. They were very accommodating for one of my friends who had a lot of specific requests for her burger. One of our waiters was very odd though and he kept on asking if we wanted more coffee and water even though we repeatedly said no. He also very awkwardly tried to maneuver the water pitcher around us which I didn&#39;t understand at all because it really wasn&#39;t that difficult to do.All in all, it&#39;s a solid brunch spot but because it&#39;s also a smaller place, be prepared to wait on weekends."

Usually, I&#39;m not a fan of house potatoes but they made them nice and flavorful and crispy. The scrambled eggs were probably one of the best scrambled eggs I have ever had from a restaurant (they were seasoned already and were yellow and fluffy). The pancakes were delicious; adding additional butter is not necessary which I love because I&#39;m always too eager to eat my food to want to take the time out to put butter on my already buttermilk pancakes lol.The waiters are also very friendly and approachable.Only downside is that it can be difficult to find parking on Damen.

Or so I thought.The wait for a table was going to be 30 minutes on a Sunday around 10 a.m. But a couple of spots opened up at the counter, so we sat there immediately. We were offered and served coffee pretty quickly. I think the service was good. Not overly personal or friendly but polite and efficient.The food is where things fell apart. I ordered the two egg breakfast (eggs, toast, bacon, breakfast potatoes). My scrambled eggs were way overcooked and the potatoes were hard.My friend ordered the French Toast.

There&#39;s hardly any space to wait for a table. The host did not seem friendly. I couldn&#39;t blame him. Standing in front of a freezing cold door all day would make me crabby as hell. But it was like a quiet crabby-ness?We were seated and ordered the pancake orgy and pesto scramble. He liked his pesto scramble a lot and I agreed. We both thought it was just going to be eggs with pesto thrown on top. Nope, it was blended with the egg and it still retained its nice pesto flavor. He really liked his cinnamon raisin toast. His potatoes could have been crisper. His OJ was tasted like Tampico.I was happy with my pancake orgy at first. The yogurt was good, but then again you can&#39;t really go wrong with vanilla yogurt, fruit and granola. The marscapone was nice, but kind of lacking in flavor. I couldn&#39;t handle the strawberry french toast. It was just too mushy for me. I understand that there&#39;s strawberry inside, but it just looked like mush to me. I even scraped some of it out to see if I would like it better, but I didn&#39;t. Perhaps if I&#39;m in the mood for brunch again, I&#39;ll get the regular French toast with berries on top.Overall, I think Toast is a solid place for brunch. A bit cramped because I was scared that the guy next to me would knock over the vase of flowers into my french toast. They need to work on their heating/winter door or something. It was bitterly cold every time the door was opened. The outside canvas door did nothing. I would definitely choose this place over Janik&#39;s on division."

It was very nice to have the shade from the umbrella, because it was pretty hot in the sun.Everyone ordered Iced Coffee besides my bro and me. He went with the standard coffee and I went with water.For the entrees, my friends had the cobb club, the cobb salad, the bison sliders with potato salad, and the burger of the day (a breakfast burger type with sausage, egg, arugla, and potatoes). My brother and I ordered omelettes with multigrain toast and fruit. We also split a short stack (2 pancakes, so one each) of the whole wheat cakes.I went with the vegetarian omelette, which had shrooms, broccoli, peppers, onion, and gruyere cheese. I had it with egg whites too. My bro went with the mexican type omelette (Tijuana, I believe). It had peppers, jalapenos, and I&#39;m forgetting the rest, but he enjoyed it.Fruit bowl had bananas, berries, and grapes. Not a fan of the 3.00 upcharge to have fruit instead, but that&#39;s the price I pay for being a bit healthier. Egg whites I understand, though (1.50 upcharge).The toast was perfect, the pancake was good (6 dollars for a shortstack? COME ON). Omelette was good, but nothing out of this world.Waitress wasn&#39;t very attentive, but she was nice. It was 35 bucks for my bro and me. A little expensive for my liking, especially since we didn&#39;t get that much food. Should have paid ten dollars less (Thanks Chicago).Overall, I&#39;d probably go back.

After parallel parking, we were told it would be a 30 to 45 mins for a table. The wait was only about 20 mins. This place is small but there is a patio in back which is where we were led to sit.I was not expecting to dine al fresco but we loved the Julius Melini coffee umbrellas providing shade.Our large testosterone filled group was ready our order food after getting iced coffees, coffee (this is why I&#39;m hot) and waters. I went with the Tijuana omelette, fruit instead of potatoes, multigrain toast, and a side of whole wheat cakes to split with my twin brother. We were the only two that were not hung over as I mentioned before. Brother ordered the vegetarian omelette. Rest of the table enjoyed a Cobb Salad, Cobb Club Sandwich sliders, burger of the day, and their iced coffees.Food was great! Service was okay, but what do you expect? Refills had to be constantly asked for, especially on water.The menu is simple. Besides the service I found two pancakes for six bucks a bit much. Sure they were whole grain and delicious, but I thought an order was three or four.To our odd waitress, it was great to see you. I wish you were around more today. Bus boy was great at refills.I would go back to sit back on the patio again. Wish I could have buttered up this review a bit more, but Toast Two should be on your list of Bucktown hot spots.It is BYOB. I hate places that upcharge for fruit, but I understand. It&#39;s a business.As my friends mentioned, this is the kind of place a couple of cheeseburgers in paradise can chill on a Sunday afternoon."

Mine was ridiculously delicious and she only had good things to say about hers. I will say this: don&#39;t go for the dark chocolate unless you have a serious sweet tooth, it was not for the faint of heart. You get three chunks of toast and o could only manage one, despite how delicious it was. They aren&#39;t messing around with the portion size here.We went around 11:30 on MLK day, and the place was accordingly bursting at the seams. I believe we eventually got seated a little after noon, which wasn&#39;t bad at all.We were seated at the counter, and the server was very pleasant and quick with the refills of coffee. I honestly can&#39;t think of a bad thing to say about this place. I will have to go back and try something savory."

The place was PACKED. There wasn&#39;t even anywhere to stand in the miniscule entryway, so my cousin and I took a walk in the freezing cold and checked out some little shops just to warm up. Quoted a wait time of half an hour, we headed back to check in just after 2:00. Nope. Still nowhere to even stand inside. When I asked for an update, the hostess was totally snotty. Then, when it finally cleared up enough for us to at least stand inside where it was warm, she ignored us completely. No, &#34;sorry for the wait&#34;. No, &#34;it&#39;ll just be a bit longer&#34;. Nothin&#39;. We were just about to leave and go get sushi across the street when we were finally seated. Around 2:45.The atmosphere and decor were cute, if a little kitschy for my taste, but the seating was just absurdly close together. I could barely manage to squeeze between the two tables to access my bench seat against the wall without taking out the water glasses of the diners beside us.The savory options sound tempting, but I really wanted the namesake toast. I had a dish with a sampling of different stuffed french toast, the French Toast Orgy. A lofty name for an okay plate. It arrived relatively quickly and it was good. But not quite good enough to make it worth the ridiculously long wait and the awkwardly cramped seating arrangement.In short...Since they don&#39;t take reservations, you can simply accept a long wait time for apathetic service and mediocre food with a somewhat inflated price tag or...Call up a hankering for sushi instead of brunch and head across the street."

Since we weren&#39;t willing to wait around, I realized this was the perfect opportunity to try Toast Two. Unfortunately when we got there there were no tables available but the hostess did offer us the opportunity to immediately sit at the bar, which we took.Celebrating the late arrival of fall, I immediately decided on the Pumpkin Pancakes with pumpkin whipped cream on the side. My BF decided to order the Tijuana scramble with an English muffin (his choice) and breakfast potatoes. Both were really good! We ended up swapping our dishes with one another so we could have a fair share of the sweet with the savory.  It was perfect.I just wish the seats at the bar had back rests because I would have enjoyed my meal more if I had been comfortable. I almost scarfed my entire meal down so I wouldn&#39;t have to sit on the stool any longer.I guess this just means I need to go back in the hopes of getting to sit at a real table with comfortable chairs and see if Toast Two can earn its 5th star :)."

I had a crazy weekend, starting with being whisked away to a surprise brunch experience by a very dear friend. I have yet to explore Chicago for breakfast joints, and Toast was one of his suggestions that he decided against. However, I took mental note because I love diners and I have yet to find a place fit for my expectations in the city. Toast does not fit the bill.Rocking serious hangovers, my new friend and I decided that a substantial breakfast would assist in stopping our dizzy heads and perhaps reset our cloudy and unmotivated attitudes. He ordered the veggie burger, and I got the El Bucktowno. What came to our table looked much different from what we had pictured inside our heads. His veggie burger looked like someone cut out small pieces of construction paper, took a bunch of Elmer&#39;s glue, and made a patty out of the clippings, and threw it in a bun. I almost burned my mouth on the over-cooked chicken in my sandwich, and there was so much zucchini, it was hard to keep it inside the bun. For both of us, there was no flavor in our selections at all. No one was saying it needed to be deep fried; but you can marinate chicken and you can also use spices.My friend and I are form the suburbs, and we are not used to sitting so close to other diners. At toast, you feel like a fish in a can of sardines. I have learned to get used to it. I can even take the noise level. However, you sit me next to two loud and pretentious hipster girls who pretty much favor the sound of their own voice over actually listening to what their breakfast companion is saying; I will draw the line. My friend and I kept looking at each other, eyes practically bleeding at being subjected to their conversation. There was no choice. We had to listen to them and we couldn&#39;t even talk because it would have meant that we needed to raise our voices even more to hear each other. We resorted to texting each other with jokes regarding their sense of fashion, and perhaps both of them lacking men in their lives. Who would even stomach a date with these girls? There were, however, some very attractive men that dined here. I am not usually one to check out guys with tattoos and gauged earrings; but my visit to Toast changed my mind.Our waitress was amazing. She was so gracious and patient with everyone. I don&#39;t know how she does it, but she treated everyone like they were royalty. I didn&#39;t catch her name, but she had blond hair and cat-eye glasses. We made sure she got a decent tip. My tip to the reader would be to stick to breakfast if you eat at Toast. The rest of my weekend, my friend and I spent at the mercy of frequent trips to the bathroom."

The cinnamon raisin toast. Wow. Served warm and HAS to be made in the restaurant. Literally the best piece of toast I have ever had in my entire life. Eggs Benedict was good. Egg cooked to perfection. We wanted more meat so we ordered sides of sausage. Oh, and the best part, BYO mimosas, baby! And the orange juice glasses that come with the carafe are brought with a little strawberry on top. My friend had some sort of scramble and the potatoes were just so perfect. The right amount of crispy and seasoned well. I came with my husband some time back and it was pretty good, this most recent time just affirmed Toast Two as a solid brunch spot forever.

Had to remind waitress of our drinks and the toast that should come as a side for both entrees (it&#39;s in the name!) that we got as we left. It&#39;s not the waitress&#39;s fault, she was the only one on a Sunday that we saw, and wound up comping our drinks.The other brunch options were solid, lots of savory options with eggs, good portions, well cooked veggie additions. Where it lacks is the sweet section, which I know others will disagree on. The pancake and French toast options are good but just differ in their toppings. That&#39;s not going to compare to a lot of spots in Chicago- but hey, they have something called an orgy so it&#39;s not all bad. This will be a good backup from here on out."

From the French toast orgy to their breakfast burrito, the menu is full of interesting choices. And yes orgy. It&#39;s actually a menu choice. Kind of like the everything bagel with a nice assortment of fruit and sweets.Prices are fair considering the neighborhood.

Not only that, there was an empty table that could fit us right next to the window that was clear for 20 minutes. I asked if we could just sit there, and they said it was reserved or something. Angry and hungry, my alter ego hungry Hans came out...and it wasn&#39;t pretty.By the time we sat down, we already knew what we wanted as we had plenty of time outside to figure it out. Me and my friend split the French Toast Orgy and Nutella crepe thing. Note: be careful about your wording when you say something like this because someone asked me what I was getting and I said &#34;we were splitting an orgy and...&#34;I didn&#39;t even need to complete the sentence.We got to try all 3 flavors with the orgy, but you could request just one if you like. I believe there was a mexican chocolate one, a strawberry, and a marscapone. I think I liked the marscapone and Chocolate on the best, but my friend really liked the marscapone. To each their own, but I like the the variety of getting all 3. They balance each other out. As for the crepe, I thought it was good, but a bit dry. There were a lot of pecans around it, which were nice, but as a whole, I thought the dish was a bit dry. I needed something. Even a little dollop of whipped cream would have been nice.  I tried my friends&#39; dishes and they were good too. The veggie goat cheese one was awesome. And as the name implies, the toast was surprisingly good. I enjoyed the perfect brown-ness on them.I think I would prefer Yolk over this, but this was also a good option. It probably wouldn&#39;t be my first choice to go back to, but a solid one nonetheless."

We had to wait a little while to get a table since the place is a little on the small side and seating is fairly limited. Once we were seated thought the service was quick and friendly and we didn&#39;t have to wait for anything at all. I think part of that is them trying to turn over tables quickly but whatever it was nice to have attentive people working there. For brunch I ordered the crab eggs benedict and a side order of blueberry pancakes. The eggs benedict was delicious and came with a side of fried potatos. The pancakes were also great as well. I&#39;m looking forward to going back here. Also, for two people the total bill came out to around 30$ but since we got a bunch of food I&#39;d say it was a good value."

Everything about the 3 different flavors, (mascarpone, mexican chocolate, and strawberry was fantastic!) This is of course only when we had it at the Lincoln P.  Toast.However, we can&#39;t say the same about our food experience  when we decided to stop at the Bucktown location.  We live less than 10 minutes away, yet I highly doubt we will be back.   The french toast stuffing flavors lacked INCREDIBLY.  I hardly was able to taste the chocolate flavor filling; the chocolate flavor was very diluted.  They added so little chocolate cocoa flavor, that it so seems the cooks pitch in from their own pocket just to make the dollar stretch.  To top it off their mascarpone filling was very soggy and they hardly added any.  (a PICTURE is attached).I truly wish I could say this was only my plate but unfortunately my husband ordered the orgy and he felt the same way about his filling flavor and the amount they add to each toast stick.  We weren&#39;t expecting anything far beyond what we have eaten at the L.P location: just regular good tasting with a mild amount of filling.It was so disappointing to come to this location&#39;s Toast.  You would think that one of the things they are famous for would be on point at both locations.  Bucktown&#39;s location needs to step it up and stick to the original recipe without being cheap with their flavors and amount served.Next time, I rather drive further, wait as long and gladly go through troubles with finding parking at the Lincoln Park location, than to come to this location and be disappointed with my dish."

The tables are pretty close together, so please shower for the good of the whole restaurant and your inadvertent dining partner next to you. At least layer on a swipe or two of deodorant.But I digress. The eats at Toast are solid. If you&#39;re a fan of the sweet stuff, try the stuffed French toast: three sizable, battered to perfection pieces of goodness stuffed with chocolate, strawberry goodness and marscapone. Three separate stuffs, all meld together to form a harmonious dish of fatty deliciousness. Still hungry? Definitely get a size of chicken sausage.

Barbecue is something that should never be rushed. However, I think that formula is to cater to the downtown lunch crowd. Move &#39;em in, move &#39;em out.The pulled chicken was tender and moist. The sauce did nothing to enhance the chicken. The sauce was more of a drizzle. The elotes was the equivalent of cold corn salad. The salted caramel root beer scored points.I would have to return and try the brisket and baked beans. I&#39;ve seen a few positive statements about the brisket.

The chicken was tender but the sauce didn&#39;t do it enough justice for me. The sauce could have been just a little thicker for me as it seemed kind of watery. The flavors I did get from the sauce were pretty decent though. I was hoping to find sauce along the tables somewhere but they are only behind the counter from what I could tell. Didn&#39;t feel like having to wait in line for some more sauce so I just ate it as it came.Had the Mac and cheese as a side and it was pretty good. There was a crunchy outer crust and the inside was really gooey  and cheesy. No complaints there!The portion sizes were pretty good. I even had some as leftover.Overall, a decent place.

The mac and cheese is served in it&#39;s own little foil dish with ample amounts of crispy cheese to seal in the gooey cheesy macaroni within. As for the brisket, it was the best I&#39;ve had so far.

Pulled pork platter was my choice and couldn&#39;t decide on just 1 side so I ordered three. 3 Cheese Mac, Apple Slaw &amp; Beans were all so delicious and right portions (for me, after all the pork). I&#39;m lucky to have this place near work, although that could be bad for the good ol&#39; waistline. Totally worth it! Ordered online, fast service. Thanks!!!"

I have yet to find my BBQ holy grail but I&#39;m trying! The reviews here were so good that I wanted to give it a shot.I will admit I&#39;m in love with the mac and cheese and the corn muffin. The mac was perfectly crispy on top and oooey gooey, cheesy on the bottom. The muffin was damn good. No explanation necessary. If my reviews were based off these two items alone it&#39;d be a five, but it&#39;s not.I&#39;ve never had brisket before today and I was feeling adventurous. I told the guy I was a first timer and he gave me a nice explanation of everything. He recommended the brisket &#34;half and half.&#34; He slices through the middle of the brisket cuts a chunk out then places it on top of an end piece. This way I get to try some dry meat and some fattier pieces, which he says have different flavors. Whatever the flavors, I wasn&#39;t feeling them.The Chicago sauce also didn&#39;t help. It just tasted like some high fructose, processed sauce. I usually make my sauce from scratch so I know the difference.The reviewer who compared this to a BBQ Chipotle is spot on. I was surprised by how &#34;chain restaurant&#34; it felt. Not to hate on that but it makes a difference.I seriously might come back for that Mac &amp; cheese though."

So while there is a plethora of places to eat, it&#39;s rare I actually get the opportunity to try them.I decided to head into Blackwood BBQ for lunch one day I was home, and was blown away by how delicious it was! I was not expecting the quality of ingredients to be as they were - very fresh veggies, home cooked baked beans and macaroni, and boastful about their antibiotic and horomone-free meats! Love, love, love!The menu is very limited, but that&#39;s okay - &#39;cause you&#39;re there for just what they have - some meats, and some to be expected sides of pickles, mac &#39;n cheese, corn bread... You get the idea.I opted for my favorite of the BBQ meats family - pulled pork - which is slow roasted dry, so you have the opportunity to pick your sauce. They have probably close to a dozen different sauces for you to try, all categorized by region and briefly described on the menu - I loved this! I&#39;m a vinegar lover, so the fact that I could actually choose a Carolina sauce full of tang, over the sweet style that Memphis has to offer was awesome! (They even have a Chicago sauce, which according to my boyfriend is slightly sweet and spicy). Your sandwich will come with house made pickles (YUM), all other sides are additional. My eyes were larger than my stomach on this particular day, not to mention I&#39;m a sucker for baked beans, so I decided to get a side of them - they were good, but honestly I was so full just from my sandwich and pickles, I could only have a taste of them or I would&#39;ve blown up.Price fits the quality and portions of the food, and despite coming for lunch and given its location, service was super fast, efficient and friendly!"

It seemed healthy at least and wasn&#39;t too creamy. Next time I will try the Chicago sauce since the North Carolina sauce didn&#39;t really blow me away. The meat, however, was great for bbq near the loop. I would come back to try the brisket."

You get to choose among three meats (chicken, pork and beef) prepared three different ways (sandwich, salad, platter), as well as regional sauces to top it off.My go-to is the beef brisket sandwich with the North Carolina sauce (tangy and not too heavy/overwhelming). My friend really enjoyed her pulled pork sandwich with the Chicago sauce. We split mac and cheese and corn bread. The mac and cheese was great; love the crispy top. The corn bread was so-so, but I&#39;m not a corn bread fan to begin with.It gets a little crowed inside, so be prepared to either take your food back to the office or become &#34;that person&#34; who stands over a table until the occupants are done."

There&#39;s enough room for a decent line to for and they prepare your food right in front of you as you move toward the register.

Everything has a BBQ feel to it, with wood tables and metal hardware, and it&#39;s a very relaxing atmoshphere.Bathroom: unknownStaff: Everyone was very friendly and they prepared our food very quickly, they keep the line moving!Food: We each had the Brisket Platter (with mac &#39;n cheese) and a different sauce: Chicago (tasty) and Kansas City (more of a hot sauce consistency but definitely more heat), and a bowl of the Brisket Chili (very tasty!). Additionally I had a bottled lemonade, which was enjoyable. The serving size is quite good and I left feeling full (but not stuffed).Value: The prices are great, given the serving sizes!This is a great lunch spot and one I will certainly remember for the future for lunch (although, Green Street Meats is still king of BBQ)."

It&#39;s (un)surprisingly difficult to find good BBQ in this city (and the suburbs). We stopped by after a day at Shedd (on the way back to the train). It was about 4:30 pm and not busy at all. We ordered the brisket and scored some burnt ends with it as well, also ordered mac n&#39; cheese, and a honey cheddar muffin. We tried the Chicago and KC style sauces.Brisket (5 out of 5)- $9.99 - This brisket was delicious. The sliced brisket had the nicest smoke ring I&#39;ve seen on brisket in a long time. The meat was well seasoned and didn&#39;t even need the sauce (so we minimized our use of it since it was our least favorite thing we tasted here).Mac n&#39; cheese (5 out of 5) - under $2 - This stuff was very rich, but also very delicious. It even has gruyere cheese in it! Impressed that the sides were as good as the bbq since often sides are an afterthought (or taste so).Honey Cheddar Corn Muffin (5 out 5) - under $2 - This muffin had nice flavor, was moist, and actually had corn in it! It was a nice compliment to the rest of the meal.They serve an interesting pickle, bean, and onion &#34;salad&#34; with the meal. This was interesting too, good, but I was too stuffed to eat much of it.The staff were very friendly too. Great experience, we will be back!"

Would seriously consider coming back here and ordering 5 of these Mac and cheese cups as a meal.I wasn&#39;t the biggest fan of the Kansas City sauce, and if I were to come back, I&#39;d probably try it with the Chicago sauce. However, the brisket itself was very well cooked, with nice marbling of fat and lean. I also really appreciate that they ask you if you prefer a leaner/fatter/medium cut of brisket. The fatty parts melt in your mouth, and the lean pieces are still extremely tender!Definitely try it out for lunch if you work in the area!

It was the most flavorful and tender brisket I have ever experienced. It was so tender, I was able to cut it into bite size pieces with a plastic fork.One thing that I also liked about Blackwood is that they only offer; brisket, pulled pork and pulled chicken. They do three things and do them well. My co-diners, both gave thumbs up to the pulled meats.I am more of a dry rub and natural seasonings man, but I did try the Chicago Sauce. I figured, it was only appropriate since I was in Chicago. Their description was spot on, it is just the right balance of sweet and heat. We all ordered Cole Slaw, which had a sweet tangy taste, making it a good accompaniment to our meat selections. Wish I could have persuaded them to each order either the baked beans or mac-n-cheese. I would have loved to see how they were prepared. Oh well, I&#39;ll just have to order them myself on the next visit.Sorry for no pictures of the great food, it was a short lunch break during a training class and I wanted to EAT."

Great BBQ, said sides and the line moves quickly. The above applies to all their locations. I&#39;m a fan. Why 3 stars? Simple, you can&#39;t order by the pound. Everything is either a sandwich a platter or whatever. What if I just want meat? No dice, I&#39;m afraid. A key element of legit BBQ is your ability to purchase by the pound. Get on it Blackwood!

The cornbread was a good texture, not overly moist but enough that it wasn&#39;t breaking apart.Negatives:Weighing the meat. Good for the accountant, and while I didn&#39;t think I was underserved by any means, it doesn&#39;t give you a good impression as mentioned in other reviews. I don&#39;t like that the sauce is only on the line and not available at the table or at least by the fountain.

Went here for lunch based up yelp reviews and craving good bbq. Mentioned 1st time customer and received free corn bread. I ordered brisket and pulled pork. Meats had good flavor to them, though I was disappointed on the portion of them. The seller for me was chicago style BBQ sauce. It was very good and flavorful with the taste of old style in it. I sampled all the sauces and I would also recommend the south Carolina mustard (esp with the brisket) and Memphis style. Mac and cheese was decent and my second favorite item was the homemade sweet tea....I&#39;d go back for that alone. Overall very nice atmosphere, food is good;wish the portions were a little bigger, and staff was very friendly I would recommend Blackwood to my friends and family as I would visit again. I also purchased thier chicago style BBQ sauce for home."

Yes please!!!You can have it as a platter with a side or over salad which is what I chose.When I asked how they prepare it--- they SLOW SMOKE it for 11 HOURS!!!!!! And then finish it off omggggg the flavor is amazing.Know how I know? Because I didn&#39;t add any BBQ sauce. Due to my crazy diet, I can&#39;t have any sugars so I just had it as is, smoked, plain and it&#39;s amazing.I am super excited to come back here daily.Great friendly patient service, good quality, filling.  And price??

Pulled pork and brisket sandwiches are great. Good array of sauces to accompany great meats. Mac and cheese is the best I&#39;ve had in this city.

I was a little disappointed when I walked inside and I saw they really only have sandwiches.  I was in the mood for some ribs!  But I was on a time frame so I decided to go ahead and order.The 3 meat choices Blackwood  bbq offers are brisket, pulled pork, and pulled chicken. I went for the brisket. You can either order a salad with your meat choice inside, a platter which is basically the meat in a pile without the bun #Fail, or just get the damn sandwich. I&#39;m all about my carbs so I got the sandwich #IAintNoSkinnyB*tchThe side choices were coleslaw (I HATE coleslaw. I would rather eat a sh*t sandwich!! Nothing against backwood! I hate coleslaw!) baked beans, or Mac -N- Cheese. I went for the Mac. I told the workers it was my first time at Blackwood bbq so they gave me a free corn muffin.When you pick out your meat you also pick out a sauce- they have a North Carolina, South Carolina, Kansas, a couple others, and then a mustard sauce. I went for the mustard. Not sure what made me do that, but it was pretty good! The Mac -N- cheese was really good. I was actually quite shocked by that because I usually don&#39;t like anyone&#39;s Mac -N- cheese.  It was really good. Like my whole group of coworkers loved the Mac -N- cheese!  I didn&#39;t really care for the corn muffin. I didn&#39;t like the bits of corn inside. I think it was a texture thing for me.Later Gators!!"

I was first introduced to their food at my office since they catered here. I loved everything. The cole slaw is amazing, the mac and cheese so creamy and rich, the meat cooked just right. I decided to get lunch from there and whoa. First of all, the meals are relatively cheap and the portions are decent. I was surprised to learn their lunch platter also comes with a pickle salad- its now my favorite part of the meal, except a little too much onion. It also comes with one more side of your choice and anything beyond that is only about a dollar or so more."

First of all, the meat is always done perfectly and is fresh from the grill, you can even see them chopping/pulling new pieces as you go through the line. They have a choice of sauce for everyone - my favorite is the Memphis because it&#39;s not very spicy, but a little sweet with a BBQ kick. The beans are housemade and super yummy, and the mac and cheese is good, but is taken to the next level with a crispy crust baked on top. Last, but definitely not least, THE CORNBREAD. It&#39;s soo good - real corn and just the right amount of cheese baked in. YUM!If all the food isn&#39;t enough reason to love it, I can get a platter (meat, sauce, side) for $8 in about 5 minutes max. (Since the line moves in a Chipotle-esque style, there is almost no wait, even during the lunch rush.)HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"

Service was quick and friendly. Very reasonably priced! I got the combo platter to sample all the meats and a couple sides.All the meats were juicy and flavorful. The real bonus here is the variety of authentic sauces, including both Carolina styles (vinegar and mustard based).The coleslaw was spicy and original (a good thing), and the beans were a hybrid of Texas style with a hint of sweetness. I normally don&#39;t like Texas style beans, but these wee exceptional with chunks of meat.The ambience is a bit too polished for me; it feels like Chipotle. BBQ needs a more &#34;down home&#34; environment. What this place loses in style points are made up for in the good food.Would visit again whenever I&#39;m taking the train!"

Of course, I always have to try the pulled pork. Happy to report it was delish at 8am!

They need to rethink this and put some sauces over by the drink area."

It helped that the server laid it on really thick. The side dish was basic Mac &amp; cheese but with breadcrumbs on top; dish was still pretty awesome. The only complaint I had about it was that it was too small of a portion for what I paid for it.The place wasn&#39;t a formal restaurant; still it was a good use of space for it&#39;s location.

While the chicken and pork are decent the brisket has been cooked to perfection every time I have been here. You can see the juices run out of it as they slice that delicious smoked hunk of meat. So the other meats will simply be a waste of valuable stomach real estate.2. If you get a sandwich have them slice the brisket, not shred it.3. Do not fear the line!  It moves surprisingly quickly.4. If you cannot conquer your fear of the line either order online (1 hour lead time requested) or come before/after the lunch rush.I am clearly a fan of this establishment but I am only giving it 4/5 stars for the following reasons:1. Hours - they close at 3PM which means I can&#39;t stop here on my way to Union to grab dinner for my wife and I.2. Their take on BBQ from around the country is misleading.  The difference in BBQ  is more than what type of sauce you put on your meat, it is in the rub and use of other ingredients.  You could also argue that some of the sauces are not representative of the region, particularly the Kansas City.3. They can be stingy with how much sauce they give you."

Chicago sauce had a decent flavor but too salty. One may suggest I get less sauce, but that would make my meat too dry for me. The prices must have gone up recently as I didn&#39;t get the pricing that other reviewers raved about. Brisket, pickle, small portion of mac for $9.99...okay but not great. Overall I would give about 3.5 stars."

That was my roommate and I at approximately 7:40pm tonight- 20 minutes before Blackwood closes. We called as fast as we could find the number and spoke to Annette - a living saint on this earth - and after a few moments of deliberation with her manager (Norman?) she gave me the best news I would receive today. That beautiful woman told me that they were locking the door at 8, but if I ran real fast she would put an order in for me. I live 15 minutes from Blackwood and I had roughly 12 minutes to get there, but it was a task we were willing to accept. We walked so fast our legs burned, but at exactly 8pm they opened their doors and their hearts to us two hungry girls. Not only did they let us in late and make food later than they needed to for us, but they were incredibly, unbelievably sweet to us about it. They turned the pop machine on, cracked jokes with us (about how much we were sweating (or was that just me?)) and sent us on our way letting us know that they&#39;re always happy to get us food- next time when I call she&#39;ll remember my name and she won&#39;t waste time asking the manager, she&#39;ll just start going. It doesn&#39;t even stop there. When I got home we realized they gave us an extra side, because they clearly wanted my life to peak tonight.Honestly, I may be obsessed with them. Thank you so much for everything you did for us tonight.Oh, and Blackwood is pretty damn amazing for all you trying to read about food right now. Trust me, I dated a Texan."

It felt a little to me like they were measuring similar to that of weight watchers so I didn&#39;t go over my &#34;points&#34;.  I understand it may be smart business, but it definitely gave me a bad taste."

Yes they are good but the true reasoning for the long wait was the free lunch they were giving away.This places gives a decent bbq. It is similar to Chipotle or any other build their meal establishment. You pick a meat (pork, beef or chicken), next decide the presentation: platter, salad or sandwich, sauce is next and finally an optional side.This is a great addition to the area. I must add that their brisket is very tender but does however lack a smokey flavor hence the 1 star deduction.Side note: they are open for breakfast and lunch only so go now!"

The design and layout is simple. You walk in, order your meal at a counter, and dine in or out. Tacos here are $2.75 while tortas are $5.My favorite order so far has been their Milanesa torta. Now I love my street tortas from LA and Mexico, so how does Atotonilco compare to those spots? Pretty damn high! My torta had a crispy slab of milanesa with plenty of avocado, shredded lettuce, onions, and salsa. I loved every bite of this and can&#39;t wait to come back for more!The service here is very friendly and understanding too.

St.)Slide #4: cons- cash only (doesn&#39;t bother us)I know there are other locations of Taqueria Atotonilco in the city and suburbs.  My experience with this Pilsen location was very positive."

I wish more Taquerias would offer this w/o asking.  Our extremely nice server took our order on a tablet (I didn&#39;t know they were this high-tech yet no do not accept Credit Cards) and you basically had two options: tacos or tortas; or both.I have such fond memories of the tortas at Atotonilco since that&#39;s what they do well.  Growing up, my dad would bring us to Atotonilco at least 3 times a week and he would always order the Lengua Torta with a Papaya Milkshake so this place was bringing back some memories. The smell and atmosphere was exactly like the original Atotonilco we grew up going to.We ordered a bunch of tacos, a bunch of tortas, a bunch of milkshakes and everything looked and tasted exactly as I remembered.  The bread is unique to Atotonilco and even their avocado still has the distinct flavor and creaminess that you only get here.  Atotonilco on 57th was where I actually tried avocado for the first time 20+ years ago.  Their milkshakes are also what they&#39;re known for and are made to order.The one standout was the Atotonilco Taco (special steak).  I&#39;ve never had it before and it was almost like a taco/gyro mashup.  It included a creamy queso fresco/sour cream/tzatziki sauce with onion and tomato.  These are the exact same components of gyro except they use steak for the meat and a tortilla instead of the pita.  It was delicious and unique.Not only was the food extremely fresh and delicious, it came out within a minute.  I mean, it was blazing fast.  The tablet ordering process helps expedite the orders so if you&#39;re in rush, this is your place.  Even if you&#39;re not in a rush, this is your place for some perfectly prepared tacos, tortas and milkshakes.  I am thankful for this Pilsen location closer to me now - it&#39;s like I&#39;m permanently reunited with another family member."

Your choices are tacos or tortas. No burritos, no quesadillas, no enchiladas, no rice and beans, no entrees. Tacos, or tortas. Easy enough then to decide what you want.I tried the al pastor, the goat, and the atotonilco special. The special comes with steak, onion, and tomato, and was tender and flavorful. Both the goat and the al pastor are served in a slightly spicy red sauce, and tender meat chunks. Honestly I could not tell which was the goat and which was the pastor, which I guess was ok flavor wise, but I like to be able to distinguish what I&#39;m eating typically, especially with a goat taco that is less common among the neighborhood taquerias.They also have milkshakes, which I did not try on this visit, but come in several fruit flavors like melon, banana, canteloupe, etc.Service was quick and efficient, place was clean, prices were decent.

So I knew I had to come give it a try.I am afraid he was right. Their taco al pastor is outright amazing. Their soft, tender meat  melts in your mouth in a delightful sauce that leaves wonders.

I&#39;ve heard they&#39;re renown for their al pastor. Not to be confused with my pastor, Al, whom I visit at my Christian congregation regularly. I&#39;m talking about their marinated pork. It&#39;s unlike any I&#39;ve had before. It&#39;s spicy, hella flavorful, and as good as advertised. They&#39;re also some of the greasiest tacos I&#39;ve had. So brace yourself.I&#39;m glad this location seemed to open just as I moved to Pilsen. Talk about good timing. If tacos are your thing, think about stoping here. Then, actually do it."

The four stars are seriously too hyped for what this place offers in flavor. I ordered 2 carne asada and 1 alpastor. The carne asada was very bland, lots of fat was left on it and it just didn&#39;t taste good. The tortillas were so greasy and hard that all I tasted was the oil. I also got a tamarindo water and it was sour and also tasteless and room temp. The alpastor was not alpastor and it was drenched in sauce but the sauce was good.

Ill go over my entire perspective since I live extremely close and saw it as it went up. It seemed all of Pilsen was buzzed about them opening here. I thought at first it would be nice to try them but after the hype... I was a little eager, Ill admit. When they first opened they had people in taco and jelopeno costumes passing out flyers. Pretty basic, one side said it was a Mexican Restaurant in english and the flip side said it was hiring but in espanol. I got a kick out of that. Why are you giving me that? Plus I saw these costumed people putting flyers in peoples cars behind the windshield wiper WHILE WAITING FOR A RED LIGHT! Yup! Saw it with my own eyes. I couldnt believe how rude that was.So the Tacos... My friend was in from Colorado and I had been bragging about Pilsen and how AMAZING the food was. I first brought him to El Milagro who was closing up so I thought this was the perfect time to try the new joint... enter ATOTONILCO. They are pretty friendly but dont ask what is good there because they obviously have been trained to tell you EVERYTHING is AMAZING! Ya.. okays thanks for the tip. We got steak and goat tacos. I love that the dude at the register made sure we knew that the goat tacos were especially great.So we brought them back to my place and low and behold the goat tacos were all fat. I bought some for my wife and she couldnt find any meat, just fat. It was disgusting. We would of brought them back but it was cold, it was late, and I was entertaining an out of state friend.This place made me feel not only ripped off and lied to but also a bit ashamed of my Pilsen bragging.Ill never go again and I tell everyone my story."

There&#39;s no mistaking chorizo for anything but chorizo. Well, not here. We finally figured out that the mystery meat was the chorizo. Oh boy. The other tacos de carne asada were tough and chewy.

Honestly the ramen dishes that I&#39;ve had in Chicago are disappointing. Just because &#34;ramen&#34; is Japanese for noodle doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s acceptable to use a random kind of noodle to make ramen. Just like linguine, the Cantonese wonton noodle (oddly the apparent choice for all three Japanese restaurants that I&#39;ve been to in Chicago) is definitely the wrong choice for ramen. Also the broth should be savory, not just salty.Comments for this particular restaurant: the food looks good, is overpriced, and is really really salty. The decor is way off for a ramen restaurant. There are just too many ingredients in the soup.I get that the restaurant is trying to be creative, but tradition is tradition for certain reasons. Please honor the traditional way and try to understand the cuisine better before make any changes. Otherwise the food would be confusing and nasty. It borders on humiliation calling this kind of food &#34;ramen&#34;.For real ramen nearby, please go to NYC."

We walked right up and asked for a table. &#34;Do you have a reservation?&#34; &#34;No...&#34; &#34;Ok, we can seat you in about 5 minutes.&#34;Wut.I get the need to clear off tables, but there were plenty of clear tables, and I think seating patrons should be the first priority before busing tables, especially when it&#39;s not super busy time. I asked one of the main guys what was up with that, and he gave me a pretty nasty look the rest of our time here. So that was a pretty bad intro to the experience.The express lunch is a good deal if you&#39;re not getting the ramen. Seriously, the ramen (both types offered for lunch) had minimal flavor, and the noodles did not taste fresh. I like that it came with some other side dishes, like the salmon over rice, which was much tastier and satiating.Chill vibe overall. It&#39;s not all hip hop, so think liberally in your definition if you&#39;re coming for the music.I&#39;d suggest going to Slurping Turtle down the street if you&#39;re looking for ramen, hands down.

Bf did comment that it was a little salty though. The noodles were the perfect texture. The broth was warm and a good enough amount of spice. There was 4 pieces of chashu in my bowl, which was more than enough. And even though they don&#39;t have it on the menu, there are bamboo shoots and nori (maybe?) in the bowl.

Being part of LEYE, I figured it would be solid but nothing special. It wasn&#39;t intriguing enough to go to over any of the other hot new ramen restaurants in Chicago. I just happened to be in the area and it wasn&#39;t that crowded, so I figured might as well give it a shot.Ambiance: Being right on Hubbard and next to Paris club, the atmosphere was clean-cut, dimly lit, and trendy as expected. It didn&#39;t really give off a Japanese vibe, but I&#39;m not a stickler for decor. The layout was almost like a school cafeteria, with rows of high top tables and bench seating. I ended up just grabbing a stool at the bar. I&#39;m not sure if they always do this, but they were projecting the olympics on one of the walls behind the bar, which was nice for people just grabbing a quick bite.Food: There were definitely some interesting items on the menu I wanted to try, but considering this was my second dinner, I just stuck to the basics and ordered a classic bowl of tonkotsu.Broth - I gotta say that I was pleasantly surprised with the broth. It had plenty of porky flavor and a good amount of saltiness. The best part was the strong garlic flavor, especially since I wasn&#39;t expecting such a dominant garlic taste based on the menu description.Noodles - The noodles were pretty generic. Not bad, but didn&#39;t have the nice chew of a hand made noodle. They were pretty generous with the portion though, so that&#39;s a plus if you come hungry.Toppings - Again, I thought the toppings were solid but not too memorable. The pork was a thicker but leaner cut of meat and didn&#39;t really have that melt in your mouth texture that you&#39;d get with a more marbled piece. The egg was great, with a melted yolky center, but they cheaped out and only gave half an egg. Like I said before, the best topping for me was the huge amount of roasted minced garlic sprinkled on top. Every spoonful of broth just packed little bursts of flavor.Overall, I thought it was a solid bowl of ramen. It probably wouldn&#39;t stand out among some of my other favorite ramen joints around the city if compared head to head, but I&#39;d come back if I was in River North and craving ramen."

The poke on chips was also pretty tasty, if not laden with too much Avocado.Their Ramen, however.... is terrible. It reminded me of when you bought Ramen at a drugstore on your way home from a party and drunkenly let it sit too long.Soggy, bland and honestly, from a package you buy as a student at corner store in a caloric emergency.Perhaps I am spoiled coming from LA, where we have great Ramen shops, but this is the red headed stepchild of Ramen.In name only."

I ordered the Roasted Vegetable Miso Ramen and the Shiitake Mantou Bun. The Ramen came out really hot, and was pretty good. Portion size of the Ramen was really large. It was a little oily and was not as spicy or flavorful as I expected, and I found myself using a lot of the red chilli pepper flakes to my Ramen bowl. The Ramen was alright as a whole, but it was not super special. The Shiitake Mantou Bun was really good! The Bun was a little small, but I loved the taste of the mushroom with the sauce in the Bun.The service here was really good, and the waiter was very friendly. However, the price was very steep here for pretty average food; the Ramen bowl costed $14, and the Mantou Bun costed $5 (for a really small Bun!). Not sure if I&#39;ll be back, but overall I&#39;ll give it 3 stars."

It was delicious! i had mine with less spice because I would not be able to handle the full amount of spice it normally comes with. I thought the flavors were great and the portion was good.They also sell ice cream cones for $3. Not a bad option!

My friend and I were thrilled to discover this place since there seems to be nothing but steakhouses in the area. Looking back now I could have eaten at a steakhouse and probably would have spent the same amount, this place is pretty pricey if you ask me. The cocktail I bought was the same price as my meal ($13).I did enjoy the atmosphere as well as the old school hip hop they were playing.I ended up ordering the Shio and added fried chicken for $4. Overall the meal was good, kinda plain taste wise which is why I am glad I added some fried chicken. I paired that with a cocktail called the blueprint which was honestly one of the best cocktails I have had in a long time. That was worth the $13 but I wish the ramen was maybe 10-11 bucks instead. My friend went with the Kimchi &amp; Fried Chicken and paired that with the penicillin 2 cocktail(which was also amazing based on the couple of sips my friend let me have) and said it was pretty tasty and definitely spicy. He had to go to the bathroom a couple times just so he could blow his nose.We decided to splurge and got some green tea ice cream cones ($3 each) which hit the spot on a very hot summer evening.My friend and I ended up spending way more money then we were planning to but in the end it was a good experience. We just need to get used to spending more money when we are downtown. Everything is so so so expensive."

The broth was lighter and it had a ton of veggies in it.  The Sumo bowl was heavier and had more of basically everything haha.I WISH there was one like this in DC.  SOOOOO RECOMMEND!"

The place wasn&#39;t busy due to the late hour. The bartender saw us looking around to see if there was a server, and she came over to help us. She apologized, got us some water and put in our order. Food was decent as usual. My boo really enjoyed the chicken wings. Much to our surprise at the end of our meal, the hostess stopped by with our &#34;check&#34; and apologized for the long wait and comped us our entire meal!

There was a special sauce that was really good. The pork belly was crisp and salty and somehow also chewy, but in the good way.The ramen came out piping hot and with the typical gigantic proportions. Fortunately they all come with extra ingredients besides what is just on the menu. I love the mushrooms!

The restaurant&#39;s ambiance is pretty great - semi-hipster. It gets pretty crowded after 7 PM on a work-day. I recommend that you call to make a reservation or do it on opentable first. There are outdoor seatings when its warm.FOOD:1. Tonkotsu Ramen (8/10): I added corn and fried chicken into it, rough day at work need some extra calories. The soup was very flavorful, you don&#39;t need to add any extra soy sauce in it. The noodles are not authentic though, I think they use instant ramen noodles. Adding the fried chicken really makes a difference, though. The chashu they give are very fatty (I don&#39;t like it) but the egg, urgh. so good.2. Kimchi Fried Chicken Ramen (6/10): Very flavorful, they give a generous amount of fried chicken. I&#39;de say its a level 8/10 spicy for me. My level of spice tolerance is pretty bad, though.3. Gyoza (5/10): nothing special for its price, just a fancy presentation of the fried flour added on top. The fillings of the gyoza tasted like nothing.4. Sesame Ice Cream - the cone has chocolate fillings in the bottom, I didn&#39;t really like the ice cream in particular, but if I had to order again, I&#39;de choose seseme over green tea5. Green tea Ice Cream - the cone has caramel fillings in the bottom. It tastes like normal bad green tea ice cream, like the ones you get at gyu kaku.Overall, a pretty good restaurant."

I would absolutely order it again.Cute bartender greeted me by saying, &#34;Hi, have you been here before?&#34;  I replied that I had not and asked him for some recommendations. He described his favorite drink, the Yuzu Margarita. He then went on to explain that if I like whiskey, their whiskeys are special Japanese whiskeys worth trying.  I ordered the Yuzu Margarita with house made syrups. The margarita was rimmed with salt, garnished with a lime wedge, and served in a tall, sleek glass.I observed a few of the bartenders and servers mingling on the side of the bar. They were watching their tables at the same time. I never observed any tables with empty glasses or any tables that appeared to be waiting for anything.Drinks were great. Wings were fantastic.

The broth was more like a thick gravy and it wasn&#39;t all that warm upon being served. By the end of the meal, it was downright cold.

I also really enjoyed the ramen but my egg was overcooked and I didn&#39;t get that incredible egg yolk taste mixed with the ramen.

The manager made a trip over before we even ordered to welcome up and thank us for our patronage. Major props. Additionally, we were seated near the entrance and at our request, the wait staff was nice enough to move us to a booth in the back, away from the cold.As for the ramen, I would be doing my california roots a dishonor if I didn&#39;t remark that it was a little expensive. I ordered the fried chicken and kimchi ramen and had to go digging for noodles and chicken. Not really what you want to do when you&#39;re paying ~$15 a bowl + $misc add-ons.I will say though, the smoked salmon appetizer - so money.

It is unique in the area, more akin to something from San Fran or Diego. This review is based upon several trips and focuses more on something tangential to food and drink. We have been to Raman-san several times since OT made its last, standard request to review a trip back in August. We almost never miss a visit there when downtown. The most recent visit (9/24) was not really for a meal at all and was not reserved via OT (not by our choice; we want our points!)Yes, OT, we may want TWO &#34;dinner&#34; reservations on the same night! As excessive as this will sound, on this amazing day, we had sushi lunch and dinner AND still went to Ramen-san to cap the day. We went there for the ice cold Asahi and their famous (if you read my reviews) black sesame ice cream. So, the visit was for sort of a bizarre &#34;nightcap&#34;.My complaint stems from the second &#34;incident&#34; that we have had in the past year surrounding their black sesame ice cream. Clearly, however, unlike the last time, we pissed them off this time. This is what I really want to discuss. The tone and approach of the staff clearly changed after the incident and the manager handled the situation in a very accusational manner, unlike last time.I get that complaining about ice cream sounds pretty petty. However, black sesame ice cream is a rare and wonderful treat! Once before they served us vanilla ice cream covered with black sesame seeds. Their vanilla is good but it is NOT black sesame: something that I have raved about in the past as a &#34;sole source justification&#34; to visit Ramen-san. Like that time, they insisted that it WAS black sesame ice cream. However, with our persistence, during the first incident they eventually discovered that we were indeed correct, that they HAD served us vanilla ice cream and not black sesame, and that it happened because the vanilla was where the black sesame &#34;should&#34; have been (having found the actual black sesame pushed to the back). Not so this time.The approach this time, by the wait staff, manager, and kitchen (we were told) was almost combative. The manager kept telling us that the black sesame ice cream is made from vanilla. Duh! Pretty much all &#34;Japanese flavors&#34; of ice cream (red bean, sesame seed, green tea) served in the U.S. involve adding those flavors to vanilla. The excuse was also lodged that they get their ice cream from a vendor and that they cannot control its quality.The proof is in the flavor and the color. If you go try this (on my recommendation) you are only getting true black sesame ice cream if it is distinctly gray in color (as unappetizing as that might sound). The ice cream (both times a mistake was made) was distinctly white. If you are mixing a black ingredient with a white ice cream you pretty much have to get some shade of gray!My real complaint is with the approach taken by the staff. We made no &#34;demands&#34; and asked for nothing free. We simply wanted to see if the same mistake had been made as before and, if possible, if we could get the real black sesame, as we know it for the past three years. Failing that, we wanted to know if this was the &#34;new normal&#34; so that we did not again make the mistake of coming in specifically to satisfy a craving for black sesame ice cream.We were not accusing them of trying to do anything nefarious. It indeed might be possible that the vendor has changed the manufacturing or formulation or maybe that they simply are really inconsistent from batch to batch. Though, it IS every business&#39;s responsibility to accept accountability for the quality of the vendors that they choose.The real problem was the approach taken by the staff and particularly the manager on this night. We have always found Ramen-san to be a &#34;the customer is always right&#34; sort of place. I get it. I&#39;ve done it. Serving people can REALLY suck. People can be jerks. People can be doing it for nefarious reasons. We were not treated like we were correct this time. In fact, we were treated like we should just leave. Again, we made no scene. We simply made a quiet comment to our waitress. We wanted black sesame ice cream as the perfect end to a perfect day. We didn&#39;t get it; instead we got a dose of attitude to add insult to injury.Sadly, this seems to be a trend that I have observed in the Ramen-san staff overall over the past year. The food and drink still rock. The ambiance is still cool. But they simply are not as customer friendly as they once were. Perhaps they don&#39;t need to take such a friendly approach anymore? Considering their location in a trendy nightclub area and how full they seem to be on such nights, this may well be true. It would be a disappointment. Part of the awesome experience at Ramen-san through the years has been the awesome staff. We did not leave feeling awesome. We left feeling accused. Clearly, late night stops for black sesame ice cream may no longer be warranted...though the ice cold Asahi sure still hit the spot."

Yes, I said &#34;stuff.&#34; They&#39;re clearly trying to fluff up their ramen and make it trendy of whatever, and I don&#39;t mind all the extra crap on top as long as the flavor is great. Hubby and I found the broth to be just ok, and his spicy miso had too much cabbage  in it for his taste.If I lived in the area, I&#39;d probably only come for the buns and to grab a beer.

I&#39;m dreaming about it now as I type.The service is pretty great too...at least in my experience but that might be because I am clearly so excited as soon as I walk in.My only issue with this place is that they forget the corn for my ramen 1/3 times and whenever I do togo orders, they put WAY too much garlic and green onions.But I still give 5 stars because as I mentioned earlier, this is my heaven."

We all got the kimchi fried chicken ramen. It was a little lukewarm when we got it and the fried chicken just didn&#39;t mesh well with the ramen, to be honest. The broth was delicious with a great balance of spice, but other than that, it wasn&#39;t anything memorable - it sure wasn&#39;t cheap either.It was an average ramen experience."

It is pretty pricey for what you get! Be ready to drop at least $15 on a mediocre bowl of ramen. I don&#39;t recommend the shoyu- it kind of tastes like pho and not like ramen. Might be the beef broth, not sure. The kimchi and fried chicken ramen was much better, with the buttered corn, but they are pretty stingy wirh rhe chicken, giving only 4 small pieces.The dessert was really good though! For $5 you can get homemade donuts with a miso caramel dipping sauce. These are light, fluffy, and are just sweet enough. The dipping sauce is definitely worth the calories. Dessert saved the meal for us, otherwise we would have left disappointed.It gets pretty crowded here! You can sit at the counter though for a quick meal. The food comes out pretty quickly. Also, service is friendly and efficient.Sidr note- check out the bathrooms- they have really cool sinks!"

My husband had the standard tonkotsu, while I was adventurous with the mapo tofu style ramen. Both were sooo good, but what made both dishes stand out was the chashu *smoked* pork belly!

Perfectly steamed pillowy Chinese bun encasing a juicy on the inside (watched the juice literally drip from my mouth) and crispy on the outside with asian slaw and leaf parsley.  I could see myself coming in here secretly with my drawstring pants and a disguise mustache to inhale twenty of these as a last meal option.Lastly, the braised short rib &#34;shoyu&#34; (my favorite Hawaiian word) ramen noodle bowl.  The bowl comes out with a ladle (though a spoon-fork hybrid would have been a better choice,  combining a broth-cradling spoon with noodle-sticking prongs.  While the taste of the beef was succulent, there simply was not enough of it (in comparison to my friends tonkatsu pork belly portion).  Plenty of noodles, green onion, and enoki (I refer to them as alien looking antenna shrooms).  Needed a smidge more salt, but I used the soy on the table for added flavor.  In my opinion, I think there wasn&#39;t enough meat to satisfy the price of the bowl.I would come back for the mantou buns all the way.  Next time I&#39;ll have the tonkatsu ramen bowl, much more flavor and priced right."

It came with pork, scallions, nori, and an egg on top of what appears to be a pancake.- Skirt steak and tonkotsu ramen (from the Express Lunch menu): I really enjoyed both entrees. The steak was cooked to perfection. The tonkotsu ramen had a thick broth consistency and was savory. The salad didn&#39;t blow me away, and the cucumber side was okay.- Toasted black sesame ice cream cone: OMG, SO GOOD. I would eat 10 of these if I could, but my body won&#39;t allow it.- Shaved ice dessert: There was slightly an excessive amount of condensed milk and only mango toppings. I wish they added additional toppings or at least more mangoes because the ice-to-topping ratio was off.My friend was in disbelief that I ate half the giant pork belly appetizer, my entire entree, and all of the ice cream cone and shaved ice dessert.

The Tonkotsu broth was very rich and delicious! The pork slices were also generous and incredibly flavorful, charred to perfection. Every ingredient in this ramen dish added great depth of flavor. The noodles also had a great texture, very fresh and bouncy! The egg was the perfect consistency where it was runny and made the broth just that much more delicious!

Surprisingly good! Really liked the broth and who doesn&#39;t love a runny egg?!Yuzu Lemonade $4 - Very Yuzu-y.

They offer three different kinds on the weekends until 2pm and I highly suggest getting over there to give these a go. We had the ham, cheese and kewpie mayo okonomiyaki which was delicious! Okonomiyaki is like a Japanese pancake with batter but mixed with other veggies &amp; often octopus shreddings! Yum yum yummmmm!With our delicious starter and the express lunch, my belly was beyond full plus I took home some leftovers.

That will be mine.  Stopped through yesterday and it was stellar. The staff, like always, was friendly and engaging. Recommended the Berkshire ham &amp; American Cheese option. I was more that happy to take that suggestion because all three combos looked awesome and I couldn&#39;t decide on my own.  I added some steamed buns too because A) I&#39;m a fat kid and B) hello steamed buns.I thought brunch wouldn&#39;t get better that my teenage mutant ninja turtle coffee mug...but it did. The steamed buns were perfection. Fried chicken was juicy inside and crispy outside and a nice sized piece of meat. The pork belly was fantastic, with just enough acid from the pickles to cut through the fatty richness.My Okonomiyaki was everything I hoped for. It had crazy umami flavor and such a great blend of flavor and textures. I was happy with my choice...I can&#39;t wait to try the octopus/brisket version.  Ended brunch with Black Sesame Ice Cream. Great end to an awesome treat yourself brunch.The food is great but on top of that the environment is welcoming and inviting. The soundtrack is top notch.

I believe we were seated at one of the communal tables which also doubled for tables for bigger parties.I ordered the tonkotsu ramen bowl- pork broth, nori, egg, 3 pieces of pork belly, plenty of sliced green onion, fried garlic bits, and pickled ginger. I found the pork broth to be tasty, but not as flavorful as I would have liked. Maybe I should have gone with the other pork ramen bowl (it was a special that night mentioned by the waiter), where the pork broth was said to have been simmering for 16-18 hours instead of Ramen-san&#39;s usual 8 hours. The egg was also slightly overdone. I liked the fried garlic and pickled ginger a lot and the pork belly itself was wonderful. I found some of my ramen noodles to be really stuck and clumped together (almost smushed into large dough chunks) instead of the usual individual noodle strands.Overall, decent ramen in the city but there are better places to check out for sure. The service was good, clean bathrooms, and reasonable prices. Solid 3.5 stars, but I&#39;m upping it to 4 for the nice ambiance and service."

I noticed the bamboo looked and tasted just like the sad canned stuff I used to mix into home-made stir fry. Whatever, onto the rest. What, ginger in ramen?? I read this in another&#39;s review, and I was surprised also. Whatever, let me try the pork.Oh my... Prior to this, I was familiar with Berkshire pork but had never tried it. Words can&#39;t really describe how stellar it is, other than to say that I&#39;m salivating right now, thinking about it. That layer of thick fat just melts in your mouth. And the flavor in that pork. I&#39;d think such a delectable piece of meat would be lost in a bowl of soup, but it&#39;s really what made up for everything else.All that said, I&#39;d consider returning solely for the pork."

The Tonkotsu broth was very flavorful and thick. The noodles were perfect with the right amount of chewiness. However, there were way too much ginger! At first, I didn&#39;t really notice because the flavor of the tonkotsu, noodles, and bamboo shoots covered the taste of ginger. But with each additional bit, my chances of biting a piece of shredded ginger increased until I almost every bite was filled with ginger in the end. Personally, I think ginger should not be added to ramen.The egg was also a disappointment. When the ramen came, about half the yolk was gone already, presumably dissolved in the broth. The yolk is the best part....Overall it was ok. I feel like for the price I paid, I can probably get better ramen elsewhere."

I just need to get this little complaint out of the way. I phoned in my order for carryout. I arrived at the time the food was suppose to be ready, then I waited another 25 minutes past my promised pick up time. Which then meant I wasn&#39;t going to have time to fully savor my soup for lunch. I now had to slurp it down like an American in a hurry at lunch. At least, the guy at the host station was apologetic. He told me that after my order was placed a giant party was seated and the restaurant got slammed. The apology still didn&#39;t get me my soup on time but at least he acknowledged they had made a mistake.I had ordered the spicy miso with ground pork, napa cabbage &amp; kung pao chilies because the description in the menu reminded me of a bowl I had in Japan. I also decided to add another helping of noodles to the miso. I always hate running out of noodles and that&#39;s the Sicilian in me.  Keep giving me pasta and I am a happy person. I even added some fried garlic which really took the dish up in my opinion.  Every slurp was amazing and I didn&#39;t want the bowl to end. I also loved the packaging. Taking soup for carryout can sometimes be tricky but they had that covered. No hot soup was spilled prior to eating or writing this review.Once I finally got my food, I took my carryout order over to the Chicago River. I had a great view while I slurped down my miso. I&#39;ll say it again, &#34;MISO HAPPY&#34;! It was also a beautiful day which always makes it nicer. This fall has been very pleasant in Chicago and I&#39;m trying to take advantage of every single warm bonus day.I loved how the soup took me pack to Asia and I didn&#39;t have to fly anywhere. The chefs here definitely did their research when they prepared this dish. I love an authentic dish. I really enjoy it when I can compare a Chicago restaurant dish to an authentic dish from my travels and the taste was spot on. This makes me a happy foodie. I look forward to another bowl of this yummy spiciness in my future. I am sure it will taste even better during the colder months of our Chicago winter."

We made reservations because you know, we are SOMETIMES considerate, we were sat right away. River North is so beautiful and has another wonderful restaurant to add to its repertoire. It was bustling in there. Tables filling up super fast and you can hear that hip hop playing in the background and another wonderful sound.....SLURPING!Our waiter served us right away, SAKE BOMBS!!!! (Don&#39;t judge me! We were celebrating and it was a long week). For starters we had some of those buns (Baos) the fried chicken and pork belly- were delectable! Bravo! Of Course I had the tonkotsu (extra chili oil and fried garlic added for an additional price-worth every penny!). The broth was beautifully rich without  it not being too thick and the meat was tender and complemented the noodles so well. I have had many bowls of ramen, some bad, some good...this one was spectacular. It was an amazing bowl of ramen and I can&#39;t believe I devoured it so fast.Things can get a little expensive there but I have zero complaints about the meal. There is lots of communal-esque type of seating and a few booths scattered about. On the table they have hot chili flakes, salt and pepper mix to add to this beautiful creation.TVs adorning the walls and a full service bar., Easy to get to via public transportation and pay to park on the street if you can find it. Service was fast and friendly."

The place was packed and it had good music playing. I liked the venue it self, it was nice with exposed bricks and projector TV. We shared one kimchi and fried chicken ramen because it was our first time trying. The broth had a kick to it and it was unexpected but it was really good. The fried chicken was still crispy but there were like three pieces of chicken. It was good for a one time try but we wouldn&#39;t come back again."

The ramen itself is tough. Its not the best I&#39;ve had in the area but that&#39;s a tough comparison with ramen shops popping up all over the place. The food complemented by the great staff and nice vibes though is definitely worth the visit. I really enjoyed the old school music, heard some Biggie Smalls. Trenton, behind the bar, was extremely helpful and really added to the ambiance for a lot of the guests.The brunch looked very unique too. I&#39;m going to have to come back and try!"

As far as the broth went, the I appreciated that they didn&#39;t overload with the salt; Very balanced amount of garlic too. That said, the Tonkotsu broth I ordered didn&#39;t have the same depth of flavor as some other ramen that I&#39;ve had, so it didn&#39;t really set itself apart on that front. The fried egg I had tasted a little more overdone then I&#39;m used to(aka not perfectly soft-boiled) as well. On the upside, they gave a decent amount of pork belly, and it tended to be a little bit leaner than some chashu pork I&#39;ve had at other spots; That&#39;s a pro or con depending on what you&#39;re looking for(and sort of goes in theme with a less fatty and intense broth here). Friends got the Shio ramen and also the Tonkotsu and they seemed to think it was alright.I&#39;ve heard that the Sumo bowl, which is both a larger portion and spicier, is the real standout at Ramen-san, so if I ever find myself urging to coming back here I&#39;ll order that. Otherwise, for my ramen and hip-hop needs, I&#39;m in no hurry to come back anytime soon."

After a recent visit to Slurpin&#39; Turtle just down the street, I didn&#39;t have much expectations coming into here but was pleasantly surprised both by the service and food.We started with their smoked salmon nigiri, which was an excellent starter to get those taste buds movin&#39; &amp; groovin&#39;. Would describe this as a sushi like appetizer which consisted of rice wrapped in thinly sliced cucumber topped with their delicate smoked salmon &amp; wasabi caviar. Unique &amp; tasty!For my main dish, I went for their special which was their &#34;fatty&#34; tonkatsu ramen, basically a double cooked/marinade of their house tonkatsu broth. HELLA PORKY, HELLA GOOD. My only gripe on this was the portion. As explained by our waitress, it comes with 2oz of pork so I added extra chashu pork for $4. I was expecting a double amount of meat, but it came out half with this super tender pork belly and half with this overly crispy pork belly ends that weren&#39;t as delicious. The standard portion of noodles is kinda weak IMO for ~$15, but you can add more for an additional charge. Aside from my complaints, overall it was a solid bowl of ramen just be prepared to add in extras to make it an excellent bowl of ramen. Oh yeah, don&#39;t forget to ask for a side of fresh chopped garlic to dump in. Our waitress looked at me like I was crazy, since she was explaining how it already came with garlic oil/sauce in there... Manager came thru personally with the chopped garlic as requested. I was a happy camper.I did mention the service here being really good. Upon being seated we were personally welcomed by the manager which was a nice way to start our dining experience. In addition, we were seated at the booth closest to the door however whenever the front door opened we&#39;d get a nice draft of cold air from outside. Upon request of moving, they were able to move us with no problem at all despite it being relatively busy. Much appreciated!Anyways, &#39;til next time, cheers!"

The place was pretty busy when I showed up to get my order. I was told 20 minutes and came around 35 but still sat around and waited. Came around 47 minutes, but they were pretty busy and pleasant about it.Main issue, I didn&#39;t not like the tonkotsu ramen. Main problem, the soup came room temperature to almost cool.Hot, the ramen may have been decent. The meat was tasty. The food portion is modest. It comes nicely separated, soup in a separate container, noodles and meat in a paper bowl. I could eat 2 bowls of ramen.Not a great take out place, may be worth another try dining in."

It&#39;s filling and tastes good enough.However given Ramen-san&#39;s popularity (and prices), I expected the flavors to be more complex. The tofu and egg in my ramen soup, for example, weren&#39;t even marinated. Do you know what un-marinated tofu tastes like? Nothing! And the chicken broth  tasted like something I could have picked up from Whole Foods for $8. Very disappointing.Overall, I think the culinary experience was fairly bland. I&#39;ll attribute Ramen-san&#39;s popularly to its location in a touristy, party district. Look elsewhere for really flavorful, imaginative ramen."

One of the best pork bellies I&#39;ve had in Chicago ramen shops. The only regret is the most important component of ramen didn&#39;t meet to par: the soup base was too watered down. I&#39;ve had better soup at Strings, Urbanbelly and Slurping Turtle.The ambience of Ramen-san is probably what makes the restaurant trendy and popular.

No wait at all, awesome.We ate at one of the high tables in the back, I liked the set-up, but it was not ideal for my larger work bag. The hooks under the table, because of the size of my work bag, crossed over into the next seating area (sorry to the person sitting next to me).I really enjoyed the quick lunch menu. It gave me the opportunity to try a few different things and it was the right portion size for lunch.

The server managed to apologize and &#34;kinda&#34; wipe it away. But it was still on the edge of my table and on the seat. They didn&#39;t even offer to ask to take it back to put more soup in or ask if I wanted a new one (I would have said no, but it&#39;s the thought that counts). Also, because they didn&#39;t completely wipe it off the seat, I had a hard time getting out of the booth without getting soup broth on my dress.Kinda disappointed in the lack of service.

For some reason they dunked the fried chicken in the ramen so it was well... soggy... The broth was not overly salted like some other places, so that was nice. Noodles were so so.My main problems were not the food, though the person I was with hated their ramen. The bar tables (of which compose most of the seating) were really hard to sit on for short people and so my back started hurting sort of soon. There are hooks under the table which are a plus, but they&#39;re kind of small which nearly negates the point of putting effort into having hooks there. more restaurants should give hooks for bags. everyone has bags nowadays, and i&#39;m sure tired of putting them on the floor. if you can invest in molecular gastronomy or local organic non-gmo whatever the heck food you can screw a hook onto your desk OK+1 : sesame seed grinder and chili oilThe ice cream at the end was good, $3 though, for a borderline offensively sized scoop. I appreciate the black sesame flavor and the chocolate filling was a good idea.+1: nice server- 0.0001: the group of four next to me did a sake bombIt&#39;s also really, really loud, like, bar loud in there... I got a headache and had to take an Advil, which was annoying.The hamachi plate was a stupid ripoff. sashimi is the most hilarious scam in the history ofi wouldn&#39;t go here again even if ryuichi sakamoto replied to my tweet and said he was in chicago and wanted to get some ramen here. it&#39;s too loud hear, damage your hearing loud. maybe he&#39;d agree.verdict: cross the street and buy three donuts from firecaks"

So we went to Ramen-san since it was close to all the other bars.We actually weren&#39;t disappointed with the Tonkatsu ramen. The &#34;molten-egg&#34;, which is basically the soft-boiled egg was quite on point and the chashu they used, though didn&#39;t have a lot, was cut thick and pretty flavorful. The noodles they used are the medium-sized curly noodles similar to the ones at Daikokuya and the broth was a bit on the peppery side.The ramen in Chicago is definitely a lot more expensive than the ramen in Los Angeles, but I am glad I am able to slightly compare the two cities based on Asian cuisine. The Tonkatsu ramen itself was 14 dollars, so my boyfriend and I decided to just share one since we weren&#39;t that hungry (after all we did eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner that day so this was our after-drinking snack). We got an extra molten egg, which is the other half of the egg for a dollar, as well as extra noodles, which was a $2.50 charge. Overall, we ended up paying 11 bucks per person, which isn&#39;t bad at all compared to how one bowl of Tonkatsu ramen was 14 bucks!"

Those seeking that should adjust their expectations.I&#39;ve had Ramen in Japan on several occasions and this is not that. Rather it is more of an American spin on Ramen. They used to have a BBQ brisket ramen and now have a short-rib ramen, both unique and very &#34;un-authentic&#34; but still tasty.I have been coming here since opening and I have always been treated very well. Very good service in a casual, fun, loud downtown environment. I prefer their original drink menu as compared to the new one but beer is probably what you should be drinking here anyway.So sure, you can find Ramen more similar to that in Tokyo elsewhere but it&#39;s worth coming for the overall experience, friendly people and service plus on a cold day a bowl of hot ramen can really hit the spot.One last thing, the late night fried rice is generally great. I would love it if they made it available at all hours because it is super satisfying.What to eat: Short Rib or Tonkastu ramen. Both of these are rich and mild. They do have spicier ramen if you prefer that, I do not.What to drink: Draft Asahi beer or a bottle of White Owl beerGet the fried rice if you can and expect a crowded, high energy space."

Then we each had a bowl of the tonkatsu ramen (added bok choy) and it was some of the best we&#39;ve had anywhere.

The shave ice was surprisingly tasty too, I&#39;m normally not a fan. The strawberries in this one were a huge perk!They have a couple of beers to choose from and a lot of Japanese whiskey that you can make a selection from. The pours are a bit expensive for whiskey that is unknown to me, but I assume that&#39;s due to import costs :).I was sitting nearby the bar and as the Friday evening crowd started coming in the bar got jam packed and people kept bumping into us.

The service and food was all excellent.From the outside, the restaurant is quite simple. Simple black awning with a simple sign. When you walk in, the decór is simple yet urban modern. Open brick walls, intimate lighting, and simple wooden tables. Some were high tops and others were booths. We were seated at a high top and found to our surprise that there was a purse hook!  Now there was a girl behind the scene when designing this restaurant. The tables are high with high bench seats with no backs so space would be limited if there were 4 people sitting at these tables.We started with the raw tuna appetizer. There are 3 larger crackers per order topped off with tuna tartar and poblano chile guacamole.  The poblano gives this app a little kick, and the cracker has savory sesame seeds on it.  This app is savory, fresh, and light. It doesn&#39;t fill you up for the main course.I ordered the mapo doufu ramen (excuse my spelling).  Anybody familiar with the Chinese dish, mapo tofu, this ramen captures all essence of it!  Its spicy but not too spicy. The broth is very comforting and the noodle was aldente! There&#39;s a great balance between noodle to broth, with lots of tofu and pork! I definitely will order the kimchi fried chicken next! My friend ordered this and the broth was a touch spicier and I really liked the corn and kimchi!They do have a dessert menu however I was too full to try it.  Next time Ramen-San! You got me hooked!"

I peeked at the menu and found the pescatarian options erring on the boring side. So why 4 stars? Because things can surprise you when you&#39;re least expecting it.The group started out with drinks and the manfriend and I split the raw tuna starter. I ordered a cilantro-lime margarita; I ended up having two of these, not because I loved them, but because nothing else on the menu struck my fancy and I was too lazy to ask for something else. The drink was a little too sweet, the second drink clinched it and I regretted not opting for something different. To me, the drink would&#39;ve been better with some spice (other than the glass rim) to cut the sweetness. The group also shared the pure dusk and crazy milk sake. At our server&#39;s recommendation, we drank them side-by-side and enjoyed their differences.When our server covered the specials, I was delighted to hear a shrimp curry ramen. I don&#39;t know a lot about ramen, but I know what I ordered was not a traditional bowl. That said, I enjoyed my meal; I&#39;ve had better ramens, but I think this one was solid for what it was. At the end of our meal, our server treated us to their doughnuts. They were warm and doughy and the dipping sauce was delectable.Overall, the food was good, but not out of this world. What really knocked my socks off was how great our server was. Friendly, funny, and on point all night. We all loved her."

Not much complexity in the broth flavors, but overall serviceable execution of ramen.It&#39;s the service that distinguishes the restaurant from others though...Amarit- the manager - is incredible and should write the book on customer service in restaurants. He catered to our questions about ingredients and preparation style with an enthusiasm and expertise that cannot be equalled.We ordered 2 ramen bowls- the pork broth and the soft shell crab - which were both pretty good. I preferred the pork and my wife the crab, so it worked out nicely.Our 2 year old was with us and they catered to her very well. She loved the pork ramen as well."

Smack Shack has no idea how to handle what is essentially the perfect ingredient and the way they prepare it in both the boil and the &#34;original&#34; roll should be construed as a direct insult to you as a paying customer, as well as the hardworking lobstermen and women fishing off the Maine coast. This place not only made me reconsider the lobster, it has also shaken my faith in the people of Minneapolis.To elaborate, the lobster prepared in the giant boil kettle out front have been cooked so long that the bright red color has already leached out of the shell by the time it hits your table. The meat ends up stringy and waterlogged. Any of the &#34;Easter egg&#34; bits (like tiny strip of meat in the legs) that make eating a lobster a fun ritual have been cooked out.On the original style lobster roll, low quality lobster dregs are chopped to shreds and mixed with a too-salty reddish(?) mayo that is overpowered by tarragon. I&#39;m not a purist and have had many traditional and modern lobster rolls in Maine and elsewhere. There are certainly many in Chicago that put this version to shame. You are better off ordering the Connecticut style if you absolutely have to get a lobster roll here, but it&#39;s only going to manage to be acceptable.The reason why I can&#39;t give Smack Shack one star is they actually have some decent menu items that are prepared well. The grits are great as many have noted. There is the chance I will even end up at Smack Shack again for their brunch one of these weekends. But if I&#39;m wanting a lobster prepared well, I will spend my time and money elsewhere every time and so should you."

I like that the menu is short so it&#39;s easy to choose but I probably won&#39;t go back.

That day they were featuring some east coast ones, served with lemon slices, horseradish, and an onion/balsamic(?) dressing as well. We also shared the lobster poutine, which wasn&#39;t skimpy on the lobster or cheese curds. The Hurricane doesn&#39;t play.

The selection of the oysters were very limited but it represented good options for the west and east coast oysters. I tried a few of the oysters and were very impressed with the quality and the freshness of the oyster. The lobster roll was very heavenly. Generous amount of lobster was poured into the bread and Da Lobsta is peanut compared to Smack Shack.However, for an expensive joint (aka not red lobster), I had some expectation on the service component of the restaurants. The waitress today didn&#39;t seem to be very focused and was not knowledgable about the menu. When asked about the oysters, she was giving some attitude to me. I would prefer if she went to her manager and obtained clarifying answer. Later on, when I tried to get her attention for water or clean utensils, she ignored me and was acting busy helping other table. Ironically the restaurant was only 10% filled at 11.40am today. I ended up taking utensils from the other vacant table. I hate to talk smack about smack shack.....In a nutshell, I love the oysters and the lobster roll here. However, with service that approached red lobster quality (or worse?), I am not sure that I want to re-visit this venue again with friends or clients."

Overall I&#39;m giving a 3 stars rating on Yelp for the below reasons:Lack of consistency in overall experience:--During the 1st visit (dinner), service was prompt, server was friendly, personable, made the effort to have a convo with us. The carafe of water was always on the table so our water glasses never went empty since we could refill them ourselves. The server was visible at all times but not intrusive.--During the 2nd visit (brunch), I&#39;m assuming that because the crowd is much less at this time, they staff less people on the floor. I can understand that but not if it impacts service. Our server took awhile to greet us and filled our water glasses. Took awhile for him to return to take our order. All this while, our water glasses set empty for a noticeable amount of time. This time there was no water carafe left on our table either so I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s standard practice in this place. There appeared to be no bussers. The server didn&#39;t have the support to carry out his job efficiently. We did end up getting our water glasses refilled after awhile, but it was sometime again before they got filled again. We were almost finished with our meal when the server decided to leave the water carafe on our table. The server wasn&#39;t very much visible at most times either.Food was good, not mind blowing:--Food here was good. Just not outstanding. I&#39;m a firm believer that what you pay is what you get and fair enough, the menu pricing reflects that.--I&#39;m a huge fan of mussels. I tried the mussels here and the flesh was small and not juicy (the broth that came with it had great depth and flavor though). Compared to other places where I always get the mussels, the flesh is plump and juicy. Well, this is also because I paid $13 for the mussels at Smack Shack vs ~$20 at other places. We got the lobster boil and while the price was fair, the quality was not excellent and just fine.Smack Shack felt very much like a place that was a level above Red Lobster. In the West Loop/Fulton Market where above-average and outstanding restaurants define the neighborhood, I appreciate Smack Shack offering an affordable price range for people to have seafood. However in order for them to sustain and compete in the neighborhood, they really need to be on their game with providing a great experience for customers every time. When I go out to eat, I look for the entire experience. I did not really get that here.Also, not sure why in their restrooms, they use Cowshed hand cream BUT not Cowshed hand wash? Weirdly, they seem to have taken a used Cowshed bottle, washed it clean and filled it with a generic hand soap?!"

I love lobster and guacamole and never had them together. There was a nice amount of lobster in the appetizer, but the guacamole was not seasoned well and the chips were greasy. Crab cakes - nice portion, but nothing special. I came here for the Lobster Roll. I decided to go with the Connecticut style lobster roll. It had a ridiculous amount of lobster!!!! Unfortunately, the sandwich was so dry. I asked for more butter and sauce after two bites and I still was unable to make it work! We also had the Fried Chicken and Lobster Mac n Cheese. The Fried Chicken was the best item we had. This is a seafood restaurant, so that was not what I was expecting. At least all was not lost. In fact, we order the Fried Chicken because the waiter said it was one of his two favorite items on the menu. This should&#39;ve been a red flag. The Lobster Mac n Cheese was horrible. There&#39;s very little lobster, which was not a deal breaker, considering how much lobster the roll and guacamole had. It was the mac n cheese that was the issue. It was runny and not flavorful, very bland in general.Atmosphere - the bar area is nice, especially for enjoying a drink on a nice summer day or night. The rest of the restaurant doesn&#39;t really feel like it would meet the expectations of people who frequent the West Loop.

Looking at their lunch menu (the Minneapolis version), the food sounded delicious, so I wanted to try this place out with my dad. I admittedly did not look at the Chicago menu and I should have because I was disappointed with the lack of selection.Location- This place is next to the Google HQ and some neighboring restaurants are Swift &amp; Sons and Bar Takito. The space has a nice bar with TVs and a nice boiler area in the main dining room which you can see right when you walk in. Parking is stressful and difficult. We had to circle around multiple times until we found paid street parking on Halsted.Food- Like I had mentioned before, I only saw the Minneapolis (original location) menu, not the Chicago menu. I was expecting to see the large extensive Minneapolis menu with the lobster mac and cheese, fish &amp; chips, salmon, shack towers (towers of jumbo shrimp, mussels, lobster, and king crab legs, 6 different types of po boys, and even the lobster boil (served with red potatoes, Polish sausage, corn on the cob, and butter).When the waitress gave us the menu, I was dumbfounded. Seriously? I go to a lobster restaurant and there&#39;s only 2 lobster rolls, 2 appetizers (chicken wings and lobster guacamole), one type of soup (clam chowder), 3 types of salads (BLT, Caesar, Lobster Cobb), 1 of which has lobster in it, and 2 po boys (Shrimp or Andouille Sausage) and a burger, neither of which have lobster in it. Of the 11 items I just named in the whole menu, only 4 items have lobster... I&#39;m not going out of my way to go to a lobster restaurant to eat guacamole or salad topped with lobster. So that leaves me with the lobster rolls as my only choice for lunch. Where&#39;s the lobster boil that I saw on Instagram posted on the very same day?! This was very misleading considering it wasn&#39;t on the menu for lunch yet the Instagram told people to come for lunch to try it. My dad and I got the Smack Sauce Wings (9 wings) with hot sauce and bacon blue cheese dressing. I liked the sauce but it didn&#39;t taste hot, more on the sweeter side. The chicken was crispy and juicy. Our lobster rolls were yummy with large pieces of lobster cooked perfectly wrapped in warm buttery Texas Toast bread. The chips had the right amount of salt and crunch. The food made up for the lack of selection in lobster...Service- It was good, we were seated right away and the waitress was attentive, refilled our drinks and took away our plates when we were done. I thought it was weird that she refilled my dad&#39;s Coke with a can of Coke lol I haven&#39;t seen that before.Verdict- I really want to recommend this place because the lobster rolls and chicken wings were delicious. However, why is the lunch menu so small? This is supposed to be a lobster restaurant and only 2 options out of 11 have lobster as the main course. Where&#39;s the lobster mac &amp; cheese and lobster boil that were advertised as available for lunch on Instagram? I would&#39;ve given this place 4 stars due to the lobster rolls but due to misleading advertising, 3 stars. The menu needs to be expanded otherwise it&#39;s not worth a trip to lunch here."

I love seafood, and I do really like the layout and the atmosphere of the restaurant. The food was not bad, it wasn&#39;t phenomenal, I feel that there are at least a dozen of seafood restaurants in the city that do as good of a job or better.What I am appalled at is their BYOB practice. My friend was excited to try a couple of bottles of wine he just got and so he called to asked if they were BYOB and they said that they were, but there was a corkage fee. We really didn&#39;t think much of it, until we got our bill.The corkage fee was $25 dollars per bottle. I feel like if you are going to charge such an exorbitant fee, either make sure to tell your customers this, or just ban BYOB altogether.Mediocre service combined with mediocre food and a surprising high corkage fee will make me think twice about coming back to Smackdown shack."

This is a beautiful restaurant with an open kitchen, lots of light, open windows, and seafaring theme. We started with drinks at the bar. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the restaurant history from it&#39;s original location in Minnesota. We started with a drink and weren&#39;t really hungry so just browsed the menu. What I did find really annoying was that they were playing Top 40/hip-hop or what I call Millennial music. It just didn&#39;t fit the theme or the price point and no one in the place was under 38. I was buzzed so I tweeted them and interestingly they responded quickly and politely said they will play whatever we wanted. I suggested some music like classic rock, 80&#39;s/90&#39;s, alternative rock, and seafaring music.2) Came back here for lunch and it did not disappoint. First, the music was upgraded to Foster the People and Foo Fighters from what I can remember. I got the Connecticut style lobster roll which had a very generous portion of lobster that overflowed the butter-grilled New England style roll. Best lobster roll I&#39;ve had in Chicago. Fries were good but a little too thick and overcooked for my taste. Waitress was nice but curt and indifferent."

The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and the lobsters are the freshest ever...kept in a tank on site and cooked in a huge old bay spiced vat along with potatos, corn and sausage. We got an appetizer and split the lobster boil and were glad we did; it was very filling. Overall,  a very enjoyable meal- I didn&#39;t even want to take off my bib.

This restaurant is fairly new and been opened for two months. The restaurant decor is really nice and had great ambiance. Our waitress was really nice and was attentive to our needs. My friends and I started out with the wings and lobster guacamole and they were both great. Both my friends had the lobster rolls which was great to except the  roll needed more sauce. I had the burger called Lobster Lucy and the only complaint I have about it is you don&#39;t get enough lobster meat. My friends and I agreed we will definitely go back to this place and tried the seafood boil and other items on the menu. Overall we enjoy our experience here and would recommend others to try this place.

Um, amaze balls. I love the space itself in the ever growing Fulton Market area. Can you say hot, hot, hot. Like so timely.Plenty of seating in the bar area, which features an open window concept perfect for warm nights. Upstairs there is ample seating for a dining room experience. We sat upstairs for our table for 4, and upon being seated we were able to cruise by the tank where the lobsters come to die. Very cool (morbid, but cool). Our waiter was fantastic on suggesting dishes as this was everyone&#39;s first time. Do yourself a favor and order the Alaskan King Crab dip. You just must. It&#39;s warm and crabby in all the right ways;) our dining partners dined on oysters and said those were very yummy. The menu is huge...oozing with many innovative seafood dishes, as well as the classics. I got a lobster roll which was BY FAR the most substantial roll I&#39;ve gotten to date. The comps in the area do not even compare. I&#39;m looking at you GT and Dusek&#39;s... So much lobster, so much roll, yet not so much left on my plate after I devoured it. My boo had the shrimp and grits which he adored. And my friend had the 5 lb...yes you read that right 5 lb king crab. Let me tell you shells were flying everywhere in a blaze of glory!No room for dessert because the portions are hearty. Everyone loved their  meals. The only downside was trying to decide what we wanted to order. Can&#39;t wait to come back and sink my chompers in dat shrimp po&#39; boy! Ohhhhh yeahhhh!!!"

The lobster Mac and cheese was so extreme creamy that it could barely be swallowed...how can you mess up Mac and cheese?!? Lastly tried the clam chowder. Gross. It was also so thick and within 1 minute at our table it was starting to congeal at the top. The cornbread was decent. The butter was probably my favorite part of the meal.Lastly, the atmosphere - with how cheap the food tasted, I felt like I was in a TGI Fridays....except that restaurant can serve good food.

Tonight is their opening night and my husband and I stopped by for an early dinner. It is a HUGE space. If word gets out about how great it is, I think they should be able to fill the place up regularly. It is little off the beaten path (next to Google, around the corner from Swift &amp; Sons), so I hope it gets the traffic it deserves.We expected some kinks, being that it was their first night, but for the most part, everything went smooth! They did not have our reservation (we called earlier to make one), but it was no big deal since the restaurant was empty. It opened at 5, we got there at 5, so that is to be expected. It was fun to be the first person seated on their opening night.We were seated in the main dining room, near the kitchen. I actually really liked the seat because it was clear they were doing a lot of training in the kitchen and it was interesting to watch. The bar area would also be a fun place to sit. They were opening up the glass window/doors to take advantage of the nice weather tonight. Would be a great place to have drinks and dinner on a summer night.Our server, Confessor, came over right away. He was attentive and friendly the entire meal. We started with some drinks - I had a rum punch, my husband had an old fashioned. Both were great - mine was very strong. Next we had appetizers. We ordered the lobster guacamole and the lobster bisque. Delicious. Both had big chucks of lobster. Two large claws in the soup and enough in the guacamole that I had a little with every bite. For our main course, my husband had the Connecticut lobster roll and I had the lobster mac &amp; cheese. My husband has wanted a Connecticut lobster roll ever since I declined to wait 2 hours for one when we were in Boston. It did not disappoint. the bread was great and the warm, buttery lobster was perfect.  The lobster mac &amp; cheese was equally delightful. This stuff was SO rich and cheesy. I have no idea what cheese they used, but it was perfect. Again, LOTS of lobster in there. They do not skimp on the lobster at this place. The meal was spaced out perfectly and we left feeling full and happy.I think this is a unique addition to the Chicago food scene - nothing else like it. We will definitely be back!"

That is what I was told.  Ha..We got the bill and it was for 1 and 1/2 pds not just 1. I suggest they put the price on the menu for what you have to order.

Parking was surprisingly easy as we located on-street parking just two blocks away. When we walked to the restaurant we discovered that they have valet parking which is a good option to have since parking would almost certainly be a challenge as the evening wears on.The restaurant has a very nice vibe when you enter and the decor is understated but very nice. The red/white checkered tablecloths were covered with heavy white paper as you&#39;d find in many fish restaurants, cloth napkins and nice decor on the walls. The music...they might want to work on that. We saw one large-screen television but it was off. We were greeted warmly by the hostess and by servers as they passed us at the host station. Our server, Gregory B, was prompt and provided recommendations when we asked. The wine list was good and our water glasses were filled whenever they were running low. The menu, while not pages long, had several dishes that we considered ordering. Ultimately we went with crab cakes and shrimp and grits. De. Light. Ful. Both meals were great--as was our wine. The key lime pie came in a large portion and was one of the best I&#39;ve had lately. So, the food and service were all good.The only thing that was disappointing was that during the time we were there, no manager came to check on us. I would have expected this since the restaurant is fairly new and was fairly empty while we were there. It definitely started to fill as we lingered and I have no doubt that there would be a wait sooner than later...which is exactly why someone could/should have stopped by before the rush. At this price point, which I classify as &#34;pricey but totally worth it&#34;, send someone over to say &#34;hey&#34; just like your competition does. I&#39;ll be back &#39;cause it was that good."

We decided to try out this new neighborhood spot on a Sunday evening. We were very eager to try several things on the menu. We started with the Sea Bass Ceviche- decent flavor if you like red peppers, a lot of them. It was served on a leaf and while that is aesthetically pleasing, it makes it hard to scoop up with the chips they serve. Needs to be served in a bowl. Next, we split the lobster roll. Very good flavor but Gilt Bar&#39;s is night and day better. We ordered a half order of the lobster mac and cheese. This was the clear winner. Our last dish was the Juicy Lucy. Now when I splurge on a burger I want it to be worth it. Chicago has some ah-mazing burger places and a burger stuffed with lobster sounded like it&#39;d fit right in. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. It was served to us not just well done, but CRSIPY. We each took one bite of the burger and did not eat anymore. The problem came when we let the server know it was over done. He shrugged his shoulders- no apology, nothing. We didn&#39;t push the issue. But if you are going to charge $20 for a burger, your chef had better know how to cook it! In general the service was pretty bad. He took over 15 minutes to bring a glass of wine, did not serve any of the food to us, nor checked on what we thought. He could have cared less and the restaurant was not even 1/4 full. This place charges River North prices with McDonald&#39;s service. Go back to Minneapolis, Smack Shack. Chicago has higher expectations."

However, my experience won&#39;t be bringing me back. Very expensive and not worth it. The food is just okay, albeit over-salted. Every fish dish we had was salty. Portions are small and the way they portion things out make no sense. I ordered a pot of mussels swimming in sauce for a starter and got two tiny crostinis the size of my pinky to dip into the sauce. Yet our wedge salad had a whole piece of Texas toast. What? The drinks we ordered were all ice for $12-$15 each! Horrible value. Also $5 for bottled soda. Why? For food, we ordered one of every entree and honestly you&#39;re better off going to Bonefish Grill for taste and value. The only items that were good was the Juicy Lucy burger and lobster Mac and Cheese. I went with my family of 7 on Mother&#39;s Day, spent over $300 and it was not worth it. There are so many other places to drop $300+ on. They also put items I didn&#39;t order on the bill (extra $17 appetizer). As always, check your final bill.

Lots of seating- bring your family and friends!The appetizers were the true stars of our meal. We got:Mac and cheese with crab ($8.50). You can add smoked bacon for an additional dolla, but I would recommend it without so you can really enjoy the flavor of the crab. There isn&#39;t actually that much crab in it, but that made it more special when you actually got a mouthful of crab. This dish is beyond amaIng. It is just the right amount of cheesy, and even has veggies like zuchinni cooked in. I think this is the best mac and cheese I&#39;ve ever had, anywhere. I would strongly recommend this dish.Brussel sprouts ($6.50) with smoked bacon and truffle balsamic glaze. This was also delicious and I will definitely get it again. The portion is very generous, especially the bacon! The glaze is so tasty and the sprouts are cooked perfectly. Yum!We also got a side of Truffle french fries ($6). These have a strong cajun taste to them too, but the truffle flavor is prominent. These were not my favorite, but I am pretty picky about my fries.We also tried some Tacos:T&amp;B Taco ($3.50)- spicy shrimp, habanero aioli, garlic cilantro lime slawDuck Taco ($3.25)- duck leg confit with ancho pepper,  guajillo aioli, pickle cabbage and carrotsFish Taco ($3.25)- pico de gallo, jalapeno lime aioli, black seaame seeds, pickle cabbage, ancho chile peppers seasonedThese were all good, but nothing compared to the appetizers. Not sure I would get tacos again when the appetizers are so much better. Tacos range from $2.50-$3.50. Burgers range from $8.50-$14 and come with fries. You can also get mini versions of each burger for $5! I want tovtry these next time- they look interesting with things like biaon burgers,  grilled shrimp on top, and fried eggs.Check in on yelp for a free order of beignets, which we enjoyed more than ones from New Orleans! They are cute little beignet munchkins settled on top of a delicious chocolate sauce, with a rasberry sauce that was so good I wanted to drink it, and fresh raapberries. The perfect way to end our meal!Another plus- this restaurant is BYOB! There is a liquor store right next door, which is very convenient.Truly excellent service. Our waitress, Monica, was so sweet, personable and friendly and really made our dinner a wonderful experience.5 stars for sure!"

Tons of street parking on Lawrence. Came at 3pm on Friday for late lunch and since they just opened no one else was here.Wasn&#39;t in the food for a burger, I&#39;m typically not. Though they all sound different and can all be made into mini burgers which is pretty cool.I ordered a half order of the crab Mac and Cheese. Also has chopped up veggies mixed in. It was pretty good. Slight crab flavor that wasn&#39;t over powering. The crunch of the veggies was a good texture too.I then ordered the T&amp;B shrimp, Fish (tilapia), and Chorizo taco. The fish and the chorizo were my favorite. Tacos come on a slate plate that I loved with a wedge of lime and salsa verde. The tortillas are green which I&#39;m assuming have spinach in them.I also got a side of truffle fries and have to say they were probably the best truffle fries I&#39;ve ever had. And I&#39;ve had a lot of truffle fries. There is a reason the side of fries is $6.00 but it&#39;s also a large portion and delish! Don&#39;t miss out.Server was Monica and was she super nice and let me know about the fact that I could order a half order of the Mac even though it&#39;s not on the menu and it can be ordered with or without crab and veggies.Nice place in the middle of a mess of stores."

Great service, great inventive menu serving gourmet tacos and burgers and service is on point. Really good offering of tacos and they come with great fresh ingredients that most will love. Burgers are the same. And, you can try full versions of burgers or mini slider versions of them. Very delicious. My favorite taco was the duck taco which comes with very tender meat in a gorgeous soft tortilla.  My favorite burger was the T&amp;B burger with grilled onions, guac, and shrimp. The rest were definitely tasty but nothing blew me away.Plus BYOB which is always good in my book. Very affordable esp if you get the taco plate you can get them down to three dollars each and def lower priced then the typical Chicago gourmet taco or burger joints.Only thing was that it does get a little noisy and stuffy in there. They must try to get better vents. Otherwise, I would come here again and pair some good tacos and burgers with my own brew."

The chorizo and pork belly tacos are also very very good, lowest rated item would be the fish taco, although good, does not even compare to the rest of the menu. The classic burger and the spice burger are also heavenly when you bite into them. This is a little hidden gem in my neighborhood that&#39;s started to get noticed. As others have mentioned, it&#39;s byob, so it also has that going for it. $ is an absolute bonus, 4 for $12 tacos special is always good.One of these days I&#39;m going to leave room in my tummy for dessert, cause they all sound amazing as well."

This place appeared to me as a savior after the food fail I experienced yesterday. Everything about this place was as good as it looked in the photos and honestly, it restored my faith in humanity (a little).T&amp;B Grill sits cozily on the corner of Lawrence and Lawndale. Parking is pretty easy to find with a lot of parking meters on Lawrence. Walking in, it had a nice atmosphere with a cool mural of the Bean to the right wall and another mural of colorful corn on the back wall. Immediately my gf and I were greeted and seated by one of the nicest servers I&#39;ve ever had.I ordered the T&amp;B burger with a duck taco (had to try it), while my gf ordered a mini T&amp;B Burger and a fish taco, both orders coming with a side of truffle fries. Although we didn&#39;t order the tacos as appetizers, they came out first as if they were and it was a pleasant change up seeing as how we were famished. I&#39;m so glad I tried the duck taco, the meat was tender and succulent while the pickled cabbage and sauce complimented the meat for a refreshing, vibrant flavor. By the time the burgers came out, my gf and I were ready for more flavor bombs.The burgers themselves were delicious. On it were a bison patty, shrimp, guac, chorizo, pepper jack cheese, all on a brioche bun. After the first bite only one word came to mind, DELICIOUS. The truffle fries were super on point too, and it came with so many. After we finished we were so satisfied and stuffed yet how we felt in our stomachs did not reflect on the bill (which was a good thing). For 2 burgers, 2 tacos, 2 sets of (what seemed like bottomless) truffle fries, and exceptional service, it came out to about $30. Well worth it.This places gets 5 stars, an A+, 10/10, etc. Highly recommend this place as it serves good food, gives great service, and really gives you a bang for your buck!"

Fish taco blackend ,crispy ,cooked to perfection. Bison mini burger  with shrimp and guacamole so succulent with a side of sweet potato dusted with the perfect amount of cinnamon and sugar. Pork belly habanero,pineapple tacos. Wow this cook is amazing. I had a steak with fried eggs the white was runny so the manager /waiter came back and  brought them back thinking upon the return it would be over cooked yoke, nope perfect and runny just the way I love it.

Just go the extra mile and eat here instead.Freshly made taco wrappers definitely gives it the soft texture that makes a good taco. Add some protein, sauce and slaw and you got yourself a gourmet taco. It is definitely up on the list of best not-so Mexican taco places in the city! Yes, I said it, in the CITY.I ordered a bunch of tacos from Duck Confit, T&amp;B and fish. They were beautifully presented and good portion size. I ate the fish taco and there&#39;s a lot going on, it&#39;s a grilled piece of meat so it&#39;s healthier than the deep fried ones (though I like those too).Also ordered a round of mini T&amp;B sliders. Each mini-burger comes with it&#39;s own side of fries. I tried all three and my favorite were the sweet potato - crunchy on the outside, creamy and sweet inside. Ask for aioli and you have 4 options to choose from at no additional cost. Burger cooked at medium was perfectly medium. Inside sits a piece of shrimp and guac, this tiny burger is incredibly quite filling.Tiramisu with blackberry sauce served on a chilled marble cutting board is excellent as well. At $4, can&#39;t go wrong.I forgot to mention we were here on a Sunday and they serve brunch too - a meat and veggie option, chilaquiles, chips and guac. It&#39;s not on the menu, but I think they&#39;re starting a brunch too.Space is great, high ceilings, cool giant mural of the &#34;Bean&#34; and large windows. Good staff and plenty of seating. If this place opened in Wicker, I am certain there would be a line out the door. The only unfortunate thing is the name, T&amp;B Grill. Had I just saw the name alone, I think of those little shops that sell frozen patties, chicken nuggets and fries, quickly fried or griddled in a seedy neighborhood. Nothing wrong with that except T&amp;B uses all fresh ingredients. Definitely coming back here to get my fill of tacos and sweet potato fries.What you wanna go now?!?!?! Let&#39;s go!!"

There is plenty of pay to park street parking across from the restaurant3.) go to the liquor store next door, and pick up some liquor. This place is BYOB, and they don&#39;t charge you a fee!4.) order the TACOS! These were some of the best tacos I have ever had. They are very unique and flavorful. The chorizo and shrimp taco were sooo good.5.) you should definitely order a burger as well. The best part is they have 2 sizes for their burgers, so we didn&#39;t have to commit to only getting a burger and were able to order lots of different things. We also had the truffle fries, and the sweet potato fries which of course did not let us down either."

The tortillas were jalapeno tortillas and the chips for the guac were chipolte and jalapeno chips. They were thicker and tasted really good.

I tasted more spice than the shrimp, but the shrimp was well cooked. Overall, everyone at the table felt the spices were worked into the meats quite well.

Tasty, yes but really nothing special. Slightly overrated. Presented as a &#34;higher-end&#34; taco but many street taco counterparts are better. Seems as if care went into the preparation. Fat was trimmed off of the meat nicely (or meat was nicely chosen). Too much sauce. Barely any cabbage. Very, very, skimpy on the meat. Concept not very unique. Simple (although simple isn&#39;t bad). Would be worth it if portions were fair and sauce was not heavy. All protiens were cooked nicely. Food was seasoned well. Price compared to portion is shameful (especially in that neighborhood &amp; in Illinois). Tortillas nice and fresh but small. Guacamole was good but overpriced. Fresh (like all other good taco spots). Creative but mimics an overdone food truck concept.Overall, should have more of a humble approach to what is offered.When it comes to tacos it just comes to freshness, great meat, and flavor... This being said, you can find great and &#34;fairly&#34; priced tacos in Chicago and T&amp;b Grill is not that spot. There are many other places that offer tacos that are not skimpy, of quality meat, complimented by great salsas, and made with fresh ingredients.This place is not bad but definitely doesn&#39;t impress when it comes down to fulfilling hunger with some great tacos... This place will leave some realizing that they were better off going to a well worth it taco spot instead.Taco&#39;s were almost there but they missed the mark and the place seems more like a business concept.If changes are made than this pace would be worth another try, if not than search on if your looking for great tacos..."

When I walked into T &amp; B Grill following a recommendation I was blown away by the quality of the food. I had the Spice Burger with sweet potato fries and shared a Chipotle Hanger Steak Taco with someone. First off, the taco was amazing, a mix of a traditional taco infused with a more modern fusion flavor that Chicago is used to (think Antique Taco in Wicker Park, but better.)The Spice Burger was wonderful, habanero aioli, a fried egg, thick burger patty and pretzel bun. I would recommend this for anyone who comes in.The service was lovely as well, Monica was our waitress and she was enthusiastic and very kind with us as we paced through the menu.This restaurant represents what I hope is coming to Albany Park (more specifically Lawrence between Pulaski and Kedzie) great food and lovely service.

The avocados that came inside the entrees were fresh and the meats were cooked to juicy perfection. Highly recommend the T&amp;B tacos, never had a taco taste quite as  flavor packed as those. The sweet potato fries were a perfect compliment to the burger and it also came in a generous portion so that&#39;s a plus. It wasn&#39;t just a meal, it was an experience. Will definitely be coming back here again."

The service was friendly and fast, the hostess was super nice and personable.Tacos were delicious, we tried the duck and steak/chorizo mix, salsa verde was very tasty as well. Presentation was nice, the tacos came out on a wooden cutting board. House made green tortillas with cilantro and jalapeño were unique. I&#39;d definitely return to try the daily specials and a burger. The menu seemed very ambitious with a good variety. Interesting concept, I&#39;d encourage anyone to try them out. Glad they&#39;re in the neighborhood."

It was a very large portion and I tried some and they were so good! The portion sizes are big and the presentation is fancy!The only thing I would say that kinda stinks is the restaurant didn&#39;t have air conditioning and it was really hot in there. I&#39;m not lowering my stars for this because I&#39;m not sure if they actually had AC but didn&#39;t have it on or maybe it wasn&#39;t working? They are a 7mo old restaurant, so maybe that&#39;s something that will change in the future. Regardless, I will be back and I will be spreading the word of this great neighborhood restaurant!"

Awesome.Seriously, this place sets the bar pretty high for other Latin fusion taco spots.  Can&#39;t wait to stop in again try some other offerings on the menu!"

Even the tortilla chips are a cut above: they are homemade and have a subtle bite of jalapeño that perfectly complement the freshly made chunky guacamole.

The ramen was well balanced, the broth spicy but not overbearing. It was creamy without being heavy, and the noodles held up well in the broth.The pineapple and pork combo was simply a delight - sweet and savory! The garnishes used in the dish were well received, the pork belly cubes tender and flavorful, with the sweet pineapple rounding out the dish nicely. the crispy onions added a welcome texture contrast to the rest of the dish.Overall, both dishes were amazing.

Had some duck dumplings too. But I would come back for that phat rice. It&#39;s easy to share the fried rice because of the big portion, but if you truly believe, you can make it your personal fried rice.I would skip the Urbanbelly Ramen. Just because there is pork belly in it, doesn&#39;t make it fabulous. I think they went overboard on the broth. Of the dozens and dozens of the other ramen joints, I&#39;ve never seen this dark cloudy pink broth concoction until eating here. And it didnt taste that good either. Also there was just way to much broth for the amount of noodles given, or maybe they just didn&#39;t put enough ramen noodles in the bowl.I&#39;m also not a fan of the whole paying first, and tipping first experience. I mean, I had to pour my own water and if I wanted some more beer, I had to go to the front and order it there, so it took out the whole service experience."

Well, I was honestly disappointed with Urbanbelly. Other Yelp reviews let me down.When I think of West Town Asian fusion BYOB places, I think of cheap food, decent quality, decent service, with kind of a hipster feel. Well, the only thing UrbanBelly has going for it is the hipster feel.I get it, your building rent is high. But, I hate when places don&#39;t give you enough food and I leave hungry. Not only was the food high priced, the beers were really high priced. Even though it may show up in your BYOB search, it is only BYOB for a small window of hours. The cork fee is like $20 otherwise!I got the duck dumplings which other yelpers recommended. I was not impressed. The flavor was actually kind of bland, and I liked the pork dumplings better.Service was also to be desired. You have to go all the way around to the front counter where you ordered it you want anything. And then the guys up there act really annoyed that you are asking them for help!

Its nicely decorated and secluded even though it is located by two busy streets (Ogden/Randolph). Self serve water and utensils are also a nice touch.2) Service was also good. Prompt service and clean up. No rush to leave and ordering went quickly (they give you a number and bring food to table).3) Food is OK. I ordered the Pork Belly Ramen and Edamame as appetizer.  The portion of Ramen was very generous and the egg therein was perfect. The Pork Belly was pretty good as well. The overall liquid portion was just ok. I would have preferred it be a little spicier (the chilly sauce did not help).  The Edamame was just ok as well. The portion was pretty small (but ok for the price). The spices were not quite working out. My GF has eaten here before and said that the Edamame was a little off as well, maybe it was just a bad day to have it.I&#39;ll likely come back to try some other choices on the menu.They have beer and its BYOB on Sundays I believe if you would like to do it."

The broth is thick, creamy and rich without being too salty. You can easily split the huge bowl and also try out another dish--which I did, with the Phat rice. The Phat rice reminded me of Southeasian (Thai) street food, so I definitely found it to be overpriced at around $12-14 (my memory fails me) but it was still tasty. What made it even better was scooping some Urbanbelly Ramen broth into the rice with every bite--I suggest you try that!My friend also opted for the frozen beer. Only the &#34;foam&#34; part at the top was somewhat icey. It was essentially just regular beer.I&#39;ve always loved the dining environment at Urbanbelly. The interior is clean, spacious, dimly lit and cool. Since it was a sunny day outside, however, my group opted to sit outside.

I&#39;ve already raved over the giant size of this dish but now let me rave about the dish itself. Their signature ramen dish has a great balance of spices and flavor that made my urban belly so happy. It was filled with ramen noodles, two huge slabs of pork belly, an egg, and mushrooms all in a semi-creamy and semi-spicy broth. For me, this was total perfection in a ramen. I absolutely loved it.+Once you&#39;re done, if you have leftovers, they will take it in the back and wrap it up for you.

We originally tried going to Belly-Q, but since it was only 4:30 and they weren&#39;t opened yet, the hostess suggested that we try their sister restaurant Urban Belly. I am so glad we did!My boyfriend and I ordered way more food than we should have for just the two of us, but we got so excited reading the menu, there were things we just had to try! We both love a good Asian fusion menu, we couldn&#39;t resist! We went with the Korean Chicken wings, the Waygu and Cheddar dumplings, the Urbanbelly Ramen with chicken instead of pork, and the Asian Bolognese. The chicken wings were the weakest, but they were still yummy! There was a creamy horseradish sauce to dip them in that was very flavorful.  The dumplings also had a similar horseradish sauce on top of them, which gave them the perfect amount of spice. They were light, crispy, and delicious. Next, the ramen. The broth had a great flavor to it, and they even made it with chicken per our request. I was surprised because usually a chicken based broth falls weak on the flavor, but theirs certainly did not. The noodles had the perfect amount of bite to them also. Lastly, the Bolognese. This menu item was a thing of my dreams. It was truly amazing!!! They took their perfectly cooked, silky udon noodles, and topped them off with a delicious pork ragu. The sauce wasn&#39;t your traditional Bolognese though, it had an Asian kick to it that was unworldly. I will definitely be coming back for this dish!The only reason this isn&#39;t getting the full 5 stars is because of the service. We asked someone working for a ramen spoon when they dropped off the food, and were told he&#39;d be right back with it. Instead, he proceeded to walk back and forth past us plenty of times without any spoon."

All hot food so a little difficult for summer. They share the space with bellyq. Only complaint were the gnats and giant fly that were all over. The gnats were giant and a concern for an indoor seating location.

But keep that in mind before you try this place out. To me, it is another hipstered out, Starbucked price restaurant that drains your wallet as you stare into the cool interior designs and fast paced environment. A culinary delight?Not in this case. So, I tried their Kim Chee Soup. I&#39;ve had my fair share of this Korean staple. I remember when my friends and I would venture out to Ktown&#39;s local spots. So the  taste here is new, different. A strange, oily Frankenstein invention. Did I like it? It&#39;s hard to beat the original. It&#39;s like Taco Bell trying to pass off as Mexican food. Only difference here is the quality of meat was good but the taste just wasn&#39;t.I guess hipster mania is here to stay like that unwanted skin tag you need to rip out of society but if keeps growing. Or maybe people just are craving for something new. But we have to remember what quacks like a duck most of the time in hipster nirvana is just quacking LIKE a duck. That&#39;s all and you&#39;ll be fine."

The only thing I don&#39;t like is the fact that they don&#39;t have one in Virginia.I stumbled upon this place on Yelp and came here for dinner with a coworker during our business trip. Like everyone else said, there&#39;s free 2 hr parking right across the street making it super convenient to eat here. We walked in and immediately liked it. The atmosphere was trendy, chill, and relaxed. The decor is modern and adds to the ambiance.We ordered at the counter and decided to sit outside. I ordered the duck and pho spice dumplings, the urbanbelly ramen, and the peanut butter and jelly soft serve for dessert. My coworker got the pork and cilantro dumplings, the phat rice, and a side of kim chi. The ramen and dumplings came out super quick. The dumplings are a little pricey, 4 for $7.  But they were delicious. The duck was juicy, and the dumplings were fried perfectly. They&#39;re garnished with cucumbers and some grapefruit. The ramen was interesting. Good flavors, nice kick to it, and they give you 2 huge pieces of pork belly. Yum. I tried some of my coworkers phat rice as well, and I liked it a lot too. It was a fancy version of fried rice.The soft serve was a perfect ending to a perfect meal. The berry compote was delish, and the crunchy peanut butter worked so well with the ice cream. I&#39;m still dreaming about that pb and j soft serve. The ramen portion was fairly large, I made my coworker finished some of it because I wanted to save room for dessert. We both walked out of there, extremely stuffed.There was a little confusion with the numbers they give you when you order. The waiter who brought out our food took our numbers away when we hadn&#39;t gotten all our food. Easy fix, the waitress who took our order walked by and we just let her know. She remembered everything we ordered and took care of the rest of it. Not a big deal to me, especially since the food and ambiance makes up for it. They also have a little station outside where you can get your own water (I actually don&#39;t mind getting my own water, that let&#39;s me get as much as I want. score.) And sauces. Belly Q, the restaurant it&#39;s connected to looked really cool as well. We almost came here again for dinner the next night. That&#39;s how good it was.Please, please, please come to Virginia! Until then, whenever I&#39;m in Chicago, you will most definitely find me here for a dinner or lunch."

While in Chicago for work, my colleagues/friends and I came to Urbanbelly for dinner. Because it was Superbowl Sunday, one of my associates asked if the restaurant had a TV (I couldn&#39;t care less about sports bowl). The manager was within earshot. And I guess because there were so few patrons in the restaurant, he offered up their tasting lounge for us to watch the game. To which I asked if it meant we would be ordering from their sister restaurant, BellyQ. He responded by handing me one of each menu and said, &#34;feel free to order from either menu.&#34; Talk about accommodating! And really, I don&#39;t like to be catered to. The manager really went out of his way though, and I&#39;m sure it was because it was such a slow night. Regardless, he didn&#39;t have to. He chose to. And we were very, very appreciative.Immediately, this was a really good experience. But then the food started to arrive, and a really good experience became a FANTASTIC experience. So much so, that I&#39;ll have to write a separate review for the BellyQ menu items I had.Let&#39;s start with the dumplings: I don&#39;t know which I enjoyed more, the duck &amp; pho dumpling or the pork and cilantro. Both were very unique. I expected the duck dumplings to be heavy, but they&#39;re really not. And mind you, I&#39;m one of those people for whom cilantro can be a little overwhelming. But the pork dumplings were delicious too.What really blew me away though was the &#34;asian bolognese&#34;. This was a heavier, more dense dish, naturally. But it still wasn&#39;t as heavy as the traditional bolognese I find in most restaurants. It was a very interesting spin. I think it&#39;s because of the udon noodles. But the combination of pork, black bean sauce, and tomatoes really makes this dish stand out. Long after I was full, I couldn&#39;t bare to let the bolognese go to waste.When I set foot on, or even near, Chicago soil again, I&#39;ll be making a b-line for Urbanbelly."

Because of it&#39;s location, we managed a parking spot a little far away. They do not take reservations hence we decided to go at noon. To our luck there were only a couple of tables occupied. So we could take our time and browse the menu boards that are up front, as well as go over the fancy, imported beer selection - That was steeply priced. They have a communal seating concept and this &#34;live wall&#34; which is a pretty neat addition. We ordered for a Kirin Pitcher with the frozen foam and beef &amp; cheddar wontons. The wontons were tasty and crisp. For our mains we got the mushroom pho and the ramen jr. Both the dishes were unique in their broths and even for a &#34;jr&#34; serving it was quite a large portion. On the whole a pleasant experience at a very hipster joint. I look forward to seeing what their other joints have in store."

Urbanbelly is the more &#34;order and grab a seat&#34; style annex to Belly Q. It&#39;s a great, casual space with communal seating and order tags adjacent to the fancier Belly Q restaurant and bar.I was pretty excited for their Phat Rice and Rice Cake dishes--Phat Rice with 3 types of pork and Rice Cake Soup with chicken katsu in a spicy tomato-based broth. Although these were unique, strongly flavored, and very filling, I felt that the combinations were a little over-ambitious and consequently sloppy.The Phat Rice had 3 different kinds of meat, all uniquely flavored and strong. When added together, it just became distracting and a little overwhelming. The Rice Cake Soup was promising at first, but a little too salty for my taste and the mix of fish balls and chicken katsu was odd to me.Overall, average experience. But I&#39;d go back."

I&#39;m not a pork person so I skipped out on eating too much of it in the ramen, but it tastes just fine without meat. The set up of the restaurant is really nice. You order as soon as you walk in. Then you can sit wherever, on the table they have bowls, utensils, napkins, cups and water ready for you. The food came out quickly. Definitely will be back!"

We LOVE trying the restaurants on W. Randolph (it&#39;s the new up and coming restaurant row!), and we do love our Asian fusion. It gives me ideas on what I can try at home with whatever Korean cuisine background I have (being Korean and all).We were initially confused because we both had no idea that there were two separate restaurants. Urbanbelly is the more &#34;casual&#34; one and BellyQ is the &#34;sit-down menu&#34; one. After looking over both menus, we decided we were in a more casual mood and ordered our food at the counter. They give you a number to take to your table and bring out the food to you when it&#39;s ready. It was a GORGEOUS evening, so we sat outside in the patio area. LOVE the urban mural on the wall with the stringed lights for added decor. Really gives me that Chicago summer patio vibe and it&#39;s wonderful. The inside is beautiful too. They have a wall with lush green plants and industrial-type lighting with glass that makes it look like huge light bulbs. I am probably not describing it well, so just take a look at the photos of the interior decor to get a better idea. :)Btw, make sure to order their Kirin Ichiban on draft; it is on. point. They top it off with this beer slushie that is just icy enough to keep the beer beneath nice and cold. Are you listening? It&#39;s a BEER. SLUSHIE. on top of my already awesome refreshing beer. You guys are taking this to whole other level, yo. And I love it.We&#39;ve been on a mission to try ramen places in Chicago to compare and find our top favorite. So, of course we ordered the Urbanbelly Ramen ($13) which are the ramen noodles with braised pork belly, mushrooms &amp; an egg. Let me start with the broth: If Tom Yum and Ramen had a broth baby, it would be this dish. There was a slight sweetness to it (like Tom Yum) and there was also lemongrass, cilantro and mushrooms, all of which can be found in Tom Yum soup. Yet, it was thick like ramen broth, and slightly spicy. Talk about Asian fusion, right? The best of Japanese ramen and Thai soup! The noodles were not the absolute best that I&#39;ve had, but they were still fairly good. I just couldn&#39;t wrap my head around eating a bowl of ramen that had lemongrass and cilantro in it. The egg is added whole (NOT cut in half like most places) because the yolk is runny. When you cut open that thing, get ready for some beautiful egg porn with the ooey-gooey yolk oozing out into your broth. The absolute best part of this dish was the PORK: I mean. WOW. Thick cut (and I mean THICKY THICK, like Beyonce&#39;s jelly) pork belly meat, braised to perfection. The outside was perfectly crispy, and it was so tender and juicy, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness on the inside. I would order the ramen bowl JUST for the pork. Out of all the pork that I&#39;ve had in my ramen, this one certainly stole the show. I shall crown thee as our Royal Ramen Pork Belly, behold thy Oink King!We also ordered the Phat Rice because of the reviews that we read here on Yelp (thanks, fellow Yelpers). The Phat Rice bowl is a combination fried Jasmine rice with pineapples, ground chicken, pork belly and braised beef short ribs. This was a little on the sweet side for me, I think I just like my fried rice a little more salty/savory...even the ones that have pineapple in it. But, again, this reminded me of a marriage between Chinese and Thai fried rice. They have a bottle of hot sauce (that looks homemade) at the self-serve utensil/drink cart that you can bring to your table, so we tried the rice with it. I actually wish there was more &#34;heat&#34; to the hot sauce, along the lines of what Sriracha offers as far as heat and flavors go. Overall, I want to say that I&#39;ve had better combo fried rice (fusion or not) and maybe they can try not to make it so sweet? But that&#39;s just my humble opinion."

Urbanbelly was convenient and that&#39;s where we headed. We ordered our food first and sat down in the restaurant. The seating was community style and just grabbed a table for us and all our luggage. When our food came, it was pipping hot and ready to warm our stomaches. The ramen broth was deliciously savory. The only thing I disliked was the pork bellly, but that&#39;s just because I&#39;m not a fan of eating fatty meat. This was great way to end our trip to Chicago."

This is similar to Korean Bibimbap. It&#39;s similar because there are many things and you mix them together. The similarity ended there. The problem with this dish is I was hoping to have more Asian spice in them, and it is too sweet for my taste.Next, we had urbanbelly ramen. I like this dish because of the kimchi flavor in the broth and it&#39;s a little spicy, but I don&#39;t like that it&#39;s again too sweet. The egg and the pork belly are good.Finally, we had Wagyu beef dumpling. This is the most disappointing dish. I don&#39;t taste anything but the sauce that they put on top. The sauce is way too overpowering.Overall I feel like they tried to be fusion, but failed miserably. I&#39;d categorize then as Americanized Korean food instead. I rated them 2 stars because of that."

Rice dishes and noodle dishes range from $9-$13.  A pitcher of Kirin beer was $10 or $3 for a pint.  If you happen to partake in &#34;a la card chicago&#34; you will find that both Urbanbelly and BellyQ are in the deck of cards.I came here for two reasons: I happened to be visiting the Randolph Street Market just a block down the road (awesome btw), and the $10 card to Urbanbelly.  I had heard good things about it, and nothing gets my stomach growling like Asian food.  Everything on the menu looks good.  My girlfriend and I ordered a pitcher of beer, the Duck and Pho spice dumplings to start, and then I ordered the Phat noodle and she ordered the Rice cake noodle as our entrees.  Ordering is done at the counter, and the ambiance is modern and inviting.  Service is fantastic as we got our food in about 5-10 minutes.  As food goes, we liked the Duck dumplings the best by far.  The dumplings were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and were perfectly paired with the cucumber and a little house made hot sauce.  The Phat noodle was disappointing.  The flavor felt like something was missing, and the chicken was dry and tasteless.  The pork belly was my favorite part of the dish.  I wouldn&#39;t order it again.  The Rice cake noodle was quite good.  The broth was flavorful and spicy.  The chicken katsu was well cooked.  The mango in the broth was a great idea.  It&#39;s a bit on the spicy side so be careful if spice isn&#39;t your thing.  My only complaint was the rice cake seemed a bit too much.Location: 4 starsEnvironment: 4 starsService: 5 stars.  The food came out in about 5-10 minutesTaste: 3 stars. see abovePrice: 4 starsMenu selection: 4 stars.

The place is really cool and casual with a very urban ambiance. The tables are set up for communal dining. But since it was a week night there wasn&#39;t too much of a crowd and we had the whole table to ourselves. We ordered the wheat berry bowl and the pea shoot fried rice and the spiced edamame. I really liked the wheat berry bowl - it was perfectly tangy, sweet, spicy. It tasted great - though was a bit too greasy for my taste. The pea shoot fried rice looked really good but it was too salty. I don&#39;t know why a lot of places these days have too much of salt in their food. Too much salt does not mean tasty. The spiced edamame was pretty good as well. The service was good and friendly."

It was my first time here, and the first thing I noticed was how huge the place was. Most lunchtime patrons were seated in the back near the kitchen, but there were at least 20 empty dining tables that I passed on the way to the bathroom. I thought about how cool it would be to come here for dinner or after work for a drink.What I really like about urban belly is their sizable but focused menu. I chose the pork belly ramen, and my friend chose the kimchee stew along with a bottle of kirin. We were ready to chow. Grabbing our number, we sat at these long brown wooden tables with block stools--i thought it was modern and cool. Then, 2 minutes passed and somehow our two bowls of noodles, steam rising from the server&#39;s hands, were being whisked to our table. I remembered that my friend had struck up a conversation with the guy who took our order, but altogether it took less than 10 minutes for the food to come. FREAKY FAST which is a great thing.I liked my ramen noodles and the dish hit the spot. However, the 2 pieces of pork belly were so fatty. I was dissecting it to find bits of protein amid globs of white, but my friend really enjoyed it, so much so that he wanted to replicate it at home. I thought he was crazy. The soup broth was also a tad too sweet for my taste--I think the dish would do well with some added heat. My friend&#39;s kimchi noodles came in a bowl that was considerably smaller than the ramen. I wondered why since it was the same price as the ramen and was accompanied with the same amount of meat. For better or worse the kimchi flavor wasn&#39;t powerful, but again, I was missing some spiciness. Overall it was a solid experience, but I figure that the flavor of some of the dishes could use some tinkering. After reading some reviews, I must have forgotten to ask for the belly fire sauce. doh."

I always enjoy edamame, but the Szechuan peppercorns, coriander, and fennel make this dish a symphony in your mouth.The phat rice!  Oh my geez!  This was fantastic and very filling!  It was so overwhelmingly flavorful while not being overpowering.  I would definitely order this again!Lastly, the bibimbop.. my husband was thoroughly pleased...

The amount of meat was more generous that I would have expected.Service: 5I came here with a friend, based on the Alacard recommendation. The service was outstanding. They kindly let us use both Urbanbelly and BellyQ vouchers on the same bill, and we ordered from both menus.Would recommend going back. It was 60% full on a Monday night, so I imagine it is packed on weekends. The bar aesthetic is modcon."

First off you could feed two people with the ramen.  You get a huge bowl and thankfully it&#39;s really good.  You get some pork belly and a full soft boiled egg in the broth as well.  Sometimes I&#39;m not a huge fan of how pork belly is prepared but here I loved it.  The broth had great flavor, you could really taste all the herby and spicy goodness in there.  The phat rice was pretty good too. Not a show stopper but the short rib was really tender and the pineapples were a nice touch.  I added a little of that orange garlic sauce to it and it went together perfectly.  Not to mention I got a Kirin Ichiban draft for $3?! Where else are you going to get a draft at a restaurant for $3 in the city?By the way I&#39;ve been looking for that orange sauce in bottles at the Marianos for a while now.  I saw it a few months ago and I&#39;m kicking myself I didn&#39;t grab one.  Now they&#39;ve disappeared.  The only thing I can do now is wait with bated breath for it&#39;s return to grocery store shelves.  Anyway, this place is good. Check it out!"

It&#39;s not quite like home but it tastes just as good. I ordered the phat rice and I&#39;m a huge fan of how the fat just seeps into the rice. The pork was fatty, and the savory flavor blended well with the pineapples. Also, I&#39;m a huge fan of sticky rice, so that really made me happy as well.I wouldn&#39;t get the edamame. It&#39;s really lacking in flavor -- I wished it was saltier. I still plan to eat through the menu though... :)"

The food is ok, but no where near the price.$7 for 4 very small dumplings is nuts. They tasted good, but not $1.75 a bite good.The half ramen was only $8, which seems about right, no complaint there.  Certainly large enough for lunch.  It came with a nice big chunk of pork belly, which was very tasty, a hard boiled egg, some sliced radishes and of course ramen noodles. A little spicy but nothing ridiculous.The seating arrangement is kinda of unusual. When you first walk in, you will see the counter to order and one row of counter seats. I didn&#39;t realise at first that the is a dinning room in the rear with a few large communal tables. After you order the counter someone will bring you your food."

Due to our previous experience, the owner of Urban Belly/Belly Q promptly contacted me and invited me back to check out Urban Belly and was gracious enough to send a gift card.When we walked into Urban Belly, we made sure to ask questions on how ordering worked (we learned this time). The woman at the counter at this visit was very nice and friendly and answered all of our questions. We ordered the duck dumplings, the urban belly ramen, the pork and pineapple fried rice, and hubby got the Asian bolognese and beer. Cool thing about the beer-they use a tap that freezes some of the beer so that it stays cold throughout your meal. I don&#39;t know how it works, but it&#39;s pretty cool.We grabbed a table and honestly it took only a few minutes for all of our food to come out. The dumplings were adequately filled and had a good flavor. The rice was absolutely delicious! The ramen was very good-I still have my favorite ramen at another establishment, but this was still quite tasty. The Asian bolognese had a lot of meat and sauce on it-very hearty. Our experience this evening was very nice-the workers were attentive and made sure we had water, extra utensils, etc. I would visit again if I was in the area."

My husband and I had lunch on their outdoor patio and were very happy with the experience.Vietnamese iced coffee--it was my first time trying it and though I am not really a coffee drinker, I really enjoyed itWagyu beef dumplings--amazing appetizer, you could definitely make a tapas style meal by just ordering the different dumplingsPhat rice--holy crap, I loved it. I added some spicy sauce because that&#39;s how I like my food, but it was very good and definitely something I&#39;ll be ordering againBacon and kimchi--also very good, my husband really liked it. Had enough to bring home leftovers for another lunchLiked their patio area, which is dog-friendly. Staff was nice, brought out water for our dog. You order at the counter, get a number, and they bring your food to the table. Not sure about the indoor tables but the outside ones had one of my favorite things: hooks for your purse! They kind of share the space with Belly Q, which means you walk through the entire place to get to the bathroom.The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the pricing. Our lunch ended up costing $37. Not high enough to keep me from coming back, but probably won&#39;t come back as often as we&#39;d like because of the prices."

I think I must be on a ramen kick bc I just had some at Santouka in Mitsuwa this past week. Urban belly was so much delicious! Briny broth with two big pieces of pork belly...which were so delectable! A perfectly cooked egg with a runny yolk that dribbled into the broth...and I tossed a bunch of the eggplant into my soup as well. I have no idea how they cook the eggplant but I think it&#39;s sautéed and then soaked in some kind of vinegar ...totally addicting and if anyone knows the recipe..please let me know! they used to have a spicy eggplant ramen which I loved...it&#39;s no longer on the menu, thus my improvisation.

And the portions are large. And they serve you within seconds (literally) of you sitting down. So why is this anything less than 5 stars?The service is awkward. Drinks are handled by the counter, which is at the front of the house. My date and I had our meal before we had water. And there was a half-full container of water at the table that no one bothered to refill or clear from an earlier group. I get that water shouldn&#39;t be wasted but leaving that half-full container of water with us and not offering a new one, or any glasses even, just made me feel like they needed some help.The food was awesome, though. And the waitress was cool. They just need to figure out the counter situation for when they get busy in spurts. Guests should never have to wonder about how to get a drink."

It&#39;s not absolutely to-die-for amazing and it&#39;s certainly not something I would come back just to order but it tasted pretty good. They are fried more like pot-stickers instead of dumplings.I got the Urbanbelly Ramen which was mediocre at best. The menu says it comes with mushrooms but there were none in my bowl. The pork belly was average and the broth was decent but lacked the fattiness needed for ramen soup. Of one thing to note is that this is one of the few ramen places out here that adds a soft-boiled egg in their soup. Toppings wise - the bowel was definitely lacking in decorations.My friend got the rice cakes which again, we both thought was fair for Korean-American fusion. Medium spice but he definitely worked up a sweat. I wouldn&#39;t recommend eating this for one person as it&#39;s a pretty one-dimensional dish and let&#39;s face it, that&#39;s a lot of carbs.Awesome decorations inside and a decent-sized patio outside for your dining pleasure.

I ordered the Urbanbelly Ramen (Ramen Noodles with Braised Pork Belly, Mushrooms &amp; Egg) and Chilled Vietnamese Coffee. I made the ramen a bit spicy by adding hot sauce out of habit, but it was so flavorful it really did not need a thing. The broth was perfect just the right amount of everything, especially flavor. The pork belly in the ramen was fatty and tender. And if you are one of the reviews that said the pork belly was too fatty shut it because that is what makes pork belly, pork belly. In my opinion and my experience with ramen this definitely earns a top spot!The Chilled Vietnamese Coffee was spectacular and that is probably because the use Cafe Du Monde Coffee!

The menu in my opinion had many options for noodle or rice dishes and dumplings. There was a small selection of beer but more than enough choices. I like that the tables have small stacks of bowls and chopsticks so you can share your dishes with friends. (Asian food is always better when you can eat family style!)As for the food and service... It was so-so. The girl at the front who took our orders was nice and explained dishes when we had questions and was very patient. She also was able to substitute shrimp for pork in the ramen for one of the diners in our group who doesn&#39;t eat pork. However when our food came out, the substituted ramen arrived much later than the other entrees. We were all practically done with our food by the time the ramen came out. We ordered two of the duck pho and spice dumplings which were tasty. Nothing mind-blowing but still delicious. I had the phat rice which again was tasty but I didn&#39;t feel excited about it. I also didn&#39;t have short ribs on mine which I didn&#39;t notice until half way into my meal. Again, it wasn&#39;t horrible food but it didn&#39;t exactly leave me impressed either. If I was in the area I would probably come back but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to dine there. I&#39;d prob also try something different like the Asian bolognese which sounded delicious. The phat rice was sort of a disappointment."

It is not a Japanese restaurant or a Korean restaurant, but rather some sort of fusion. The ramen did not have any sort of identity and was really lacking in variety of ingredients. It did however have a very juicy and nicely seared pork belly. Otherwise the ingredients were small and not full of variety. The decor was cool tho lol."

Urban Belly had been on our list of places to try for a while so this was a good opportunity to check it out.We actually sat at the bar on the Belly Q side but ordered from the Urban Belly menu and had a couple great Belly Q cocktails. The Stove Pipe is a bourbon based drink and was perfect. The Red Lotus is a sake and yuzu drink that was even better. Drinks ($11) were 5 star quality.We weren&#39;t totally famished so we split an order of Duck and Pho Spices dumplings ($7 for 4) and the Pad Thai ($14). I thought the dumplings could have come with a more interesting dipping sauce, but they were good. The Pad Thai was an interesting and tasty presentation with rice noodles and some interesting slices of rice cake. Only 4 shrimp in the dish, maybe 2 more would be nice. They had a house hoisin sauce that was good, but the other one they had wasn&#39;t great. Overall, the food was 4 star.Service was really good, food and drinks came up quickly.

There were barely any noodles in their so called special food item (urbanbelly ramen) and the broth was way too salty. It was also overpriced.

Substituted the udon noodles with rice noodles but it felt like they cooked it with oil for too long causing it to taste mushy, almost like we were eating mush."

The order came in about 45 minutes, which was okay, although I thought it would be a bit faster. I ordered the Phat Rice and the Pad Thai.The Pad Thai was, well, not what I was expecting. Although it did say rice cakes on Grubhub, I assumed that the rice cakes were an addition to the typical noodles in a Pad Thai. I assumed wrong! I received just the rice cakes with sauce, toppings, and grilled (maybe?) shrimp tossed inside. Nevertheless, the food was great. The rice cakes were surprisingly delicious, the shrimps were large and plump, and all the additional toppings like peanuts and garlic complemented the dish well. For $13, the portion was tiny but it was delicious, and I guess I can justify the price...a bit.The Phat Rice was larger compared to the Pad Thai. The rice was cooked just right (al dente, for those wondering), the other little things didn&#39;t get in the way of eating, and again, the portion was good (but not great!) for $13. The meats (ground chicken, pork belly, and braised beef short ribs) were definitely on point. I didn&#39;t notice the chicken too much because it was ground up and mixed with the rice, but the pork belly, which was a bit dry, was soft and tasty and the short rib was chewy but had a melt-in-your-mouth texture. All three meats had a great taste, although the Chicken was just a tad bit bland. There were ample amounts of meat compared to the rice, and by the end, I found myself debating whether or not I should order again the next day. Overall, a very delicious dish.Solid 5 stars for food, but knocking one star off for rather small portions and big prices. So far the best food I had in Chicago without stepping outside the hotel!"

Initially, the wait time was supposed to be a 30 minute wait for our party of 6. That unfortunately ended up being a 60 minute wait, but I will say the wait was worth it. Intelligentsia is just down the street so we killed an hour there and got coffee while we waited.Waitstaff was super cool. Actually, this whole place is super cool. Really trendy vibe from the chalkboard walls to the house brewed beers to the modern twist on bar food and the dishes they serve it on. I ordered the veggie reuben and omg it was great! Red cabbage and mushrooms instead of the typical corned beef and sad looking kraut. I would definitely eat this again! The fries here are really thin and crispy and served with a lemon pepper mayo and a spicy ketchup/bbq type thing; both were really good!Half the reason my friends wanted to eat here was for the beer. I can say that didn&#39;t disappoint either. I got the Shark Meets Hipster. Really nice light beer, super fruity, reminded me a lot of Wailua Wheat from Kona Brewing!Overall, dinner was good. Good, friendly service. Portions were a little small, but the prices reflected that and were well within reason. If you plan on drinking more than 1 or 2 drinks, I could see it adding up pretty quickly. Still, if you&#39;re going to eat here you should try at least one beer! They also offer flights and you can take their beers to go in either cans or growlers. From what I remember the growlers were actually a pretty decent price.The free wifi here was also a nice added bonus!With all the other trendy restaurants in the area, I&#39;m not sure when I&#39;ll be back to this one any time soon, but it was definitely some place worth trying!"

I call it sweet, sweet capitalism.I knocked off a star because the place is a bit tight and at times their beers get a little too eccentric even for an eccentric like me, but when you catch them putting a stout, porter or any darker beer on the draft list, drop whatever you are doing whether it be weekend chores, a project at work or holding your friend&#39;s baby, and sprint over before the locals gulp it all down.I mean the coconut milk stout, dubbed the &#34;Angry Samoan,&#34; still haunts my dreams in a very real and satisfying way."

And while it might be located in the heart of Chicago&#39;s own Boystown, I would definitely say there was a very wide mix of patrons. Maybe the only qualifier to dine is that you come hungry.I&#39;m not going to go into a long explanation of what their burgers were. I think if you&#39;re in the are and want one you need to come try it for yourself. A good burger bar in the east end was sorely needed and DryHop filled that need quite nicely."

The beers on last night weren&#39;t particularly mindblowing. No sours too :( But everything was executed well for what it was. We each got a flight, which was nice, but everything felt similar somehow. Hoppy wheat, hoppy lager, english ipa, ipa. Would have loved to see something really high abv, higher IBU and lower IBU, and stout option that wasn&#39;t spiced. They were all delicious, but safe. And I&#39;m aware I&#39;m just spoiled going to craft beer bars in NYC with often 20-70 taps to choose from. Can&#39;t wait to come back at another time of year and see what they have.Food was delicious! Fried chicken is everywhere and they did it nicely. Same with the shell pasta mac. Service was good, a little slow, but we were busy with out 6 beers anyway- a great deal for a flight!"

I came in for some beer and all of your beers had very similar tastes. Im not sure if it was the glasses or the water or hops you use but something tasted off about the beers. Kind of a dirty taste that ranged across all the flight beers and pints I got.On top of that the selection of beers was limited. Nothing really exceptionally exciting about the brews. No super malty drafts, no sours, no punchy dark beers. All of the beer was pretty normal. I might be spoiled living in Boulder but damn, I just cant say I was blown away.  However, nothing here is bad per se, I just am not a fan. Revolution and Goose Island are pretty damned good though.The staff was kind of excited to go home on a friday night, understandable, but they pressured me, aka shower up with the check, to close out 25 minutes before closing, lights came up 20 minutes before closing and it was suggested to me that they were closing countless times. Yes so I left 15 minutes before closing."

We came here on a busy Saturday night with friends to celebrate their engagement.  We knew there would be a wait so we put our name and number in with the host and went over to Intelligentsia to grab a cup of tea/coffee.  I think we waited about an hour, but since we had planned for it, it went by quickly.Once we were seated we had the problem of choosing what to actually order. Everything sounded delicious! We ended up with the pork buns, soft pretzel, and charcuterie and cheese board to start. I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with pickled jalapenos and fried onions - so good! My husband had the burger and was extremely happy.  Of course, we also a few of their tasty brews to wash everything down.Don&#39;t come here if you&#39;re looking for a quick bite or if you&#39;re already hangry, you won&#39;t be happy with the result.

The Monday special of $15 for a beer and burger (with fries) is pretty unbeatable in Chicago especially when the burger is so great. We also tried the beer flight and it was great since it was our first time trying their beers so we were initially unsure of what to order. I definitely suggest the flight for first timers.

It&#39;s a pretty small place with only maybe a dozen or so tables and another dozen seats at the bar. You get a great view of some of their brewing equipment across from the bar. I definitely recommend trying a few of their house brewed beers. There&#39;s always something for everyone and they have pretty decent flight prices if you want to try them all!So after three visits you would think I&#39;ve had a pretty good taste of the whole menu. Nope. I&#39;ve only ever gotten the burger because it&#39;s delicious, absolutely one of the best in the city. It only comes one way, but you can add bacon or egg. Bonus points for the spicy ketchup and garlic aioli you get for the fries. If I can ever manage to not get the burger the chicken sandwich and skillet mac n cheese both sound delicious as well.Love this place! 5 stars all the way"

I recommend the sampler!Staff was fun and their burger was delightful - whatever they do for their patties is impressively succulent for something that manages to maintain its puck shape. Fries were McDonald&#39;s style and tasty.Good crowd on a Wednesday night but not too loud for conversation."

The beer, first off, is great. We love trying microbrewery beer and always enjoy something different. This place has a nice selection and definitely offer something for every beer drinker.The food is eclectic and different, and not too pricey! We got to fried green tomatoes and fries as an appetizer. Their Monday night special is a burger, 16 oz beer, and a whiskey shot for $15. How can you go wrong???Love the interior- it&#39;s hipstery but also casual and modern. And a little patio for the good weather too. Will definitely be back!"

We found a spot at the bar and tried a few beers. Bartender was friendly. We had a great time!The best part of the evening? Every Saturday they pick one beer to offer at a special price ($5) in their 32oz cans, which they fill when you order (they also have a growler special), and the special beer happened to be the one we liked the most--Mondo Generator Doppelbock.  We bought two cans to take home.The dining area is small, but we plan on returning to try their food...and more beer.Note: My husband is a big fan of craft beers, so we&#39;ve made a point of visiting local brew pubs in Chicago. He spends plenty of his spare time learning about craft beers and tasting them. He and a friend have taken trips to Michigan and Wisconsin for the purpose of visiting craft brew pubs. This 4-star rating is his, too.Enjoy!"

The outside seating area was filled but my friend and I happily took to inside seating next to the window in the much needed air conditioning.Inside was kinda crowded, but I dug the decor. Our server was nice, sat us down right away, and told us right away that they were out of their &#34;Steal Your Face&#34; beer but would be replaced with a light belgian beer. With that said, we decided to go with a flight of their beer selection.We weren&#39;t that impressed with any of the beers. Our favorite out of the bunch was &#34;Mr. Banana Grabber&#34;. The most interesting tasting was &#34;Wolves Loose in Koln.&#34; I kid you not, it tasted like pizza. PIZZA! It wasn&#39;t meant to at all. My friend agreed, he said it tasted like tomato sauce. Not my cup of tea, but he liked it.Regarding the food, we shared &#34;The Burger&#34; and that was top notch! It was juicy and very flavorful. It came with a side of crunch fries with a side of homemade ketchup and dijon sauce.  The sauces were just ok. I would definitely like to explore more of the menu at some point.So overall I&#39;d definitely go back AND major brownie points because the entire time we were there, they were playing Grizzly Bear songs, and they&#39;re my FAVE!"

We wanted a casual vibe and thought we had hit the jackpot. I left feeling a bit underwhelmed.They had a variety of beers on tap that night but they all had something weird added to them. Like odd flavorings. I ended up with a Milkstacio, which was/is a South Loop collaboration. It was a pistachio milk stouth with cocoa nibs and pistachios. It was described as having a velvety mouth feel with a chocolate finish but I just got tons of pistachios. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I like pistachios. But not in my beer. Didn&#39;t know that until I started drinking it but yeah, not a fan. But it was the darkest thing they had on the menu.For dinner I went with the burger with bacon. I&#39;ve never seen a sadder &#34;gourmet&#34; burger. It was a thin patty with two thin strips of grocery store bacon. None of that thick, juicy bacon you come to expect with a $2 extra charge. Nope, grocery store thin. And again, the patty was a thin patty. Not hearty, not flavorful. It was greasy dive burger for double the price.I probably won&#39;t be back. Reviews said it was like Hopleaf, but it&#39;s definitely not at all like Hopleaf. Well I guess they&#39;re similar in that they have the word &#34;hops&#34; in their name."

Obviously I&#39;m not coming at 10am to eat a cheeseburger...............So sadly, we just got a few beers and then left. It was a disappointing start to the 4th of July, but I will live.

We had spent almost an hour wandering around Lakeview and Boystown looking for a place to go and finally made our way here, so we were hungry. Three out of the four of us were newcomers, so deciphering the lingo on the beer list was a team effort but with help from our great waitress, we all chose the right brew for our tastes - I loved the Shark Meets Hipster. Our waitress also sold 3/4 of us on the Carbonera dish, complete with a raw egg yolk mixed in, which was so delicious and perfectly portioned to fit each our hunger levels.I also wish I could give this place 5 stars because everything was wonderful, but our food took almost an hour to come out. This was offset, however, by our waitress offering us a free round of drinks so that made it less frustrating. I would come here again - just maybe not on as much of an empty stomach."

I got it with the horseradish sauce on the side, and they even brought me a little taste of the &#34;jam&#34; that&#39;s really fancy ketchup that&#39;s normally served with the burger. I think it&#39;s ancho-chili tomato jam, and it was pretty great. But the sandwich......damn. My companion got the burger, and inhaled it, so I also assume it was tasty.My face: The $3 upcharge for the salad instead of fries seems a little steep, but it&#39;s actually a really decent portion, so it&#39;s all good by me. I think the total was maybe $15 a person. We both left happy and full. Just how it should be. Sober smile up in here."

I had French Toast made out of Challah Bread crusted with Captain Crunch. It was covered with cream and blueberries. My girlfriend got the &#34;Angry Toddler&#34; omelet which I believe had eggs, apple-wood bacon, and cheese.My only gripe with this place was the service.  It was fairly busy in the restaurant so this is reasonably understandable. However, I was a little concerned at the lack of attention we received and furthermore, I was disheartened by how long the meals took to prepare and serve.

Maybe that&#39;s just me, but during the years in US, I have become almost allergic to hops. Unfortunately DryHop IPA&#39;s are not an exception.

You know I&#39;m all about that beer, but DryHop has a lot to offer not only in terms of beer but their food is bananas and service is completely on point.I went to DryHop on Friday night about 10pm and was met with a thirty minute wait. We ended up snagging seats at the bar and not having to wait at all. I loved the guys working at the bar - they were both friendly and attentive but not overly so.I tried every beer on their menu that night, thanks to the beer flights they offer. They price the flight at $14.61 so it comes out to an even $16 when you pay - love that convenience. I also tried their two beers not included with the flight and everything I tried was solid.Highlight of the beers - the Daytona 500! Holy spice explosion! This beer has ginger, galangal root and ghost pepper! It was so spicy yet so unique and I loved it. It left my lips tingling for thirty minutes after finishing my brew. Tart Down For What!? was another good beer that not only had an amazing name but made me lips pucker it was so sour ~ loved it.I had the Skillet Mac &amp; Cheese for $11 for dinner. The highlight of this mac &amp; cheese was the sunnyside egg on top! It was cooked perfectly and complimented the dish well. The macaroni and cheese itself was insanely creamy with shell noodles, covered with breadcrumbs. It came out piping hot in a skillet! I&#39;ve always said Kuma&#39;s has been my favorite mac &amp; cheese in the city but I have to say this now takes that honor. Next time I&#39;m going to try it with peas &amp; bacon - some additional add ons available!I loved everything about DryHop - great food, great beer, great service!

On a brioche bun, which is perfectly soft and toasted, and great toppings to boot.Don&#39;t miss out on Monday nights when you can get this amazing burger, a shot of whiskey, and a beer all for $15!!!"

The beer is pretty good, but nothing spectacular I&#39;m sorry to say. I&#39;ve tried many of their beers, and my mind is never blown.I&#39;ve tried both their brunch menu and dinner menu. I enjoy both! The first time I had the captain crunch french toast, and the other night I ordered the burger. The french toast was great, very tasty! The burger was pretty good! A bit smaller than I expected especially for the price. I loved the chipotle ketchup, and if I heard our waitress correctly: horseradish mayo? --Awesome. My bf ordered the buttermilk chicken sandwich, and I thought that was better than my burger. I have my eye on your macaroni and cheese next time.There is something about DryHop that is missing. It just needs that extra umph for me. The food menu could use a boost. I&#39;ll be back sometime I&#39;m sure!"

They don&#39;t take reservations either or we would have done that instead.The place was very busy. They don&#39;t serve food at the bar but we wanted a table anyway. Our waitress was nice and very patient and efficient as we tried to make our best decision on the great sounding beer and food they had.The table all together got a couple burgers, the Mac and cheese and the Poutine.

The outdoor seating is great in the summer, and when the weather is nice they open the whole front of the restaurant so more tables can soak in the sun as well. The interior is casual, but well designed, overall just a really cool neighborhood spot. Best of all, there&#39;s rarely a long wait!As far as the brunch menu goes, two words... Hank&#39;s Plate. It may sound like a safe choice compared to some of the other options, but it&#39;s truly amazing! The applewood smoked bacon with brown sugar black pepper glaze is absolutely the best bacon I&#39;ve ever had. The potatoes are phenomenal, and the biscuit and sausage gravy is equally delicious!If you&#39;re coming for dinner, the burger is awesome. And of course, you can&#39;t forget about the beer!"

Since this place is so popular, we ended up waiting for about an hour before we finally got a table for 6. Our waitress was very nice and made great food and beer suggestions. I ordered a serving of fries with garlic aeoli and it was very good. I don&#39;t know what they put in the ketchup but it was some of the best ketchup I have had. I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the garlic aeoli dipping sauce because it was a bit too rich for me. My friends ordered burgers and from what I could tell, they enjoyed their meals. They also enjoyed the draft beers that they ordered. All in all, this place is your typical American-fare restaurant."

They aren&#39;t beer snobs, what a treat! Seriously some of the nicest bar staff I&#39;ve been around. The layout is really nice, the bar is great (we liked the bar at Dryhop better than the bar at Corridor), and for a rather cold December night it wasn&#39;t remotely drafty. We old folks catch a chill real quick. The music wasn&#39;t good, but it wasn&#39;t my taste. Loud screaming death metal ain&#39;t my thang, especially not on a Sunday evening.The beer is fantastic. My favorites were the Moustache &amp; A Supernova, Light Up Gold, and, Funcrusher. The Moustache was by far my favorite and I&#39;ll gladly return for more of that. Food wise I wasn&#39;t blown away, but it wasn&#39;t bad. The best thing we ordered was the pork buns: perfect balance of sweet and spice but not too much of either. There are two per order and I would gladly have eaten both. The deviled eggs were, you know, they were deviled eggs. The only thing I didn&#39;t love was the shrimp &amp; grits. I normally love this dish, but, I didn&#39;t realize the &#34;gravy&#34; would be tomato-based..no. That&#39;s not okay with me. The shrimp was delicious, but I didn&#39;t like the gravy, and had I known it was tomato-y I would have asked for the poutine gravy instead. We want to go back for brunch, more beer, and more great bar staff."

When I lived in Chicago, definitely a spot that became awesome to grab a beer with friends. I think the best thing I ever had there was The Shark Meets Hipster. Also, the fries there are awesome.

The beer is spectacular and the burgers are epic. Epic. They change the burger style every few months just to keep it fresh. And the frites are thinner (sort of Belgian style) and absolutely delicious!One of the things I love about Dry Hop is that the entire street front is glass and when the weather is nice, they move the panels back and open the restaurant to the street. That is Dry Hop at its best. It can be a little loud otherwise. But when you&#39;re sitting in a place and looking out into this great north side neighborhood, you just can&#39;t do better!"

We stayed there for a few hours and ended up eating a LOT so I&#39;ll go through a rundown of what we sampled:Poutine: The poutine was good but was not at all what I expected, very different than poutine I&#39;ve had at other places.Buttermilk Biscuits &amp; Sausage Gravy: This may&#39;ve been the best thing we tried. The biscuits were enormous, heavenly, and very warm and came with excellent gravy. Definitely a must order if you&#39;re here for brunch.Bacon: I didn&#39;t try any but my dining companion tried the bacon and it was all gone, enough said.Make Your Own Omelette: Again, my dining companion had this and I didn&#39;t try it but he said it was good.Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich: I was so full by the time my sandwich came I struggled to eat much of it but what I had was pretty darn good.All in all I wanted to love Dry Hop but I just couldn&#39;t get there. The price point is high and the food is good, but not great. Since I live down the block I&#39;ll probably be back again, next time maybe just for beers."

The mussels were delicious and had a great sauce! Later, I had the ham and pulled pork sandwich and fries and my date had the burger with an egg on top along with mac and cheese. I thought my pulled pork was good, but it could have used some stone ground mustard since it was a bit dry (they do provide dipping sauce such as ketchup and aioli sauce, which didn&#39;t do the trick for me). Fries were delicious. My date liked his burger but the mac and cheese had no flavor (and don&#39;t get me wrong, we love mac and cheese!).We are looking forward to coming back and ordering the beer samplers along with some more appetizers.

I tried theirSummer arugula salad. I didn&#39;t hate it but it defiantly didn&#39;t catch my attention. When I told my friends I only tried the salad when I dined at dry hop, their jaws dropped and demanded I go again and try a hamburger. Today we went out for brunch and I tried the hamburger and I am a sucker for a good burger and their burger hit the spot. The French fries were also a nice addition, crispy and the sauces that accompanied the fries were so good, I almost asked for a to-go container for the Dijon aioli!

Walked in with my parents and was talked down to by a hostess on a power trip.  Claimed there was a 3 hour wait for a table when no one else was waiting. When my Mother inquired about the communal table (that seated 6 but only had 2 sitting at it) the hostess cut her off saying &#34;that&#39;s my job as the hostess to figure out seating&#34;. All we wanted to do was grab a bite to eat and this hostess, who is a serious need for an attitude check, had already ruined our appetites.Recommendation to management: ditch the server from Monday night. She&#39;s making you lose business and is tarnishing your name.*UPDATE* - one of the members in our party found the manager to express disappointment in how we were treated by the hostess. He seemed very sincere in his apology and offered to seat us within 10 minutes (the &#34;hostess&#34; told us 3 hours). Half of our group had already left in search of another restaurant so we did not take him up on his offer, but his urgency to ensure a nice dining experience was appreciated. For that, I&#39;ll up it a few stars."

I tend to enjoy beers with fruity notes, so my favorite was the Violet Beauregarde, a lavender &amp; blueberry saison.For my grub, Since I&#39;m a picky vegetarian freak, I got the Mac n cheese with an egg on top.

I was super full after ordering the mac and cheese and adding bacon. I could barely finish it, but I could see why people can say that it&#39;s so-so. I personally love mac and cheese, so I&#39;m never going to complain when it comes out better than what I can make it. Boyfriend&#39;s burger was pretty juicy and flavorful and definitely more than filling as well. He ordered it cooked medium, and it came out perfect. I also LOVED that their french fries were super crispy as well!The staff was very friendly and informative when we asked them some general questions about their beers (styles/flavors, etc.). The only downfall was that, for some reason, there was a lot of condensation on the pipes above our heads (the place has an industrial chic kind of decor), and the water kept dripping on us throughout our meal. Otherwise, I thought that this was a pretty cozy little place to eat!"

Nothin like a nice glass of champagne for a late brunch. When it arrived, his was bubbling like crazy, while mine was almost flat. We asked the server if she could check to see if mine was poured out of an old bottle. She came back with a new glass, claiming they came out of the very same, newly opened bottle. [insert eye roll]I ordered a salad. He order the lobster roll. We got calamari to start.The calamari tasted like typically greasy calamari that you&#39;d get at a pub or cheap restaurant, but hey, it wasn&#39;t the worse. My salad was decent. I&#39;ve had fresher from a salad bar, but it did the trick.My bf&#39;s lobster roll was laughable, to say the least. It looked like a tiniest bit of seafood salad on a lame looking hot dog bun. All that &#34;lobster&#34; for $20+.We asked the server about it. She sent out the manager who seemed surprised that we weren&#39;t ecstatic about the minced canned seafood on a generic roll.Honestly, skip this place!

I was here last year on the beautiful rooftop. We stopped in for some random drinks and appetizers. The kitchens inability to master a chicken wing or mini burger was astonishing. The drinks were overpriced of course because of location but the service tried very hard to make up for everything.Now I tried to give them a chance again this past week for a coworkers birthday party. I ordered the citrus chicken. Idk if it was burnt, over cooked, or just plain nasty. There was no flavor in the chicken, the skin, or the vegetables. The vegetables looked like they were sitting in some type of broth. I can&#39;t explain why this place or the chef is so awful but they are in desperate need of some restructuring."

I know, very specific, but it is the truth. There are not that many restaurant dining options in the area.T at the P is on the fancier end. We came for a casual lunch that we quickly realized was not so casual. This is a white table cloth dining experience where you will pay a little extra for high quality food and service.There is a front area that seems more casual with booth seating and a bar area but we were seated in the back which was quieter and more upscale. Most people were dining as couples and they were dressed business casually. We came in like a storm as those who I was accompanying just finished skating at Millennium Park. We were civil and could be respectful but this was not the lunch we were originally planning for.I am never a burger guy but I always find myself ordering burgers. I think eating burgers is an American thing. So every time I go to a new place I usually have the staple burger which is normally named &#34;[Enter Restaurant Name] Burger&#34;.

I do love me a great risotto dish, and this is one of the best in memory.The wine list is impressive, although I don&#39;t remember what the boss ordered. Well in my defense we did have a copious quantity. Sorry!FYI, it is located across busy Randolph St from Millennium Park, not in the park as I was led to believe.

Okay, but definitely NOT the best Margherita flatbread or (so greasy) calamari...Next time will go with a entrée, my neighbor&#39;s salmon looked interesting, albeit farmed and a whopping 8-10oz.Service was good, as it should be, considering the table was at least 20 people at avg of $25pp... water was refilled and tables bused almost constantly.Entertaining factor - millennial boys wear tight pants and short jacket suits... everyone else is more casual.

Nonetheless, it was very nice.As we were waiting for our table, we had the Mahi Tuna and Salad for an appetizer at the bar, which was excellent. Once seated, our main dishes, however, were just okay. It was nothing special, especially for the expensive cost of these mediocre meals.The service was a bit on the slow side, but all of our servers were very nice and professional.Overall, our experience was A-OK, neither amazing nor terrible.

It tasted terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrible. Avoid, avoid, avoid! It tasted so disgusting that the name vanished from my memory and got buried in the spot of no return. I ordered what my girl friend was drinking, which was the Takes Two to Mango. That was delicious, so I would recommend ordering it. Also, brownie points for the clever drink names.We went during the day, but I think the ambiance and experience would have been better at night. This would make a great date spot in the summer at night. It&#39;s next to Millennium Park, so you can stroll on over there before or after this rooftop bar. Try to get a seat by the window if you can.Side note - shortly before we left, we saw a spider crawling up my girl friend&#39;s drink, which completely freaked us out.

Upon entering, it was a nice sunny- Chicago day with 80 degree weather. I took a friend from out of town there. We were not asked did we preferred patio seating. (Where there was plenty of seating and only a few guest outside) we were seated in the back of the restaurant in the dark. The host ordered the waitress to seat us in the back. I also noticed many other black patrons were seating in the back along with a middle eastern family. The front house and patio was all white.When I got ready to order, the waitress asked if I had a seafood allergy. I told her all seafood including shell fish. She told me anything fried is fried in the same grease as fish--- why ANY establishment would do that when seafood is a common allergy, is beyond me. She then pointed to other menu items I could order but told me it would cost me extra to replace the fish- grease cooked fries that came with my burger, with something not cooked in fish grease. I asked her why- I can&#39;t help that I have an allergic reaction. She then told me &#34;it cost the company more money&#34; why would it cost them more to give me potatoes with my burger instead of fries cooked in fish grease. At that point I told her leave off the side and I will just have a burger instead because I was not going to pay extra for replacing something.The only good that came from this was the manager, James, came out and offered me something to replace my fries with no additional charge.The food was good but the service could use some work- it&#39;s not a &#34;friendly&#34; environment and the extra charge to replace a food item due to a food allergy policy should go in the trash with the crappy host and waitress.  I would say go visit a place where it&#39;s more upbeat and friendly."

Dinner at Tavern at the Park was a real disappointment. We decided to eat at the rooftop which is no more than a big terrace directly above the restaurant. Drinks were terrible. Pretty sure the Margarita was a ready mix. Tons of sugar and hardly any tequila. The 13$ glass of Chardonnay was awful and tasted watered down. My 5 lobster ravioli for 33$ were not big homemade ones. Regular size ones and again Costco quality drowned in sauce. Some small pieces of lobster on top along with sun dried tomatoes that took over any lobster taste there was. My wife ordered the chicken. Regular half chicken on top of a ton of mashed potato. Ridiculous. This place is using low quality food dressed a bit up to look fancy and is charging high end prices. 2 terrible drinks and 2 not tasty main courses for over 100$.Skip this place!

We originally wanted to go to Wildberry, but it was way too crowded, so we settled here. We were seated immediately and the server was quite nice. We had the steak salad and burger teasers. The steak salad was pretty good. However, the burger teasers were a bit of a disappointment. It was pretty dry and there were way too many fries. I don&#39;t think it would be a good place to casually eat, especially if you&#39;re young because you can be quite intimidated by the business people who go there and loudly discuss their work.Although it&#39;s no fault to the restaurant itself, I think the reason why I didn&#39;t like it was because our table was next to a really obnoxious man. During the entire lunch time, he kept making sexist, racist, and flat out ignorant comments."

The guy next to me said, Wow that was lawsuit waiting to happen. I ordered second one it was great like first one. Third one, I could instantly tell he put grapefruit soda in it. I asked him nicely about accidentally putting grapefruit in, he denied it next thing you know I have hives on my face from one sip. I sent it back he was super annoyed and still charged me. The woman on side of me asked if I was ok Bc she heard it and saw me itching. The woman and her friend beside me said, he has been miserable bartender all night.I am given it 2 stars based only halibut dish was fantastic and it&#39;s great to be outside on 2nd floor.

We had the Skybox room reserved which offered a great view of the park and also fantastic service.I started out with a &#34;Cloudgate&#34; cocktail which features pear infused vodka and champagne. It was... not good. Only complaint. It was either over shaken or the champagne was just flat but it tasted like a children&#39;s juice drink. Seriously, only complaint.The menu is CLASSIC well prepared Chicago steak house fare. I really enjoyed the fried lemon slices in the calamari and my short rib entree with polenta was divine. I added a little fresh cracked pepper and BOOM it was heaven on a plate.Tavern at the Park is a completely safe bet if you&#39;re looking to dip your toes into Chicago cuisine in a VERY touristy part of the city."

Service was great. The woman poured my beer straight up. No foam. Impressive.The dinner menu had a nice selection of apps, sandwiches, and plated entrées. I browsed the Tavern Favorites section and spotted the Santa Cruz Turkey Burger. A 10 oz. turkey burger loaded with provolone cheese and guac on a brioche bun. You better be hungry if you order this burger...this thing is a monster. It was absolutely delicious!

Both times I have been very pleased with the service and quality of food.In the summer, the best way to enjoy an afternoon at Tavern is on their rooftop deck called The Treehouse. It is filled with comfortable tables and lounge chairs, great background music, and provides a great view of Millennium Park. During my summer visit I had their Fig &amp; Prosciutto Flatbread which was absolutely delicious. I&#39;m a sucker for anything with truffle oil, and when you pair it with poached pears, blue cheese, and prosciutto... it&#39;s an easy home run. Their Tuna Tacos, Buffalo Chicken Mac &amp; Cheese, and Shoestring Fries with Truffle Aioli were also very good. I have a major sweet tooth so I went to dessert heaven when I ordered their Warm Apple Blueberry Bread Pudding, New York Style Cheesecake, Key Lime Creme Brulee, and Apple Crumble. The bread pudding is MASSIVE and can easily be shared between 4 or 5 people. The cheesecake and apple crumble were probably my favorite.In the winter, I went to Tavern for a romantic dinner in their Tree House Atrium, which is an enclosed glass section on their deck. Very romantic, quiet, and intimate lounge area. For dinner we had their Wild Mushroom &amp; Truffle Risotto and Lobster Ravioli which were both so, so good! I was so happy we took leftovers back to our hotel so that we could have the next day.The service was also excellent. The waiters were very attentive and accommodating. I will definitely we returning to Tavern at the Park in my future visits to Chicago."

But to have it happen on your birthday when you&#39;ve just arrived from out of town really sucks. Ruined our entire visit. After getting in touch with partner, Peter de Castro, I thought they would make things right. I asked to be reimbursed, at a minimum, for the $124 my girlfriend paid for our non-refundable Chicago Pizza Tour. As of today, July 1, 2016, NOTHING. And this occurred in JANUARY.

I decided to stop in for a drink to warm myself up (Macallan 12 neat) The bartender, Philip, was very nice. I asked him for suggestions for places to eat and things to do. I sat next to a kind gentleman who shared a slice of his margarita pizza. I can honestly say this is one of the best margarita pizzas I have EVER eaten. I&#39;m a pizza lover and worked in the pizza making industry for years, so I feel confident in my taste judgements.The only reason I did not put 5 (this place is a solid 4.5) stars was not because of my server&#39;s service, but more because of the way I was greeted at the door. As a host and a FOH manager your reactions and responses set the tone for your business. Maybe I am used to the type of greeting and welcoming tone from my city, but I did not feel that here. Greet your guests with enthusiasm like you are happy to have them and they are not a burden. That&#39;s my only suggestion.Great atmosphere, fantastic bar service, and delicious drinks. Awesome job guys. When I visit Chicago next time I will absolutely come back."

First we had a ridiculous incident with an order of calamari. It was put at the wrong end of the table and some members of the group started eating it without knowing. It was then passed our way and my boyfriend brought it to the attention of the wait staff. We said it was fine but the staff should know they did wrong. They insisted on bringing us another order when we explicitly said no to several waiters. To further embarrass us, they brought it anyways and again, gave it to the wrong people forcing us to explain and involve more people in this annoying situation. Before dinner, twice someone tried to take my wine glass and I told them I was expecting wine. It was like fending people off for my glass. Lastly, when I went to have my leftovers this morning, most of my meal was missing. I had a sandwich and almost full plate of fries and no fries were in the container. I usually ask to full my own container because I don&#39;t like people touching my food. But they took it away before I even had a chance to stop them. Then the fries that I paid for were not even there. On top of everything the food was only mediocre. Not worth $19 for a sandwich. In such a high profile and expensive place, I expect a might higher degree of service. This was ridiculous and made such a scene and basically ruined my evening. I will not be returning to Tavern at the park. This was my first and last visit. I wish I could  take back my tip because it was not earned."

The man who was behind the desk, we found out later was the OWNER, pushed me from behind and said &#34;we want the door closed&#34;, then closed the door. I&#39;m a business owner and being one, I realize people have bad days, I try not to judge based on one encounter but I did not appreciate being pushed.

We had a reservation upstairs on the second floor, and it was nice to see a view of the city all around us. From what I understand they have a fantastic outdoor rooftop deck, and I think that must be spectacular.This was my first time dining here, and I have to say my experience was perfect, other than I wish I would have followed my gut and ordered the short rib sandwich, because I&#39;m still thinking about how good it must be.Overall, the menu had so many options that I truly had a difficult time deciding. It&#39;s not an overwhelming menu and it&#39;s well organized, but it all looked beyond delicious to me. They have a great selection of salads, and for lunch you can choose from an entree or a list of delectable sandwiches - like the short rib.I decided to go with a meatless option today - the butternut squash ravioli dish. It&#39;s my fault for assuming, but I thought the ravioli would be made from butternut squash and stuffed with some kind of cheese. It was plain ravioli stuffed with butternut squash. Here&#39;s the thing. The ravioli were just okay. The stuffing, however, was a mix of sweet and savory. The sauce, when blended together was a tad more on the sweet side, but a nice summer dish. Not super filling.Our server was professional, friendly, gave us plenty of time to search our menus, and I appreciated that he asked if any of us have allergies, because I&#39;m allergic to soy.Great experience, and I hope to get back for that sandwich!"

We said that was fine and that we would just wait around the bar area and drink until a table was ready; &#34;No&#34;, the hostess said, &#34;there is no room at the bar.&#34; We must wait downstairs. Ok...so we waited maybe 20 minutes downstairs until a table was ready. As we enter the rooftop we were expecting it to be mobbed considering the hostess said there were no tables or room at the bar: the rooftop was EMPTY. There were open tables everywhere and the bar was half full. What??This treatment made a poor first impression, but luckily the service and food the rest of the night made up for it. We had two cocktails that were unique, tasty, and decent pours. For food, the fig &amp; prosciutto flatbread was delicious; highly recommended. Unfortunately, the braised short rib was not good; I have had a lot of short rib in the city and this was below average; it was too chewy and tough (short rib should be tender and rip apart easily; go to Pinstripes for an example of a good short rib); the small piece of polenta that came with it also was underwhelming; short rib should come with mashed potatoes in my opinion. We also had a side of mac &#39;n cheese which was tasty.Overall, the rooftop really is beautiful; I recommend you go here for good food and drinks (although skip the short rib) and also be prepared to wait 20 minutes to be seated even if the rooftop is empty (I&#39;m not sure what that was all about - let me know if you find out)."

This location is directly across from Chicago&#39;s Millennium Park and externally is a beautiful building. As per recommendations from Yelpers, I made a reservation and noted that I wanted to be at the rooftop. Upon entering, my reservation was confirmed and coat check was available, as the hostess was about to sit me down at a table, I asked if the rooftop was available - she checked with her manager and it was!!!! I was then led to an elevator and escorted to the infamous rooftop... Unfortunately, due to the weather, the rooftop was enclosed but you still had a view of the park and city, however I was not able to get the same experience that other Yelpers had spoken about (ex: bar area, plush seating, closer views and airiness).I knew exactly what I wanted so I got the following...Smoked Pepper Wings - I asked that these be well done. They came out piping hot and were great! I wouldn&#39;t say that these are &#34;jerk&#34; but they are seasoned very well, I have to say that I was surprised with the quantity given... it was a lot... enough to share between 2-3 people. The Traverse City Cherry Cola BBQ Sauce that is givin on the side takes the wings to another level, I could swim in a bowl of it... it&#39;s sweet and has a hint of spice, you will enjoy it.The Tavern Steak - A 16oz Prime Ribeye, I ordered this well done, this is a lot of steak, lol, I loved that there was more meat than chewy fat and that it was grilled to perfection. It comes with a house made butter which compliments the steak well. I opted to also get a side of onion straws to place on top of the steak (which IMO should come automatically).I know many have concerns about customer service but I had no issues, in fact, my waitress was on it. She overheard me saying that I needed to be quick as I didn&#39;t have much time and came back to check on me as I was waiting on my food to ask if I was OK as she did not want me to be late, she kept my glass full and checked on me throughout the night. I did not encounter any issues with any staff and all requests were answered and accommodated without any attitudes.I will most def be back when I return to Chicago AND the weather permits the rooftop to actually be open in it&#39;s true element."

It started off very unpleasant as we were on a waiting list for a table, and they never called us when our table was ready. After awhile I went back to the hostess stand and they did skip over us and forgot to give us a call. I was assured by the hostess our table would be ready in 5 minutes.After the 5 minutes she said someone sat in our table and they weren&#39;t going to ask my them to move. We waited another 5 minutes and finally received a table.After we were seated, I spoke to the manager James, who completely turned our night around. He was very apologetic, took charge of the situation and assured us things were going to get better. He brought out several complimentary appetizers, was persistent with checking on us and seeing if we needed anything. James was helping the wait staff clean our plates, grab us drinks.If it wasn&#39;t for James compensating for the disaster in the beginning of the evening, we probably would&#39;ve left or not even come back.Every restaurant needs a James."

I guess 3 of 4 ain&#39;t bad.And had I read many of the other reviews, I guess I would&#39;ve known what @$$holes the host and hostess were. I hate to start a decent review with the bad stuff, but chronologically that&#39;s how this is going to go. Thankfully things greatly improved as the night went on.I made a reservation several days earlier and was informed that reservations aren&#39;t taken for the Tree Top, but they would note that we wanted to sit there on our reservation. Unfortunately when we arrived, it wasn&#39;t acknowledged whatsoever. No mention of it. The hostess began to seat us and I asked if we were going upstairs per our request. &#34;No, we only note that on the reservation,&#34; she said rather rudely. I told her we&#39;d wait for a table up there, which seemed to shock her. &#34;It could be an hour,&#34; she said. &#34;I have no idea. But you can sit at the bar.&#34;She pointed to a packed bar.&#34;Where?&#34; I asked.&#34;Well I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s first come first served.&#34;No shit, lady. But don&#39;t tell me to sit there if it&#39;s obviously full.&#34;So what do you want to do?&#34;I said we&#39;d stand there and wait for our table, which seemed to put her off even more and she walked away.Well, we waited for a spot at the bar to open up, and before our drinks even arrived Friendly McCrabbypants arrived to tell us there was a table available upstairs. Once again she showed annoyance when I mentioned that we hadn&#39;t gotten our drinks yet, but my wife absolved the situation by telling me to go ahead upstairs and she would follow when the drinks came.The hostess didn&#39;t go upstairs with me or show me to a table, as she did with every other guest that arrived after us. Instead she simply pushed the button on the elevator and said, &#34;take whatever table you want.&#34; Jerk.Had they simply said something like, &#34;I see you&#39;d like to sit in the TreeTop. Unfortunately there&#39;s no table available right now, but I can seat you in the dining room right away,&#34; I wouldn&#39;t have been so put off by their behavior. But simply ignoring our request was downright rude and uncalled for.But once we were upstairs things changed. It was another world. It was elegant and warm, with an amazing view of the skyline, picture-perfect lit Christmas trees and a roaring pillar fireplace. Everyone upstairs was delightful and friendly, and our waitress couldn&#39;t have been more helpful and attentive.When my wife showed up sans drinks (they were missing an ingredient for one of their signature cocktails at the bar downstairs) our waitress told us they absolutely make it upstairs.The food was divine. We had the duck egg rolls, my wife had a burger and I had the barbecue brisket. Everything was flavorful, delicious and wonderful, and our waitress Nashley checked on us and saw to it that we had an exceptional time.She really turned things around and made what started off as a horrid dining experience into a spectacular one."

They were cleaning and wiping things down. However, they still welcomed us in with a smile. The workers were very friendly and didn&#39;t rush us at all.Now on to the poke bowl, or as I like to refer to it as the glamorous deconstructed sushi. For about 15$, I was able to get the kahuna sized bowl (large). It may seem like a lot of money, but it is very filling. I ordered the marinated tuna with crunch. They really jam pack that bowl and give you your money&#39;s worth; the worker could barely get the top on. After one bite, I was in heaven. The flavors of the tuna, sauces, and garnishes complimented each other so beautifully. I was very full, but every gluttonous bite was enjoyed.I would highly highly recommend! Excellent service, excellent food, what more can I ask for? I definitely will be going back."

I have been looking forward to trying Aloha Poke for months now.I stopped in last Thursday and ordered a small half salmon and half tuna bowl w brown rice.  I added Maui onions, crunch, avocado and the aoli sauce.I thought the bowl was tasty and just enough food for me. They ended up giving me white rice. Not a big deal. And I took off the onions because I didn&#39;t really care for them.It&#39;s affordable and fast. I wish street parking was a bit easier here.

They have a spot as well at the French Market, but I haven&#39;t been to that location yet.Let me start with this: Sone of the softest pieces of raw fish I&#39;ve ever had. I have had poké before, but the between this and the marinade: perfect.The menu was easy to read,  a huge plus since this was my first time here and had people waiting behind me to order. Pick your size, pick your fish, pick your rice, pick your toppings. Easy! Cashier was extremely polite and pleasant, so far excellent service!My only complaint was that they loaded my poké with a TON of onions and cucumbers. I was not expecting that. I wish there was more fish and rice in it.Place is pretty busy, it looks like. I came around 7pm right before the game started, and the place was bustling. I didn&#39;t have to wait long for my food, and i was able to find a spot to sit down.I&#39;ll definitely be back, and hopefully I&#39;ll be able to try the location at Revival as well!"

Every time though the food would be waiting for me after I paid. This is not the case with the Belmont location!!Went in with the bf around 2:30 on a Friday and ordered immediately. There were several people waiting for their food, and it took almost 25 minutes for our poke to come out. I would normally be fine with this except the cashier was fooling around and flirting with the 2 &#34;poke chefs&#34; instead of letting them serve the hungry customers. After one of the fellow customers called them out the 2 &#34;poke chefs&#34; had an argument about the taco salad, all in front of the customers. It was completely inappropriate behavior by all employees and they should take a lesson from their French market counterparts on service."

I haven&#39;t been to the other locations in Chicago but I thought the location was clean and the staff friendly.  It&#39;s funny, like other reviewers have said, they messed up my order as well but gave us another one for free! In this case, mess-ups are welcome :) :)I got mine with sauce on the side. A great tip left by another yelper!I also felt the &#34;big&#34; was a good portion. My friend got the kahuna and ended up taking the rest of it home.I did think the spam jars with plants were cute but staring at the soil while eating my food was pretty unappetizing.All in all, I want to go back!

I&#39;ve been curious about the food and been wanting to try this out for some time. I never had the opportunity till now because prior to their opening in Chicago, there was a lack of poke shops. Poke has a strong presence in the western parts of the US and thankfully, the cuisine finally made its way here in the Midwest!Aloha Poke is a great fast casual option focusing solely on Hawaiian style poke. You can create your own freshly made poke bowl or order a bowl off their preset menu. Their bowls come in 3 sizes (little, BIG, or KAHUNA) depending on your appetite. Their smallest size starts around 8 dollars (after taxes). The seafood, tofu, and ingredients are fresh and when mixed with their choice of sauces, the bowl is absolutely scrumptious!They are located in the hip and vibrant Lakeview shopping district. It&#39;s a popular new business and has become a welcomed addition to the neighborhood. Seating is limited to bar stools and will seat at max 10 people comfortably. Parking is metered and street side only."

My lunch break would become a measly 15 minutes to indulged in this bowl of awesomeness.When I heard news of this location, I was there! Right off the Belmont stop away from the madness of the loop, there is no line, no wait, and super fast service. This poke bowl bar is definitely worth checking out. They even got tofu!Although it is a bit pricey for lunch or dinner, I am still loving it because like Chipotle, you can customize it to your liking. Just 4 easy steps and you got yourself a bowl of awesomeness.#1 - Pick your appetite. First time I tried Aloha I was at the French Market and having to wait that long I went all out and got the Kahuna to make that waiting worthwhile. This time, I got the Big.#2 - Base - If you want it light, do the greens. If you really want this meal to count and actually be full off it, go with rice.#3 - Poke - I tried both the marinated for salmon and tuna. Both are good. Just depends on your mood.#4 - Toppings! - Big fan of making my poke bowl an 808 because you get a little bit of everything off that list! However my favorite is the crunch because it gives the poke bowl more texture. After all that, it is topped with some sauce and my favorite is the samurai and volcano. Not as spicy as you may think, but it really brings the bowl together."

I do have to say, it isn&#39;t the best if you are driving, so busy down this area, and rarely will you get parking on Clark or on Belmont.Went in and laughed my way in ordering since I was a newbie making my own poke bowl. I asked the cashier how many ingredients I can add in my bowl and she smiled happily saying I can have whatever I want!!!I got my first poke bowl (medium) and omg was a huge portion!

When I was waiting for my change, I had the urge to just grab my own change. The line reached the door not because it was that busy, but because the cashier guy was so damn slow.I ordered the large bowl with both ahi tuna and salmon, with mixed greens in the volcano. My husband had the large bowl with ahi tuna in crunch. We also ordered the tako salad (octopus salad). First off, I would like to say the fish was pretty fresh. However, that was about as good as it got. The rest was a disaster. The rice was way undercooked. It literally crunched when you chew it. There was also a whole mound of pickled ginger in my bowl. The kind you get at sushi places where they are like palette cleansers. I mean, I like those pickled gingers, but who eats that much of it? My volcano sauce completely drenched the bowl. The mixed greens were chopped too big, and made the eating process very messy. My husbands bowl was just as sloppy. The sauce was so overwhelming that I can barely taste anything else. The tako salad was mediocre at best. It was overall, very disappointing. There&#39;s definitely better poke elsewhere such as Yuzu."

I wish I liked it but I just don&#39;t. So I got the tofu (big Aloha bowl). It was a very small amount of food and I left still feeling hungry.

However, no ridiculously long lines and better hours! I came by around 9:30pm for dinner on a Friday. The place was still quite popping as most seats (while limited) were full, even though they were closing in a half hour. I only had to wait a few minutes to order as there was just one customer ahead. After ordering, I barely had to wait for my bowl...freaky fast like JJ&#39;s! The lady who took my order and the poke bowl makers were lovely and genuinely friendly and helpful.I got the same thing as I did over at the FM, however in kahuna size this time. After all, it was dinner vs. lunch. Sooo worth it! The larger size equates to nearly 2 meals. I have a big appetite and finished the whole thing, but really, I could have saved half of it for another meal. I love that they are generous with their toppings and ingredients, especially the fish! My personal favorite concoction is a mix of greens and brown rice, naked ahi tuna, rice seasoning, cucumber, maui onion, seaweed, jalapeno, edamame, scallion, avocado, crunch, and tobiko all in spicy aioli. Everything goes so well together. I tried my boo&#39;s Aloha house creation with marinated salmon and added avocado and that was yummy as well. I don&#39;t think you can go wrong with any combination here, just personal preference.Total satisfaction here at Aloha. Great value, fresh, clean, and healthier option! But above all, tasty af!

They soft opened yesterday, but they are officially open TODAY! HOORAY!If you&#39;re not very familiar, poke dish is a Hawaiian snack staple that&#39;s becoming really popular across the country. Aloha Poke staked its claim first and while their French Market focuses on quick serves, this location has a little more homey feel to it.Choose between Ahi Tuna, Salmon or Tofu... marinated or naked. Choose your toppings and off to eat you go. I really love this location, and I hope they don&#39;t get too-too busy like the French Market location with super long lines.

Came here with the boyfriend for a light lunch on Saturday around noon and the kahuna size was more than enough for the two of us to share. Reasonable price for the large portion size.We got brown rice with marinated tuna and salmon, and all the toppings except ginger. We got the volcano sauce, which basically tasted like sriracha mayo.Small seating area and casual ambiance - seats maybe about 20 people or so. A lot of take-out as well.

First, avocado was unripe, hard and tasteless (you can tell in the picture and I don&#39;t know why they didn&#39;t just say they ran out of ripe avocados). Second, rice was slightly undercooked.

While Aloha Poke served up delicious fish and rice, it was more expensive than I&#39;m willing to pay and the portion sizes are miniscule. The small size is about the size of a fist, the medium size perhaps the size of a froyo cup, and the &#34;kahuna&#34; size is the only decent meal-size portion, and it starts at about $15. Meanwhile, I had just had the loaded ahi tuna poke bowl at Furious Spoon, which was larger and only $11-12.Quick tip: If you do go here and decide to go with seasoned sashimi, I would choose white rice to go with it. I chose brown rice and found it a bit too gristly and distracting from the flavor of the fish, whereas white sushi rice would have absorbed and magnified the flavors.As a final note, the fish and rice were tasty, but it wasn&#39;t like the Hawaiian poke I&#39;ve had. It was more like sashimi on rice with extra ingredients as opposed to heavily flavored/seasoned fish in a bed of a variety of seaweeds."

Aloha has quickly become my favorite lunch spot in the city.The medium size is a great deal - with tons of protein, rice &amp; as many toppings as your heart desires.One hack - Get the Kahuna for lunch, and save half of it for dinner!!! Dreams do come true!"

Unfortunately, this was very disappointing.The ahi just didn&#39;t taste right - maybe because I got the marinated kind and that&#39;s not as fresh as the naked - but it just wasn&#39;t good fish. That said, the rest of the bowl tasted very good (minus the unripe avocado), but I just couldn&#39;t get past the fish to finish it.I&#39;m hopeful this may be a result of this being a new location, but I won&#39;t be back for a while unless the quality improves."

It really allows each customer to choose what fits their palette and/ or diet. The tuna and salmon fish is fresh and the topping selection is diverse. The portions are generous for the price. A sushi roll with a fraction of the fish can cost you the price of a small bowl. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a quick refreshing snack or meal with lean proteins and toppings. Definitely a great addition to the area.

You can order a creations off the menu or make up your own many people say get the marinated fish but if you really love sushi get it plain. I got middle size and it was more than enough.

I was counting down the days until they opened in Lakeview by my apartment and just had the chance to go today! It was as awesome as I expected. The best part is, they don&#39;t charge for toppings so you can get whatever you want! I went for a big bowl with marinated ahi, brown rice, avocado, edamame, scallions, jalapeño and tobiko with both volcano sauce, crunch, and spicy aoli. I went all out!! The big size was really filling! I definitely wouldn&#39;t have been able to go for kahuna but the small would&#39;ve probably been enough for a light lunch. I loved the combo, it tasted amazing, even better than sushi. In the future, I&#39;d probably ask them to go light on the jalapeños and maybe would&#39;ve tried a different sauce because the aoli was rich.

Within 12 minutes. great timing, our meals were brought to us.  Along with couple more glasses of wine.    Philia would check in with us periodically.    Both meals were excellent.For dessert, we had opted to try slices of the Key Lime Pie and Peanut Butter Pie.  I have had the slice of Cherry Pie before and it very delicious.Overall, we truly enjoy the food and service.  I would recommend this great supper club."

He started suggestions as soon as I walked in. And asked about a refill within 2 minutes. I think the bartender was training, and he was doing a great job, even as things sped up with more people coming in.They are very particular here about their drinks and the flavors going into them. I heard some of the notes given by a senior bartender to the trainee and got PTSD of when I worked at a very similar bar.OYSTERS AND SHRIMP: Delaware Bay. Plump and fairly firm meat. Some sources describe DB&#39;s as &#34;nutty&#34; in flavor and I can see that. Definitely earthy oysters. This places served them with a mignonette sauce and a ta sauce. The hot sauce was amazing. If I were the kind of person to take sauces in my bag, I would totally do it now.The shrimp were juicy, a little smaller than expected, but a dollar is a dollar I guess. The hot sauce made them awesome. I&#39;ve already added cocktail shrimp and Tabasco sauce to my shopping list.ATMOSPHERE: After work crowd, because I came at 5pm. Light conversation, dim lighting, and soft music playing in the background. The music almost sounded  like 70&#39;s disco or soul. The place starting filling out more as time went on and conversation drifted from a soft din to a more robust situationDRINKS: Guava Margarita was very flavorful with a strong guava taste. Basically what you would expect from the ingredients. The chili lime rim made this drink. I love chili lime rims.Southside was very boozy, though it didn&#39;t taste it, about .5-1 ounce more of alcohol. Very minty and very refreshing.Overall, the Wednesday drink specials make this place doubly worth the happy hour. When you can get a well crafted drink for $6 in the heart of chicago, that catches my attention. The price might make my review a bit biased."

The happy hour at Tortoise is not bad! I had 1 dozen of Delaware Bay oysters for $12, half dozen of jumbo shrimps for $6, and a $12 mint chocolate shake (overpriced because I asked them to make it a virgin non-alcoholic version). The oysters were very fresh, but lacked the oyster liquid. Jumbo shrimps were very plump and fresh as well. The adult milk shake is also very tasty... too bad I can&#39;t drink. I appreciate that the happy hour special is an every day offer from 4:30pm to 6:30pm. ^__^V  Will be back!"

The lunch special consists of 3 courses - appetizer, entree, and dessert. The choice of appetizer was soup of the day (mushroom/asparagus), tomato soup, or house salad. Choice of entree included kale and quinoa salad, bacon cheeseburger, fish and chips, and meatloaf. Dessert was limited to tortoise pie - chocolate custard, candied walnuts, bourbon-caramel sauce, and whipped cream.I started with the house salad - green leaf lettuce, julienned granny smith apples, candied walnuts, goat cheese, cranberries, and vanilla vinaigrette. The salad was great and I especially enjoyed the light vinaigrette, although I didn&#39;t really taste any vanilla. I was conflicted between the meatloaf and fish/chips. I ordered the fish and chips based on our servers recommendation. The fish and chips is not a great value - one piece of fish comes with the order. While I enjoyed the flaky fish, tempura batter and tartar sauce, I couldn&#39;t get past the portion size. The fries were decent as well. The dessert was outstanding and reminded me of a walnut brownie. The dessert is extremely rich if you&#39;re wondering.My co-workers enjoyed their bacon cheeseburgers and meatloaf. I had a taste of the meatloaf and it was definitely the highlight of the lunch. I would return to order the meatloaf.**I revised my rating because the restaurant week lunch special, specifically the fish and chips is not a great deal. With tax and tip I paid $30 for my meal."

The Lake Superior Whitefish had a really nice crust and a pleasantly citrus tinged beurre blanc.The Not Your Father&#39;s Root Beer float was the perfect dessert.Wine markup seems a bit steep, although there was a nicely priced Scotch flight the week we visited."

They had a live jazz bland playing music in the back of a dimly candle lit restaurant. I felt &#34;fancy&#34; lol. I had a mix review on the food. The tomato soup I had was delicious! It was roasted tomatos (not cream based) topped with fresh goat cheese and croutons. Yummy! But the salad I ordered? Ehhh I had the house salad and added chicken. The chicken was dry with little to no flavor and the salad didn&#39;t have enough toppings for taste. The service was great. So I had enjoyable experience.

I was one of them too, always wondering just what exactly was inside this &#39;Tortoise Club&#39; place until I decided to stop by for lunch.We started off with the complimentary cheesy and sesame chips which was super unique and tasty albeit some parts of the chip were incredibly salty. For our mains, we got the French dip and the Tortoise club sandwich. The French dip was alright, the prime rib had no flavor by itself so you must dip the sandwich into the light rosemary au jus for a much tastier bite. The Tortoise club sandwich was like your typical club sandwich with bacon, lettuce, chicken, egg, and avocado. The sea salt vinegar chips on the side were very good. You can tell it&#39;s made in-house; definitely nothing like the ones you get from a bag of chips at convenience stores.Dessert was the real shining moment for me. We got the white peach and champagne sorbet which was DELICIOUS!! It was probably my favorite part of the meal. The taste of champagne really sticks out and then you get a hint of the white peach in the background as well. We also got the bourbon pecan ice cream which although also very tasty, after having the champagne sorbet, the bourbon did not stand out as much until you eat more of it.Tortoise Club is a quaint little spot from the outside, much bigger once you walk in. It&#39;s fairly dim inside but the little lamps at each table work to brighten things up a bit. They have private dinner rooms capable of seating 10+. Service was great but the food came somewhat slowly especially if you have limited time for lunch."

When we got there it had a very old but romantic setting. Dimmed lights, thick table cloths, and more silverware then I am use to. When me and my gf got there we were instantly greeted by 2 associates. We sat in a very nice booth with candle light. I had the New York steak crusted with blue cheese with grilled asparagus. For the price of almost $50 a steak it was okay, I had it done medium but it seemed rougher than normal and the blue cheese was overwhelming the taste of the meat. If you are downtown and really want to go &#34;fancy&#34; and treat your lady go here, the food is just okay but the location is perfect and the ambiance is amazing along with exceptional service."

I realize it&#39;s downtown, and drinks are pricey everywhere, however I want to taste the alcohol in my $12 drink.  These drinks were good, but tasted like high quality sugary juice. The worst part of the evening is that both of my friends ordered oysters (not happy hour oysters, regular priced oysters) and a few of them were so small we didn&#39;t even know if an actual oyster was present.  On top of that, they both said the oysters tasted off.  They sent them back, and they were taken off the bill, but no one really seemed too concerned.

We told him about our 7:30 curtain time and he made sure to get us through all courses with plenty of time to spare from our 5:30 reservation. (No service delays at dessert time which is so common in many places) The wine selections were great.  Bottles run from $50 on so and make sure you have plenty of credit on your card available.We started with the lobster bisque, which had a few strips of zucchini added for enhanced flavor.  Wonderful!For the entrees, my partner had the filet.. They have 2 sizes and choices.. one was stuffed with blue cheese and one without but had asparagus and worchester sauce.   The small size was perfect.So i had the market fish special, which was a grouper with some kind of crab topping. Missed the whole explanation but ... I will say this, it was among the best fish dishes i ever had anywhere.  (And given the number of places and excellent fish offerings I&#39;ve tried, this really says a lot).Dessert was a peanut butter pie..

We walked by here few times and finally decided to give it a try. Our server (forgot her name) but she&#39;s a cute petite young girl was helpful and friendly...accommodating to us since we took awhile to order since the 5 of us wanted to chat. Total time we spent at Tortoise Club was probably around 3 hours. We love the atmosphere - it has a very Chicago feeling, playing jazz music in the background, dimly lit room with artwork around. A nice place to have dinner and catch  up with friends.Our table started with the shrimp and guacamole, crab cake, and each one of us ordered a soup. I had the tomato soup which was decent. My husband had their special cream of corn chowder with crawfish which he thought was ok...didn&#39;t taste much of the crawfish, mainly corn. The shrimp and guacamole was decent. Crab cake was a disappointment, 2 small pieces for $17 and it was heavily breaded. It did not taste as good either.I had the roasted amish chicken. It was decent - I like the sauce on the chicken. It came with potato salad and corn on a cob. I didnt eat much of the corn, but potato salad was decent. My husband had their steak..which he thought was good along with the asparagus. Two friends ordered their white fish..one didn&#39;t really like it, the other liked it. I forgot what my other friend ordered. Shortly later one of my friends threw up in the bathroom - not sure if it was from the food she just ate or from breakfast..We ordered the strawberry shortcake to share with the table as dessert. It was a belated birthday celebration for my husband. The presentation of the shortcake is nice, but the biscuits on the short cake or the actual cake itself was dry. Didn&#39;t really enjoy that, but it came with lots of fruits so we all took bites of the fruits.Overall it was a decent time, and food is just average for our liking. We did enjoy the atmosphere and the music."

I asked him how their Moscow Mule is (&#34;since I&#39;m very picky about my Moscy&#39;s&#34;) and he was like, &#34;yea, it&#39;s fine&#34;. K well I guess I&#39;ll have one. Thanks for making that sound so enticing sir.Anyway, onto the food....We had an amazing Crab Cake for the appetizer, which had a sriracha aioli, pickled cucumber, and crispy jalapenos on top. YUM. So so good. I&#39;d come back just for the crab cake.My boyfriend and I both went with the Chicago 250 Filet, medium rare, and the twice baked blue cheese and bacon baked potato on the side. I also got a blue cheese crust on mine.So anyway, this is where it got really weird....My steak was fine, my boyfriend&#39;s was definitely overcooked, there was no pink or red in there...He was just going to eat it, and I told him he was nuts if he did that, and we&#39;d just get a new one, it would only take 5-10 minutes...I called our overly friendly waiter over, and told him that the steak was overcooked and his response... &#34;I don&#39;t know what you want me to do about that.&#34; oh and then asked him to cut through the steak to show him his steak to prove it wasn&#39;t cooked correctly. WHAT?! What does that even mean. I was so turned off at that point I literally had to look away because it was so unbelievably uncomfortable. We both sat there in disbelief, steak still in front of my him for the next 5 minutes, not really knowing what to do. Anyway the manager finally came over and was like &#34;I heard you may have had an overcooked steak.&#34; To which I replied, &#34;Actually, we could really care less about the steak being overcooked, I just didn&#39;t appreciate the way the server handled it and how rude he was.&#34; Anyway, he comped the steak, and we didn&#39;t get a new one.Long story short, there are many other steak houses in Chicago..."

The meatloaf came with mashed potatoes and Brussels sprout sprinkled with bacon bits. Portions were rather small in my opinion, definitely not enough to share, but if you don&#39;t like sharing then it&#39;s perfect.The steak burger was perfectly tender and juicy the way a good burger should be. The burger came with a side of fries.If you&#39;re party is generally hungry then you&#39;ll want to order at least 1 hors d&#39;oeuvres for every 2-3 people for your entree to be filling."

While they also can do a quick lunch meal, the vibe is certainly going back to the era when face-to-face business mattered for a two-martini lunch. They even say &#34;founded in 2012, inspired by 1959.&#34; In such a flashy area of the city, Tortoise Club is not doing a fly-by-night business. They show that a good, classic meal with genuine hospitality and a homey interior is to be coveted, especially in the year 2016.My ahi tuna steak was massive. I tasted the filet mignon - it was perfectly salted. The fries had that magical texture of super crisp on the outside and soft inside (double fried maybe?). For dessert we split the decadent tortoise pie, fudgy inside and oozing in caramel. Service was professional, straight-forward, friendly and efficient.I work with groups with my tour company, Chicago Detours, and hope to bring clients here. They have a room for up to 60 that is outfitted with a/v equipment, and the design is warm, simple and elegant - a big step up from more generic steakhouses in the area. And the restaurant has some great ties to Chicago history, with paintings of characters from history and wood from the Pump Room.Oh, and check out the jazz on weekends and the happy hour looks great, too!Highly recommended!"

Presented on a bed of crushed ice both were incredibly fresh with a wide selection of wines to suit anyone&#39;s taste. We moved to their romantically lighted dining room well appointed with dark wood and contrasting painted walls. We both chose entrees following the shrimp and oysters. She had the baked grouper which was remarkably fresh and I had the pork chop on a bed of smoked grits which was absolutely delightful. The waitstaff, in particular our waiter Philipe, was very attentive and answered all of our questions regarding the entrees. We closed the dinner with a desert of peanut butter pie and a glass of twenty year port. Both were delectable. I will come here again to enjoy the live Jazz that they have on some evenings.

That can really alter my experience at  a restaurant like this.The fact that he knew it was $1 oysters and shrimps for happy hour and didn&#39;t mention it and charged us full price for it at the end. And then tried to make it seem like it was our fault for not mentioning it though it was clearly advertised when you walk in.

Wasn&#39;t presented which ones were which (really?) but I could figure it out. Very small. Pretty fresh- east tasted a little off but it&#39;s probably a seasonal issue not the restaurant. No shell and separated. Not enough cocktail sauce bc served with other raw items.Tuna tartar: best ever. This was smokey and fresh... Indescribable. Wish the crackers weren&#39;t so flimsy. They couldn&#39;t hold the tuna. You should stop with that rice cracker stuff. So many places do it and it doesn&#39;t work. Use an actual cracker.Caesar: Perfect. I eat a lot of caesar salads and this was one of the best. Dressing tasted a little bit tangy which I really liked.Steak: perfect again. I loved the potato it came with. Perfect.Desert: cherry pie- why not served warm? Good but not mind blowing. Ice cream was fantasticNot Good Stuff...Do you not offer bread? My table didn&#39;t get any but I thought I saw bread at other tables.No drink menu at the table. WTF. Do I look like I don&#39;t drink bc that&#39;s just crazy. Always drink menu. Always.(Star taken away bc oysters not presented, not enough cocktail sauce, rice cracker issues, no drink menu, and mediocre pie)"

Located in the basement of a nearly inaccessible building (fire hazard??), my friend and I were greeted by two blonde short skirts asking if we had reservations. We were sort of anxious that we didn&#39;t but the ladies let us in passed a couple of tables of &#39;ladies who lunch&#39; into a dining area that was dark but upscale into one of their many open tables (it was about 30% full at noon).Long story short, the service was &#39;meh&#39;, the french dips were fine and it was a perfectly reasonable place to have lunch. I could definitely do without the snooty ladies at the door who hoovered over the table next to us not so quietly gossiping about a TV host that was there and scheming to walk by him. It&#39;s a $12 sandwich in a quiet place but don&#39;t take your laptop or hope that the upscale name gives you anything worth paying extra for."

The service was wonderful.  Our server was just the right balance of attentive and not in our faces.  The food was delicious.After dinner, our server brought me a piece of cake with a candle, which was also delicious and very thoughtful.Our whole party walked away feeling like we had a very special dining experience.  It is fancy and fun enough for a celebratory dinner but not so expensive that you couldn&#39;t go there on a normal night.I will definitely be back!"

Small side of slaw, and it&#39;s only one crab cake but it&#39;s HUGE and shareable. We wanted more!Ordered a chilled, bottle of Ken Wright Pinot(approx. $70)2nd course was braised beef short ribs and the lady had chef&#39;s halibut special.The best braised short rib I&#39;ve had. Fall off the bone, tender, and juicy. It was served with first layer of mashed potatoes, then braised beef, carrots and daikon around the dish. Can&#39;t remember the name of the rendered sauce but it was SOO GOODThe Chef&#39;s special Halibut was buttery and flaky. Served with roasted corn on the cob and pineapple salsa. The best part of the Halibut dish was the Lime crema. Splash the lime crema on everything, we asked for more.For dessert we had the cherry apple pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was good, but we both thought it could have been sweeter.The restaurant itself is pricey, but you can taste the quality of food and experience the excellence in service.Come here! Will not be disappointed!"

While this restaurant was recently established, it possessed an old world feel. The decor included dark oak finishings and tables, and nice red and green hues on the walls and furniture.Beyond the comforting decor that harkened back to another era, the food was fantastic. I was pleased with my choice of the tomato soup and ahi tuna tartare. Both dishes were well presented and flavorful. Lumps of goat cheese in the soup and a pairing with a moist and fluffy biscuit really made it a wonderful option.  The ahi tuna tartare was also a perfect, with its fishy and avocado flavor pairing.It was a perfect end to a trip to the Windy city."

Our steak tartare was very good, a little small but spicier in a good way than usual. The Berkshire pork chop was excellent but we would not order the white fish again, either improperly frozen or just too thin to really prepare well, overcooked or mushy- pick one. Small salad was small.It could be quiet and intimate there after 8pm but somebody decided to seat us next to the only other four people, LOUD from the South, we could see outside the bar.The star was the cherry pie with the smallest scoop of really good ice cream we&#39;ve ever seen. We had four glasses of wine and a $25 coupon, and left minus $147 so think before you just wander in here instead of catching the happy hour oyster special.Thanks Sasha, you rock."

It&#39;s in a spot that does not really stand out. You walk down a couple of steps from the sidewalk to get into Tortoise Club.The day was beautiful and we sat outside. The menu does not have an enormous selection, but it was adequate. They are one of the places in Chicago that offers $1 Oysters - but only until 6:30, and we arrived at 7 so we missed the cutoff. We did order shrimp and two types of oysters to try. All were outstanding - very fresh.For dinner, I had a petit filet with pomme fritte (french fries). The meat was excellent - perfectly aged, perfectly rare. The reduction was outstanding and made the meat taste even better. Others with me all got different things off the menu and each shared the same compliments.We skipped dessert in favor of going out elsewhere afterwards. I would definitely recommend the Tortoise Club to anyone looking for a great meal."

It was my choice for a special occasion dinner with a group of close friends. But I didn&#39;t love the TC. I didn&#39;t really even like it. The ambiance is exactly what I had been looking for, very traditional, clubby and mature. My first impression of the look was positive but immediately I sensed an off-putting smell, like all of the wood (lots of wood) had been recently varnished. It was not pleasant, especially for a restaurant. Next, we had requested an area for our group and we were seated in a little alcove which would have worked well if it hadn&#39;t been about 80 degrees with no air movement. It was uncomfortable all evening. We made mention and our waiter ( more on him later) did relate our complaint to the manager. I guess the heat was turned off and to be fair, it was an unusually warm day and the room was packed. But still eating when you are warm- not good. But what of the food you say?Meh. The food was spotty. I, myself had a dreadful meal. My companions seemed to enjoy their meals more but no one raved.Let&#39;s begin with the rolls. Many restaurants give you bread with your meals, free, gratis. But not TC. You can order their special Parker house rolls. What I found special was that they cost 4.95, had weird pepper on the top and were served with an unpleasant-tasting dill butter which sounded better then it tasted. Oh, and you get four per order. I have had much better bread and rolls for free (Wildfire corn bread or onion loaf- unlimited).Next was an uninspired Cesare salad, nothing special for 7.95. So I was super looking forward to my entree, steak frites. But what I got was far from steak frite. It was supposed to be Waygu beef and maybe it was but it was tough and tasteless. I couldn&#39;t cut the steak. And then there were the frites. I have never seen a more sad pile of soggy French fries   . They weren&#39;t frites- I have had delicious steak frites at Mon Ami Gabi and DJ bistro in Lake Zurich among other places. To compound the pain, the waiter wanted to argue with me saying they had never had a complaint on this dish. I asked him to try the frites and even he had to admit they were soggy and cold. So I got the skirt steak which tasted better but was still tough and the celery root mash which was too salty. So basically my meal sucked. As I said, my companions seemed to like their meals. Two had the skirt steak, one had chicken, one had the Cornish hen, one had salmon and one had white fish. Dessert was okay. Folks liked the cherry pie and the peanut butter pie which I felt was too rich but strangely tasteless. We did get free champagne to toast our special occasion and my meal was comped which I would expect. Would I go back. No. Plenty of other great Chicago restaurants to try. I would have given only one star based on my experience but gave two because my companions seemed to like it more than I."

This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. It seems old school but their menu says they&#39;ve only been open since 2012.Do not consider this a stand alone steakhouse. This is a restaurant that happens to serve a limited selection of high quality beef. The first time I went, I skipped the steak as I had just had it the night before. I am glad I did and have had the same thing each time I go (switching up the appetizers). Friends I have gone with did enjoy the steak and loved the blue cheese stuff twice baked potatoes.All of the appetizers I have tried have been delicious. I&#39;d highly recommend the Chicken Liver Pate (if that&#39;s your thing...). It&#39;s some of the best I&#39;ve had and I&#39;ve ordered it each time. The steak tar tar is great too. My friend ordered the calamari the last time, and it was interesting. It was breaded calamari but is not served with marinara--instead it sits in some kind of sauce I can&#39;t even describe--somewhat spicy, but lemony and light. Definitely unexpected and unique.As far as entree&#39;s go, I have had their meatloaf each time. I went out on a limb the first time I ordered it since I&#39;m not a huge meatloaf fan. This is not your mama&#39;s meatloaf. It is flavorful and moist, but with a crispy, flavorful and savory crust. It comes with whipped potatoes and the best brussel sprouts cooked with bacon. And this coming from someone who doesn&#39;t like brussel sprouts either.However, the dessert is one of the biggest draws here. Get the tortoise pie or you&#39;re doing yourself a disservice. It is a chocolaty pie, firm like a brownie, but gooey in the middle, with walnuts. No ice cream needed. The last time I went my friend had the champagne ice cream which she raved about.They&#39;ve got live music on Saturdays in the bar too--but it&#39;s not overpowering. Although I think the drummer was about 70 years old but it was cute.Anyway--I highly recommend it if you&#39;re looking for classic Americana with a twist."

We were here for a birthday party dinner and were disappointed with the food. I ordered the $15 bacon cheeseburger that I asked to be well done. Not only well done outside, the inside tasted burned. My girlfriend had the Amish chicken and it was so tasty to her that she bagged it to feed the alley cats at home. The $12 shrimp and guacamole appetizer was OK. But the $6 Stella Artois and a $12 glass of wine were expensive. After all was said and done our bill was $94 and we wound up going to Chili&#39;s afterwards to eat some good stuff. The waiter was very attentive but he wasn&#39;t cooking the food or creating/pricing the menu. And the topper was the Marina City parking fee of $32 for a 3 hr after 7pm night out. I probably won&#39;t return here if it&#39;s my decision."

But even more important than that is the professional yet still relaxed attitude of the bartenders and bar patrons. It has become our new favorite spot to add to our list. The atmosphere is beyond perfect as is the staff. Special shout out to Cal, our bartender this evening for taking extra special care of us and making us want to stay around for dinner.

We enjoyed the Steak Tartare and Ahi Tuna Tartare appetizers - wonderful! The seasonal soup was also lovely - a very straightforward butternut squash soup. For mains, the Meatloaf and Whitefish entrees were favorites among the group. The cherry pie for dessert was aces!Our waiter and supporting service staff were helpful, friendly, and professional. They offered truly good service. All the while, live jazz added to the traditional and somewhat formal atmosphere.The only drawbacks here are a slightly raucous level of ambient noise - and - if you are looking for culinary creativity, this is not the place you&#39;re looking for.

It was a nice atmosphere, with plenty of seating in the bar area. The oysters were okay. Nothing too spectacular. The Chicagoan was a good drink, but a bit strong for me. If you don&#39;t like a strong-tasting drink, be sure to ask them to dilute it a bit. Easy to rack up a tab at happy hour because there aren&#39;t any drink specials."

Low lighting, dark wood, very comfortable toned down seat fabric but very comfortable chair made our 3-1/2 hour dinner very, very comfortable.I was surprised that they put one server on our group but she did an absolutely terrific job. Cocktails got ordered and the bar was out of Red Bull but they sent a bussboy across the street to pick up a few cans. This did not hold us up at all.Dinner selections ranged from Hanger Steak to the Pheasant Pot Pie.

We went here for a work dinner and the service was terrible. They were slow to take our orders, and when dinner came out our appetizers were still on the table. The person bringing out our dinners just stood there. It was a little awkward. When they were serving water they also spilled it on some of our plates since they were really rushed. After we got dessert and were done, it took at least 20 minutes to get the check. I had to ask for it since one of our clients was falling asleep and I felt really bad for her. Then our waiter told us he comped our dessert, but he really should have comped a bottle of wine or more since it was so bad. The food was good, and the whisky sour was one of the best I&#39;ve tasted, so they have some things right. If the service were better I would come back."

Fair-to-middling entrees.Went here for a joint birthday dinner. While we weren&#39;t disappointed, we weren&#39;t gushing either.I did really like the decor, which reminded me of RL. The large dining room has lots of dark wood and tartan plaid, and the servers are all dressed in preppy clothes. The female staff wear their hair in ponytails tied with grosgrain ribbons.We started with a round of drinks. I had the Southside, which is the perfect summer cocktail. No complaints there.We then ordered four east coast oysters. We were brought six, and decided not to say anything about receiving two extra. I forgot to look to see how many we were charged for. Oysters were fresh and pleasantly briny. The tuna tartare was excellent, and had some diced cucumber and avocado, which added a nice contrast.Get the pretzel bread with a 312 beer cheese dip. So snackable and delicious!The tomato soup had a very pronounced, deep tomato flavor and was served with a goat cheese crostini. Excellent.We were quite full after the appetizers so we opted to share a ribeye and a side of creamed spinach instead of each of us ordering full entrees. After waiting almost 40 minutes for our entree (this is when they really lived up to the &#34;Tortoise&#34; part of their name), our steak was served, and they split it in the kitchen, which was nice. Now granted, we were sharing this, so we weren&#39;t expecting huge slabs of meat, but we got only about two bites each, so I guess it&#39;s good we weren&#39;t that hungry.The steak was not that good. It was thin, had no discernible &#34;char,&#34; and very little flavor. I expect a filet to be bland, but not a ribeye. Truthfully, I&#39;ve had better steaks from Jewel.The creamed spinach was downright awful. I&#39;m not sure how they can legitimately call this &#34;creamed&#34; spinach because it was just leaf spinach sitting in a coagulated pool of gloopy white stuff. The spinach wasn&#39;t incorporated into the sauce at all. Pretty disappointing.I wasn&#39;t all that keen on ordering dessert, but they offered to buy it since we waited so long for our entree, so that was appreciated. We ended up with the Michigan cherry pie a la mode. Again, decent. Not fantastic.Tortoise Club is okay. I would definitely go back for a drink or an appetizer, but for dinner, there&#39;s a ton of other places in the area that do it better."

It&#39;s a fancy upscale restaurant and we were greeted very enthusiastically. I felt out of place in jeans with the business professional crowd, but the service was excellent. The crowd during lunch was older and it appeared everyone had ordered a lunch time drink. We followed suit and our waitress was able to recommend some drinks based on our likes. The drink my friend got she didn&#39;t care for, but they apologized and got her the same drink I was drinking that she liked.I have been an active participant in restaurant week for the last 3 years and have developed a love and hate relationship with the restaurant week menus. I love the fact you can get a three or four course meal and get away with only paying $22 for lunch, but I&#39;m beginning to notice some places are not offering the popular items, but stuff I probably wouldn&#39;t want to try anyway. That was sort of the case for this place. My friend and I weren&#39;t feeling the dessert option they had listed for restaurant week, so we decided to just order off the regular menu.We both ordered the Steak Frites which is a 6 ounce filet with fries. The fries were not good at all and the steak was rather dry. We both ordered our steak Medium Well, but it was too cooked. I don&#39;t think we got our money&#39;s worth for the price we paid. Based on the price and the lack luster food I probably wouldn&#39;t revisit again, but then I was told they have live jazz...so maybe...just maybe...I would like to go back for that.

Lest I think that was enough I selected the sweet tasting house salad (one of the best I have had, almost dessert-like), the Lake Superior whitefish (chewier than expected but this was how it was to be prepared), and finally a Hummer (&#34;adult milkshake&#34;) for dessert, very rich for the blood but all so great tasting and palatable for a special yearly splurge."

I gotta hand it to these Ladies, they really know how to brighten up your morning.I ended up ordering my usual, The Veggie Omelette - Side of Hash browns &amp; Wheat Toast. My Boyfriend ended up ordering the Steak &amp; Stack, this meal is pretty hefty, it came with Steak - 3 Eggs - 3 Pancakes!! Check out the photo if you&#39;re wondering just how big this meal is!Everything was great! The food is always good, The conversation with the staff always brings smiles and lots of laughs, and the atmosphere is just so welcoming!

The servers were quick to go above and beyond to make sure everything exceeded our expectations.I enjoyed the eggs, sausage, bacon, French toast, and coffee. While I can&#39;t guarantee the ingredients were fresh and high quality, they certainly tasted as if they were. It was a lot of fun to watch the cooks work the grill in tandem like a well-oiled machine and get everything plated quickly and delivered to us within minutes.It appears as though the owner has good control over what is going on here and was present and working with his staff. He was a super nice guy to talk to and filled us in with a little history of Don&#39;s. For three breakfasts and three coffees, the total came to under $25. The value certainly can&#39;t be beat for the taste and service. I&#39;ll make it a point to visit this throwback of a diner the next time I&#39;m in Chicago."

You&#39;re driving north on Western through Pilsen, and tucked away in the midst of all the run-down industrial buildings, shady cell-phone shops and dirty strip malls, you spot it -- Don&#39;s. Huh, that&#39;s tiny. Looks like your typical little diner. But then you notice that it&#39;s packed with people. And you think to yourself, &#34;Wow. It&#39;s either really good, or really cheap, drawing a crowd like that.&#34;Let me tell you, it&#39;s both.I stumbled in one morning with a terrible hangover and a craving for some cheap, greasy-spoon munchies. Boy, was I satisfied. And yes, I&#39;ve been back several times since, with and without hangovers. This place is consistently delicious, and the prices are great. Staff are incredibly friendly as well.There isn&#39;t one thing on the menu that isn&#39;t executed just right. I can&#39;t recommend this place enough (especially for breakfast)!

A 24hour diner on 18th and Western.Surely, he was joking.I&#39;ve been in this area 2 years and haven&#39;t known anything to stay open past 10pm. So I walk over and there it is...like a beacon of hope. Don&#39;s.I had the 2 x 4 (2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 links, 2 bacon) for about $6. This really seems like the first meal you should order in a place like this. Although in other diners in the same arena, I&#39;ve had the same meal for like $4. I will admit that the others rarely have tasted as good as my food at Don&#39;s. There was a guy at the end of the bar who just kept telling his girlfriend, &#34;Look at how fluffy those pancakes are!!! And look at the links!!&#34;. Serious business.The place so tiny and out of the way. I felt like I was in a 90&#39;s indie movie. I was waiting for Christina Ricci to come out of the kitchen and take my order. The actual waitress was even better - so sweet and attentive and she knew how to HUSSLE. It was only her working with myself and 4 other customers. She took my order, cooked the food and had it on the table before I could even log on to check my Facebook!

It&#39;s one of those trucker&#39;s diners that just has a counter around the grill and one cook and one waitress. It&#39;s usually a show watching them work...especially the cook, they are such whizzes at the grill. Good food and people watching at this joint. They are open 24/7 so if you happen to be passing through you can just pull up into their parking lot and have some good ham on the bone or pancakes, or greasy cheeseburgers...or oooh their fries. Good eats!"

This chef clearly understands seafood.The prawns were the best I&#39;ve ever had. They were huge and in a rich, spicy sauce. The sauce seemed like a reduction of lobster or prawns. It was one of the best sauces I&#39;ve ever encountered. After eating their sweet, meaty bodies, I ate their heads and eyeballs. It was divine!This chef is clearly a genius. I highly recommend this restaurant."

I ordered the &#34;The Crying Game&#34;, a potent and manly cocktail from their Bebidas menu. It was served on the rocks and made with overproof rum, 2 other kinds of rum and bitters - with no true &#34;mixer&#34; it&#39;s strong. Perfection.Once seated, we started with pan de queijo (cheese bread) - don&#39;t think of typical American cheesy bread from Dominos. It&#39;s more like a warm pillow of baked dough filled with a soft gooey cheese. Next, we ordered the garlic frites - crispy fries topped with a generous amount of herbs and salt and served with some bomb aoili! We also ordered the coxinha, a smoked chicken croquette - it was pretty good, but not a standout. We weren&#39;t too hungry so we didn&#39;t get entrees, but we did get DESSERT! The panna cotta was so damn good! Such a complex dish and variety of flavors packed into one amazing dish.We loved the atmosphere here - the bartender that served us our drinks and our server were both amazing and attentive. The restaurant was dimly lit and quiet. It&#39;s a perfect date night spot - check it out."

Its pretty close to my neighborhood.  Directly across the street from Swift &amp; Sons.  It has an appealing decorum.  Tin plated ceilings, drop bear bold lights, old chemistry looking lab stools at the bar.  Very industrial looking.  The bar is made of reclaimed wood as well as some of the bar shelving.  The chairs are reminiscent of woodworking shop chairs.My server is John (who is fairly new here).  I start off with a Pisco Sour. A traditional Cocktail of Latin America.  It&#39;s made of Peruvian Pisco, Lemon, touch of sugar, foamy egg white, and Peruvian Bitters.  Despite the small amount of bitters used in cocktail recipes, they have a very definite effect on the flavor profile of a drink, helping to bring the ingredients together. Don&#39;t think that because of the name it will immediately make the drink bitter. In this cocktail, bitters works more like adding an herb to a sauce, it is an essential ingredient on any bar.Had the empanadas to start, super flaky and buttery crust, and the meat was tender and super flavorful.I had the Kale salad and added chicken and avocado.  I&#39;m a bit of an avocado head, and could pretty much eat it with anything.  I just Haas to have it!  haha  The salad was very fresh tasting, with big chunks of avocado and chunks of very juicy chicken, thinly sliced radish.  The kales rough texture and slightly bitter taste are the perfect match for citrus notes and the cotija  cheese.The dessert was literally amazing!  I&#39;m a bit of a critic when it comes to desserts (for those that know me and what I do for a living).... The Hibiscus Coconut Panna Cotta.  Topped with honey chamomile toasted meringue, Chartreuse caramel, blueberries, and pistachio.  Every element of the dessert went so perfectly together.  The ultimate in refreshing and not too heavy.  Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!"

Kale salad was creamy but with enough heat from the jalapeno to stand up to it.  Grilled Asparagus were tender and delicious. Empanadas were good but sort of boring. The whole fresh fish was absolutely delicious with an array of flavors that seemed more Asian than South American.  It was snapper on our evening but I&#39;d order it regardless of the day&#39;s fish.  Pork Milenesa was good but a little dry and the hanger steak was expertly cooked and delicious.This place has really matured and I love coming here for a more restrained, comfortable meal when I don&#39;t need to live on the edge with some hip newcomer."

Service (especially at the bar) is always stellar.The only reason I haven&#39;t rated this 5 stars is due to the small protein size - chicken or shrimp is a *lot* extra and I only received three small shrimp the last time I ordered.I&#39;d recommend making a lunch res or planning to sit at the bar during the week."

We were able to get last minute open table reservations on Saturday night for 2 at 7 PM. From the outside, I got even more excited because I thought it was so cute!Well as soon as we walked in we felt so awkward because the host was giving menus to people seated right next to the door but was also trying to greet us. Then the manager came by and instead of speaking to us, made it even more awkward by pointing out our reservation to the hostess and it was just an odd encounter. We got seated towards the back away from the window which was dark and a view of the chef standing by the kitchen.The server didn&#39;t come by us at all. The manager came to us after 10 minutes asking what we would like to drink. We ordered capirinhas. By the time we got our drinks we still had no server. The busboy came by and we ordered with him. We got the ceviche, empanadas, and flank steak. The busboy suggested we get the rice dish too so we did. 30 minutes went by, no one checked on us and we only got our ceviche. The ceviche was tasteless and very fishy smelling, which only makes me believe it was not fresh. We were starving at this point so getting hangry. 15 minutes later they brought us 2 empanadas, which we described as hot pockets.Still no server by the way. Maybe we got no service because we didn&#39;t look bothered or annoyed at all. We were talking and laughing, enjoying our time together but it was annoying with no food and no service. With no service and first 2 dishes being awful and so were our juiced up drinks we decided to let the manager know to please cancel the steak and rice, give us our check for what we had as we would like to go. She insisted that our dishes were coming out but we were over it. She asked if we would like to take it to go anyways at no charge. We paid for our drinks, the ceviche, and empanadas came out to $48. We were there exactly one hour and had only our 2 appetizers without service. We tried the steak and rice and thank Goodness we left. Ended up giving throwing it out unfortunately because the steak was medium rare but tasted like chewing gum. The rice was probably the best tasting dish we had out of the four but nothing to ride home about or give a second chance. It was just mushy yellow rice. Overall everyone should save their money and time. There&#39;s plenty other amazing and delicious restaurants around...like next door! ;)"

We recently returned from a trip to South America and wanted to try Chicago&#39;s version. It was pretty darn good, and I love how creative their menu is!La Sirena Clandestina is located on Fulton Market in the West Loop. The restaurant itself is small and intimate with a bar in the front and high ceilings. Atmosphere is rustic chic. Unfortunately they have a metal ceiling, making acoustics a bit poor. Sound control could have been better, and we were speaking loudly for the first half of our meal until the crowd thinned.We each started with a cocktail. Their pisco sour is to die for. I could drink this all night every night. For dinner, we decided to share all our dishes as a table and we started out with the kale salad. It&#39;s a basic salad but the dressing is delicious. Portion size was very generous and there was plenty for the four of us. Afterward, we each ordered an empanada. The flavors of the evening were sweat potato and black bean. I loved the sweet potato, while other members of our group preferred the black bean. We also ordered the cheesy bread. These are really just a small bite each (an order came with 4, one-bite size bread balls), but a nice taste nonetheless.For main courses, we tried the tuna steak, hanger steak, pork shoulder, and the moqueca. We also ordered a side of rice and beans. All the entrees were fantastic. I particularly enjoyed the moqueca, which was a rice and seafood stew with head on praws and clams. The seafood was extremely fresh and portion size was again, very generous. The tuna was served tartare and melted in your mouth. Finally, the pork shoulder was extremely tender and served with some delicious potatoes and greens to top it off. If coming with a group, do keep in mind that portions are quite generous, and you don&#39;t necessarily need an entree / person.We finished up with alfajores, and these were delicious. A little different than the ones we had in South America in that the cookies were much thinner. Our experience here was great. I appreciate their menu having lots of different choices and items. I would knock a star based on the fact that I think they use a bit more salt than I prefer, and because of the acoustics. I would definitely return, especially for a Pisco Sour!"

I first wanted to check this place out because I heard it was designed by local Chicago artist, Brian Willette. As a big fan of his work, I was hoping the food would be as good as Brian&#39;s art. And boyyy it sure is.  I&#39;ve had some truly terrific and innovative dishes here at La Sirena. Some of my faves include the sword fish ceviche, braised rabbit empanada and duck heart confit. Truly all of which had stand-out flavors and an interesting rather unique twist on Latin cuisine.Yes La Sirena yes!I suggest bringing some cash so you can valet because it definitely is hard to park in the ever-growing Fulton Market District.

Bf had the pisco sour and peruvian ambassador, the latter of which was one stiff drink. Both were delicious though.We ordered a ceviche, hangar steak and moqueca. While the flavors were excellent, I thought they were a tad stingy with seafood in their ceviche. The moqueca, however, was piled high with delicious shrimps &amp; shellfish. The steak was good but over-salted. Also wished it came with some veggies on the side, especially given the price of the dish (hangar steak is supposed to be budget cut!).I liked the food &amp; drinks enough to go back, but given the prices this is a special occasions place, not for neighborhood weeknight dinners."

It was also a very filling dish. I could barely finish it all. We started with the empanadas as an appetizer. The dough was quite delicate and flaky and the fillings were delicious.

Most importantly, the food was outstanding! The atmosphere was sophisticated and cool, vintage with a funky urban twist. I would have definitely given five stars, yet the pricing was slightly on the pretentious side. That being said....this location is the hottest restaurant scene in Chicago, so I expected the prices I paid. Ultimately, it was worth it. I had a great time. It was relaxed, it was cool and the food was top notch. I&#39;ll be back and if I have the same experience next time, they&#39;ll get that 5th star!"

I came here on a Tuesday night at around 9:30 and a Thursday night at around the same time. A lot of the stuff they have is tapas sized.

The reviewers who rave about their Kale Salad are right, it&#39;s fantastic. However I was even more impressed with Moqueca sort of a cross between Thai green curry and Bouillabaisse ( outstanding!!! ) and their Short Ribs were out of this world (i don&#39;t recommend sharing) Of course these are just highlights! We shared many items as a group of 4 and there wasn&#39;t anything short of simply delicious served!The place is very cozy, has a dark rustic feel with a waitstaff who cares. They have a very interesting wine list. Our amazing waiter who&#39;s name escapes me (he was a tall dude in a black shirt with giant glittery wings on the back)  knew his wine and his suggestions were excellent.

Was very impressed with the steak and chimmichurri dish - SUPERB. Asked for a medium steak and got something a little more on the rare side, but the flavors and quality made up for this entirely.

Biggest disappointment was the spring lamb. Although the preparation was perfect (especially the terrine part), we expected a lamb entree and pretty much got an appetizer. There must have been 5-6 small cubes of lamb, which for $20 makes sense, but either raise the price and offer a satisfying portion or specify that it is a small dish.Delicious lamb curry empanada, great flavor on the elotes (served on the cob).Loved the ceviche, but you can&#39;t really tell the difference between the squid, shrimp, and mahi.We&#39;ll give it another try in the winter, when the heavier dishes will be more enticing."

She and I were walk-ins Saturday night early - around 5:25 p.m. The small dining area was almost empty and the bar was entirely so. Paige was our server and she was attentive and gracious at all times.We split three dishes, starting with the kale salad which is huge but not too filling. Since my daughter is a pescatarian and a &#34;spice wimp,&#34; they agreed to put the jalapeño peppers on the side of the salad. Its fresh cotija cheese was a tasty counterpoint to the kale. The poblano dressing was not very spicy.Next was the ceviche with toasted pepitas and a kind of creamy green dressing that set it apart nicely from the typical lime juice ceviches you&#39;d get on a warm beach somewhere. It comes with what the menu calls house made saltines that are actually more like large pieces of flat bread papadams. This was a great combo and disappeared quickly.Paige checked with the chef to make sure they could make the grouper entree without the morcillo (which I suspected and we confirmed was blood sausage.) It didn&#39;t need it, as it was served over a bed of white beans and maple glazed sweet potato purée. Small portion but delicious, all the same. We couldn&#39;t leave without trying one of their famed empanadas - this one with cream of mushroom filling. The crust was flaky but the filling was unremarkable - the only let down if the night.Several times during our meal, Maria (who seemed to be the manager) came over to check on how we were doing. When we told her about my daughter&#39;s profession, she spoke with us at length about other places to try in the neighborhood, spots with good deserts and breads and went out of her way to be helpful, supportive and informative.When we were about to pay the bill, Maria sent over two comped deserts: a shortbread cookie with dulce de leche and a flourless chocolate cake with fresh mascarpone and a gooey, delicious ganache. Try to save room for these. You won&#39;t regret it.As we were leaving, the place was filling up and getting quite loud, so it could definitely be &#34;conversation-challenged.&#34; That said, kudos to everyone at LSC.

We were greeted by friendly hosts in this romantic, chatty atmosphere, dark lit, smaller restaurant in the West Loop on Randolph.We were seated on connecting tables on the beautiful dark wood and comfortable dining chairs and booth.The Good:-Drinks are fantastic. I ordered a daiquiri with the seasonal fresh fruit of green apple. It was not a slush, but it was perfectly strong and sweet.-The chicken was flavored fantastically. The outer crust had a char, and it was tender, over chimichurri sauce. The portion is perfect for one person. I decided to split it but didn&#39;t need too.The Bad:SERVICE IS VERY SLOW: I understand the meaning of a busy kichen on a weekend night and how group dinners can be challenging to serve warm all at once, but 20 minutes for the appetizers and 30 minutes for the entrees. It was a bit ridiculous. No apologies for wait time or complimentary appetizers for the wait.OUR WAITER:-We asked our waiter to take a group picture. It was 9 ladies, the birthday girl brought her boyfriend. One of our friends asked our waiter if he can also take a group picture using her phone. He made a sarcastic comment saying &#39;He will text it to you.&#39;-My friend asked for a &#39;Kale Salad&#39; and he repeated back &#39;Pear Salad&#39; but my friend hadn&#39;t heard it. He came back with a pear salad but there was no pear salad on the menu. That whole thing was weird. He should have mentioned there is no pear salad on the menu. But he &#39;covered&#39; the pear salad.-He brought out plates for everyone for the birthday girls surprise birthday dessert when we didn&#39;t order any dessert or look at a dessert menu. It ruined her birthday surprise.OVERALL: It&#39;s sad that not many restaurants have a Brazilian and south american cuisine and this one does. I feel bad for the Chef, really. But the restaurant does stay busy. If you like a drink- come here, it&#39;s perfect to sit at the bar and share a dish but I wouldn&#39;t schedule a group dinner or come here on a weekend night. I strive for service, and Randolph street is competitive enough with wonderful restaurants so I would just skip it."

I work in the area and have made this small gem a favorite - especially on a cold day. I am particularly fond of their black bean soup. On a cold day, a bowl of that is the perfect way to warm up and keep yourself going the rest of the day. It does have some heat to it (the type of heat you feel not taste) so if that scares you, you might want to only do a cup or at least ask for extra crema. But if you like beans this soup (and the homemade crackers it comes with) is not to be missed.I&#39;ve also tried the empanadas, which were great; the cuban and the brazilian beef, which were both tasty but the type of sandwich you need a nap after. Also, I&#39;ve not tried them yet, but I&#39;ve heard the Alfajores (a type of cookie) will knock your socks off.The service here has always been attentive and friendly, especially at the bar, and their out door tables are nice for a beer on a hot day.All in all a solid spot that you keep wanting to go back to."

The ceviche sauce was to die for, I wanted to lick the bowl clean. The empanadas were on the smaller side, but spot on flavor wise (my bf and I shared the &#34;Cubano sandwhich&#34; one). I like that the entrees are really built to share, and that the meat plate offered us a taste of all the meat dishes we were hankering to try anyway (hanger, sweetbreads, blood sausage, and a couple others). The fries serving was huge, which was fine by us with how tasty they were, but a little strange given it was a side item.

Let me say we had a feast!!! The interior of this place still stands out to me. Very intimate appeal with the dim lighting and rustic décor.Love the fact that reservations are confirmed through text. When I came previously the place was pretty dead (Mind you I came on Easter Sunday previously). Last night that was not the case. The place was at full capacity. Great place to go with the girls, date, whatever you fancy. Our waiter Jugo (sp) was great! He recommend some really superb selections for us.For drinks I tried to keep it native and went with the Pisco Sour and Caipirninha. Really refreshing and I highly recommend either. My other friend went with the Heritage Daiquiri and was really pleased. I found all the cocktails to be on the sweeter side and I enjoy that, but for those of you that don&#39;t like sweet they weren&#39;t overbearingly sweet.For appetizers we knew we had to get the Empanadas. They change the selection daily, but hopefully you&#39;ll be able to try the ones we got cause they were delicious! The two specials last night were the potato/provolone and the Chicken/garlic/Onion. Both were outstanding and flavorful. I&#39;m a huge fan of garlic and that really aided to the flavor. I would describe the empanadas (no matter which kind you get) flaky goodness :)  For our other starter we got the shaved Brussels Sprout salad. Very beautiful presentation and we really enjoyed the tartness of the ingredients. Having the Brussels sprout shaved versus whole give it a different taste.Entrees: Of course we all ordered something different so we could share- Grilled Swordfish - If you&#39;re not into fishy fish..lol. This is the item for you. On its own it&#39;s a little bit bland, but paired with the beets and the Feijoada Black beans and Rice it&#39;s really really good!- Grilled Hanger Steak - I&#39;m a huge meat eater and was in love with this dish. The icing on the cake was the chimichurri sauce. Excellent flavors. The steak really went well with the Garlic Frites. Fries are not extra crunchy and seasoned to perfection.- Seared Scallops - By far all of our favorite pick. You get 3 huge scallops and the mixture of the corn and chilles salad that pairs with it was mouthwatering!Were we full by now. YES!!!! Did we keep going for dessert....YES!!! LOL...they do have a dessert menu and we had a hard time choosing between the Buttercake, Tiramisu, and the Dolce de leche cookies. We ended up going with the Buttercake. It wasn&#39;t anything like we expected, but it was still good. I&#39;ll warn you we shared, but the size is more for one person. We were expecting a cake and it was more like a pie slice. Not too sweet and the texture reminded me a little bit of flan. The warm plums on top though were interesting.I love that the menu isn&#39;t too extensive and the focus seems more on making each dish the absolute best. They have delivery, so I just might have to check that out in the near future. I was stuff, but I&#39;m looking forward to trying the sweetbreads and la bomba rice next time! A little on the pricey side, but great place to go for a fulfilling Latin inspired meal."

We made Open Table reservations and are glad we did - the place is really small with only a few tables which are really close together.Ordered the Heritage Daiquiri which tasted really good and sweet, however only got a few sips since 90% of the glass is full of ice. For $11, the ice-cocktail ratio should definitely err on the side of the drink.Onto the food: I was looking forward to the kale salad, but was bummed it has gluten so I passed up an app since I was going to order a hearty entrée, the grilled hanger steak. I asked for it well done (which I know some chefs say it won&#39;t taste as good overcooked, but I&#39;ll take it).Once the food arrived it was so dark I couldn&#39;t really tell until after my first bite that my steak was probably at best medium rare. On top of that, it was not the full flank of steak you get at most places when you order hanger steak, it was just about 6-8 small pieces of steak with the oiliest chimichurri sauce I&#39;ve ever tried. The worst part though was how extremely salty it was seasoned, it was almost inedible. For $31, the steak also doesn&#39;t come with any sides or anything.The saving grace with the flourless chocolate cake I ordered for dessert.Really pricey food for the portions you get - and drenched in salt. Add this to the fact that every time you have to get up from your table your bum ends up on someone&#39;s table because it&#39;s tight quarters and this will be the first, and last time I come here. Just way too many other places to eat at in the city!"

We came on a date night, and had a wonderful dinner! It was restaurant week, but we had not planned on participating.We started with the ceviche, which was delicious and the portion was very generous. I loved the &#34;saltines&#34; this came with - very crisp flat bread. After looking at the menu, I had decided on the stew, which only then made sense for me to participate in the restaurant week menu! We choose the Kale Salad as our starter and this was probably the best part of our meal - it was DELICIOUS! I know that sounds weird since its only a kale salad, but trust me - its amazing.For my main, I had the stew and my boyfriend ordered the Feijoada - a mixture of different beef and rice, beans and spinach. We both were a little MEH on the mains. The first two starters were so great and these just didnt really compare, unfortunately! Dont get me wrong - they were good, but not as GOOD as I would have expected.Finally, we had the Tres Leches, which was the great ending to our meal! I would HIGHLY recommend checking this place out. Maybe next time, I will stick with some of the smaller offerings towards the top of the menu so we could sample more.Side note on the drinks, there seems to be a lot of ice in them and not as much booze for $13. For my second, I ordered a glass of wine to make sure I got more bang for my buck!Lastly, our waiter was GREAT! He was not pushy, knew the menu so well and answered so many questions. He was truly one of the best waiters I have ever had."

The food was OK and the service harried but passable, but the prices seemed high and the ambiance (décor, crowding, and especially NOISE) was unpleasant.Foodwise, a kale salad was good (if overly salty and bread-cubed). A meat/cheese empanada was OK, but rather ho-hum. Piri-piri chicken thighs in romesco were tender &amp; tasty (except for the slightly burnt flavor of accompanying onions). Smoked ribs were delicious, though the dish could have used more coconut puree. Overall, A-OK food.The wine list was another matter. To start, price points are too high -- all but one red were $50 or more. There should be more bottles in the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s. This is a Latin-themed restaurant with many picante dishes, but the wine list is mostly Italian and French varieties that are not heat-friendly -- lots of tannin, not much juicy fruit. There was no tempranillo, no zin, no primitivo, no shiraz, and just one (pricey) garnacha. Maybe it&#39;s a millennial thing: everyone drinks beer or cocktails? Whatever. We tried a couple of wines; one was bad (from two bottles), the other just not very good, and both were overpriced.Regarding ambiance, it&#39;s a narrow room with high tin ceilings and exposed ducts, so the crowd noise is awful -- way conversation-challenged. The décor is spartan (hip?): rustic wood tables, no decorations. The tables were crowded together more than I prefer. Definitely not the place for a pleasant dinner conversation.Overall, I&#39;m glad I tried La Sirena, but it&#39;s just not my thing. I won&#39;t be back."

Because when you dine at a restaurant that specializes in empanadas, you order empanadas.The Gala Apple &amp; Fennel Salad was light, bright and crisp. It was dressed with a lovely, grainy mustard vinaigrette and sharp Dunbarton blue. Apples carried into the next dish, too, which was a Grilled Spanish Octopus served over acorn squash romesco and apple-celery relish. Ordering octopus can be risky (or maybe that&#39;s just my take because I&#39;ve had one too many pieces that are akin to chewing on a tire), but this was done right - charred with just the right amount of chew. Tart vinegar-y roasted Brussels sprouts on the side paired deliciously with the octopus. Yes, they&#39;re greens, but these cruciferous veggies add substance, and the Tropea onions they&#39;re cooked with make the dish even heartier. The empanada looked and smelled heavenly, with a golden - and in some parts, just a touch darker - baked exterior.We were talked into dessert, although realistically, it didn&#39;t take too much talking. We ordered carrot cake. Unlike most places, where ordering carrot cake means ordering an oversized triangular slab with a 1:1 ratio of cream cheese to cake, this slice was delicate. It still maintained that dense, luscious texture that&#39;s a requirement of any true carrot cake. This dessert capped off the meal perfectly, leaving us full and satisfied but not overstuffed."

In a Brazilian restaurant, therefore, naturally I had to start off with a capirina drink which was perfectly delicious. As for the food; the octopus, bomba rice, hanger steak, heirloom tomato salad, empanadas were all delicious. I do have to mention that the national dish of Brazil feijoradha was delicous, but also, over priced($34).  Especially when you consider that it&#39;s mainly a rice and beans dish. The service was friendly and helpful. Overall its a great addition to the other great restaurants on this strip of Fulton street."

The ceviche mix was zesty with plenty of lemon kick, but not enough to overpower all the flavor. It&#39;s a refreshing order, perfect for the summer season. The presentation in the martini cup is cute, but not exactly practical for mixing the ceviche with the guacamole! The house-made crackers had a nice salty pastry flavor, so you don&#39;t have to worry about eating the ceviche with some cheap store-bought saltines.I like that the empanada is baked and NOT fried, the pork belly meat option sounded amazing but if you don&#39;t want to feel guilty, the vegetarian version is a nice alternative. It&#39;s a bit small and the order only comes with one, but at $4 it&#39;s not exactly expensive."

We found out after we ate about half of it - and basically, I will feel this tomorrow but one thing I must say is the staff handled it very well, comped us some food and was very apologetic. It does count for something. We really enjoyed the fried cauliflower though, it reminded us of Indian pakoras ...

I think because it was Halloween on a Friday, the restaurant wasn&#39;t overly busy. I dined with my husband and we went the shared plates route with our choices.Empanadas--ordered both the meat and veggie versions. The former was cheeseburger themed and the latter was...veggie something. Both were a delicious start to our meal!La Bomba Rice--realllllly good and the chiles give it a nice kick. It&#39;s a sizable portion and at the suggestion of our server, we ordered it along with one of the larger entrees. I don&#39;t know that it would be good as just an entree on its own though as in that form it might be kind of boring.Lobster tail and chicken--loved this entree. The lobster was nice and buttery, the chicken good and crispy skinned, and the rice both came with had a great flavor too.Cheese bread--I&#39;m not sure what I was expecting, but what came out were 4 balls resembling hushpuppies. They were tasty and I would definitely recommend them. We got them along with our entrees but I actually think they&#39;d be a great as another small appetizer with the empanadas.As far as drinks, we had the caipirinha and pisco sour.

I&#39;ve been to the restaurant before and had their regular menu. Everything was delicious then but was equally matched with the group menu. They served dinner family style and I was able to choose from many options.Everything we had was wonderful: an assortment of empanadas, head-on prawns, ceviche, kale salad (a favorite of mine), pan-roasted salmon (holy s*it this fish was perfectly cooked and the skin was on point - I almost opted out of the salmon because I eat it often but am so glad I didn&#39;t; chef and his team nailed it), chili-rubbed pork loin, garlic frites, fried cauliflower and...my favorite...alfajores. I ate three, no shame.The service was impeccable. My glass was never empty and there was always food on the table. They also split the check evenly between the guests and ran 14 different cards. La Sirena was also so accommodating, inquiring whether anyone in the party had dietary restrictions and letting me know when the market fish had changed last-minute so I could change courses if I wanted. Thank you to Nicole - Director of Marketing and Private Events - she answered my many questions punctually and set the entire dinner up.I will definitely be dinning at La Sirena again!"

To be honest this is more like American food with a south American flavor, not particularly authentic. That is not to say that we did not like the food, it just was not what I expected. The best part of the meal was the empanadas. There was a vegetarian option with Mack and cheese and rapini as well as a ham.  They were smaller than I liked. But alas, we survived.The seafood dishes we had were tasty. We had an octopus appetizer as well as a seafood stew that our waitress recommended we order a side of fries with so that we could dip the fries in the broth of the mussles and seafood.Finally, they have fernet and coke on the drink menu!  That was great!!"

The potato leek polenta did not feel especially Latin American. Ceviche was excellent though, and the kale salad, wow. Empanads, always baked, were tasty. Thumbs uo on fried cauliflower.

I went to college down the street, this cafe holds lots of memories. I remember it used to be a place where we had to wait over 45 minutes to get seated, then we got excited for everything that we&#39;d ordered, finally walking up to the cashiers and tell them how great our brunch was.I went back there today, I have to say that the taste isn&#39;t there anymore, or it could be that they were busy. My omelet and potatoes were very greasy and unflavored, I hope it was just because they were busy. I ordered a side of French fries, it looked so fresh and delicious, unfortunately it tasted dry and old.Juice and waffles were still good! I was very happy at least something hasn&#39;t changed.

The waiting time can easily be 30-40 minutes on weekends. If you&#39;ve got a brunch itch that can&#39;t wait that long, there&#39;s always sweet maple cafe down the road.Skillets are the thing to go for if it&#39;s your first time here. The portions are huuuuge. I&#39;ve never left stax without a to-go box! Most dishes come with house potatoes and the option of either toast, mini pancakes or mini waffles. I always opt for the chocolate chip mini waffles. They&#39;re equal parts delicious and adorable.The food itself is well made and they&#39;re happy to customize your order. I usually swap bacon with turkey sausage. The potatoes and omelettes are really greasy and under seasoned and require a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper. I love their freshly squeezed juices, especially grapefruit and orange. So pulpy, so good!Yes, stax is a little overpriced, but they&#39;re super cool about splitting checks, and the service is outstanding.

She put my name down, estimated a 25-30 minute wait, and ended up throwing my name and potentially a few others in the trash.Never fessing up to her mistake, she blamed me. Then said I would be put at the end of the list again after already waiting 25 minutes. I ended up walking out and driving to a different restaurant which happily took my business.

After answering and receiving the wait of 30 min, we asked to be placed on the list.This is where our wait should be rewarded with the brunch of the century... but alas... I&#39;ll never know what those glorious waffles will taste against my lips because the hostess&#39; epic unprofessional boffo.So apparently 30 min means 2-5 minutes in the alternate twilight zone reality of this hostess. We walked down the block to look at a storefront only to return 5 min later. After this hostess pops her head out calling other names on multiple occasions and about 20 min later (as well as a 3 top that was sat who walked up while we were standing there &#34;because the hostess hooked them up&#34;) we approached her again to ask how much time was left. Only to be told that she had already called us.Well, okay. Womp womp... things happen... but you&#39;d think i dunno, you&#39;d apologize and tell us we&#39;re next. Or even don&#39;t need to apologize.. just maybe skip us... but no... this hostess proceeds to give us another 20 min wait.So while I&#39;d love to regale you with a happy story of awesome food and tasty beverages...

It&#39;s also a terrible choice if you&#39;re looking for a smaller/lighter breakfast. I ended up going with the veggie skillet (spinach, mushrooms, onions, green peppers, mozzarella, potatoes, swiss) with over-medium eggs and I chose mini waffles as my side. The plate was $14.The mini waffles were on the moist side of dry, but then again I have yet to find excellent waffles anywhere. The over-medium eggs were pretty runny, but acceptable. The skillet itself was drowning in oil, which was the biggest disappointment about what appeared to be a healthy choice. It was a big portion so I only ate about half - the top half since the veggies at the end were so terribly greasy. If we ever return I won&#39;t be ordering that again. And with other options hovering around $10-15 I won&#39;t hesitate to be very particular about my order (e.g &#34;no oil&#34; or building my own lighter breakfast from some of the other items around the menu).If you&#39;re okay with a sugary plate though, the crepes, waffles and pancakes looked fun and unique."

We got there around 12:30 on a Sunday and it was about a 20 minute wait, which isn&#39;t bad compared to most places. Parking was easy to find on Taylor street and better yet free since it was a Sunday. The ambiance of the restaurant wasn&#39;t anything fancy, but it was quite cozy. If you check in on yelp you get either two free mini pancakes or two free mini waffles. Most of the meals also come with two free pancakes or waffles. To mix it up I went with a side of two mini white chocolate banana pancakes (a little dry). I also went with two mini chocolate chip waffles and those were very good!For my main meal I had the Spanish omelet and it came with potatoes on the side. They don&#39;t have the siracha (sp) sauce sitting on the table, but ask for it! After putting some of that sauce over my omelet my meal was delicious and complete. Prices were reasonable and it&#39;ll definitely be on my list of places to come back to for brunch.

So, I opted to go to Stax Cafe early on Sunday morning. Fantastic!I ordered banana French toast with dulce de leche, eggs scrambled well with cream cheese, and house potatoes.The French toast made my day. The fact that they didn&#39;t require any syrup was all the better. I love the fact that they actually scrambled my eggs with cream cheese rather than sending out a plate of scrambled eggs with dollops of cream cheese. The home potatoes were also good, seasoned with onions, red peppers, and green peppers.Having gotten to the restaurant early, the service was good. Given the area, I imagine the restaurant gets crowded, so I recommend going early enough to enjoy your breakfast, brunch, or lunch without complaint. I&#39;ll definitely have to return to see what else is on the menu worthy of gobbling."

Yum, pancakes!This cute little breakfast place located near UIC offers up some delicious breakfast options in their cozy building. I love that it&#39;s so clean inside and really modern like in design. The menu is on a single sheet and easy to read. From platters, to benedicts, to omelettes, pancakes and french toast, you&#39;re sure to find a breakfast treat for you.When I hear &#34;stax&#34; I immediately think of a stack of pancakes. So naturally, I decided that I wanted pancakes. I decided to go with the Healthy Start Pancakes because of the blueberry compote. I love blueberries and was drawn into the blueberry and greek yogurt with honey combination! I was so surprised by the portion size of these pancakes. There were 3 giant pancakes filled with blueberries and on top, a dollop of greek yogurt, blueberry compote, granola all drizzled in honey. The pancakes are made out of oat so it gave an interesting texture and flavor. I really liked it though, being an oat fan that I am. The blueberries bursted in the pancakes and the greek yogurt was tart and refreshing. I could have eaten it without maple syrup, but maple syrup never hurt anyone! I barely got through half of the stack before my stomach caved in.My friend got the Starving Student platter which comes with eggs, bacons, potatoes/veggies and either mini pancakes or waffles. It was a big meal, definitely fit for a hungry student. And trust me, after finishing that plate, you&#39;ll leave as a satisfied student!My other friend decided to go with the carnivore omelette. He is a huge meat lover and said that the omelette had so much meat that it was almost too much (can you ever have too much meat?!). I could see all the different pieces of meat throughout his giant omelette. It also came with potatoes and HUGE pieces of toast. I&#39;ve never seen toast that big ever. This is a hefty portion so be prepared!The pricing is really fair for the big portion sizes. Each menu item is about $10-15 depending on what you are getting. Service here was pretty good. Our server was a little hard to understand but we made it by. She checked up on us here and there and our water was refilled promptly.Breakfast food is comfort food, and Stax embraces comfort."

My coworkers and I had lunch here this week. I, of course, have eaten here numerous times, but some of my cohorts were new to try it....I was more than happy to offer my suggestions:)First off, they serve Intelligencia coffee, so that&#39;s amazing. Also, they have a full juice bar if that&#39;s your thing. The menu is rather large with offering both breakfast and lunch options. I&#39;ve tried many items to include the chiliquiles, fried chicken sandwhich, tuna sliders, mini egg sandwiches, the turkey club, the chicken salad, I mean I could go on....Honestly these dishes are nothing short of delicious. But the absolute best is most definitely the breakfast wrap. It&#39;s my &#34;go to&#34; for sure! I highly recommend this dish for anyone who loves bomb food...and cheese! ;)The customer service is always on point. There is sometimes a wait, but that&#39;s only because this place is the real deal. It&#39;s worth the wait I promise. I have to say, one of the best diners in Chicago! See you real soon Stax!"

I believe my friend enjoyed her meal way more than I did. The skillet lacked in flavor and was slightly bland. The gluten-free pancakes were good but a tad burnt on the edges.

I had never tried Stax before, but there were a couple open tables so we were seated right away. I thought the crepes looked good, so I tried the mushroom and swiss crepe. It came with some nice leafy greens on the top and a really nice sauce. The food was high quality and came out quickly. It was a little crowded and the noise level was a little high, but nothing too crazy. I will be coming here again."

Hot compote was cold at that point. Toast was cold.The table next to me suffered the same fate. They were served their pancakes first and then had to wait quite a while for their actual dishes.Too bad the kitchen/expediter sucks at their job. Food isn&#39;t too bad.

Got seated right away on Saturday 1:30pm. I had the veggie skillet it was ok, first time here so wasn&#39;t sure what to get and many things sounded good on the menu. The skillet was a little plain, veggies with large potatoes and  egg on top but was missing some sort of spice or something. The Raspberry and white chocolate pancakes were very good but I compare all pancakes to Bango room (breakfast place also) as they have white chocolate SAUCE so you don&#39;t even use maple syrup and this would have been perfect with these pancakes. Probably won&#39;t be back anytime soon."

It was simple enough that I am hoping I can recreate it at home, that&#39;s how great it was. I also ordered the mini egg and ham sandwiches. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the rolls they served them on are really yummy. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the potatoes that come on the side, but luckily I was full from the soup so it didn&#39;t really matter.

The coffee was a bust, too mild for my taste. I don&#39;t know. The menu looked very standard. Price was ok but no value here. The add on meat is not worth it. Would I go back? Sure.

Totally mediocre breakfast - my French toast had no sugar or spices to be detected,  and the bananas on top were black - not because they were brûléed - they were just old. My boyfriends&#39; frittata had no salt and the worst crime - the coffee was gross. Burned three hours ago. Giving it two stars because service and decor were nice enough. Price is fine, but honestly paying even $10 for that French toast felt like robbery because I would have been better up picking up a bagel at a bakery for $2.But burnt coffee man - you have ONE job if you&#39;re selling breakfast - don&#39;t give people bad coffee."

We were greeted and sat immediately by a friendly host, as it was only about 8 a.m. and the brunch rush hadn&#39;t started yet. As usual when everything looks good and I get nervously indecisive, my fiance and I opted to order one sweet and one savory breakfast and share. I hemmed and hawed over whether to order the mixed berry crepes or the butter pecan waffles, but decided on the crepe, you know, to be &#34;healthy.&#34; By crepe, they meant three crepes stuffed with and topped with strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, with a raspberry and cream coulis and whipped cream. No skimping on any ingredients here!Once I thought I had decided, I pulled out my phone to check in on Yelp, and was delighted to find a check-in would get you a free order of mini-waffles, and yes, these mini-waffles COULD be butter pecan. You can have it ALL at Stax! The waffles were hot, fluffy, crisp, sweet, and had whole pecans IN and ON the waffles, lots of waffle-y goodness, with whipped cream.My fiance went with the tender beef brisket hash with potatoes and an egg, which also came with mini pancakes. Well seasoned, well cooked. SO MUCH FOOD! Add a hot chocolate with whipped cream and a coffee and we still hadn&#39;t even spent $30. Our server was also great  - Merissa, genuine smile, appeared to offer a coffee refill without being flagged down and to check in at the right times, efficient; joked about my whipped cream overdosing, definitely the person you want to deal with before 9 a.m.  We packed up at least half of our meal to go and got Sunday breakfast out of it too, supplemented with an egg or two of our own. With such great food and great service, I imagine it gets pretty busy later in the mornings, but I definitely would recommend Stax to anyone and have added this to my own list of great breakfast spots!"

The fact that I still remember the negative experience, is a strong indicator of the long-lasting impact of bad service - and fair warning to choose the other nearby breakfast options over this one.The hostess called our name and we didn&#39;t hear it. When we told her that we were overlooked and had been waiting already for twenty minutes, she barked at us and said &#34;Well, you could wait longer then!&#34; and proceeded to call two more groups of two before us.

Stax has perfected a dairy-free eggs benedict, and their potatoes on the side are cooked to perfection. Without the use of butter and any other dairy products (after I ask, of course), stax has made the best eggs benedict I&#39;ve had yet. For several weeks, I would go spinning and then come straight to stax for a filling and satisfying brunch.The menu is short; with limited options and not a lot of variety, I have not been too eager to try anything else. I always enjoyed trying my friends&#39; plates, but I&#39;ve only enjoyed the eggs.The environment is friendly, and the restaurant is slightly tight, but you can still move around. I haven&#39;t always appreciated the staff; I understand that brunch gets very busy on weekends, but I found the service almost negligent sometimes. I also found the hostess slightly rude and combative, and my newcomer friend wanted to immediately go somewhere else because of the attitude.

Stax was the next breakfast/brunch we saw.  There were lots of patrons dining in; the lights were shining and bright; servers were working hard.  Yeah, this was it!  Look no further.We were warmly greeted by one of the servers, and then the hostess guided us to the table.  The menu was pretty extensive, not to mention that the daily specials were written on one of the columns which I failed to notice after we placed our order (not a big deal). I ordered the Spanish Harlem (chorizo omelet with diced veggies on the side) with mini waffles.  Hubby, on the other hand, ordered the oatmeal pancakes with bacons.The wait wasn&#39;t long at all.  I barely had a couple sips of coffee.  I took a bite of the mini waffle.  Wow, that was the best waffle I&#39;ve had for a long time.  It was so soft, fluffy...anyways, everything was so lovely about this piece of angelic waffle.  The actual Spanish Harlem entree was well-done.  Everything tasted fresh and flavorful.  Hubby said the pancakes were delicious.  The granola on top weren&#39;t overly sweet.  The bacons were cooked right; they had a nice &#34;bark&#34; to it.  Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience.They were fairly busy on a Tuesday mid-morning, but the service was attentive.  All servers and the hostess were working together as a great team.  The total came to $32 after tax.  The prices were better than what you would have in the Chicago loop area, but it&#39;s literally one (1) bus ride away (CTA 157-Taylor/Streeterville) to get this place if you want to avoid some over-priced diners downtown."

It&#39;s all I wanted, so I ordered the starving student (which you can sub the bacon for pork sausage for no extra charge! if you want turkey sausage it&#39;s $1 extra). My bf got the beef brisket and really enjoyed it. He loved the mini waffles even more, of course.

Well, it was worth the recognition! My friend had the breakfast tacos and I had the open face bacon jam and egg sandwich. Both very good! We also got a free pancake when I checked-in using Yelp...not a bad idea! The only concern I had was that it did take some time to get our food. I WILL BE GOING AGAIN to try more things on the menu. The place was also packed which is usually a good sign."

Over all, this place was exactly a-ok for me, I had the dulce de leche french toast and the dulce de leche wasn&#39;t mixed in the french toast, it just replaces the syrup. For those uncertain of what to order, order a juice and something from their &#34;eggs and bennies&#34; portion of the menu because that&#39;s what they&#39;re well known for.

I brought my very good friend along for the tasting of this new place.I had read that there was parking lot across the street, however this is untrue. The parking lot is actually a block down from here and I have no clue if its free. I chose to do street parking.Upon entrance, it didnt seem busy, for a rainy wednesday 10am...AWESOME.Since I checked in, I was able to retrieve the free mini waffles that is available via yelp. My hostess had no clue about this, but my server Josh did. He was awesome. Extremely friendly, happy server. I always love an upbeat server. Who wants to be served by someone who shows they hate their job, not me! However, with Josh, I love his interaction with customers not only with us. He tells us about some entrees that arent on the menu n very descriptive.We both had coffee, a bit strong for me, reminded me of Starbucks (n i dnt like their americana i find it too strong) but everyone is different so def not rating their coffee becuz everyone likes it different.We order, my friend had the Spanish Harlem omlette with potato.... n shared potatoes with me....MAN THOSE ARE THE S&amp;!T AS IN THE BOMB.COM!!! My friend raved about it n was very satisfied. I had the banana pancakes with macademia nut topping. Eh, it was just a regular pancake with banana, nothing to rave about. Regret ordering this lol just because it was too ordinary. Im coming back for that Spanish harlem omlette thats how good my friend&#39;s entree was.On my way out, I literally bumped into a detective n hit his vest....HELLO OFFICER LOL...he told me to stay dry n duck under the canopy (it was raining hard when we left).Service was great and I will def come back.

At least, we see which of the two lines of Sweet Maple or Stax is shorter, but I think we&#39;ve found a comfort with Stax. I think, and my friends do too, the best part of Stax&#39;s menu is that many of their dishes come with the option of the mini-pancakes/waffles/toast with the egg/savory option AND potatoes that you don&#39;t find in a lot of brunch spots. So its a lot of food for not a lot!Their mini-waffles are to die for!! So fluffy and perfectly sweet-I eat them plain or save them for later if I can&#39;t finish.For my go-to main dish, I almost always go with the Spanish Harlem. The ingredients all just taste so fresh and the chipotle sauce they use us the perfect smoky kick. The side potatoes are always cooked well with the roasted peppers - yum!!My only complaint on food isn&#39;t that big of a deal, but their coffee just isn&#39;t my favorite. But I still drink it anyway if I need the caffeine.I am also curious to see how their fresh squeezed juices taste like as I have yet to try them, but they always look delicious, as does all their food!Service is always spot on and their servers are great people to ask for suggestions for your meal.One star docked for the coffee and the long wait you can have on weekends - but it is a brunch place, so that is almost always expected."

I added on a side of fries for $3, because next to anything cheese-based, my next frequented food group is anything potato-based. I waited about 5 minutes before my epic meal was presented to me.I took it back to my office and dove in. Now, if I had eaten lunch at my regular time, I probably would have only had half and saved the rest for later, because it was a lot of food. But I was getting hangry, so I scarfed that sucker down and enjoyed every bit of the gooey cheese and buttery toasted bread. I&#39;m not always a fan of spinach, but it was welcome between the heaping globs of cheese. The fries were some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. They were thick and somehow, crispy, which I feel you don&#39;t always get with thick fries. They were salted perfectly.It&#39;s going to be hard to resist coming here all the time. By the time I was done, I felt like a fat shallot.But a happy, satisfied shallot."

Guests raved about the sandwiches and they were very quick to get food out in a timely manner and not have a long line. The commutation throughout was always easy and painless. They came a lot earlier then expected, which I can&#39;t complain about, but guest were confused if they were open or not. It didn&#39;t help that the second food truck was LATE so it made it a little extra confusing. The guys running the truck were completely understanding of me wanting to wait to open them together and were beyond nice about the situation. HIGHLY recommended for your next event!!!"

A warning as to what kind of shape your body will resemble if you hit this truck every week, since they are on Clark on either Tuesdays or Wednesdays (check their schedule) and Wacker &amp; Adams most Thursdays.They are a treat, for sure. While it will be a slightly spendy lunch option, the food is freshly made, with quality ingredients, and generous portions. My modus operandi is the grilled cheese and the spicy sesame fries. First, I will try to pawn off, I mean, share some of the fries with my co-workers because the portion is huge and realistically should be split between 3-4 people, but I have no shame and have polished off an order by myself before, because these are some damn good fries.Next, I will happily dig into the beautifully messy, gooey composition of grilled sourdough, caramelized onions, sauteed spinach, and muenster cheese.  I am a fan of using muenster cheese in my grilled cheese sandwiches and was happy to discover these guys are too.  Usually, with the fries involved, I only manage to finish half of the sandwich.  When that happens, I save the other half for breakfast the next day (it re-heats well in the oven or toaster oven; do not microwave, DUH) and I add a fried egg. Heaven!Note, the usual preparation involved regarding popular food trucks like the Fat Shallot: get out there early or be prepared to wait. They do move pretty efficiently, though you can place your order online via their website and it should be ready for pick up, if you fear the wait.  Also, check in on Yelp and get a free beverage with your order."

My favorites are the buffalo sandwich and truffle BLT (it&#39;s a toss-up between the 2), and their spicy sesame fries. (I can smell the spicy sesame sauce while waiting in line and it seriously makes my mouth water.) Word of the wise: portions are large!

I will follow them around the whole city wherever they are to get one of their sandwiches.Tried them for the first time a month ago when all the food trucks rolled into Daley Plaza for their food truck Fridays. My coworker and I immediately headed for their truck, as I had been stalking them on twitter for some time and viewing their foodporn.It was lent so I ordered the caramelized onion, spinach and Gruyere grilled cheese. Coworker ordered the croque  monsieur. Both sandwiches came out in about five minutes, despite there being a line. The guy in the truck taking our order was super nice and struck up a conversation with us while we waited.We took our sandwiches back to the office, and eating them made us strike up a conversation of the best meals we&#39;ve had around the city. They were that good. My grilled cheese was garlicky, gooey, smokey, and the bread was oily and crispy. My coworkers looked and smelled amazing, and he said it was the best croque monsieur he&#39;s ever had. For 7-9$ a sandwich, you&#39;re looking at the price of a subway meal, but instead you&#39;re getting a huge handcrafted gourmet sandwich.Try them today if you haven&#39;t and follow them on twitter @thefatshallot to see where they are headed for the day!

They ran out of egg buns so mine was on a pretzel bun. I typically don&#39;t like pretzel buns because they&#39;re too salty but this one was made perfectly!

It&#39;s a little difficult to cut in half. The spicy dipping sauce was fantastic! I&#39;m not a fan of spicy food and this sauce is not spicy at all.When I got in line there were about 15 people ahead of me but the line moves fairly quickly. Extremely friendly and they accept debit/credit cards. They were also serving grilled cheese, buffalo chicken and turkey sandwiches which all sounded great. I&#39;ll definitely be back! Plus, if you check in you can get a free drink.*8/5/16Ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and regular fries. The sandwich consists of about 3 or 4 crispy chicken tenders doused in their truckmade buffalo sauce, topped with a crunchy celery slaw, and blue cheese. The sauce has a good buffalo wing sauce taste and is a little spicy. The crunchy celery slaw provides the perfect crunch and blue cheese sauce always complements anything doused in buffalo sauce. The fries were fine, as they were a tad undercooked and soggy."

After sampling several varieties of fantastic beers I fond myself working up quite an appetite. The menu is of course limited by the capacity of the food truck, but quality is absolutely on point.

In fact my stomach can&#39;t usually handle digesting it very well at all. But there was something so powerful about seeing The Fat Shallot truck at the market! I don&#39;t know what came over me, but I headed right over there and ordered up what I thought would be the easiest thing to digest. I ordered a Jumbo Sausage with sauerkraut on a pretzel bun with yummy mustard (ha!). There was no skimping here on the beef. It was a lot more mild in flavor than I expected, which was a perfect complement to the piled high kraut and brown spicy mustard. I really loved the pretzel bun thrown in to the mix, but it didn&#39;t hold everything together very well. Needless to say, I went through a lot of napkins - but it was sooo worth it!There&#39;s more! I was enticed to try their spicy sesame fries. Oooh wee were they a bit spicy for me, but I was amazed at how crispy the fries stayed under the spicy aioli topped with black sesame seeds. Talk about a real kick to the palate! I had to surrender them to my picky eater husband, who surprisingly gobbled them up before my eyes! I was honestly shocked. When he eats anything and likes it, you know you&#39;ve made a super tasty side of fries.The owners are really sweet and seem to take pride in what they serve.

I admit, it&#39;s a crowd pleaser, but how could it not be, stacked high with bacon and truffle aioli, atop buttery Texas toast? Here&#39;s the secret: the BLT, while delicious, is actually not the best thing on the menu. The real star of the menu, in my opinion, is the turkey.Their regular sandwich rotation is the BLT, the grilled cheese, the buffalo chicken, and the turkey. I&#39;ve tried all but the buffalo chicken (I don&#39;t like buffalo sauce, ever, no matter what restaurant/establishment makes it). While all of them have been tasty, the turkey sandwich is the standout for me because it has the best flavor combination and tastes exceptionally fresh, and it&#39;s also one of the lighter options on the menu - the others are a bit too rich/fatty for me. The grilled cheese and BLT are on the obvious side - duh, buttery bread, cheese, and bacon taste good, and they&#39;ll taste good pretty much in any combination with any other toppings. The turkey, on the other hand, combines basil aioli (officially one of my favorite ingredients now), arugula, avocado, cucumber slices, and turkey breast, all served atop a pretzel bun. The pretzel bun is actually worth singling out - I&#39;ve never given much thought to bread before, especially not sandwich bread, but their pretzel bun is amazing. I&#39;d probably eat it by itself even without the sandwich filling. I don&#39;t know what they put in the bun to give it so much flavor, but it adds a lot to the sandwich and is worth the price of admission in and of itself. The veggies are always crisp and fresh-tasting, and are the perfect complement to the richer aioli and avocado. And finally, the turkey itself is thinly-sliced and packed with flavor.Oh, and the fries are great as well (the house fries are great, truffle fries are great, but I&#39;m not as big a fan of the sesame), but I&#39;d have to be rolled out of there if I ate the entire sandwich with a side of fries. For those with small to medium appetites, it&#39;s probably too much food to get both (it&#39;s certainly too much food for me).The owners are super nice and I&#39;m very appreciative of the fact that they seem to always run on schedule and update their Twitter feed accordingly - something I cannot say for all food trucks.As you can see, I&#39;m obsessed with the Fat Shallot."

It&#39;s well worth the wait, even if you don&#39;t skip the line. A close second, and my favorite on some days is the Turkey, a refreshing and savory sandwich that is great in the warm weather. The grilled cheese is also delicious and easily customized. I have tried some other options here and there, the meatball sandwich-- OMG-- But generally just stick with the two. I have gotten truffle fries once, but I have to draw the line somewhere."

I immediately thought I should order the Truffle fries (I mean rosemary salt and truffle oil on fries! how could you go wrong)?  But my friend assured me to try the spicy sesame fries, I am not ashamed to admit it that I went back and ordered a second helping!  They are that good.I also tasted the buffalo chicken sandwich and the grilled cheese.  They are classics done right.  They deliver the flavors you want and are cooked to perfection.Please I insist of you, if you go visit Chicago find out where this food truck is parked and make a pilgrimage.  Just be prepared to wait a little in line, because this place is not a secret anymore, and Chi-town is eating it up.

Taco in a Bag won the episode and now had a location inside Spring Hill Mall. We live fairly close to the mall, so we visit them now and then. I love their food at Taco in a Bag, so I have been curious to see what they were up against.The Fat Shallot had a very different style of food. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. It was spot on with the Buffalo flavor. Not too spicy, had the nice balance of celery/coleslaw (I&#39;m not sure what it was but it doesn&#39;t matter because I liked it). It was a huge sandwich. I tried to finish it, but only got about 3/4ths of the way there. Also ordered the truffle fries. They were presented nicely with a huge amount of sauce. Which was pretty, but then all the fries on the top had an overbearing amount of sauce and the ones on bottom none at all. The flavor was pretty good though, a little tangy (but in a good way). My boyfriend ordered the grilled cheese and added bacon to it. He said it was one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches he ever had. Along with the spicy sesame fries -- I tried these and liked them better than my fries.It was about $30 for the two of us (with a drink each).The drink selection was pretty limited, but I did appreciate the selection they had.The location we were at was in the west loop off of Monroe and Sangamon. It was my first time visiting the truck, but I really locked this location. It was right by a children&#39;s park and dog park. And there is conveniently a nice little area to sit, fairly close to their parking spot. It was a great place to sit and enjoy my food.Overall, it was a good experience. There was a lot of delicious food truck food in a nice Chicago location. It was definitely worth the train ride.The only complaints I have aren&#39;t really complaints:-Too big portion--- but leads to leftovers-Pricey-- but has big portions-Didn&#39;t get to try the Polish sausage, but they said there was a limited availability on the website anywayOh and Taco in a Bag, definitely did have competition. Both restaurants present a fresh take on old classics. But Taco in a Bag is definitely the new fad."

I can&#39;t help it - no matter where I go, I have to get &#39;em. Sometimes, I&#39;ll pick a lunch/dinner spot simply based on its reputation for good fries; other times, I&#39;ll be hit with a sudden craving, and the next thing you know, I&#39;m happily/guiltily munching away. I&#39;ve eaten fries at Pommes Frites in New York, practically everywhere in Chicago (you name it, I bet I&#39;ve had it), and even (of course) in Belgium, and France, and England, and Spa- ... okay, now this is just embarrassing.As something of a fries connoisseur, then, I can with 100% authority tell you that the fries from this food truck are AMAZING. They have the perfect crunchiness &amp; consistency (not soggy, not charred or burned, not rock-solid, etc.).But the absolute BEST thing about the The Fat Shallot&#39;s fries is that they come with amazing flavors! Not only do they have truffle fries, but they also have this awesome, fusion-esque, spicy sesame fries. I&#39;ve tried both (I&#39;m coming for you next, Rosemary!) - and each comes with very, very generous portions of both fries &amp; sauce.As for the &#34;real&#34; food - I got the pulled pork sandwich, which I appreciated, but didn&#39;t like as much as some other BBQ places in the city (Q, namely). One coworker got the buffalo chicken sandwich, and similarly said it was decent, but not the best he&#39;s ever had (and he&#39;s from down south, so I believe him). However, one co-worker got the grilled cheese sandwich and said that it was out of this world. (Grilled cheese, I&#39;m coming for you too!)Based on the strength of the food explained above, I&#39;d normally give only 4 stars, but the fifth is for:a) the incredibly friendly and efficient staff,b) the enormous portions (you will feel totally self-conscious if anyone catches you hauling an entree + fries back to your desk - sometimes the lid on the takeaway box won&#39;t close!),c) how ridiculously excited my team gets when they know the truck is coming near our building,d) and the fries, of course! :)----Bottom Line: catch the Fat Shallot if you&#39;re super hungry &amp; looking for a filling meal - they have good comfort food, and the kind of fries that people dream about!(... or is that just me?)"

At first $9 seemed a bit pricey for a grilled cheese sandwich...then I ate it.I usually consider myself a grilled cheese purist.  That is a grilled cheese is cheese + bread and that&#39;s it. Once you start adding other ingredients you&#39;ve moved into pannini territory. The Fat Shallot had me reconsidering my position because this was hands down the best grilled cheese I&#39;ve ever eaten. The sandwich had Muenster, caramelized onions and sautéed spinach. I added bacon and avocado for an additional $2 (which is what made it a $9 grilled cheese.)The sandwich is loaded with tastiness and perfectly prepared. Usually when you add bacon to a sandwich, places give you two, maybe 3, slices of sad, limp looking bacon. This sandwich read chock full of delicious, crispy bacon - enough for every bite. The onions were perfectly caramelized and practically falling out of the sandwich. The cheese was gloriously gooey.

The grilled cheese is good, but they need to add a tangy or sharper cheese to the muenster. I wonder how mushrooms spinach and onions might taste? The bacon sandwich is decent, but what gives with the Texas toast? Why not challah or brioche or something much more specific tasting than thick white bread?  Pretzel bread, even? The fries are frozen...boo! Or, at least that&#39;s what they taste like or like they&#39;ve been fried twice.  They should be fresh cut. Why in the world would you serve quality ingredients then serve frozen fries? The truffle sauce is decent but it should be a dip. I know I&#39;ve been critical but it could be so much better. Finally, they have been out of things and don&#39;t vary the menu very much. They are only open three to four hours on most days. I&#39;d love to get a chance to taste some of their other fair.Very nice folks, though. Pleasant and focused, but they need a little work on the menu to really bring in more patrons. Also, the app is cray. It needs work, like to reflect the actual hours of operations."

The BLT was great, crispy bacon, the peppery arugala,  fresh tomato, and perfect bread. The grilled cheese was just wonderful. The greens cheese and bread all blend into that perfect cheesy, satisfying bite. The grilled veggie sandwich just highlights the summer bounty. Delicious.I also tried their signature fries.

Impressed by his energy and enthusiasm, all I had to do was listen as he showed me the lunch specials and the regular menu.Although everything looked good on the specials, I went with my usual tri-colored tortellini with shrimp. You really can&#39;t go wrong with a little comfort food on a cold autumn day. It was perfect. The shrimp was nicely portioned with the pasta. The pasta was just the right kind of chewy, but I wouldn&#39;t call it al dente. A nice mass of parmesan cheese was piled in the center of my to-go dish. Complete with slice of bread on the side.While I waited, I took a moment to scan the space. Local art covered the walls, and it looked like it was all for sale. The seating is either found around the perimeter as large booths, or there is ample bar seating. Everything is decorated in dark brown and merlot. Perfect for the low-lit atmosphere and a couple of drinks.To people who pick up their food. Be careful how you carry it out. Most of the cheese sauce had spilled inside of my bag by the time I got back to work. I didn&#39;t notice the plate had managed to turn on its side as I carried it. If I had known that, I would have held the dish through the plastic instead of the handles on the plastic bag. The portions aren&#39;t too big so you don&#39;t feel too pasta bloated after your meal. Very tasty, and the next time I crave Italian, I&#39;m coming here."

The portions were a great size! I did have to wait to be seated for a little bit but that was fine. The ambiance was nice. It was very welcoming. At times the noise level would get really low, I personally found that annoying but that could happen anywhere."

They offered a check-in deal, which consisted of a free cheesy bread. Free food is always good. I noticed that the cheesy bread is normally $5, which I definitely would not pay for. The bread was lightly toasted with melted cheese on top and served with generic marinara sauce.I ordered the portobello sandwich because I was sad that the portobello mushrooms in my fridge went moldy earlier that day. The bread was over toasted for my taste. The cheese was good though. I had originally ordered white beans as my side but instead I got pasta salad. I don&#39;t remember whether that was good or not.The servers were super nice and attentive, which is always a plus!"

Once I start eating the bowl of pasta I don&#39;t stop and usually leave there with noodle and sauce belly.I always leave there feeling more than satisfied with my meal and the cost.We love you pasta bowl!!!

Both were excellent choices. There are a few items that they offer but not this location which is a bummer but it was still a great experience. I loved how quiet and personal our date was.

Last night I ordered the linguine with clams for the delivery. The food came quickly - way before estimated. But I was so underwhelmed. My best guess is that the clams were canned (not fresh) which just ruined the entire meal. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll give this place another shot. Very disappointing.

I was skeptical of finding anything that was good and able to deliver at 9pm. We saw The Pasta Bowl open and decided to peer at their menu. The menu showed a plethora of appealing pasta options when compared to other restaurants. We decided to give them a chance, and ordered delivery. The food was delivered about 20 minutes earlier than the expected time, which was a pleasant surprise. The delivery person was nice, and the food was still piping hot.When we opened the containers up, my partner and I were shocked to see exactly how much food we got for the price we paid. The tin containers were packed with ooey gooey, cheesy pasta. It looked very tantalizing.I had ordered the Capellini Pomodoro. When the menu says that it contains mozzarella, it really means it. There were big chunks of it along with chunks of tomato. The taste was delicious for a relatively cheap delivery pasta. The basil was pronounced giving it a great fresh taste. The noodles were cooked well, and the cheese...well, let&#39;s just say I enjoyed how much there was.My partner had the Macaroni al Formaggio. This dish was almost as good, but the trouble it ran into was that it was a tad dry. That might have been from them baking it in order to toast the bread crumbs on top. The flavor was good, however. It was very rich and creamy. I doubt I would have been able to eat the whole portion of that by myself because of just how rich it was.I will definitely be ordering from here again the next time I get a hankering for some pasta."

Had a $15 balance that clearly says &#34;Certificate never expires&#34;. Only term is that you must spend $22.50, which we did. Upon receiving our check, we informed waitress that we had the certificate, and she came back and said &#34;the owner says we don&#39;t honor these anymore&#34;. I ask to speak to the owner. Taylor comes out and awkwardly tells us that &#34;we haven&#39;t accepted these in 5 years (date the certificate was issued was not 5 years old so this was a lie). Then he proceeds to tell us that there are predator sites and he can&#39;t honor.  I told him that I have used these in the past at Lux Bar, Hugo&#39;s, Boundary, Division Ale house, and he wouldn&#39;t budge.  I asked him &#34;how are we supposed to know you don&#39;t take these anymore, when the certificate says it never expires and we met all the conditions on the certificate&#34;? He couldn&#39;t provide a good answer.So to prove his wrong, I called the 800 # and typed in the certificate number on the phone to redeem, and sure enough, it says &#34;Your certificate has been successfully redeemed&#34;. So I call over Taylor again, and told him that the certificate does in fact work and is valid, and he says &#34;What did you pay for it, like $5?. I told him, I have no idea, and he offers me $5 off my tab. So for $10, he now has a negative review (i never write reviews). And of course, I got a survey fromRestaurant.comasking how my experience was, too.  At the end of the day, his short-sightedness over $15 in value (cost of a pasta dish that probably costs him $3 to make) really is perplexing to us.  Didn&#39;t want to penalize the waitress who was very pleasant (although gave us the wrong dish - we ordered gnocchi and not the special) so they had to re-make our order. We didn&#39;t make a big deal about that, but certainly a big &#34;customer service miss&#34; on this one."

I got the pesto pasta and it was okay but I tried my partner&#39;s dish and it was so much better! We can&#39;t remember what it was called but it was just an angle hair with red sauce. Very large servings of pasta but only came with a small amount of bread. A little expensive for pasta ranging from 10-13 per dish. Fine enough for the night.

I came here with a few friends for dinner and ordered the tortellini with grilled chicken, which was yummy and very filling. The restaurant has a warm, classy ambience; the artwork on the wall is actually for sale, which is pretty cool.However, one of my friends ordered the potato gnocchi with rosemary, and the sauce was salty to the point that it was basically inedible. She finished half her plate (and about two glasses of water) before giving up. Also, while the service is friendly, I felt that it was a little slow considering that we were the only people in the restaurant.Overall, the food is good, but not consistent.

Though there can be a bit of a wait. The staff&#39;s hospitality ties this place together handsomely.I was visiting the area, craving pasta. I was on a time crunch so I didn&#39;t have time to sit down for a fancy gourmet place. I walked by the Pasta Bowl and it looked small, causal and the food smelled delicious.I sat down, and just behind me there was a party of maybe 20+ people. Whoops- like I said I was on a time crunch. I was committed. I placed my order quickly and the staff brought me my drink.Because of the big party, I did have a bit of a wait. The staff was very apologetic and tended to me as much as they could. No big deal. With friendly staff like that, the hunger didn&#39;t bother me much. Food finally came out (gnocchi) and it was well worth the wait. Cheesy, but not overpowering, with sweet Mariana sauce hit the spot.On my way out, the owner offered again an apology and asked if I wanted a dessert on the house. Very gracious. He even gave me a free meal next time on him.   I graciously refused as I was stuffed from the meal.Pasta Bowl, you&#39;re doing it right.

I love that this place was BYOB, I was able to make my dining experience even better with my favorite wine.I am vegetarian and absolutely loved that you can create your own dish, substituting pasta sauces for whatever you want.Did I mention the prices are great too?One of my favorite dining places. Will def come back to dine here"

I&#39;ve only gotten the lunch specials until last night and ordered a favorite of mine, the cappellini pomodoro. It reminds me of the cappellini I used to get as a kid at this place called Pasta Fair which was located in Orange, CT. I haven&#39;t tasted any pasta remotely like that since I lived on the east coast so it definitely lives up to the &#34;Italian comfort food&#34; claim.My boyfriend had the conchiglie special and that was quite tasty too. The zucchini in the grilled vegetables side was the best.Wait staff is always super friendly -- especially the guy I used to see around lunch time. Maybe I always came in way too early, but I&#39;ve been concerned about the seeming lack of customers in there almost every time I&#39;ve been there.I want this place to stay!"

The farfalle pollo is amazing and you can taste the freshness in the food. Lunch special is a good size portion got just $6.99 with a free drink. Clean place. Clean restrooms nice atmosphere.

I called after 1.5 hours of waiting and all they said was that they just missed the online order and didn&#39;t even care. Un-F&#39;N&#39;-believable! We told them that we have kids who have a bedtime and they didn&#39;t care. They casually asked if we still wanted the order. They said it would take an hour to get us the new order ergo 2.5 hours of total waiting! Wow Wow Wow! NEVER AGAIN!

The price was also unbeatable!! Food was delicious, piping hot, and our guests LOVED it. I think this could easily be a place that people would overlook for wedding catering, but I&#39;m telling you, our guests didn&#39;t have a clue they weren&#39;t eating food from a high-end caterer.

I decided not to get the same dish again and sub out to Tiramisu (still slightly frozen) and coffee... Service was very slow and water was not replenished during my visit. Nothing impressive for my first visit.

We had a great waiter, who was very attentive, but it was almost too much. We would barely set our forks down, only to be asked &#34;are you finished?&#34; We like to linger and eat slowly so that was kind of annoying.The food was ok. Being Italian, I admit that I can be very picky about it. I&#39;m always on the lookout for good Italian food. The pasta was cooked perfectly. The amount of options was awesome - really, everyone can find something. But the garlic! Why do people insist on adding so much garlic that it overpowers the beauty of a sauce? In all my life, growing up with an Italian grandmother and mother, I never saw them use garlic. So back off the garlic and I think the food would be ok.I didn&#39;t mind the BYOB but excited to hear that they might get their license to serve. Would be nice to have a glass of wine with dinner w/o forethought.Overall, would I go back? Probably not, which is a bummer since it&#39;s so close to our house. But I&#39;ve had better pasta in our area so tough choice for us."

Recently went here for Mother&#39;s Day with my family and we did not have a pleasant experience. We chose here because the first time my boyfriend and I came here, it was amazing with excellent service. This time? Not at all. When I called in, I was already answered by a person with a rude attitude (already should have been a red flag to not go) but I risked it anyways. So we show up and a lady comes up to us and seats us down at a tiny table where my mom was literally sitting on the edge of the table. Then a girl named Angela who was so rude and dull attitude asks us what&#39;d we like to drink, to which my boyfriend asked if it was free refills and she then said uh yeah in such a rude tone. She didn&#39;t give us the lunch special card although it was only 3:30pm and when I asked her for it, she was SO hesitant in giving us it (probably to charge us full price) and said she needs to check what time it is and then went to grab the lunch special card in which she seemed so annoyed doing. She then hands out our plates for the appetizers to which had crumbs on it. You would&#39;ve expect that with no business, they could have at least spent some time washing the dishes. Lol, nope. We then placed an order of 2 dishes of calamari, 4 farfelle pollo and 1 capellini pomodoro. We get the 2 orders of calamari (of which Angela couldn&#39;t balance so she dropped a piece to which she proceeded to laugh about...?) and we&#39;re all appalled on how LITTLE calamari there was on the plate. The two sauces took up half the plate. We then ask for more tissues and she again has a rude attitude and when we said thanks (even when we were served our sodas and food) she never not once said you&#39;re welcome and just walked away. The first time my boyfriend and I came here, we got a FULL plate of calamari and now we barely got 10 pieces on the damn plate!!!!! Probably saw because we placed 2 orders so they decided to split one order between 2 plates lol. We then get our food after a while of waiting and the farfelle was under seasoned... Lol... Food was 3/10 and the service is definitely 0/10. I&#39;m guessing they changed the chefs and the servers because the first time was definitely 10/10. Maybe they need to change their server once again because Angela gave the worst service ever. You don&#39;t give your customers a rude attitude based on whatever&#39;s going on in your life. In that case, stay home. Never coming back to this location again."

My experience with sitting in has always been great. The waiters are friendly and knowledgeable about the food. I&#39;m re-thinking going back mainly because of my experience with the take out service. They always seem to forget something important with the entree. The first time I didn&#39;t get marinara sauce with the garlic cheese bread. I figured it was an honest mistake and went back a few weeks later. I ordered a chicken &amp; pasta entree... only to come home and find out that the chicken was missing. So I paid about $20 for cheesy carbs? Not a happy customer."

Because we were right by the kitchen we could see several of the same dish being taken to other tables.  We eventually called for manager who came and apologized. but we couldn&#39;t help think our waiter wasn&#39;t assertive enough to get the NEXT order, not wait until all previous orders had been taken care of.  They did comp the dinner and a second glass of wine.

We were both very pleasantly surprised.My wife had the spinach cranberry gorgonzola salad with a side of meatballs and I had the caprese salad and spaghetti with meatballs. We brought our own bottle of wine.Every item was terrific and the service could not have been better. The check was $30.00. Unbelievable!"

We used to go to the original Pasta Bowl on Clark Street and we&#39;re thrilled when opened another location in Bucktown. Food is as good as always. Large portions of delicious al dente pasta and the sandwiches are amazing as well. Their lunch specials are a complete bargain and cover most of their most popular dishes. We eat here at least once a week and the service is always wonderful. Would be great if they start serving the pizza they have at the other location as well because I think it will definitely give some pizza places in Bucktown a run for their money.

Taylor, the owner is HORRIBLE! Met the owner when he was remodeling the place and bought a bunch of bar stuff. He was nice at first and we told him that we commuted from the West Loop to this location at least 3 times a week. This and the other side bar. Their delivery zone stops as far south as Chicago Ave. I live by Grand/Halsted/Milwaukee. Literally 3 blocks from Chicago. He did my roommate and I a favor and &#34;approved&#34; delivery to our home as we were such loyal customers. So we started to order and everything was GREAT!!! Anyhow, we get a call after the 3rd delivery from the owner himself stating that he cannot deliver to our location anymore -- its too time consuming. We argued back and he accommodated us with 2 $25 gift cards to the Pasta Bowl. We haven&#39;t been back since. He wrote us over email stating that he was in the process of opening a new location in Wicker Park that would be closer and we received the email yesterday the Wicker park location was open! So we placed an order and everything was fine. We called back to inform them that we would be using the gift card and the same owner answered and said that he would accommodate us this one time, however, we were not able to get delivery (despite being only 2.5 miles out)...fine, we&#39;ll take our business elsewhere Taylor. The new location skimped on the food -- maybe because he knew it was us....I&#39;ll never know. Do yourself a favor Taylor -- be a man of your word!"

I like the more casual/laid back concept Small Cheval offers. The burger was really good and had the same type of flavor. I think the bun was a little more crisp but it wasn&#39;t a bad thing. I didn&#39;t get the bacon but I hear it&#39;s not the same as Au Cheval&#39;s. My burger fix was more than satisfied so I would recommend coming here when you have an Au Cheval craving as it will hold you down.

If I am trying a burger for the first time, I get it just the way they make it. I don&#39;t enjoy slathering a burger in so much ketchup or sauce, that you can&#39;t taste the beef.This burger needs nothing on it. It has a luscious flavor. The meat is so flavorful. Their menu is simple, burgers, two kinds. Hamburger and cheeseburger and fries. They have achieved perfection. I think the bun is potato bread, with a golden crust. Dijonaise, pickles, and onions come standard on the burger. The cheese was melted perfect, and the fries were crisp yet soft enough.The atmosphere of the place is awesome. One large room, with the kitchen open to the dining area. Tin ceiling, and liquor around the wall. They have outside seating, which is cute and allows you to watch the world go by.They have a limited drink menu, with some liquor options. With the burger as perfect as it was, I regret not buying a cocktail here.Try this place. If you love burgers, this is where you go."

I haven&#39;t tried au cheval yet but hope it&#39;s infinitely better than this &#34;fast food&#34; version of itself. The only redeeming factor is the garlic aioli which helped add some flavor/juice to an otherwise plain and dry burger. I ordered the hamburger house style ($8.95), which doesn&#39;t include lettuce or tomatoes fyi. The fries ($2.95) are decent and serve their duty as an appropriate vessel to carry obscene amounts of garlic aioli into my mouth.I do really like their outdoor patio though which has strings of lights draped across.

Place was 1/3 full dine in with maybe five or so ppl waiting to get their food to go.Step up to the register and order Cheeseburger w Fries w all toppings offered. Also grabbed a Half Acre Beer//not.daisycutter, was given the buzzer and sat down at the larger communal table in the middle.  In about 7 minutes buzzer goes off, grab and go. Burger, Fries and Beer - $21 and change.15 minutes later at home, open up and happy to see that this burger traveled quite well and it probably even set up better wrapped in its foil packaging giving it time to rest and allow all the toppings to sort of get happy together. Fries were also still hot and crispy.You know the rest, two seared patties cooked to a perfect medium in true diner style fashion.  The bun is perfect in size, taste, and look for all that is going on with this masterpiece.  They strike the perfect balance with all the ingredients - cheese, dijonnaise, pickle and onion (no bacon necessary imo) - still allowing the excellent beef flavor to shine through.[X] Will be back -"

The cheeseburger was superb, with oozing cheese and pickles between two juicy patties. The. Fries. Were. So. Good. They came out fresh and had the perfect amount of crispiness to them! Delicious plain, dipped in ketchup, and oh dipped in the garlic aioli... phenom. Which can also be found at the condiment station so you can enjoy yourself garlic aioli for days.I thoroughly enjoyed the cheeseburger and fries.

That is it. But oh that is where it begins.The burgers are juicy, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The bun is deliciously soft but holds up under the two patties and cheese that is oozing over the edges. The bacon is a perfect addition! However, skip the house mayo.Fries are perfectly crisp and fresh with each having slightly different textures. The flavoring is not pronounced so don&#39;t expect a heavy salt or upscale flavoring. Just good ol fashion, perfectly done fries.Drinks are out of can (grab from cooler), from the tap, or from the milk shake shaker. Seating inside or outside.The price is heavy but I&#39;ll pay for it with these burgers! They are a five star place if the cost was a bit lower. 4 because of cost.Tips1. Garlic aioli is wonderful on fries2. It is two patties3. Save the dessert and head around the corner to Margie&#39;s Candies4. Cheese is great - do it!5. Bacon is wonderful!6.

This is a completely different price point at about $10 for a burger. The buns are perfectly bouncy with some give, meat patty is juicy and perfect (a single order is two patties), and all the fix-ins just work. Should you want to splurge, go get a bacon add-on. A cheeseburger is just enough for me (and my gf!) Definitely go for some Sir Kensington ketchup / mustard and garlic aioli! Fries give off just the right amount of texture of crunchy exterior and bouncy starchy goodness.Yes it&#39;s different than the Au Cheval burger, but this place was designed as a local, casual hamburger bar rather than a full blown restaurant. Wait times are very short if any and are pretty consistent here and they make one of the best burgers (if only under their parent restaurant) in Chicago.

Also $4-6 pints of beer. Really respectable prices!But the dealmaker so to speak? Serve your own condiments!

The fries (cooked in animal lard) were still amazing but the burger wasn&#39;t quite at the same level.Overall, it&#39;s still a great burger for $10.

Service was great and fast, and the food was delicious -- everything I was hoping for. I ordered a cheeseburger, fries, and a chocolate shake with Bailey&#39;s, and it was American food perfection. The double patty burger was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of cheese, the fries were a great blend of crispy outside and mushy inside, and the shake tied it all together with its boozy, chocolatey creaminess on a hot night.Yeah, it&#39;s pretty expensive. My husband paid the bill, so I&#39;m not sure, but I think it was in the neighborhood of $65 for my meal, plus his hamburger with bacon, shot of Fernet, and chocolate shake, but I think it was worth every penny."

I&#39;ve now been to Au Cheval 4 times and Small twice and really don&#39;t understand what the Au Cheval fuss is about. Now that I&#39;ve had both burgers within a week of each other, I can confidently say the Small burger is superior to the Au burger. Something about the patties, the flavor, and the buns. Both times I&#39;ve been to Small Cheval I&#39;ve been in burger heaven, and all times I&#39;ve been to Au Cheval, I&#39;ve left pretty underwhelmed.

Now obviously I came here already knowing the extent or lack thereof of options but I think I had this exclusive location and their ten dollar burger on a pedestal before ever having it. Maybe I daydreamed that it would have 24k gold flakes or at the least have more fresh onion on it than the little handful of chops. I really feel it missed the crunch and texture of raw onion rings. I also just don&#39;t have mad love for burgers that don&#39;t come standard with lettuce, tomato, and onions. It seems like people sweat the aioli but the gourmet ketchup was better. I had a chocolate shake and it was on point.Two burgers, one order of fries, one shake... thirty dollars. I&#39;ve had single burgers that tasted like they should be thirty dollars but Cheval didn&#39;t add up for me. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it was an alright burger.

There&#39;s pretty much only 1 food item on the menu: BURGER. And you can add fries or a milkshake if you want. Prices are basically $1 or so less than that of Au Cheval. But there&#39;s not much of a wait because it&#39;s a order at the counter and find a seat yourself type of place. Seating is quite interesting... there are seats around the edges of the small restaurant, and then a huge table in the middle. It can get busy, but I came with 2 friends on a Friday night and only had to wait 10 min for seats.The burgers of course taste great! I mean, if that&#39;s the only thing they make, it better taste amazing. The meat was juicy and chewy. The fries were real potatoes but way too salty. And the smoothie was pretty good - I got the vanilla one. It&#39;s pretty smooth and creamy. My friend did mention that the chocolate one doesn&#39;t really taste too strongly of chocolate though.

The whole thing is a little more orderly, a little more assembly-lined, and has just a hint of fast-food about it.  It&#39;s still an extremely good burger, the pickles and sauce and bun are still very nicely done, but you are a little more likely to think about it competing with Shake Shack.One other difference from Au Cheval is that you can&#39;t get an egg on your burger here.  I&#39;m not sure they should keep &#34;Cheval&#34; in the name if they&#39;re not going to go around sticking eggs on things, but I guess frying eggs to order would destroy their ability to turn these things out at high speed.Bottom line: It&#39;s not going to replace Au Cheval in my life -- but I&#39;m still glad it exists."

There is definitely a difference between burgers like this (with small, thin patties) and big burger patties like Kuma&#39;s Corner. In terms of thin burger patties, this burger was amazing. It&#39;s the perfect blend of salt and seasonings. Five stars for the burger.The fries were OK - could be better. Nice to have fries with the burger, but not necessary and I would pass on the fries if you were on a budget. The shake was good too - but not any better than say Portillo&#39;s or any other fast food shake.Atmosphere was cool. Small little one room restaurant with a big table with open seating and then seats lining the walls. Didn&#39;t have trouble finding seating at 8 PM on a Friday night (though it was raining). There is a nice outdoor patio too. Parking in the area was fine (given the rain though).Price overall is expensive - $50 for two burgers, one fry, one shake, two cans of pop, and a beer.

Time for a lunch break. It was cold and windy, almost too cold for the walk I made to Small Cheval, but nothing prepared me for the shift between atmospheres once I walked in the door. Holiday season was full throttle, drinks were being had, and connections were being made. It was the older clientele that threw me off. No one in here seemed unattractive to me, but then again, Parallel Lines by Junior Boys was pumping through their sound system. A song I hadn&#39;t heard since my apartment was robbed, and all my music was taken away. Even the staff seemed sexual.As the track switched to Feel it All Around, by Washed Out, I knew I was right. This place not only cranks out excellent cheeseburgers, they are sexual cheeseburgers. I&#39;m not gonna lie, I was a little intimidated about not knowing what I was getting myself into. I stepped up to the counter and the man at the register already had that look on his face that said, &#34;We only like customers who know what they want.&#34; I didn&#39;t know what I wanted. I had never been here before, and I tried to put on my best face that said, &#34;Be patient with me. It&#39;s my first time.&#34; It felt like they were about to rob me of the last piece of innocence I had. Once I had that burger in my mouth, I enjoyed every minute of it.They made me wait. While I waited, I felt my anticipation grow. Or was it my anxiety picking up being surrounded in such a small space by sexual holiday foodies? I couldn&#39;t tell. My emotions were all over the place. I finally found my second wind of confidence and began to look around the restaurant. Along with the Richard Geres (circa early &#39;90s) in puffy Columbia Jackets (ribbed for your pleasure), I began to relax as I noticed maybe 2 other normal people, being painfully normal. A young couple, oblivious to their surroundings, trapped in their bubble of heteronormative lifestyle. They stood out like a sore thumb. I began to wonder if this entire experience was all in my head like a David Lynch film.There was a host, more like a Maitre d, who managed to make eye contact with me. I had forgotten about the vibrator in my had, which would signal that my order was up. He assured me everything would be fine. The wait would not be much longer, and my food would be everything I needed it to be. I&#39;m glad I ordered my food to go. As soon as i got my burger, I ran. More like a brisk walk. I knew that burger needed a minute to cool down to a temperature that would allow me to swallow without burning my throat. I was breathing heavy, and for the first time, I exhaled as I charged through the doors of my work and into the break room. For a moment, I was alone, and I undressed, I mean unwrapped, that burger slowly.Then I showed that burger who&#39;s boss, sinking my teeth in like Lorena Bobbitt. Alas, I was in love, and she was beautiful. Pink on the inside. Moist. Medium, just like the man at the register told me it would be. My entire daydream faded as quickly as the onset. &#34;WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?&#34; It felt so confrontational. I was guilty. I stumbled over my words. It didn&#39;t take long to pull my coworker into my world. She didn&#39;t need to touch or taste in order to tell I was having a love affair with a burger. She only needed her sense of smell and the visual of the melting cheese and immediately knew what was going on. Finally, she left me alone so I could finish."

It&#39;s on my list but that wait time is cray. Anyways, stopped here after 606 trail walk and the ambiance is great for the summer. The patio is pretty awesome. The burger is simple and smaller than what you usually find at bar/grills in terms of patty size which is PERFECT for me. I hate fat patties. Why even have a burger. Just eat the slab of meat since you can&#39;t taste anything else anyways. I digress.These are basic ingredient burgers but everything tastes very good together. The cheese is gooey, the pickle is refreshing, the dijonaisse is unique. I really enjoyed their fries and the ketchup and garlic aioli they have. I don&#39;t give it 5 stars because I personally love creative burgers with different combinations of ingredients but overall I did really enjoy the meal and the service."

Couple of things dropped ratings..1) Rats. We definitely saw at least one rat. It was running around behind the potted plants within the patio area. It destroyed any appetite we previously had. This brings my review to 3.5-stars.2) Attitude. When I got up to the counter to order a drink, I ordered a straight vodka, which they don&#39;t carry (?). So I asked how big the house drinks were. The guy explained it was &#34;a 5 oz pour.&#34; Cool man.. I don&#39;t really know how much that is (I don&#39;t think the average person has a really good sense of how much that is..). So I ask how much that fills in the cup - he got flustered and shrugged - which did not help me answer the question. To be fair, he didn&#39;t raise his voice or anything, but I was out with a friend and it was embarrassing for me to ask to begin with. So it only drops the review by half-star. This brings my review to 3-stars.So bottom-line, last night I had a 3-star experience. Would&#39;ve probably been 5-stars on a different night.

Also: are they glazed with butter? I don&#39;t know if I want to know the answer to this question, but also: YUM- get it &#39;house style&#39; with pickles et al. Trust. Just do it.There are three options: hamburger, cheeseburger, bacon cheeseburger. Not to get all Goldilocks-y but I think the hamburger benefits from the cheese, the bacon is gilding the lily too much and so: the cheeseburger reigns supreme here.The fries are an afterthought in this review (DEM BURGS THO) but really aren&#39;t second fiddle at Small Cheval: they are deliciously crisp, perfectly seasoned, skin-on taters. You should go for &#39;em.Bonus points: unlimited access to garlic aioli.

Burger meat is just like Au Cheval&#39;s. Comes with Dijonnaise, pickles, and onions. You have to pay extra for bacon. Lettuce and tomato are complimentary if you choose to add it on. Very simple menu. Fries are ON POINT. Perfection. Thick, but not too thick. Every surface area of each fry was crispy. Love that they let you get condiments, including garlic aioli, yourself. It&#39;s an order, get a buzzer, and pick up your order kinda place. It is a little pricier than other &#34;casual&#34; burger joints, but you do get an amazing burger.

And just a word of advice: please if you wake up early enough, get there before 12:30 pm, because this small place fills up pretty rapidly. We had new patrons hovering and hawking our corner spot like a predatory bird waiting for mice, prior to leaving. Yikes!I got the cheeseburger, and my S.O. got the cheeseburger + bacon, tomato, and lettuce for $2 extra. We shared an order of Golden Fries and had two hair o&#39; the dog as well. The cheeseburger at its base had two perfectly griddled beef patties cooked to Medium (my favorite cook for burgers/arguably the best! Thanks, Small Cheval!), a quick smear of dijoinaise, a smattering of minced red onions, a handful of tangy pickles, and melty, gooey American cheese. As for the double-fried Golden Fries, they were so mouth-shattering good. Like as soon as you bite into it, a nice crispy crunch would yield. A pitch-perfect amount of salt on it, too. Reminded me so much of Hot Doug&#39;s duck fat fries. R.I.P. Hot Doug&#39;s  :-(My only -- and I mean only complaint -- is that their use of the all-natural Sir Kensington&#39;s ketchup for their fries was just a touch too grainy and reminded me of flavored tomato paste. Sorry, y&#39;all !!! But I am firmly a Heinz ketchup type of gal.Revision: There was a Heinz ketchup dispenser! It was just less vivid and appealing than the bright red Sir Kensingon&#39;s ketchup dispenser. Ooops! My bad! :/"

Don&#39;t get me wrong, a solid burger option for sure, but nothing out of the ordinary.What I like:- If you just want a less sophisticated version of the Au Cheval special, you can get that burger with a lot less fuss! (Maybe minus some of the fancier ingredients like the egg, but I can&#39;t remember)- I also like the casual, communal vibe of Small Cheval- It&#39;s in Wicker Park, so duh, I like thatOn the other hand:- If you want anything other than beer, burger and fries, you&#39;re pretty much out of luckOverall, I think Au Cheval is okay and likewise, Small Cheval is too. If you&#39;re in the area and looking for a good, classic burger in a laid back atmosphere, this is your place!"

Don&#39;t ever change.Love Always,LauraI LOVE small cheval, would it be fair to say one of the highlights of moving to Bucktown was this fine establishment. I&#39;ve never had Au Cheval, but those who have, have said they&#39;re almost the same (about 90%) there, I like those odds. The burger is juicy and delicious, and the French fries!? I also love the selection of dipping sauces, because what would a great burger place be without a million and 1 dipping sauces.Warning: it&#39;s small and has communal seating, so it&#39;s best to go during &#34;off times.&#34; Also typically tough for a big group, but nevertheless worth your while."

The burger is so juicy and the bun can stand up to it. The bacon is thinner than the original and provides more of a crunch and texture to the burger. The fries are also good and easily shareable. They were crispy but yet soft inside and you got to taste the potato. Of course, they have the famous garli aioli for dipping. If you want to experiment, there are also other sauces available too.Small Cheval is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat without the notorious 2 hour waits Au Cheval is now has.  So far, the most I&#39;ve had to wait is about 10 minutes and got a seat by the time food was ready.  It is also a completely different experience with communal tables and has more of an &#34;in and out&#34; than &#34;stay and hang out&#34; vibe.  I definitely can&#39;t wait until it is nice enough to check out the patio. The staff are helpful and friendly.Make no mistake: this is not the original Au Cheval burger and if you are looking for that, you might be disappointed.  However, there are similarities and overall, it is still a very, very good burger.  In fact, my husband prefers the small cheval burger. While the original still reigns #1 in my book, small cheval is at the top of a short list. Plus, I can get small cheval without the wait and hassle which is very good considering now I really want another."

But if you can appreciate a solid burger and fries with a shot of whiskey on the side, then come on down. After reading about Small Cheval taking over Roxie&#39;s old spot, I definitely wanted to see how it stacked up with the real deal. It seemed like a good enough idea, giving burger lovers a chance to get a piece of the Au Cheval menu without having to endure that absurd wait.We got there around 7 on a Friday night and there was a line out the door. It looked intimidating at first, but the wait wasn&#39;t actually too terrible. We were inside within 10 minutes, then another 10 minutes in the line inside before we ordered. We probably waited a half hour between when we got there and when our food was ready.Ambiance:The inside is pretty much identical to Roxie&#39;s. It was small and had a real casual atmosphere. It&#39;s the same drill too: order at the counter and just wait for your order to be called. There were a couple tables inside and a pretty large patio outside with plenty of seating, which is a huge plus over the cramped inside of Au Cheval. You could actually come with a group larger than 4 for once.Food:The menu is pretty simple. Hamburger or cheeseburger with the option to add bacon, then the only side is fries. Like Au Cheval the burgers automatically come with two patties. It&#39;s impossible to not compare the burger to Au Cheval&#39;s, so I&#39;d have to describe Small&#39;s burger as a slightly toned down, faster food version of Au Cheval&#39;s. I thought the actual burger patties were pretty much the same. Just as juicy, and just as delicious. The bun was also really similar, with a really nice toasted outer layer but still a soft pillowy center.The major differences come with the add-ons. The most obvious is the bacon. The bacon on Small Cheval&#39;s burger is definitely thinner and just slightly better than what you would find on any other fast food burger. It was still tasty and flavorful (I mean how could bacon NOT taste great??) but it was just missing that awesome sweet and peppery glaze on the outside and that thickness that made it a major component of the burger rather than just a topping. The second major difference is there&#39;s no option to add an egg. I&#39;d throw eggs on everything if I could, so this was kind of disappointing. I wanted that golden stream of egg yolk running down the sides to make every bite that much heartier.The fries that came with the burger were great. They were definitely thinner, but they were super crispy and salted well. I&#39;d say the biggest upgrade at Small Cheval over Au Cheval is the self-serve sauce station. Giving me the freedom to take as much garlic ailoi I want is a very dangerous thing. I ate disgusting amounts of aioli that night. The garlic flavor was very potent and overall it was just amazingly rich and creamy. I slathered it all over the buns, I dumped some between the meat patties, and of course every bite of a fry was naked without a trip to the aioli cup.Overall, I enjoyed the burger at Small Cheval. It doesn&#39;t match the greatness of the almighty Au Cheval burger, but it&#39;s pretty tasty in its own right. A cheeseburger with bacon and fries would run you about $15, which is a little on the steep end, but still only a little more than something like Five Guys, and it tastes much better. It&#39;s not a bad option to get a quick bite. Now if they only added the bologna sandwich to the menu, then I&#39;d be here everyday."

First bite was an absolute rush of flavor that overwhelmed the senses.Fresh cut golden fries are pretty good and serve as a nice delivery vehicle for garlic aioli, mayo and gourmet or regular ketchup.Austere decor is a bit divey but cozy. Their website shows several sit down tables but when we went there was one community table in the middle of the room with bar style seating around the perimeter."

Due to its close proximity to the &#34;Blue Line&#34; hopefully the music is at least as loud outside as it is inside.The vanilla shake was good.  I&#39;ll try the cheeseburger again when I&#39;m in the area and I&#39;m craving a burger but, this is not a destination site. The flavor and size of the cheeseburger with bacon don&#39;t live up to its price. At twelve dollars, I shouldn&#39;t have to open my cheeseburger to make sure they didn&#39;t forget the bacon. No lettuce and tomato in this cheeseburger. Not an option on the menu either. Maybe it was on a secret menu. Anyway, a nice juicy slice of tomato would have improved this cheeseburger as it was a bit dry and tolerably salty. Next time I&#39;ll add some of that garlic aioli and see if it tastes better. Hopefully it won&#39;t make it saltier. That would suck.The music inside was good. Maybe if I ate inside instead of having it to go I would feel better about the value. Nah, I&#39;m there for the food.  If the burger sucks who cares if the music is any good. A good example of this is Burger Belly (previously Lead Belly).For those of you that rated this burger five stars and said it was the best burger you&#39;ve ever had, please get out and try more burger places. I&#39;m not cutting you guys down but, if you love these, there are burgers out there that blow these away. Burger Belly is not one of them. Now get out there and continue your quest for the end all be all of burgers, I did.Finally, if your wondering why I keep picking on Burger Belly.  It&#39;s because they recently burned me for the second time. I don&#39;t believe in third chances. Unless it&#39;s my wife. She can have all the chances she needs. Unless she cheats on me. In that case, all bets are off and I&#39;ll eat her liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. :)"

When I first hear about this I was so excited I put it down in my calendar. I wanted to go opening day. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t. I heard they ran out of burgers by 4 PM. Not surprising. I was able to go the following day. I kept wondering how the line would be. It ended up taking 30 minutes to get to the cashier on a Sunday afternoon. It was lolla weekend so perhaps there were less people there than usually. I thought, 30 minutes is nothing compared to going to Au Cheval, where the wears vary between 2 to 6 hours. It&#39;s absurd. Chicagoans should have an express like for Au Cheval. I mean, WE LIVE HERE.  I just assume plenty of tourist go there because they have heard all the amazing things about it.Anyway, this location only has burgers and cheese burgers (and fries+beverages). I like that. It keeps it quick and to the point. BUT NO FRIED EGG??? So sad when I saw that. I adoreeeeeee the fried Egg on my burger. It really takes it to the next level. Also not that I order four patties on a burger but I don&#39;t think you can do this here. But then again I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s no on the menu.I do like this location because it is a quick fix for a delicious burger. I mean one of the best in the city  my only issue is that the menu is so limited which has its ups and downs.  I love Au Cheval becAuse of everything else there. Not just the burger. The bone marrow is amazing at Au Cheval and I&#39;ve heard good things about their matzo ball soup. So is this place awesome? Yes. But you&#39;re getting the burger. And youre still waiting. Haha."

We came a little before 6pm on Friday and there were a handful of people ahead of us in line. The layout and ordering is the same as Roxie&#39;s - order at the counter and wait for your number to be called. Took about 10 minutes for us to get our order, total we were in and out in a little over 30 minutes - beats waiting two hours at Au Cheval.The cheeseburger is mostly the same here (and a dollar cheaper?!) -- similar if not same bun, similar if not same Sysco patties (a &#34;double&#34; is still 3 patties), same Kraft cheese, same pickles, same aioli, and same chopped onions. The bigger differences are in the additions: 1) you can order tomato and lettuce 2) no fried eggs here and 3) probably the most glaring difference is that the bacon is different. I know those who swear it&#39;s the bacon that makes the burger at Au Cheval. That peppery, maple glazed thick piece of pork belly. The bacon at Small Cheval is smaller, thinner, less maple-y, and not peppery at all. It&#39;s pretty much thicker cut bacon that you&#39;d get on a typical burger with bacon. Sadsies.The fries are supposed to be the same as well, but they were kind sogsville when I got them. They still tasted great, just not as crispy as I remember. Hopefully it&#39;s just those first-day jitters and it&#39;ll get better.Another difference is they have milkshakes - chocolate and vanilla. I ordered chocolate but they gave me vanilla and I was too lazy to get back into the ever-growing line. The vanilla shake is made with real vanilla beans as shown by the black flecks swimming through my shake. While great in flavor, the shake itself turned soupy really quickly -- not the texture I&#39;m looking for in a shake. Shakes need to be in that limbo between frozen popsicle and melted ice cream. Again, hoping this will get better. Milkshakes are new-ish territory for Sodikoff around here, no?The bonus on Fridays and Saturdays is that the Doughnut Vault truck parks itself outside. As if you haven&#39;t consumed enough calories, the truck tempts you with the thought of doughnuts on your way out.Also, outdoor patio has lots of seating. The Adirondack chairs are not ideal for consuming burgers, but rather for the after-effects of needing to lay back and enjoying your beer, or undoing that top button of your pants.All-in-all, I&#39;m still ecstatic that I can walk down the street and get some version of the Au Cheval burger. I heard this might just be a temporary summer thing and Roxie&#39;s is supposed to be back in the winter. Sorry Roxie&#39;s, I think I&#39;d prefer Small Cheval to stay forever. EDIT: Small Cheval is here to stay, yay!"

Thank God because when I walked by on Saturday at about 1pm there was a line, out the door, down the block. When I was walking my dog on Sunday, there were even more people waiting in line.The burgers are almost as good as the ones at Au Cheval and that is good enough for me. They are the perfect greasiness, flavor, and patty to topping ratio. The fries are good too and the pump-it-yourself garlic aioli is worth it. I had the peach gimlet (which isn&#39;t really a gimlet since it&#39;s made with vodka, but I digress) and it was good as well. All of the alcohols come out of a tap (efficient!). I loved the outdoor seating (which I never got to enjoy while it was Roxie&#39;s) and it is dog friendly. No waiter service. Just order, grab a seat, and wait for them to call your number.Can&#39;t wait to come back, but not too often because I don&#39;t want to die of a heart attack.Bonus: the Doughnut Vault van showed up on Friday night so we were able to add 4000 more calories to our day by purchasing their always incredible donuts."

It was our second time here, and I just had to put in a five star review for this place! I am not a huge burger person, but after we came here two weeks ago, I really craved their cheeseburger this afternoon! I&#39;m officially hooked on the Small Cheval burgers!Food:Their menu is super simple, which I love!- Hamburger- Cheeseburger- add bacon- Fries- Milkshakes- A limited barCheeseburger:I haven&#39;t had their hamburger but their cheeseburger is the way to go. It&#39;s double patties, and they melt the cheese all over the patty, and the buns are toasted on the grill. Their &#34;house style&#34; includes this dijyonnaise sauce with some red onions - I love it that way, I recommend it. I also dunk my burger in the special ketchup and it&#39;s amazing!Sauces:They also have two kinds of ketchup, garlic aioli, and mustard. I recommend the garlic aioli and the ketchup thats not the Heinz kind - taste more salty and less sweet compared to the heinz.French fries:They make the french fries out of fresh california potatoes. They are thicker cut and cooked just the right amount, not greasy, just crispy on the outside and moist in the inside. The Garlic Aioli tastes amazing with the french fries.Shakes:Recommend the vanilla - they use good quality ice cream, you can see the vanilla bean dots in the shake - super yummy! Comes piled with whipped cream. They also have chocolate for the chocolate lovers - but I haven&#39;t tried that myself.Atmosphere:Inside the restaurant is extremely small. The real deal is sitting outside in their patio. It&#39;s much bigger than it seems from across the street, lots of big wooden bench chairs to be used community/family style. It&#39;s a great atmosphere, with nice lights and lots of people hanging out. It&#39;s very child friendly too - see a lot of people with baby carts as they can just put it next to the table."

Part of the downfall with my visit were the cold fries. The manager here on Yelp was very attentive and responded that the issue will be fixed as they were getting a new fryer.

I say this only as someone from LA who holds In N Out burgers in the highest regard. Cheese was delicious and the bun was good too, although I would have preferred a little extra crispness on the inside of the bun.The fries here are spectacular. I just wish the kitchen had made them ready at the same time as the burger because I had to wait like ten minutes after my burger was ready to actually get my fries. Considering they only make two things here, burgers and fries, the timing on this really should not have been an issue. The place was not super crowded at the time, but I&#39;ll give them a pass on this, maybe they were down a fryer or something, who knows.The vanilla shake was tasty and I was delighted by the option to add baileys to it to make it an adult shake. Every place should do this.All in all, this is a good choice when you just want to sit down and enjoy the basics of a good burger, fries and drink without any fuss."

When there&#39;s no outside seating (closed during Winter), the interior seating can be a bit odd: bar seating along 2 walls and a huge center table that occupies 75% of the floor space, but wastes about 25% of it. But, you can overlook that for a Top 3 burger in Chicago."

That&#39;s why I ask for lettuce and tomato so at least I get some veggies in.You can ask for a single patty cheeseburger too, but why do that, unless you&#39;re ordering for your kid...and take it from my 4 year old, he loves their cheeseburgers too.Their golden french fries are perfectly crispy and are a great vehicle for the garlic aioli...which is self-serve pump by the way, get some for the burger or your fries or both.  Trust.My husband likes the house grainy mustard (also self-serve pump), it can add a vinegary element to your burger/fries and quite good too.What else can round out a burger and fries but a milk shake, or better yet a boozy milk shake.   I have yet to try a boozy shake, but tried the regular chocolate shake and that was good.  I do also love the craft cocktails here too.The patio is one of my favorites for lunch in the summer.  The planted greenery make nice walls to block out Milwaukee Ave&#39;s traffic noise. And there&#39;s plenty of seating.Service is nice.  Super casual spot with elevated diner style burgers.  I&#39;ve not been to Au Cheval yet.  When I vist I guess I can compare the burgers.  But really it doesn&#39;t matter, let&#39;s give a shout out to the little sibling. Small Cheval, you done good."

I love their burgers here, almost as much as the original!I came in with my boyfriend on a Friday evening at about 6PM, and the line was surprisingly short. We only waited about 10 minutes, and they&#39;ve got it down pretty efficiently there with one person working the cash register while the other covers the drinks. I ordered an old fashioned (obviously) and this is by far the largest old fashioned I&#39;ve been served in Chicago. They put it in a large plastic cup and fill that puppy all the way up. My boyfriend opted for a beer on tap, and we chose two cheeseburgers served with the standard toppings (lettuce, tomato, dijonaise, and pickles) along with an order of the golden fries.The food came out extremely fast, and we posted up at one of their bar seats with some of Sodikoff&#39;s amazing garlic aioli and Sir Kensington&#39;s Ketchup. The burgers were piping hot and have that traditional old-school burger taste. The pickles and the dijonaise were amazing, and even without the bacon, I couldn&#39;t ask for anymore from a burger. Fries are crispy and fresh and I&#39;d definitely recommend only one order if you want anything else.Can&#39;t wait to come back, and next time, a milkshake will be in order!"

The burgers were cooked to perfection and the fries were fresh and crispy (not overdone).The wait however is another beast. Prepare to spend about 30 minutes or so in line and waiting for a seat. The seating arrangements are along the outside of the building and a community table plopped in the middle. When arriving, I didn&#39;t expect for that long of a wait, but I&#39;m glad I waited!The service was good, even though you&#39;re waiting in almost a painfully long line, servers approach to take your drink order while you wait (huge plus).

When you walk in you are greeted with a rustic, bare-bones decor. And I love it-I would rather a restaurant focus on their food than their atmosphere. My opinion.The fries are the perfect amount of crispy and salty, and they are just as great dipped into the milkshakes (which are thick and rich) or their garlic aoli (a must try!).The burgers are worth the wait on the weekends when it gets busy. While you can only choose your standard hamburger/cheeseburger and there&#39;s not much to add besides bacon, they are juicy, flavorful, and incredible. They&#39;re usually medium rare and I usually prefer medium, but I can compromise for these babies.If you&#39;re in the area, swing by and get a burger and go have a picnic on the 606. These burgers are worth every penny."

I had the cheeseburger and the golden fries - pretty good! They have a decent amount of sauces in a help-yourself type availability which was nice when deciding how we wanted our burger or fries to be enhanced. But let&#39;s be real now, their garlic aioli is the real deal - add some to your burger and have a dipping cup for your fries - boom!Seating:There is one large communal table in the middle of the room, and seats across the walls of the room.

The location is pretty cool - situated on a corner, with a simple &amp; open interior and a secluded garden-style patio that is actually larger than the interior. But, this is a burger joint - so the food is what counts. While the burger was well cooked, especially for thin patties - it was entirely, entirely over seasoned. The overwhelming strong presence of salt was the primary flavor, which unfortunately didn&#39;t let the beef shine. I&#39;m sad to say what I ate was essentially a nice &amp; juicy cheesy salt-patty. The bun was by far my favorite part, and the savior of the experience. It would be a good sandwich to have for a late afternoon snack when you&#39;re having a late dinner - but double up on the water cups!The place was quick - both in paying and in preparing the food, and they had some good tunes playing while I waited. But, since the food was mediocre and, per other reviews here on Yelp, there is supposedly a better version of their food elsewhere, I would just recommend checking the original Au Cheval. Given the high praise for this concept, I&#39;ll have to reserve judgment until I conclude Chicagoans just don&#39;t know a good burger - but this was mostly a let-down, unless salty Shake Shack was the goal."

This place is a bit different than your regular burger joint, when you first walk in their menu is all the way to the front by the register and there are only two food items (which of course narrows it down and makes it easy to pick). Right above it is their drink menu and if you happen to want an iced soda they will be sitting in a cooler(once again very different than any place I have visited). Food, food was great! The only cheese available for your burger will be sharp cheddar and if you do not like cheddar then I suggest you go elsewhere because what good is a burger with no cheese? They also have no alternative choice for the dijonnaise sauce they add to the burger but they do have garlic aioli which I added to my burger. The content of the burger was delicious. The burger was cooked to perfection and the ingredients are fresh and rich in flavor. They have an outside patio, where you can enjoy great food on a sunny day(inside seating is also available).

The flavors are perfect and the way it all just melts together is out of this world.This place gets tough criticism because of its older brother. I will agree with everyone else that it&#39;s just not the same as Au Cheval. However, to me this fixes the craving without the crazy wait...and it&#39;s designed as a quick order and eat place so they are just on totally different levels.When you arrive here you will just jump right in line to the counter where you&#39;ll place your order and be given a buzzer. The buzzer goes off when your food is ready :) It should be noted that they only offer hamburgers and cheeseburgers here, but I did hear the person in front of me ordering a &#34;kids burger&#34; so it sounds like they have a smaller portion for the little ones.This last Saturday when I visited, it was a little busy, so a server was walking through the line serving drinks if you wanted to order. This was awesome. What a nice touch. I ordered the Seattle Cider on draft and it was crisp and refreshing.Let&#39;s talk food. The cheeseburger. So good. This is definitely an eat it right then and there kind of burger. I can&#39;t imagine it would be as good as take out if you&#39;re going very far. The first time I visited here my cousin and I split a burger. This only lead to me wishing I had my own burger. You probably need your own burger at this place :) IMO it&#39;s dressed perfectly house style, but here you have more flexibility with toppings contrary to its big brother Au Cheval. The fries are also crispy, delicious and well priced. Only 2.95 for a side of fries and my fiancé and I always just split one order. I also love that the condiments are self serve here, hello garlic aioli!In my book Small Cheval is exactly what I&#39;ve been looking for. Nothing complicated, just an amazing burger and fries."

Burger had no real flavor to it. Tasted like a fast food burger on a fancier bun. Also does not come included with lettuce or tomato.... for a burger joint that sells $10 cheeseburgers that seems pretty crazy. Paid $2 extra for bacon but could barely taste the flavor.The golden fries came in a generous portion, but they were hard as rocks. Garlic aioli sauce and house ketchup were the best food items.I will say that the large outdoor patio space with string lights and vibey music deserves 5 stars.

She was insistent on walking and avoiding public transportation (an abnormal New Yorker) and Small was only a 20 minute walk, whereas Regular was an hour and 20. Small won by a landslide (considering the 35 degree weather).The menu was horribly extensive (just kidding) - a whole 3 items to choose from. But really, those three (or for my needs, two) items on the menu are all you need - fill your stomach with an out of this world cheeseburger and an order of their delicious golden fries and you&#39;ll be thinking about this meal for days, as I&#39;ve been doing. Another one of the best parts is the 5-part condiment line, including 2 different kind of ketchups, mustard, mayonnaise, and garlic aioli. Yes, that&#39;s right folks, UNLIMITED GARLIC AIOLI.My friend and I rated the cheeseburger an 8 - it was double-pattied juiciness, with a great dijonaise, pickles, and lettuce. It was probably the best burger I&#39;ve had in a longggg time and definitely more than I expected from Regular&#39;s smaller sibling. To be honest, I would say that in some instances, this burger may actually be better than Regular&#39;s. Yup, that&#39;s right, I said it. Avoid the long lines and wait times at Regular and go to Small for a hella good burger.And even though we were so full and ate so much we felt like vomming, we took the plunge and got a milkshake as well. Chocolate? Vanilla? Hm, vanilla. No, chocolate. Most people have chocolate. But I usually like vanilla. The debates continued so my friend went ahead and asked someone who worked there what he would do, and he recommended chocolate, so we went for it. When it came out, he also brought us a complimentary vanilla milkshake, which was so nice of him. That milkshake was so good. Chocolate won. Small wins."

I remember being a teenager eating the leftover shrimp they could not eat and I enjoyed the hell out of it.I decided to stop by recently for nostalgia sake. I ordered 1/2lbs of jumbo shrimp. I always enjoy checking out old establishments that have signed pics of local and world celebrities. Shaq, Lisa Raye, local news reporters and countless others have donated their John Hancocks to the wall of fame here. My food didn&#39;t take very long to come out and I hopped in my car and drove home. I was excited to try the shrimp I hadn&#39;t eaten in almost 20 years. Once home I ripped the damn bag open and saw my big ass shrimp which caused the hunger to rise. There was too much breading on the shrimp which made it difficult to eat and it definitely affected the taste in a major way. Not as good as I remember it. The hot sauce definitely added flavor to the overly breaded shrimp and would probably be good on anything fried.People behind the counter are really cool. Parking here should be easy as there is street parking in front. The place is virtually in the middle of nowhere with nothing else to eat until you drive about a mile west on Division. I would definitely try the place again, but I prefer Lawrence Fisheries shrimp."

I mean, I used to. I lived in New Orleans and would eat them all of the time. Thing is, when I ate them, I don&#39;t recall space alien-green sh!t (literally) oozing out of them all the time. It&#39;s repulsive. Of all the things to willingly put into one&#39;s mouth, this has to go near the bottom.Yes, I&#39;m a Protestant.But, seriously, my meal here might have been one of the most singularly unhealthy things I have ever eaten. I ordered a 1/2 scallop, 1/2 oyster and 1/2 shrimp meal with fries. The shrimp were very large, expertly breaded and incredibly satisfying. And, after observation, they were de-veined, which is points for me. The rating has much to do with the shrimp and I would probably come back here to eat them (or, eat someone else&#39;s). The sauce was a slight upgrade from the usual cocktail sauce and provided just the right coating for the sea roaches. The scallops, too, were quite large, nicely breaded and tasted great. If I had never seen what these ugly f*ckers look like in the wild, I would eat them again. But, I can&#39;t. They&#39;re disgusting. They have all these beady, googly eyes all over their shells... ugh, I am getting grossed out by even writing it. Tasted good -- but no more for me.The oysters were... hot. I took a bite a did the &#34;Haa-haaa-haa&#34; thing and waved at my mouth. Spitting the bivalve onto a piece of paper so as to stop the scalding, I looked into the abyss and came back a changed man. The oyster was full of green ick and it was nauseating. I put that one aside and cut into another. More ooze. I tried to pawn one off on my friend as an experiment. He cussed me out. I just couldn&#39;t do it. No amount of sauce, breading or hype could get me to eat those things. I tried to salvage the meal with the fries. They were eh. The heat from the sea food made &#39;em soggy (the order came in the same brown bag). The lack of over salting/seasoning kept them bland. I threw most away. But, in GISH&#39;s defense, I was sober throughout the experience.There&#39;s a reason this is drunk-food."

About 5 of us order about 5# shrimp, 1/2#oysters, clams, fries, almost everything. I think most of these 4-5 stars are just having a nostalgia moment. The food was OK at best, oysters were downright scary.Breading was thick but shrimp size was good, just not much flavor. Goose Island sauce is just cocktail sauce (over priced).Won&#39;t be back except maybe for the clam strips. They seemed to be breaded differently which makes me think right from the freezer into the fryer from Gordon&#39;s fisherman."

You may have to wait a little longer, but it&#39;s worth it. I suggest bringing your own bottle of hot sauce or the like, and a salt shaker.

Shrimp and catfish are the way to go. Jumbo shrimp are HUGE and taste really fresh. Had fried oysters and to this day I can&#39;t figure out why it looked and tasted the way it did.
