This was my first time at Jaks Tap and my boyfriend had visited a couple times before. He spoke highly of the place and after my first visit I can see why! Upon entering we were greeted and immediately seated. Our server was very kind, full of energy, and full of recommendations! I personally thought it was amazing when I had mentioned to our server that I was a Vegetarian. She was full of recommendations and even went so far as to offer most of the menu made to my liking -- which I thought was very considerate! We immediately ordered drinks, an order of Nachos, and took our time to look over the menu. I was instantly surprised when I saw that they actually cater to Vegetarians! Having strict food restrictions, it was so nice to see options that would satisfy me.It wasn&#39;t long before our Drinks and Appetizer were brought out to us. It took me a while to decide on what I wanted, there are so many great options!! I ended up ordering the Veggie Chili and a side of French Fries. My boyfriend stuck with the Chicken Wings.The nachos were a great start while we waited! Cooked perfectly, extra cheesy, and the jalapenos added a delicious kick! The separate sides of guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo were very fresh and made the dish even better! While focusing on our Nachos we waited less than 20 minutes before our second food order came out. We were told ahead of time that the Chicken Wings take a little more time to cook which we didn&#39;t mind at all! It was great that our server mention that from the start! The minute the food was brought out to us we were ready to dig in!My Boyfriend loved the wings, he mentioned the sauce tasting like no other he&#39;s had before. My Veggie Chili was incredible! For a second I had to question it, I don&#39;t know what real meat tastes like, I had my boyfriend taste it and he confirmed it was meat free and SHOCKINGLY delicious!!! And having the fries on the side to dip into my chili made it even better!!I should mention that the place was pretty busy and our server was pretty consumed with a large party that came in shortly after we had ordered. My boyfriend and I were so engaged in our meal we hardly noticed! Our server at one point apologized to us with sincerity and we assured her that everything was perfect! As a token of her feeling bad for not checking on us as she normally would she got us a round of Jameson Shots -- totally unnecessary and we were very grateful! Thank you!I will definitely be coming back for more and highly recommend checking Jaks Tap out! Grab a drink, grab some food, and enjoy the welcoming atmosphere!"

You can substitute any salad&#39;s cold chicken with grilled Cajun or natural chicken - don&#39;t question, just do it!, Six Gun Chili, Cabo Wabo (formerly Surfin Bird), and Bleu Moon Burger. Tater tot and onion ring option = always a thumbs up. Do not leave without at least trying the Jalapeno Mac.Best Balsamic (homemade) dressing I&#39;ve ever had - wish they&#39;d bottle and sell this!Rented the semi-private party room for $800 (pre-gratuity) in the back on a slow, empty, winter Sunday. A little much for what it is, but Jak&#39;s is special to us. Took too long to get the pizzas we pre-ordered but eventually everyone was fed and the staff offered to box up leftovers. The pool table is cumbersome to move around.TVs and ability to see them are plentiful, especially on big game days. Appreciate the ability to watch many teams at once and extra appreciate it&#39;s one of very the few places that supports both the Bears and Packers games when airing simultaneously."

The high top tables are a little too close together, and the bathroom is way too small, but the guy behind the bar (Mike?) was really attentive. The beer list is solid, and they have Kwak at a reasonable price in its proper glass, so no complaints there. We ordered a pizza (some weird Kwak package special) and while it wasn&#39;t spectacular, it was tasty enough to be a welcome addition to the table.If I&#39;m in the west loop, feel like drinking good beer but not going &#34;out out&#34;, this spot is my go-to."

We placed our food orders and got our drinks from the bartender, who was friendly, and headed to the room. They do have a good beer selection, but the food left something to be desired. I ordered the Cajun veggie burger. It should have been called the fire and ice burger. It was your run of the mill frozen veggie patty that they had then burned. For my side I chose the jalapeno mac and cheese. The mac was overcooked and falling apart, and they must have forgotten to put the jalapeno in. My husband had what I think was the sloppy jak, which he described as &#34;fine.&#34;  If we ended up here again maybe I&#39;d give one of their pizzas a try.The overall ambiance was not great. It was older but, which is fine, but not exactly in a fun or charming way, it felt a bit scrungy. Maybe I wouldn&#39;t have noticed this on a busy Saturday night after a few drinks, but as I said, it was Monday. The room we were in had a bar for larger private parties, and it was fine that we weren&#39;t using it, but there was some clutter on the bar and it would have been nice if they&#39;d cleaned I up a bit.If there was another even here or someone really wanted to go for some reason, I&#39;d go along, but it wouldn&#39;t be my first choice if I was looking for a good beer bar."

There is a nice beer list which changes frequently. Overall, Jak&#39;s is a neighborhood bar which caters to locals (mid-day parents and their kids at tables), United Center crowds (bring your Blackhawks jersey), and after work gatherings (wear your suit).

It&#39;s fairly busy and it&#39;s understandable, but holy crap. I can barely hear people a foot away! This is beyond loud and into &#34;incomprehensible&#34;.Now let me get back to the good parts of Jaks:you have a awesome and rotating alcohol selection, you have some decent food options, and you have service that ranges from awesome to crap. It&#39;s entirely luck of the draw. Over the 10 or so times I&#39;ve been here I&#39;ve had people who can&#39;t even handle glasses without having their hands inside them, and also awesome waitresses who I wish I knew outside of Jaks just to hang out and introduce to my circle of people. Woe to anyone who gets the bad service here, because it&#39;s *BAD*. On the flip side? it&#39;s pretty rare.Also, it&#39;s basically a sports bar with plenty of TV&#39;s to catch up sports, as well as having a fireplace to stay warm in the winter.Oh, and parking. Parking here is a bit of a nightmare that is easily remedied: you&#39;re just going to have to go up and down a few side streets to find a place to park. There really isn&#39;t a lot in front of Jaks.good? food and beer, convenient locationokay? service is hit or missbad? don&#39;t expect to have a meaningful conversation here"

We were in one of their meeting rooms. We had pizza which was really good, I especially liked the buffalo chicken pizza, they have a large selection of beers and they seem to make additions every week. And on the list of beers there is something that could suit you no matter what your tastes are. I hade a beer blend called the apple berry, and I loved it, being a person that doesn&#39;t like the taste of beer it was perfect for me. The atmosphere looks pretty lively, and if your a sports fan you can come here, grab a beer and watch the game. The host and the staff were laid back and friendly, they really made you feel welcomed there, I am definitely planning to come back here and having a nice meal and another one of their beers."

My wife and I meet up with co-workers here.  It&#39;s a typical bar, they have TV&#39;s playing the game of the evening on, your wooden tables, booths, dark ambience.  The staff there is very welcoming, the wait staff is super nice, accommodating and know their menu well.  You walk in and you will always have a table ready, even on a Friday night.The food is terrific.. the wings there are nice and crispy on the outside, the buffalo sauce spicy with a side of blue cheese, its a winner.  I can take a few orders down.  The pizza is delish!  The meat lovers, hold the onions, wins my heart every time.  I get a personal size because sharing pizza is a tough thing for me to do.  The prime rib sliders, you have to try.  Tasty beef, some nice spicy horseradish sauce, every bite is delicious.Now the beer.. They have lots of it.  They have an excellent selection for every taste.. you have lagers, IPA, stouts etc. etc.. you will find something you like.  They also make a good snake bite!  go try it:D  you can get your black and blues, black and tans as well.  Oh and they have a full bar...The Prices are great, don&#39;t break the bank, that&#39;s how we end up buying more tequila than we should :DJak&#39;s is tops in my book after a long hard week in the IT world.:D"

Great beer list with Firestone Walker IPA, Leffe Brune, Two Brothers. I did not get  chance to try the Lagunitas Sucks, but I&#39;ll be back soon for that.When March Madness comes around, nearby Dylan&#39;s Tap is downright mad! Jaks does not have as many flat screens, but it should be easy enough to request a table within view of a TV for all the action.On my last visit I ordered off of the specials menu: Montego Enchiladas. Chicken enchiladas with a pineapple-tomatillo salsa, served with black beans and spanish rice. The enchiladas were a little dry, and where was the pineapple? I asked my nice attentive server for a side of the salsa and 10 seconds later someone from the kitchen was setting it on my table. Damn! That&#39;s fast!Another nice visit to Jaks!"

They have a solid variety of beer on tap and selection of food. Favorite app is the buffalo chicken fingers and fav food is the blue moon burger. The blue cheese that is stuffed into the patty really makes all the difference in the world. Down fall.. They charge for soda refills (wtf) and they don&#39;t tell you that fun fact.

The turkey burger is one of the best I&#39;ve tried, and they have more than one option to dress it up. The hummus is also delish, which is surprising for a pub.

It has been a while since we&#39;ve been to Jaks and they clearly changed their weekend hours. Thankfully there are other options around that will gladly take our business. We returned on a Friday afternoon and had lunch. It was just as I remembered. Good food and a huge beer list. I had the BBQ sandwich and it was tasty. My wife had the blackened cajun chicken breast. Anything bbq or cajun are solid choices here. Also love the jalapeno mac n cheese.They have a ton of beers on tap and several Midwest brews. Bells Oberon and New Belgium&#39;s Sunshine wheat were our choices. They were good but seemed really bubbly and carbonated. Don&#39;t know what was going on there. But, Ive never seen that before and I fancy beer and have been known to throw a few back. There are several old bulky TVs and few plasmas.This was always a place I liked for game watching.

This place was great! The food was really good and the beer selection was huge! My buddy got ribs and he said they were really good.The only two issues we had were that it was 5:30pm and there were not spots at the bar or bar tables available so we had to sit at one of their regular tables. We were okay with that, but then the service was really not that good. We were waiting for a while to get our orders in and to finally get the check.This place does have a pool table and Golden Tee in the back if you are looking for that.

Yesterday&#39;s was assisted by Sin City cider from NYC.  A sweet cider I hadn&#39;t seen anywhere else in Chicago and could cry into.Jaks is a great place for groups, though it does get really noisy with the after work crowd.  And for watching sporting events, due to its large rooms and television angles it&#39;s second to none.  You&#39;ll just have to excuse me if I ever turn down an invitation there.

She was also very polite.The beer selection is stellar, and the food was fantastic. I ordered the Surfin Bird Burger with onion rings. I don&#39;t usually like Turkey burgers, but this sounded good so I went for it. I&#39;m glad I did! There was a good quantity of fresh, tasyy avocado on the burger which is surprisingly uncommon for burgers boasting avocado. The Pico was a bit spicy for me, but I have the spicy food tolerance of an infant. The onion rings were top notch - nice and crispy.Jak&#39;s has definitely earned itself a return visit."

As a dry cleaners, it was called Alex Cleaners and they rearranged some letters of the old signage &amp; added a &#34;F&#34; for it to spell Cafe on the outside. You can still see the faint outline of the rest of the old name on their signage so it looks as if they did some janky half @$$ job removing the former label. Rest assured, it&#39;s intentional.Same Day Cafe has been open just about a year now and they&#39;ve been pumping out food ever since. Some may see it as the overflow holder for Longman &amp; Eagle two doors down but I think it&#39;s a destination in and of itself. Service is phenomenal and the food had an elevated simplistic touch that makes it delicious and unique.Take their grilled cheese. We all know and love this sandwich but the grilled cheese at Same Day Cafe isn&#39;t run of the mill by any means. It comes on rosemary bread topped with a ton of shaved ham, gruyere cheese and a dash of house dill mustard. For $12 you get this sandwich with a little side potato salad/coleslaw dish. It&#39;s tasty and a fun new spin on a classic meal.I have to say that when I went to Same Day Cafe, I was with my cousin who had her two little munchkins in tow. Wonderful children but a lot of work &amp; Same Day Cafe was extremely accommodating to them despite them I&#39;m sure being just as horrified as I was at some of their behaviors. Eek. Thanks, Same Day.They are BYOB which is always good. And if you&#39;re not from our &#39;hood, don&#39;t fret.

The food was good, not great, and our tab at the end was $32, which I thought was a little high for breakfast we shared.

There was one floor fan on the opposite side of the restaurant near the kitchen. It was stifling. Not a good start.Considering the heat, I had to try one of the house-made sodas which I quite liked, but my wife did not. We ordered mini pot pies for the kiddos which  they didn&#39;t eat, but we did. They would have tasted a lot better if they were 4 bucks each. My BLT was delicious, but we were a little underwhelmed by the portion size for the price. I&#39;d say they&#39;re overpriced by 25%. Maybe they use primo expensive ingredients, but it&#39;s a bit hard to justify the price.This place is more hipster-friendly than kid friendly. I understand kids being less welcome at busy times, but we were there around 4 pm. Maybe I was just already pissed off from the heat. 2 star experience, 4 star food.

I got a meal that was probably one or two scrambled eggs, a biscuit, and a &#34;salad&#34; that was basically a tiny pile of spinach. With tax and a 15% tip, it was over $16. They also really need to expand their menu, which really could pass for a small assortment of brunch appetizers. Not worth it."

Vinyl on the record player, plants all around, light wood, white and clean... it appeals to the graphic designer in me. :) No, the menu isn&#39;t huge, but as others have mentioned, I believe it&#39;s because they want to focus on making less things so those items can be as delicious as possible. I think they try to make most ingredients in house (Rosemary bread=yum, syrups for sodas, pickles, etc) so that these seemingly simple things that other restaurants outsource can shine. No, it&#39;s not cheap, but when you make said items in house with fresh/local ingredients, they are a little more expensive. I&#39;m willing to pay for that. So if you&#39;d like a cheap pile of mass produced food, don&#39;t go here. If you&#39;d like a well proportioned serving of local farm eggs and bacon atop freshly baked bread, this is your place. :)"

The giardiniera cream on the potatoes was really unique and delicious, and the sandwich perfectly executed with, as other reviews have mentioned, a slight hint of tangy mustard. Great thick bacon as well. Very reasonable portions.One downside if you like an alcoholic beverage with your weekend brunches is that this restaurant is not licensed. No Bloody Mary or Mimosa to be found here. You can always hit up one of the nearby bars for an after-meal drink, though.I&#39;d highly recommend stopping by here, especially if the wait at nearby brunch spots is a little long for your liking."

I had their mini chicken pot pie ($6) which was the perfect escape from the windy day. The tangy taste of the salad cuts any buttery feeling from the pot pie. Although the pot pie doesn&#39;t feel too heavy because it&#39;s the perfect miniature size. It was filling for a small girl, but not too sure how others would feel.They also have hot coffee from Ipsento, so needless to say, it&#39;s a good cup of coffee. Their chocolate chocolate chip cookie is the soft kind, if you like soft cookies this is a goody. I like chewy cookies so it wasn&#39;t the kind I liked, but still tasty.Last time, I got their open faced egg sandwich with bacon and a cup of tomato soup. If you like bacon and eggs and sandwiches like most folks, this is a great choice.Service is great, really kind. They are very willing to explain anything on the menu for you. They have a great specials menu also. The place just feels very chill and the everything is delicious, so I&#39;m going to go back to reading and drinking my coffee now."

The fact that they let us stay after closing was a huge plus in my book.Food was fresh and reasonably priced. Soda was a little expensive for what tasted like regular sugar and fizz - maybe blackberry, lime and ginger are too many flavors for one drink?Honestly, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d go again, but only because there are so many other places to try around it.

My friend had the blt, and my sister had the avocado toast. We also ordered the potatoes. When the waiter brought the food out my sister noticed a hair on the sandwich. The waiter apologized and took it back. It was back on the table less than 5 minutes later. A little fishy...As we asked for the check the waiter indicated he would write off the avocado toast but he didn&#39;t write it off he took half off. Another awkward thing is that you pay your bill on an iPad. So he stands there as you decide how much to tip him.

It&#39;s assembled to match your tastes, and is a great way to experience the menu&#39;s highlights.Each course was beautifully presented. The only truly amazing one was the vichyssoise, but everything else was quite good, and the price was reasonable for the quality.Service was informative and attentive, and the secondary service staff were particularly efficient at delivering and clearing.Brindille has one of the better wine lists in town, at a reasonable markup of about twice retail. It&#39;s heavy on quality French wines, and bears a bit of research before your visit to be truly rewarded."

The service was fine (although probably not up to par with the type of ultra fine dining establishment Brindille is supposed to be) but the food and the presentation...are they even trying?First strike - we walk in, and the host seats us and says, I assume you&#39;re for the Gilt deal so here&#39;s the Gilt menu. Yes, true, but something about the way he said it was not the most respectful, but fine, whatever, its the food that matters right? (for me anyway. my friend was more offended.)Onto the first course!It was a hodge podge of olives, butter, pickled mushroom and other small unrelated bites all in different disjointed containers that just seemed completely random. Did I grab them all off a buffet line? Do the flavors even go together?Second course -I have no qualms eating frog and other &#34;weird&#34; things. I grew up going to Asian markets with my mom where they sell live frogs (amongst other interested live things), but the frog legs were fried and just threw onto the plate without my thought. You can clearly see the little bones and recognize the webbed feet screaming - hey, I was once a frog! Even I felt a little uneasy looking at it. The actual preparation and taste was mediocre as well. It was pretty mush the full leg, breaded, dropped into oil, placed onto a plate. I thought this was a fancy French restaurant?Mind you, the restaurant was completely empty on a Thursday night save for one big table of businessmen that seemed to be celebrating a big deal signed.The rest of the meal was equally mediocre and definitely not worth even what I paid for the Gilt deal - I can think of so many Chicago establishment where I can get a much better meal at half the price. I think the place is empty for a reason..."

This is a classy place and I&#39;m glad I made my boyfriend change out of his jeans before we came!For the most part we enjoyed our meal, but when I&#39;m prepared to pay that much money (we dished out ~$300) for a night out I want to be blown away.  There is a 5-course or a 9-course tasting menu, which were $90/person and $160/person respectively, but we opted to order what we thought looked the best on the menu.Starters (Pour commencer):  I ordered the Curried Cauliflower Soup &amp; my boyfriend ordered the Foie Gras. My soup was creamy and decadent with a lot of complex flavors. I would definitely order it again. The Foie Gras was delicious, as well! It was melt in your mouth tender and very rich in flavor. I always love foie gras and this was no exception!Main course: I ordered the Lobster Brindille, which was tasty, but once again I was not blown away. I probably would have preferred another serving of soup. The portion of lobster was decent, but it was served on top of an array of vegetables (sunchokes, fava beans, potatoes) that was disappointing.  I think that the vegetables change seasonally, but mine were flavorless and did nothing to compliment the lobster.Dessert:  We ordered the Bittersweet Chocolate Delice, which was rich and served with a refreshing side of salted caramel ice cream. It was a good dessert.Service:  Our server was not very talkative, which isn&#39;t always bad, but I consider recommendations and checking in with your tables to be part of the overall experience &amp; I wasn&#39;t blown away.I&#39;m still definitely wanting to try out Naha, but I likely won&#39;t make my way back to Brindille."

I&#39;m from New Orleans, and wanted to put the French food in Chi to the test, and Brindille passed with flying colors.We started off with the quail appetizer and hand made noodles. I had seen escargot on other pictures, and they are a personal favorite of mine. They weren&#39;t included on the handmade noodle appetizer, but I asked, and they added them. Very tasty with bold flavors that really compliment each other and melt in your mouth.Me and bae had been drinking and eating all day, so for entrees we split the Dover Sole fish and a winter salad. Omg. So the piece of fish was $60. That&#39;s pricey, even for me, but it was so worth it. The fish and flavors just pop and melt in your mouth. The salad was a decent size with fresh crispy vegetables that complimented the fish really nicely.For dessert we had something chocolate, again very tasty. If you&#39;re starving and want a big hearty meal this probably isn&#39;t the best spot, portions aren&#39;t small, but they aren&#39;t huge and overly filling. I like to think that it&#39;s more of a quality than quantity meal. A lot of quality.Service was terrific, but for what you&#39;re spending it certainly should be. Highly recommend if you want tasty refined French food and to feel all fancy. Cocktails were good too!"

I should mention my background experience with fine dining. I am someone who eats out a lot, but will spend over 100 dollars on a meal about once every three months (so not everyday). I&#39;ve eaten at severeI Michelin star(or two) restaurants but wouldn&#39;t call myself a sophisticated foodI was able to get a reservation the day of at 7:30 pm (and some other times available), which was awesome... but made me a bit nervous as maybe that&#39;s a bad sign? Although not advertised we ordered the tasting menu (server was happy to have us do it).Things I liked: great service, very attentive, pace was great for food, nice atmosphere but nothing stood out. Seating was comfortable!There were 8 courses in the tasting, some of things included: an oyster, steak tartar, tomatoes, noodle dish with escargot, duck roast with fois gras, and some delicious desserts (chocolate and a fruity one).Some great flavors and textures in the meal.I just can&#39;t justify the cost of $150 for the tasting menu... I came hungry (not starving) and at the end was not quite full. I&#39;m 160 lbs so I&#39;m not massive, I just think some of the portions were a bit too small, even for a tasting menu. Our server explained things and was very friendly, but the one thing I thought a bit lacking, was ensuring we understood what we eating. We were offered juices and coffee at the end, although would have been nice, spending as much as we did, I was hesitant about spending any more more (which may have been ALOT).Maybe best option is NOT to do the tasting?Was a great experience but can&#39;t justify the price."

Definitely foodie territory, though still quite approachable (much like its sibling, Naha, down the street).VIBE: Understated elegance, but comfortable. Muted tones, restrained décor, somewhat dim lighting. Romantic -- a nice choice for that very special date.SERVICE: Everyone was personable, warm, helpful and well-trained.GOOD: Bison short rib was rich and nicely put together. (In fact, every dish was rich and nicely designed &amp; presented.) Ditto sweetbreads and rabbit confit.NOT SO GOOD: Lobster was tasty, but way chewier than I prefer. Banquette seat was not so comfortable after 90 minutes. Wines by the glass did not deliver good value, in my view.As might be expected in a fine French-inflected restaurant, richness was a hallmark of every dish. This was fun for a splurge, but frankly was a bit heavy for me -- I&#39;m more into vibrant flavors, lighter textures and smaller portions. I would have enjoyed it more if the portions had been smaller (at a commensurately lower price, of course). Glad I tried it, though, and I would recommend it for those seeking a tony meal and rich French fare."

Went here with some business colleagues for a celebratory meal and the restaurant certainly delivered.During the week the tasting menu is more of a chefs choice tailored to the tastes of people at the table. The chef really exceeded my expectations (even writhing my pregnancy diet constraints). The 7 courses ($150 per person) included: watercress soup, crab with grapefruit and cauliflower purée, black cod, lobster brindille, noodles with snails (nostalgic take on Japanese ramen noodles), foie gras and pineapple then a dessert selection that we shared including a chocolate espresso cake, cherry clafoutis and hazelnut meringue of sorts. Everything was very good - highlights for me were the lobster, noodles and foie gras.The server/sommelier was passionate about the cuisine and his descriptions of the wine pairings - and likely the only person to make you believe that your wine has just the right amount of sass to talk back to you after a long day.I would agree with another reviewer that the decor is a bit more suited to a business dinner than a romantic one - decorated in cool gray tones and masculine light fixtures. Not to say you won&#39;t also enjoy for a date night, but it does have a more modern masculine feel.It&#39;s a good place to dine alone if you&#39;re in town and just want a great expenses meal."

HEAVEN...I am in love with this restaurant!1.  Easy Open Table reservations2.  Space...by far, everything was perfect.  Gray tones, crisp, light, elegant, upscale...with a pop of color...pink.  They actually steam the table cloths when they set the table.  The silverware to the plates to the paintings on the walls...everything is great.3.  Service...I cannot tell you enough about the amazing service we received from Robert.  He is a fantastic server and read us like a book.  Not pretentious, fun, knowledgeable, psychotherapist...LOVED him.  It was seriously probably the best service we have received all around in 3 years...waters always full, appropriately clearing plates, coursed out perfectly...I cannot say enough about it.4.  Food...OMG, the FOOD WAS AMAZING!  Yes, its pricey, but it is warranted.  Hand cut noodles, snails and morels were a surprising delight!  Steak tartare was excellent!  Frise salad perfect and light.  Soup was creamy yet not too rich.  Lobster Brindille is EXCELLENT and huge!  Filet of beef tenderloin was great and the potatoes on the side really shined.  They taste like french onion soup...you know a place is good when they have amazing sides to accompany amazing mains.  Dover sole was thick cut and deliciously prepared.  Last time I had dover was at Everest and it was terrible.Desserts-Lemon tarte...excellent and the Strawberry, rhubarb, leek cream was amazing!I legit wanted to lick the plate on all of the above...you cannot go wrong here.  I am shocked there isnt more reviews of this place.For an upscale meal, you WANT o try this place."

However, we are greatly disappointed about the food.We had three appetizers, a glass of wine for each, two main dishes, and one dessert.Appetizer :Foie gras: rich and tender, which was good. I liked it and the berry sauce on it.Wine with Foie gras: Great. We asked the waiter to recommend a wine which gets along with Foie gras. We got glasses of the white wine which he recommended us, and I cannot remember the name.Hand-cut noodle: dry and stuck each other. It seemed it was made an hours ago. When I forked it, the whole chunk of the noodles are hung up at the tip of my fork. The flavor of truffle was almost indistinguishable. Instead, they put a lot of Chanterelles mushrooms which are much cheaper. I chew a chestnut which was very hard seemingly under-cooked. I wish I liked this noodle since I saw the pictures of the dish which looks very juicy and rich, and the pic made me decide to go there.Oyster: After trying two appetizers, we were dubious on our taste at that time. Yes, we admit that we have not experienced French dining that much.  But, we love oyster, so we can tell. We tried the Oyster. The result was disappointing again. Oyster was not fresh and a bit smelly. I could not understand why such a fine dining restaurant could not keep the materials fresh. Also the balance with the creme on it was ... what we disliked. The creme and oyster played separately.Main dishes:Duck breast: Duck breast was good. The juice of the meat was bare (I ordered it as medium), cooked okay, but sauce made it good. The lentil with sauce spread below the meat get along with the meat very well. I don&#39;t know what the sauce on the side of the plate, but it was also made me enjoy a dynamic flavor of the dish. However, the Config Leg Ballotine on the side was smelly again. They could not remove it.Lobsters: I liked it. The texture was great. It was cooked amazingly. However, my b&#39;fried did not like some piece of the vegi on the sauce (I did not figure out what it was). It undermine the flavor some degree.DesertBittersweet Chocolate Delice with Black Tea, Citrus Marmalade and Salted Caramel Ice Cream: Wrong choice. Don&#39;t eat this... Nothing but sweet, cheap flavor. Or we were too full, maybe.Service:The waiter was okay, but I wonder if he was really qualified to take the gratuity we put. He chose the right wine. Otherwise, he did nothing. He did not give any information about the dish which is coming or about the time it would be served. Rather, the guy, seemingly a Latino, who did the chores like filled our water cups, took the empty dishes and brought the new dishes, are much worth to take it.The price was above $300 including the tax and gratuity. We were willing to pay that amount of money if it had been worth. However, our conclusion is that it is overpriced as compared to its value of the food and the service or other restaurants. At the night before, we already had another fine dining at the other restaurant which was local and not very famous chef operating. We liked there much more. I cannot believe the high rating for the Brindille on the Yelp anymore."

If you enjoy French food, excellent wine pairings and service that goes above and beyond, you MUST visit Brindille.Where do I begin? We arrive for our 530 reservation on Saturday evening and are immediately are seated at a lovely table for the 4 of us. I loved the cushions they had on the bench. Very comfy.A big kudos to our server Rob who was knowledgeable, friendly, didn&#39;t rush us at any point of the meal (we didn&#39;t leave until after 9pm). Our water glasses were never empty and were filled with no interruptions.We begin with the Duval-Leroy Brut Rose champagne ($26) which was perfect on a warm evening. We toyed with the idea of a tasting menu (7 courses) which was $150 each but since we also wanted to do wine pairings with each dish and only 3 of us were interested in having wine, we decided to just order a bunch of plates and share them. Rob was also happy to select the wine for us and poured 2 oz each for the 3 of us and simply charged us the cost of the glass. He also was quite generous with pouring a little more if we really liked it :)Based on the yelp reviews, the 3 of us went with 3 apps (oysters, foie gras, sweetbreads) and 3 mains (lobster, duck, squab). My hubby went with the split poussin (chicken) as he didn&#39;t want any of the other stuff.They brought the 4 oysters out first which was perfect with the champagne! Best I have ever had. We let Dave have the extra oyster but it was tough to give it up.They then brought out the lobster which they paired with a white burgundy (2011 Chassagne-Montrachet: $28). Best lobster I have ever had and excellent with the wine. Jill even ordered another glass to go with her dessert!They then brought out a 2011 Alsace Riesling to go with the foie gras and a red burgundy (Marsannay &#34;Les Vaudenelles&#34;) to go with the sweetbreads. This was the best foie gras I have ever had. (Are you seeing a theme here?) Even better than what I had in France! I also recommend the sweetbreads and perfect wine pairings too.Next came a glass of 2007 Bonarda from Italy to enjoy with the squab and duck.  I recommend trying the squab but was not a big fan of the duck. I think it was a bit over done. Loved the Bonarda.My hubby loved the poussin which also came with a poached egg. The egg was cold but it&#39;s hard to keep an egg warm...For dessert, I was stuffed but Dave had so much confidence in Rob that he told Rob to pick out a dessert, and to provide a wine pairing of his choice, AND to provide a smoke and a light and he didn&#39;t disappoint. He brought a lovely glass of Jurancon, a fantastic dessert and... a cigarette (camel I think?) and a lighter! Can you believe it?Jill got the cheese plate ($35) which was shaped like a clock and had 12 samplings to have in a specific order (clockwise starting at 12). It came with these yummy warm bread sticks and an amazing jam. Wow...We were also provided a free dessert that was in the oven for 25 minutes and was complete heaven. A warm cherry and almond clafoutis with a chantilly creme. Amazing... Rob filled up my glass with more of the Bonarda I enjoyed with the last course and then filled Dave&#39;s glass of Jurancon too! No charge on any of the extra pours mentioned.This is the best dining experience I have ever had. The service, the food, the presentation, the level of knowledge that Rob had and the freebies were all beyond belief.You must go! Even the butter that came with the bread was incredible..."

Kicked off with oysters, went into greens/meats, and ended up delicious desserts. Man the dessert was awesome - macaroons, cookies, and more.

My fiancé and I celebrated our anniversary at Brindille. Our experience was outstanding.A recap of our evening: As we arrived, we were welcomed with a &#34;Happy Anniversary&#34; from the hostess, which set a positive first impression. We had a 9pm reservation, and arrived about 45 minutes early to settle in with a cocktail. After checking my coat, we were seated at the bar with a cocktail menu. The service was attentive to our needs. I ordered the Elemental Genièvre, which was light, crisp and refreshing. Erick ordered the Vieux Carre, which was incredibly smooth. We were both pleased.Atmosphere was chic and sophisticated. Music selection was a blend of genres (including indie-pop!). Set a relaxed vibe on a Friday night. Decor was modern and elegant. Tables were adorned with white linens, and tree artwork covered the walls.Unfortunately, table flow was behind and we were not seated until 9:30pm. Understandable, considering the relaxed and welcoming ambiance.For entrees, I ordered the Lobster Brindille, Sugar Snap Peas, Young Turnips, Knob Onions, Greens, Pink Grapefruit, Coral Butter and Vanilla. Loved. Erick ordered the Rib of Beef, Tarte Tatin of Shaved Artichokes, Potatoes and Tomme de Savoie, Marbled Olive Oil, Sauce Bearnaise and Red Wine.Although we were already quite full, we decided to order dessert. L&#39;Oeuf a la Neige, Strawberries, Rhubarb, Chardonnay Vinegar Crème Anglaise and the Fantaisie au Chocolat were presented beautifully. Brindille went above and beyond by writing &#34;Happy Anniversary&#34; in chocolate on both plates. While presented well, both left a little to be desired in comparison to the rest of the meal. However, our server provided both to us complimentary on behalf of Brindille to offset the late seating and to cap off our anniversary. What a wonderful surprise!All in all, I recommend. Thank you, Brindille."

The staff made sure that we had what we needed even before we knew we needed them and took care in escorting us to where ever we needed to be.  The end result being that it felt like they valued our business which is so critical today!And like a good restaurant should- they took my valet ticket and found the valet so that my car was waiting out front as I said my goodbyes.All in all a lovely evening out made even better by some terrific food, great friends and staff who care.  You can bet I will be back."

They also tuck the table in for you if you sit in a wall weat. The service was perfect, probably the best service from a restaurant I&#39;ve ever experienced. I went with a group of three and one person in our party came quite long after the reservation time because she late from a meeting. The staff was really accommodating as the two of us kind of awkwardly waited at the table for almost an hour. They checked in on us throughout the night at the most appropriate times, not too much, not too little. A small odd detail but I enjoyed how the they explained to us what was in the dish as they served it. I could rave about the food but the menu itself isn&#39;t that extensive and other reviewers have already praised the steak enough! The snail was incredibly delicious too.

Just superb execution on nouveau French.The veal sweetbreads (appetizer) and dover sole (entree) are worth a repeat visit. And I liked the selection on the wine menu - though pricey (you&#39;ll be hard pressed to find a bottle under $130).Deserts are very good - adding the right finishing touch without overwhelming.

It was definitely a little on the pricey side for what I spend on dinner but we treated ourselves and it was definitely delicious. We started with the veal sweetbreads and steak tartare for our appetizers. The veal sweetbread was very good and it was my first time having rabbit! My friends had most of the steak tartare as that&#39;s not really my thing but I did try a bit and it was surprisingly yummy.For my main course I had the Rib of Beef (the 2nd priciest thing on the menu) but I wouldn&#39;t have traded it for anything! It was so good and a really good sized portion as well.We had to do dessert of course and I had the Fantaisie au Chocolat because I am a chocolate fiend. Once again, did not disappoint!It was a very enjoyable dining experience, just a little on the pricey side. Great for special occassions!"

This review is really a 3.5. Why only 3.5 stars? While everything was good, considering the price point, I wasn&#39;t significantly moved by anything except the Duck Breast / Foie Gras dish, and one or two of the side vegetables.I&#39;m big on ambiance, and the ambiance and set up here was fantastic. To describe Brindille in one word: Gentle. The light plays well in the space as it peers in through the large front windows, but trickles off by the time you are at the back of the room, so there&#39;s a blend of &#39;evening ambiance&#39; for everyone. The space is beautiful from the lightbox lighting, to the quiet artwork, multi-point lighting, down to the silverware. As for dress code, I would recommend wearing a formal jacket, or at least a well-kept dress shirt.Service was pretty much impeccable: attentive but uninvasive so as to keep the experience intimate to the guests ... just like any good French service should be. Our server recommended their sazerac, a favorite of mine, and I was not disappointed! One mystery to us was that while it was hard to get reservations, 65% of the restaurant was empty for the entire 2 hours that we were there.We shared these dishes:- Frog Legs, Blanc-manger of Cauliflower and Parsley, Ramps, Hazelnuts and Green Garlic- King Crab Merus, Tapioca Custard, Spring Pea, Cucumber, Pink Grapefruit, and Sauternes- Tranche of Duck Breast, Foie Gras and Wheat Berries, Young Carrots and Turnips, Watercress and Candied Orange Peel- Monkfish Tail, Burgundy Snails, Gem Romaine, Yellow Beans, Flageolets and CorianderOverall the entire meal was delish, but I felt the frog legs and monkfish in particular could have used a bit stronger seasoning. Don&#39;t get me wrong, they were both cooked perfectly, plated beautifully etc. but it was a bit plain on taste. Some find this to be the case on certain sister-restaurant Naha&#39;s dishes, so I&#39;m not particularly surprised. Maybe that&#39;s just their philosophy and they feel any further seasoning would interfere with allowing the prime-quality ingredients to shine? Though I personally feel it would enhance, if anything.The King Crab was great, and all side vegetables of all dishes were really tasty! The dish that continues to shine in my mind was the Duck/Foie Gras dish. It was just so decadent! The foie gras melts like butter. It was such a rich dish I had to take little breaks to cleanse my palette and just reflect on the meaning of life, haha. The duck breast was cooked just right, and quite tasty, though honestly if I wasn&#39;t sharing it, I would have gotten bored with it ... it too could have used a bit more flavor.All in all, a great experience, and a great intimate Sunday evening dinner. They even surprised us and wrote my name on a special birthday dessert in chocolate syrup."

We dine at many Chicagoland restaurants including very upscale places. While the atmosphere and decor where lovely , the food was disappointing. It is OVERPRICED. The portions were VERY small -primarily in the appetizer category. The menu shows two coarses but I recommend that you order two and either a salad to share or a third. The food all came at room temperature at best. I have dined in France and other restaurants at this same price point and never had this odd temperature. Some things seemed less appealing at this temperature while others it worked well. The desserts range from $12-15. When I say small, I mean small. Don&#39;t share if you have your heart set on what you order. Unfortunately, I would recommend other 4 star restaurants in Chicago before this."

Our server Sophie was knowledgable and she and the rest of the staff were attentive and kind. The space is modern, yet comfortable.So why only 4 stars? The gent who greeted us at the door was frenetic and almost rude. In addition, there was a couple at a nearby table watching the Blackhawks game on their phone throughout dinner and commenting loudly. The same gent stopped by the table frequently and encouraged this disruptive behavior. I&#39;m as excited for the Hawks as the next Chicagoan but wanted to have a nice meal out, not go to a sports bar. Turns out the gent was the GM- totally unacceptable.I would recommend Brindelle. We eat out often and don&#39;t mind spending the money for thoughtful food and a great experience but sadly, the actions of the GM and some disruptive guests soured our experience from great to just good."

All I can say is, this restaurant is sublime. Yes it is a splurge, an utterly satisfying dining and ambiance experience worth every penny. I will definitely return.We started with the Jeanne D&#39;arc and Boisson Adulte cocktails, oysters for me and scallops for my friend. The oysters were beautifully presented in a beautiful (and I&#39;m guessing custom-made) platter, perfectly dressed in crème fraiche and caviar. The scallops were huge and meaty with a divine emulsion and uni custard. Our entrees were Dover sole and lobster. The sole was perfectly cooked with a scrumptious touch of delicate brown butter, with crisp potatoes rissole. The lobster was phenomenal, with an unbelievably flavorful stock sauce. We finished with the cheese course and the chocolate fantasy; both were extraordinary the cheese wonderfully presented in a clock formation from lightest to strongest flavors with quince jam accompaniment, and the chocolate fantasy was both rich and light, with an airy foam that complimented the dense chocolate mousse. Al of the dishes were very clean tasting, nothing cloying or overly rich, and pleasantly confounded my expectations of french food.Our server was wonderful, just the right amount of attention, and she provided explanations of the dishes which really added a lot to the experience. We felt very cared for by our server when she steered us away from the cherry clafouti we wanted for dessert so we could make our show&#39;s curtain. She even asked if I wanted to finish the black current pearls in my (drained) cocktail glass.The space is beautifully and cleanly appointed, not at all stuffy, and is very quiet (hallelujah). A truly wonderful experience all around."

The flamboyant manager started arguing with us and calling me the boy friend of my wife of 10 years.  He started insulting me, that I had a t-shirt on, instead of apologizing for the bad food.

Went to Brindille; admittedly high expectations given the great food and service at Naha! Had a drink at the bar while waiting for my friends -- had a gin cocktail wth currant caviar, which was strong and delicious! Started dinner with the oysters -- these were beautiful, delicate, delicious. Would order again in a heartbeat!Ordered the crab and the duck for main course; this is where the problems started. It took a long (long!) time for the entrees to come out; when they finally came to us, my duck, while perfectly medium-rare, was cold. I really really don&#39;t like cold meat, and that hadn&#39;t been mentioned in the menu, so I asked if it was meant to be served cold. The answer was no, so I requested that it could be fixed and heated appropriately. What a shame, because it was so beautifully prepared. My friends ordered lobster -- that, while tasty, was also borderline cold, which led us to believe that these had possibly been prepared correctly and then sat out for a while. My duck was then returned to me -- now overcooked. :( They did ask me how it was; I didn&#39;t want to complain again so I said it was OK. (yes, yes I know I could have complained again, but there&#39;s only so much complaining one can do in a restaurant). I appreciate that not everything is always perfect, but at close to $40/entree they need to be able to execute and coordinate well. (without putting the onus on the diner to be the &#34;complainer&#34;; I am not sure how my request was presented to the kitchen, but any chef would think that what was sent back out to me the second time was overcooked.) To the server&#39;s credit, he did &#34;top off&#34; my wine since it was almost drained during all the waiting for the dish!Dessert was divine; we tried the clafoutis, the chocolate fantasy, and the Paris-Brest wheel pastry (wow!) Food is top-notch; service needs some work for coordination. Not sure if I&#39;m going to return; they need to work out the kinks first."

The space is lovely. Understated, grays, browns, blacks.  Very large window up front, comfy booths and chairs.  Lavender sweaters on the staff. The service was so spot on.  Witty, charming, knowledgeable and efficient. Rob was a star!  The appetizers were excellent. The hand cut noodles, chanterelles and snails for me---a heavenly dream appetizer!  For him: the scallops.  Also superb, much lighter and beautifully executed with the unique addition of uni.  Mains: Lobster for me, duck for him.  Here is where a minor slip occurred. The food was very very good. The lobster was plentiful and accompanied by truly amazing flavors. The duck and foie gras were beautifully cooked (absolutely perfect char on the foie).  The slip was that both plates (meaning china) and the food were not hot.  In fact, they were below lukewarm.  Can&#39;t figure out what happened.  The place was not busy. Our waiter seemed very efficient.  The food just wasn&#39;t the right temperature.  So, a little point shaving for that.  The second issue was two gnats that were hovering around the table (made more noticeable by the impeccable white table cloth-love the beautiful gray napkins, by the way).  Gnats in a restaurant, especially one of this caliber, are troubling to me.  Had to keep shooing them from my wine glass.  Wine?? Ah, yes, wine.  Back to the positives.  The wines, while expensive are really well thought out and quite good. And the staff is very very good at recommendations and their are some unique finds on both the bottle and by the glass lists. The pairings were perfect. Whites for me, white and red for him.  Terrific choices by Rob.  Champagne by the glass a bit pricey.  OK, dessert.  Dessert is something I sometimes enjoy and other times can pass on.  I am SO glad we didn&#39;t pass.  The Warm Baked Cherry &amp; Almond Clafoutis IS NOT TO BE MISSED!  It is light, airy, deliciousness.  If the plate hadn&#39;t been so hot (funny, I know) we would have licked it.  Truly amazing! I will be back here.  Next time I really want to have the Dover Sole Meunière, one of my favorite dishes.  And TWO of the Clafoutis!!!!"

Having seen the review on Steve Delinskys dining spot 4 of us tried this place. We all love to dine out at fine dining establishments and hope to incorporate new ones. This place was beyond insulting. We tried to order bloody marys and were told at 5:30 they were out of them. The frisee salad was just that, a small bowl of frisee with almost no dressing, we had to ask for extra dressing as we could not taste any at all.No artistry or specialness at all. Check out their prices  on the salad for what you get. It&#34;s obscene. We then tried to order their TV reviewed Dover Sole and were told they no longer carried it. We finally settled on the turbot and the very, very overpriced portion (less then 4 ounces and slightly bigger then a matchbook ) arrived.There was one asparaus spear cut up in there and a 1 inch smear of some potato mixture. I feel like if they try to present themselves as &#34;chic&#34; they assume Chicagoian&#39;s will be dumb enough to pay astronomical prices for less then 4 oz. of protien. The taste was average , definitley not gourmet enough to charge so outrageously. For dessert we tried the grilled pinapple . What a joke. It did not taste grilled and consisted of a 3 inch narrow spear with a 11/2 inch half spear over it .We had a strawberry dessert as well and the strawberries were soggy and drenched in some watery , sugary sauce over a cookie size puff pastry. Inedible. Do they really think the diners are that foolish to pay in the teens of dollars for that?*****Our bill with no alcohol at all, 1 diet coke and one dessert for four people $260 without the tip! People may be interested enough to try this place once but positiveley not foolish enough to go back.We were laughing so hard aftewords because we were all starving, so we stopped off at Portillos down the street and got Italian Beef sandwhiches.

The French fries I&#39;m not a big fan of but when you want some salt on your palate they do the job.All in all, unless they change their service I&#39;ll keep coming back!! I do however wish they would add more daily specials to the menu, it&#39;ll def help drive more traffic.See ya soon &#39;Ogden"

There were +/-8 of us and he gladly split the check (just tell the server in advance of ordering) which was helpful. I had the crispy chicken salad and substituted the fried chicken for grilled.

Each time i have had a good experience. My review is based on last nights (September 17th) for the Canelo VS Smith fight. My bf and i were able to find tickets online for 2 seats at the bar for $25 each. We showed up a few minutes after 8 so it was pretty dead. As the night went on more people showed up but not packed. I have been in where it has gotten pretty packed. I usually only go for fight nights. We ate there and also drank. Service has been great in all 3 experiences but this last time it was excellent. Our bartender was excellent!  The place and atmosphere is also great. Im not picky in decor although i prefer something nicer and as far as atmosphere im big on vibes and picky on music and the crowds. I always see a bit of everything which i really like. The food pricing isn&#39;t bad or drinks nothing too cheap but also not ridiculous priced. Food tasted great and so did the drinks. This is one of my go to places to watch the fight as they have plenty of tv&#39;s &amp; everything i like.

What started out &#34;find a place near the United Center before the Madonna concert&#34; turned into We love this place!With my girl crew for Madonna concert #5, for me. This restaurant really catered to the crowd, the glasses of Chardonnay were flying out of there like lies out of Carly Fiorina&#39;s mouth. Madonna music filled the air. It was a total CHICK PARTY!What I had to drink, though, was infinitely more delicious than any pedestrian glass of Chardonnay. Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with pedestrians. I was the first to arrive, and hit the bar to wait.I then discovered the Cucumber Chill, the most delicious cocktail known to Woman. Effen Cucumber Vodka, orange liquor, freshly squeezed lime juice, simple syrup, club soda, muddled fresh cucumber and a dash of Tajín Clássico seasoning - in other words, refreshment perfection. I understand this is a house-made cocktail, and I wanted gallons of it. Gallons, I tell you! However, that might have made the concert a bit of a blur, so I was happy with two of them. And I want one RIGHT NOW! It was spendy at $12, but wow. The flavor!The women at the bar are friendly, attentive, efficient - just great!THEN, time to get a table. I ordered the Brussel Sprout salad, which has carrots, bacon (BACON), dried cranberries, parmesan, champagne vinaigrette. In a word? This salad is CRAVEABLE, and craving it I am, two days later. Crunchy, cool, perfect dressing and absolutely delicious. Healthy as well, you say? Sign me right the eff up. Our server was great - friendly, attentive, informative. A real pleasure!My dining companions - two veggies - both had the black bean burger, which they enjoyed. A side salad - it was seriously enough beautiful, perfect greens and salad ingredients for two to share. I&#39;m okay with giant salads! Our fourth had one of the flatbread pizzas, also very good - thin crust, and a nice size portion for one - or two to share.Okay, Ima let you finish, but I&#39;m going to acknowledge the elephant in the room. Yes, it&#39;s a sports bar. It has MANY, MANY TVs. While it&#39;s true, that personally, I hate sports bars, this one is well done, and I&#39;d come back. Why? The food is  hella good. A small menu, but many things looked delicious. And CUCUMBER CHILLS TO DRINK!!!! The place doesn&#39;t have that frat boy douche vibe at all.It started out a &#34;find a joint near . . .&#34; but it&#39;s actually a &#34;let&#39;s go to . . .&#34; kinda place! Win!

Seems like fun, relaxing...maybe even find a place to stop at for all the games beforehand.  Nope.Bartender came to table first.  Bartender offers 50c wings as advertised/posted on Monday w/limitation of not applying 3 hours before uc events.  He takes our drink order.Its 3:40 for 7 pm &#39;event&#39; (i.e. bulls at uc).  I ask bartender about ordering wings at  3:45 and uptight waitress rushes over and refuses special - yells at bartender and condescendingly tells us she&#39;s the server.  No food special today according to her - its an event day!The place is empty...2/3 staff back in corner talking...apparently not about getting on same page.  I cannot imagine how screwed up they&#39;d be if it was busy.Walk into bathroom after brief meal and there&#39;s a sign advertising everything bartender originally told us. (Pic included)Confusing and awkward experience to spend $40 on 2 appetizers and 2 beers.  At least beers were $4.50 (thats half price since that was somehow permitted for happy hour).Don&#39;t trust postings or wait staff.  Go somewhere else if you want to unwind to watch a game."

They were playing Madonna&#39;s new album and pretty much everyone there was heading over to the concert (many of us ending up walking over there at the same time.)We enjoyed the food and service.

However, I&#39;m a stickler for customer service and good food, so if this place sucked, the proximity would not be enough to lure me back.That said, I love this bar. We&#39;ve got winners, we&#39;ve got losers (but not this year- official Hawks viewing bar!!)...seriously, the staff is super friendly- I&#39;ve only had an issue with crappy service at the bar once or twice from someone I no longer see anymore, so that speaks to the emphasis this place puts on good service. (Manager Sean is super cool- ask if he&#39;s around and say hi)The food is consistently good; however, I  would avoid the guacamole- it&#39;s definitely the kind that comes in a tub, which is a crime against humanity. The flatbreads are tasty (and on special Wednesday&#39;s) and the burgers are pretty good too. My favorite is the southwest salad with chicken. I had never had grilled lettuce before but WOW, it is damn good and the dressing has a sweet spicy kick to it.Drinks are a little pricey but you almost always get an overpour, so can&#39;t complain about that. Only reason I would avoid this place is if the Hawks are in the playoffs and you don&#39;t like huge crowds. The Ogden is THE bar to watch the game and it gets a little rowdy as the fair weather fans jump on the band wagon near the end of the season."

I got the ogden chicken sandwich, she got the cowboy burger, and we shared the animal fries.The animal fries are especially great for those of you who want some kick because of the giardiniera which also juices up at the bottom.The fries were just way too salty which made it get kinda gross halfway through. The pork and cheese curds made it really good though.The meat in the burger was delicious and cooked well BUT it was waaaayyyy too salty on the outside.The chicken sandwich was good but felt like it was missing something.The service was a little slow at one point towards the end but she was very nice and polite.In general it was a decent place.

It was a  night but the Bulls were on too so we watched them up until kickoff. They do 50cent wings(already a win) but what sets them apart is that it&#39;s not a 20-30min wait for a order (looking @ you Mr. Brown&#39;s lounge). We were a party of 6 and we had the best waitress Dominique. She kept alcohol glasses and the funky water pitchers full, she was attentive to all our needs &amp; she was easy on the ...ijs.  A dj spins during commercial breaks and @ halftime.

One of the better I&#39;ve had in town. It&#39;s a half pound Black Angus patty with 2 year old Wisconsin cheddar, caramelized onions, bacon jam mustard and served with lettuce, tomato, a pickle and side of fresh cut fries. Also awesome were the chicken wings which can be ordered in pairs 6 or 9.Overall I&#39;d say the atmosphere is pretty chill for being so close to the United Center, but there&#39;s definitely something nice about that when you&#39;re watching a game and gobbling down some amazing bar food."

Loved this place. The staff was very nice and the food was delicious. Definitely a new go to place when I&#39;m down in that area.
