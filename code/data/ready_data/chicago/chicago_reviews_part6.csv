The menu is large in breadth and thus has a multitude of options to satisfy your cravings. It may be intimating to face such a bevy of options, but speaking from experience the wait staff is readily available and able to aid you in making an informed choice based on your palette and preferences. During my visit, my friends and I dined on appetizers consisting of an amazing shrimp dish, nopalitos (cactus), a classic torta, enchiladas, and a burrito.

Don&#39;t forget to order one of their amazing well-priced and portioned margaritas, or beers to close out your experience."

Not your typical green or red enchiladas but instead covered in Oaxaquena mole was so delicious. A smaller than usual portion of rice and beans came with the entree. Which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. They almost got 3 stars because of their service. They ran out of horchata which is always a negative. A Mexican restaurant should never run out of horchata. And we never got a refill. A big no no. I would still come back and give them a second chance on their service but would still eat their very delicious food.

Food was delicious- we tried Tacos: Chorizzo(Tasted abit dry), Al pator(Had alot of flavor), Carne asada(Also had alot of flavor in 2 thin cuts of steak rather than diced up) and Taco Oaxaqueño(Is an interesting carne asada taco to try loaded with rice, beans, i think also pico de gallo) all were with onion, cilantro on flour wrap!

I bet they put one bushel (do limes even come in bushels?!) in EACH MARGARITA. They are so delicious. Also, at $6.00 each, well priced.

The food? Authentic! I have only tried the tacos, but I will tell ya, extra stars for the chorizo. It must be homemade and some of the least greasy chorizo I have encountered (except for soy-rizo but that stuff&#39;s fake!).

I&#39;ve tried the chicken and carne asada tacos and they are solid - farely typical Mexican fare.  My old co-worker sung high praises for the Sopa Azteca (Chicken Tortilla Soup), and the broth is truly packed with incredible flavor!  The soup has generously shredded chicken, carrots, onions, rice, cilantro, cheese and tortilla strips and makes a hearty meal by itself.  Being a soup lover, I&#39;ve ordered it almost every time.

We started with the quesadilla gringas--basically a cheese quesadilla topped with ham and red onions--it was mighty good. 

My husband had the mixed fajita plate--steak and shrimp. Pleasantly surprised that they didn&#39;t skimp on the shrimp.  Good serving size. Good flavor. Big enough service size that he had leftovers. 

I ordered the enchiladas mixtecas with salsa verde--3 enchiladas, chicken, steak and cheese. The enchiladas were tiny. The chicken and steak were ok, a little bland. The best was the cheese.  The green salsa was tangy, but there was a sourness to the dish that didn&#39;t appeal to me, I think it was the cheese that topped the dish. It wasn&#39;t queso fresco or cotija, just an odd tasting cheese? I didn&#39;t get sick afterward so I dont think it was bad cheese, just an odd cheese I guess.

We were feeling blah on a Friday night, and just weren&#39;t interesting in going out to dinner at our usual places.  We wanted to try something new, and it had to have margaritas.  Thank you YELP! and fellow reviewers for helping us discover this place less than two miles from our house.

The staff was very friendly when we arrived (the two women who waited on us were exceptional at their jobs and made it a joy to dine here), got us seated and got us chips with three different salsas right away.  The dark salsa option was hot and magnificent.  It&#39;s a blackened color because they roasted the jalapeños before making them into salsa.  Fantastic!

La Oaxaqueña has two menus in one.  It has the sandwiches and quick eats that are priced under $10, and it has more substantial meals that are in the $11-30 range.  

We went with the lighter fare.  The rest of the family all had sopes, or soft and thick flat tortillas with meat spread on top of them along with beans, lettuce, tomato, cheese and sour cream.  The kids had them with steak and chorizo, my wife had them as vegetarian sopes.  All three devoured their meals and cleaned their plates with smiles on their faces.    

I went with a sandwich, one of the Super Tortas, having the Torta Huatulco con cesina, chorizo y cebollas.  It was large enough to be a meal, GREAT, and curiously delicious, though I wish I would have left the tomatoes off (my mistake not to ask) and doubled the avocado on it.  For my second half I put some of the above mentioned salsa on it, and it was even tastier.  

And yes, the margaritas.  They are always better when someone else makes them for you!  They were tart and delicious.  We had more than one each.  They aren&#39;t huge, and are reasonably priced, the perfect size for having with a lighter fare dinner such as we had.

I can&#39;t wait to go back to this place and try it again, more sopes or tacos or tortas.  Also would love to try several of the full dinner dishes.  Wonderful find, very happy place, and I would say one of the better authentic Mexican places I have ever discovered in Chicago.  A real treat to which we will return."

However, I&#39;d never eaten mole so I had no idea what to expect. Even though I was not a huge fan of the mole I will be the first to say that considering how many Yelpers rave about it I think it&#39;s safe to say the problem was more on my end than the restaurants.

I think it was while reading this restaurants reviews on Yelp that I read a comment that said something about don&#39;t be &#34;that guy&#34; that orders anything that has a name you might find on a Mexican fast food restaurants menu.  Like a dummy I was &#34;that guy&#34;.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce that came with sides of rice and re fried beans.  Although my personal tastes weren&#39;t super thrilled with the mole the enchiladas were filled very full of shredded chicken and both the rice and re fried beans were good.  I also enjoyed the complimentary chips and salsa Verde and negra that came with the chips.

The reason I&#39;m giving this restaurant a 4 star rating instead of a 3 star rating is for 2 reasons.  First and most importantly my server was very attentive to making sure my needs were met and she was very happy to answer questions from a guy who really was not at all familiar with the menu items.  The other reason was although the restaurant is a little on the small side it is decorated very nice and instead of feeling crowded it felt cozy and relaxing.

I will return at some point in the future and will not be &#34;that guy&#34; again.  Next time I will go outside my comfort zone and try the fish.  To be truthful the pictures of it don&#39;t look all that appetizing, but I moved to Chicago to try new foods and that will certainly be a dish I wouldn&#39;t be likely to find in Michigan where I moved from.

Even though I couldn&#39;t give this restaurant it&#39;s 5th star that it probably deserves and it was probably just my unrefined taste buds that made me not as happy as most people I would definitely encourage others to try it out.  I&#39;m looking forward to returning and hopefully being able to give the food a solid 4 or 5 star rating."

The food was just as good this time as last. This time I had the enchiladas with mole sauce. I just love the mole here so much. I also had a few margaritas. (It was a holiday after all! ) They were good, but not as yummy as the ones at Taxco, but Taxco is long gone. I am quite content with the ones they serve here.

Christopher had the carne asada and polished off the entire plate. Ok, he actually left the plate intact, but ate all the food. Geesh! LOL

Everything, including my side of grilled nopales was mighty tasty. It is a bit pricier than a typical taco joint, but this is not a typical taco joint. At this point I think of it as a 4 1/2 star place, but I&#39;m giving them 5 stars because their mole sauce makes me so happy.

The service was fine and the atmosphere is very friendly. The parking in this area sucks, but that&#39;s life in the big city. Still, it is well worth making a trip to La Oaxaquena. Come for the mole, stay for the rest."

Well to start off let me recommend you NOT GO during peak hours like weekends and Friday night. I&#39;ve been here before and the food is good the tortas are great but the service is VERY SLOW! So if you&#39;re starving this is not the place to go. I just visited last weekend and I had to walk out. My family and I sat down and 10 minutes later the waitress came to give us menus , another 10 minutes went by until the waitress took our order, another 10 minutes had gone by and she still had not brought us our drinks ( she instead serviced customers who has arrived after we did ) on top of that the owner just sat there knowing they were busy and didn&#39;t bother to assist at least to as part of customer service. Honestly I would never go back ! The owner didn&#39;t even try to convince or apologize for such a delay , I mean he must be ok with letting money go out the door like we did. I mean if you know that you will be busy why don&#39;t you hire someone to help or get up be useful and help. And note , I wasn&#39;t the only one who walked out of that place dissatisfied."

My other two friends ordered chilaquiles and that took 50 mins of waiting to get our order.

First let me start off that you get 3 salsa&#39;s when you sit down. All 3 are made in house homemade and each has it&#39;s own taste. One is dark and smoky (hot spicy) the other is green verde and spicy warm, and the last more of a traditional salsa and mild but delicious.

Wait staff were nice and quick.

I ordered a Steak Burrito, and my wife ordered enchiladas. Both were excellent. Pop was by the can, but reasonable $1.

I was worried because it was late and employees are tire and don&#39;t give 100% on their job. We found that La Oaxaqueña was about 3 miles south for the theater and opens till 11 PM. My wife and I invited her 2 sisters to try their mole specialty. We had 2 orders of Chicken Echiladas Oaxaqueñas, Carne Azada Oaxaqueña (all served in mole sauce), and 2 tacos of Al Pastor, a soda, a Jamaica water, and plain water.

It is hard to describe the delicious flavor of all the food, even the salsas and chips that preceded the meals were fantastic (we asked for second on the salsa). We have been there several times and never been disappointed when we tried different items of their menu. They just need to work on their customer service; the waitresses do their job but need a little more personal touch. Probably I&#39;m asking too much, I should be content with a great food."

A group of us went on over there for a late lunch one weekend and  had a lovely time.  I got to try the cactus, which I&#39;d never had, and had a taco trifecta of fish, asada and pastor, all of which were really tasty.  The guacamole and horchata, two of my go-to dishes for new Mexican places, were also really well done.

There was also some hilarity with spilled beer and water, but don&#39;t go expecting a floor show; we were just lucky.

The only quibble I have -- and it&#39;s not the fault of the restaurant so no stars off for this -- is that parking in the area is horrible.  The restaurant is on a busy street and all the residential streets in the surrounding area are permit parking only.  Just be aware of that when you try to park your car.

They had a gentle but filling quality about them, and the variety of ingredients created a nice stratification of flavors, textures, and crunchiness.

As for the tacos, I&#39;m not sure if they made them differently because we three were serious gringos, but the amount of cilantro was very low and hard for me, at least, to detect. There was much more onion than anything else going on, and I find this interesting. La Oaxaquena seems to buck the practice of adding a ton of cilantro instead relying on the flavors of the meat in their tacos to do the work. It seems that their strategy worked for the most part.

Of the four tacos we had, the al pastor and chicken were pretty average for tacos. I really was not impressed with either, but they weren&#39;t bad. They just didn&#39;t wow me or catch my attention. I will say, however, that they o&#39;cesino and chorizo surprised me. The former had a nice texture and good flavor to it. It tasted like well-prepared meat with good, tangy flavor.

The chorizo was probably my favorite. It was perfectly seasoned. I enjoyed the slight spice and good amount of salt in the meat. They didn&#39;t overdo either. Because we had to split the tacos, the chorizo spilled a bit, but we were happy to garnish our other tacos and what was left of the sincronizadas with our newly-dubbed chorizo-bits. I will probably stick to these tacos in the future."

Their mole sauce is deep and smoky but not sweet.  The chicken enchiladas were well sauced and are definitely a big reason to go there.  The beans are solid but I was surprised that their rice had peas and seemed almost like a Chinese fried rice.  They provide 3 different salsas with a good range from green to roasted tomato to a pumpkin seed one.  They are relatively medium to hot.

Margaritas are always done right--not too sweet, not too tart and the perfect blend of booze and citrus.

And their breakfast is for champs...especially if you have that little bit of hangover that isn&#39;t quite bad enough to require horrific food (like Taco Bell).

The service is leisurely (some call it slow), but I rarely go out to eat just to slam food into my gullet and run. I like to enjoy it so leisurely is all good for me.

As soon as we entered I asked the woman if they accepted Visa gift cards. I was lousy with them after the holidays. They told me it was not a problem. The staff greeted us with a smile and seated us. 

Menus and glasses were brought to the table and while we scanned our options our lovely waitress delivered a basket of tortilla chips with two salsas, one good the other not so good, and a small assortment of carrots, cauliflower, and jalapenos. Perfect for putting into our torta and burrito. My friend ordered a chicken burrito and I ordered a steak torta both with everything. 

While waiting for our food we chatted a bit. I noticed that the place was beginning to fill. The waitress refilled our waters a couple of times and before we knew it our food had arrived. 

My torta was amazing! My steak was cut into manageable slabs as opposed to chopped up bits that I see at other places. The steak was hot and not at all tough to bite into. The onions were slightly cooked which didn&#39;t take away from the tasty steak. It was topped off with a healthy slice of tomato and some lettuce. I added my condiments as needed. The size of this torta is bigger than the average one you find at other places. My friend enjoyed his burrito. It was also pretty big. It was the perfect thing for two big hungry dudes.

Upon further examination, I really deserve two kicks in the head for every time I passed this place by. 

My wifey and I were trying to go to La Pasidita but they decided to close early that night so we were both in the mood for Mexican food so we went here. This place is relatively small and somewhat older but it was decorated nicely and clean and kept in good shape. Our server did a very good job taking care of us. 

We started out with the typical chips and salsa and they brought us out three different types of salsa. I tried all three and they were all very tasty and fresh. I ordered the mixed fajitas which consisted of steak, chicken and shrimp. I must say tat I made and excellent choice as these fajitas really blew me away. The onions and peppers had a nice crispness to them and the meat was cooked perfectly. The flavor combination was outstanding. The homemade rice pudding for dessert was also delicious.

This is my &#34;let me show you what is a 15 minute walk from my house&#34; &#34;aren&#39;t you sad you live in Portland/Berkeley/Lakeview and can&#39;t have this everyday&#34; show-off restaurant. Because if Chicago has restaurants this good hiding on Milwaukee between Belmont and Addison, then maybe it&#39;s the best food town in the country.

The salsa is a good harbinger of things to come. Three delicious varieties (although the spicy heat level varies every time I&#39;m there). The shrimp and octopi appetizers are good. The fish, especially the snapper, is delicious and terrifically priced. The nopales are a must-try; I love them with extra cebollitas, but careful with the jalapenos which are usually just hot and good, but once were taste bud killing hot. Thank you, God, for giving Mexico cacti so they could cook them like this.

If you&#39;re not sure, get the cesina, a tasty flattened piece of moderately tough beef marinated in citrus and oregano, then grilled. I promise you&#39;ll like it. Personally, my 3 faves are:

-Torta Tezoatlan: the menu reads cesina, nopales, and jalapeno. The sandwich comes on bread the size of a baby, filled with cesina, nopale, jalepeno, avocado, onion, beans, cheese, tomato. It might weigh 5 pounds. The Sopa Azteca is fine, but do not order it with a torta and have a hope of finishing everything.

-Conejo: Rabbit smothered in a red adobado sauce. Smoky, spicy, and rabbity. Lots of bones, but oh so taste.

-Godornis con mole Oaxaqueno: The dark mole everyone raves about with the enchiladas is even better over this little bird.

Service is good (patience with non-native English speakers helps), lots of Mexican beer choices, reasonable price (more for seafood, and beers add up), atmosphere is local and relaxed, they&#39;re open late, they take cards. Only negative: like most Mexican places, it&#39;s pretty paltry for vegetarians: cactus, beans, cheese, and not much else. 

Oh and guys, guys! They&#39;ll *deliver* to you! I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re range is, but they&#39;ve delivered tacos to my very door! A+"

I wasn&#39;t aware it was deepfried as it didn&#39;t say on my menu. The taste was fine but it sat in my stomach like a rock. The first time I ordered a dinner was steak with their mole sauce. Turned out to be just plain weird. Rice sucks too, mushy. Also ordered an al pastor taco, flavor was good yet it was super fatty- gross. I hope to give this place another shot."

A spur of the moment trip led us here and to the wonderful mole. Everything was on par with authenticity down to the cheese sprinkled on top of my enchiladas. 

It was kinda creepy being almost the only people in a place, but the service was good and the food was amazing. Can&#39;t vouch for anything but the mole, so if you go, that&#39;s the safe bet in my book.

Home made salsas?  Amazing.  

Am kind of broke today, so I just went with some steak tacos.

My brow furrowed when they came because the steak was thick.  Normally, this leads to stringy, tough, crappy tacos in my normal mexican food perusings.

THESE, however, were tenders, had a nice char, and great flavor.  Add some of that chunky dark smokey salsa on &#39;em with some lime, and it really was one of the greatest steak taco&#39;s i&#39;ve eaten lately.

Staff was uber-pleasant.  

Hell yes.  Must go back and try some regional dishes.  

Five stars like a mofo!"

Second, there was a part of it - and I didn&#39;t know how dominant that part might be - that wants to fatten me up. And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with it.

Twilightesque obsession aside, do you know what I love the most? Probably not, I don&#39;t know either, mmm I just love food -- but excellent Mexican is definitely high on the list. Out with my friend, who believes there is no better than his Mexican mama&#39;s food, we partook in the amazingness that is La Oaxaqueña yesterday. I already want to go back. Really REALLY badly.

After reading the Yelp reviews I was like &#39;horchata, heck yes!!&#39; -- and oh man, I agree that the horchata here is nectar of the gods... creamy and sweet and perfectly flavored and... guh, now I want some.

We had the sopes as an appetizer [the *only* issue was that we ordered chorizo and got chicken -- and we didn&#39;t say anything to correct it because the chicken looked amazing as well] and they were a delicious way to start off, along with the trio of salsas with the basket of chips. The salsa verde is my new lifeblood, I want it to pulse through my veins -- it&#39;s that good.

I had the carne asada Oaxaqueña, which came slathered with the best mole I have ever eaten in my life and cheese. Simple pleasures, because that + corn tortillas = Allie in food heaven. Yum. Friend had something slathered in a tomato sauce [enjitomatadas] that was also amazing... and he also said it was on par with his mom&#39;s cooking, which is about as high of praise as he gives.

We finished up with pastel de tres leche which was also awesome -- it was my first time experiencing it [we don&#39;t have a lot of legit Mexican in Seattle, imo] so I can&#39;t offer too much beyond &#34;I think I&#39;d put myself at risk of diabetes on a regular basis to consume this deliciousness.&#34;

Basically if I lived in Chicago... I bet I&#39;d be here once a week."

It was good, very tasty. If I&#39;d never been to Oaxaca, I would say it was some of the best Mexican food I&#39;ve ever had. Unfortunately, I had JUST been to Oaxaca, and I was slightly disappointed in the offerings. Some of my favorite things I had in Mexico (memelitas, tlayudas, and pozole) weren&#39;t on the menu here. BUT, that being said, it was still a definitely delicious meal.

The things that were ordered:

Sopes with beef - we shared this appetizer. They were okay, I&#39;m not sure I would order them again, but they were a solid offering.

Tacos - beef, chorizo. The chorizo tacos were soo good. The beef were alright, definitely overshadowed by the chorizo.

Chicken enchiladas with black mole - by far the best thing. The mole was most definitely on par with the ones I tasted in Oaxaca. Mmm mmm, this one was a favorite with all my dining companions.

Steak with nopales (cactus) and onions - this was also a repeat of a dish I had in Mexico. It was HUGE. The cactus here is prepared so well, grilled along with some onions and jalapenos. And also a great value, for 12 bucks I got an enormous steak that I didn&#39;t even come close to eating half of. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the beans that came with it, they were pinto and I personally prefer black beans (and also I didn&#39;t see one pinto bean the whole time I was in Oaxaca, so I was slightly sad when I received pinto beans).

The salsas that came out with chips at the beginning were also pretty fantastic.

Overall, it was a pretty great meal and will go on the list for my go-to Mexican restaurants. Once I&#39;ve been there a couple more times, I might even beg them to see if they could make a tlayuda (giant Oaxacan taco)."

well prepared, authentic Mexican at very reasonable prices, served by absolutely charming server, and very pleasant and appreciative owners who happened to thank us on the way out.  Top notch, and not a single bad thing to say!

Nicely decorated, and just plain comfortable, particularly for a restaurant offering such reasonable prices.  No raised voices trying to outdo the  volume of some &#34;over the bar&#34; TV set.  (I must be getting old, because a TV in a restaurant just pisses me off like I never thought it would.)

Encheladas Oaxaquena, topped in a deliciously smoky and complex mole sauce, was outstanding.  Ordered fish taco since that was the craving of the night and what led us here - absolutely the best I&#39;ve ever had, with the fish cooked to perfection, slightly charred, while remaining flaky, flavorful and moist.  Heavenly.

Nice selection of bottled Mexican beers, as well as tequilas.  When we go back, we&#39;ll definitely be trying the margaritas.  IF the margaritas are as good as tonight&#39;s food was, this place belongs on a &#34;best of the northwest&#34; listing.

You know you&#39;re in for a quality meal when the salsa trio comes out and does not disappoint. All three tasted amazingly fresh, homemade, and each packed a lot of individual flavor. I went with the Carne Asada Torta, and mi amiga had the Chicken Enchilada. Both spectacular. 
Tortas can vary, so sometimes I don&#39;t know quite what to expect... In the more common torta found in take out places and casual eateries you&#39;ll get shredded chihuahua cheese, a pile of shredded lettuce, finely chopped carne asada swimming in guacamole and sour cream on a super soft bolillo. Not here. This was a substantial SANDWICH. Perfect cuts of sliced carne asada just slightly charred, thinly sliced cheese, a cut of tomato, a cut of avocado, and a bit of red onion on lightly grilled bread with just the right amount of crunch. Delicious!

Torta Cubana - I can never go back to eating a plain old torta anymore. While I was moaning and groaning over this Torta, my fiance was discussing how we can divorce ourselves from our regular Taqueria b/c we found our new love.  

Whole snapper with seafood mix - wow wow wow. I thought Mariscos had the whole snapper thing down, but I was wrong.  This place was better. My whole snapper came LOADED with a mix of seafood on top (calamari, shrimp, mussels, squid...)  And the best part? The whole dish was only 19 bucks!!!

I didn&#39;t eat my dishes, I made love to it, it was that good.

me: chicken enchiladas in mole.  The mole was good, but the chicken inside was dry.

hubs: the combination plate: the steak was cooked to the consistency of shoe leather and was a brownish gray. The Oaxacan tamal was dry. The nopales were boring, they lacked any flavor/seasoning etc.

It was my fault completely, though, as I decided to go down the Stupid White People route and order a chicken burrito. Allow me to reiterate something a previous reviewer mentioned: DO NOT DO THAT. EVER. Absolutely do not order a burrito, taco or anything else that could be replicated at a Taco Bell, or you will be as sorely disappointed and confused as I was. This is not a place for standard Mexican fast food fare.

Realizing that we had erred terribly, my boyfriend and I decided that we had to go back and order exactly what La Oaxaqueña is known for this time: their entrees, especially those with the mole.

We began our Mexican feast with the usual: complimentary chips and salsa, horchatas and an appetizer (chorizo sopes).
- The chips were oddly cold and a bit overcooked, but the salsas that came with them were incredible. I especially liked the one with a creamy consistency and had succeeded in finishing off half the container before our sopes arrived.
- The sopes were tasty, albeit a little difficult to eat due to the fact they are basically small mountains of toppings. I&#39;m very picky when it comes to chorizo, so I was a little apprehensive about my choice of meat, but it was great! Flavorful, non-greasy and a bit crunchy, just how I like it.
- Fantastic horchatas, possibly the best I&#39;ve had to date. Very rich in flavor and a little creamier than any I&#39;ve had before.

So far, so good! Now all we had left was the grand finale: the Carne Asada Oaxaqueña, a giant slab of steak smothered in cheese and mole sauce, which we decided that we would split.

And oh. my. GOD it was amazing! The mole sauce really is the highlight of this place. It even seeped into the salad on the side and made for an awesome dressing! (Side note: I was rather impressed with the fact that their &#34;side salad&#34; was actually edible. This was the first time that I encountered a salad in a Mexican restaurant that didn&#39;t strictly function as a filler on the plate.) However, we were not asked how we&#39;d like our steak done and had it made well done by default. I didn&#39;t mind because I like my steak made anything upwards of medium, but if you don&#39;t I&#39;d suggest asking them to prepare it otherwise.

To end our meal, we went with some flan. Some damn good flan. The portion was a little larger than what I expected and it was an utter delight to eat -  it literally melts in your mouth the second it makes contact with your tongue!

Ah, how I chuckled at the naivette of the Stupid White People a few tables down that were ordering tacos... ;)

In conclusion: GO HERE, don&#39;t order a burrito, drink a horchata, GET SOMETHING WITH MOLE, mention how you&#39;d like your steak made and save some room for dessert.

Oh, and by the way, the damage? Just a smidge under $30, including tip. Words cannot express how freaking happy I am that this place is walking distance from my boyfriend&#39;s apartment."

I was down the street at my favorite mechanic and things were taking a bit longer than originally anticipated.  Hungry, I did what any good food hunter does and asked the boys in the shop where is their favorite local lunch spot.  Hands down the answer was La Oaxaqueña. 

A short walk later I arrived, ordered sopes with chorizo and two tacos al pastor.  The authenticity was off the charts (and my college Spanish was stretched to its limits by the waitress.) These were by far the best sopes I have had in Chicago and second only to the homemade ones my great-aunt prepares.  Light and fluffy without a hint of grease - something hard to do under typically circumstances and made only more difficult and impressive by the addition of chorizo.  The tacos were stellar and would outshine the Chicago hotspot of Big Star any day.

We had a great time and the sweet little owner acted as our host, waitress, and conversation starter.

The food is amazing. The tacos or anything with carne asada are great. The meat is seasoned to perfection and it&#39;s always so tender.

They made me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed for even asking about their food and ingredients, which is not good customer service...

Unfortunately though, they are wildly inconsistent. As a tip to the restaurant, please start measuring. I get the Kale and Brussels salad regularly, and it hasn&#39;t once been the same. The ratio of kale and Brussels sprout is always different. Sometimes my salad is loaded with cheese, bacon and almonds - other times I am digging to find any additional topping. The dressing is never the same either. I really love Blue Door, but I can&#39;t keep paying $12 if I don&#39;t know what to expect of my meal."

It is served warm and was hands down, the best salad I have had in a long time.  Absolutely delicious.

I don&#39;t even know where to begin with this review, but here goes nothing...

My friend lives not too far from here and since I had been dying for some real Mexican food, she suggested El Tapatio. We came inside and the place was surprisingly empty but we had our pick of seats, so that was nice. A few people came in and out, but the puny amount of guests meant we could enjoy our meal in peace. And that&#39;s exactly what we did. The server was so nice to us. She was also attentive. We needed lots of time to decided what to eat/drink but she didn&#39;t care. She just kept coming back to check on us. They had lots of TVs playing Telenovelas and it wasn&#39;t exactly what I&#39;d call quiet, but it was fine. For a gringa like me, it&#39;s pretty funny to sit there and listen to what they&#39;re saying, trying to decipher the Spanish.

We finally placed our order after having stuffed ourselves on fresh tortilla chips and spicy homemade salsa. They keep bringing them out to you pretty much once you sit down. Fairly standard at most places like this, but I thought I should make that clear you get complimentary chips and salsa with your meal. I ordered a veggie burrito dinner plate. My friend also ordered a burrito dinner and had one of the banana shakes. I went with a boring Diet Coke, but the shake was amazing. I&#39;ll definitely have that next time I come in!!! Don&#39;t make the mistake of getting the soda like I did, especially if you want the full Mexican dining experience. You can get soda anywhere, those shakes are just too yummy to pass up! 

The food came and the presentation was fantastic. The burrito dinners were GINORMOUS! A seriously massive burrito covered in sour cream (ours were fancy out of pastry frosting servers - see my pictures I added) served with rice, refried beans with cheese sprinkled on top and some fresh strips of lettuce, a few tomato and avocado slices. YUM! We chowed down and since my friend and I hadn&#39;t seen each other in a while, we would up staying for over 2 hours! As I said, the place wasn&#39;t busy and the waitress didn&#39;t care how long we stayed. So we gabbed away and she would periodically check on us. It couldn&#39;t have been nicer. It was like eating at home, except I could never make such yummy Mexican fare. 

Definitely will come back!!! Hopefully I will be able to give this place 5 stars the more places I go to."

The Waitstaff: Excellent, very friendly and goes out of their way to make sure you are happy with your dishes and your experience.

Service for Events: Needs improvement.  So for the rehearsal dinner when it really matters that everything finish on time before guests start arriving for our post -rehearsal dinner event with all wedding guests, we had the dessert being served at the time the event was supposed to be ending.  We had communicated that it was important for everything to be wrapped up on time and still that was not the case.  Other than this event, I have not had any issues with timing.  I think if you are not in a rush, you will not have any issues.  Honestly I would have given 5 stars if not for this issue.

Ambiance: excellent; it reminds me of a lot of restaurants in Tuscany.

Let&#39;s get to the food: Excellent (see dish details below)

The red pepper cream cheese dip served with the bread: Excellent.  I never eat bread but I will eat the bread here so that I can eat the dip.  That&#39;s how good it is.

Crab ravioli with curry oil/quinoa - hands down my favorite dish for bringing creativity, fresh homemade pasta taste and each bite was heavenly.  

Shrimp spaghetti - quality, solid dish.  Even had some kick, which I appreciated.

Arctic char - cooked perfectly with the right amount of crisp.

Warm chocolate cake - every time I have had this, it has been heavenly and decadent.  Can never go wrong with this."

The wait staff is super attentive. To start there was good French bread and a nice caesar salad with slices of parmigiano reggiano on top. This was followed by farfalle with duck confit. It was a generous portion I couldn&#39;t finish even though I tried! For dessert I enjoyed the ice cream in the profiteroles but not the pastry crust. On the whole I found the the food to be more refined than robust, very decent and made with good quality ingredients.

My dinner here was at a 30 person event held in a private room. I liked how well the event was run--the food and drink didn&#39;t interrupt the speeches, and the speeches didn&#39;t interrupt the meal. The wait staff knew when to be present and when to be absent. Plus everything ended on time, and those who wanted to linger were allowed to linger. I can see why so many people eat here before the theater--you will be out in plenty of time.  You won&#39;t miss your show! This is a very professional operation. They know what they are doing and they do it well."

I&#39;ll have to admit that the biggest driver for coming here was because of the generous birthday coupon sent to my email (up to $40 off lunch or dinner). You can even use it during Restaurant Week!! You just have to go on their website and sign up for their email and enter your birthday.

I was conflicted on what to order and was scanning my surrounding environment to see what the dishes looked like for Restaurant Week when lo and behold I spotted a large table of about eight people with various dishes from the Restaurant Week menu. It seemed like people were predominantly ordering the House Made Herb Pappardelle. I wanted to see what the whitefish entree looked like and spotted a guy nearby with it. I saw the crispy onions and what looked like to be a pile of white, textured goo. At first, I thought I was looking at the whitefish with my poor eyesight but my boyfriend oh so lovingly put it, &#34;Babe, you&#39;re looking at the risotto.&#34; (I continue staring.) &#34;That&#39;s the risotto. You&#39;re staring at the risotto. The whitefish is gone. He ate it already.&#34; Thanks, honey, thanks. -___-

We were given complimentary bread with a cheese dip that I skipped on but my boyfriend loved. It took all my might not to devour the entire loaf of bread and ask for more and then being too full for the rest of lunch. Self-control. *brushes dirt off shoulder*

First Course - House Made Minestrone: This was subpar. It perhaps could have used a little more salt. I would recommend ordering a different appetizer.

Second Course - House Made Herb Pappardelle: I can see why more people ordered this dish. It was incredibly delicious with the perfect texture for the noodles. Everything just complemented each other in the dish.

Third Course - Profiteroles: Despite the waiter telling me how to pronounce it after I asked, I still couldn&#39;t pronounce it. The profiteroles were good though! They had more vanilla ice cream than I wanted -- I&#39;m a chocolate person -- but still a decent dessert. The presentation was awesome!

The service was spot-on. Our server was friendly and attentive.

This meal was an amazing value when factoring the coupon! I would still recommend it without the coupon, but just order a different appetizer than the minestrone soup."

My sister and I came in for lunch on March 23, 2015 without a reservation. The manager (I think he has a disability too because walked with a limp) was so nice to us and gave us a table right away, although it was packed, making space for my wheelchair without being asked. I still appreciate how nice and accommodating he was that day. 

The food was amazing. Our waiter forget about us, so the manager gave us complimentary butternut squash ravioli. It was amazing, sweet but not too sweet. The scallops we ordered were delicious, cooked just right. Even the bread was heavenly. 

The restrooms aren&#39;t accessible. I couldn&#39;t get my wheelchair in the main restroom door, so I walked in. 

Location is hidden. It&#39;s downstairs but there is an elevator.

We went again for lunch recently. Butternut squash ravioli and bread weren&#39;t as good as the first time, but the monk fish was divine... A bit sour, probably from the lemon to prevent fishiness, but it was not too sour. The monk fish came with mixed vegetables, which was also great."

We had a reservation for 5:15, but half of the party was running late due to traffic. The hostesses were very accommodating and allowed my husband and our friend to be seated without us and start ordering food. We arrived about 5:45. The two that beat us there had already discussed timing with the waiter and he was on board with getting us out by 7:10. 

Our waiter was knowledgeable about the wine list and how the chef and bartender selected each wine. We went with a nice dry, white blend. He was also very patient with one in our party who has a severe dairy allergy. 

We got the mussels for an appetizer to share. It had about 30 mussels which was the perfect size for 5 people. You are also given bread with a wonderful spread of some kind. 

Everyone seemed to really enjoy their meals. My husband and both got the Orecchiette pasta. I thought it was very good, but I would have liked some more flavor in the sausage as well as cracked pepper that was never offered to us, but was offered to other tables. We used the table pepper which was hard to get out... 

Others in our party had the Farfalle, Herb Pappardelle, Butternut and Acorn Squash Ravioli, and the quail. 

We all enjoyed dessert. I was a bit disappointed in mine. I got the cheesecake, which was very good, but was minuscule in size compared to the cake, tiramisu and gelato/sorbeto servings that others got.

Overall, it was a very good meal and I could see us coming back again. Note, that the portions here are not the standard Italian American portions, but are much more modest in size. We all were sufficiently full by the end of our meal with no leftovers! We spent around 115 dollars for myself and my husband after splitting up the check accordingly. I felt like the service and food was well worth the price."

Our waiter David was the best waiter we&#39;ve had in a long time. His recommendations were spot on. He even have us some spots to hit later that night since we were celebrating our anniversary.

We were an hour early for our reservation but no problem! 

The tables were spacious and not close to each other. They had a great menu and unhurried service.

I had a superb cheese plate to start and a great iced tea. I followed that with a half order of lobster ravioli and a half of sausage.  It was all exquisite. 

To end our elegant meal I had a cappuccino and a lemon blueberry Panna cotta.

It was the best service we have ever had on New Year&#39;s eve. I find that usually you are rushed so they can flip the table. Not here, we were treated like royalty. 

We recommended the restaurant to two other couples who were seeing the same play and they loved it as well.

Beautiful indeed!"

The first time we visited Trattoria No. 10, my father was visiting from out of town and we grabbed a bite to eat before heading to a show. We let our waiter know what time the show started and he insured our food and drinks came out in a timely matter, which was one less worry for us. 

We were so blown away with how amazing every dish we had was, when he came in town again we knew Trattoria was a must go. When making the reservation I included it was my dad&#39;s birthday and anything special they could do for him would be amazing! 

Again, the service was absolutely amazing and our server, Steven, was very personable and helped us pick our dinner dishes when we were very indecisive. My father made a point to let Steven know how much we love everything about the restaurant, which he then let his manager know who came up to the table to talk with us as well. It was a very professional touch and we were happy to praise not only Steven, but the consistent amazing service and food of the restaurant.

To top everything off, they surprised my dad with a piece of their delicious Tiramisu with a candle and &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; written in chocolate sauce. 

We couldn&#39;t ask for a better dinning experience!!"

Drinks were awesome. Do get &#34;The Tiki&#34;. Shout out to the bartener.. this thing was epic

Portions...dear god... so less. I understand that it&#39;s a fine dining place, but whoa, they give you some seriously LOWWWWWWW portion. 7 finger sized raviolis for 25 bucks for so. Plus it&#39;s quite salty. Did I mention that the quantities are ant sized already? 

Wasn&#39;t impressed with the bread as well. It was hard, cold and dry.

Skip this place and try another fine dining place around this area. But.... if you want to go out on a date somewhere, then this place would be great, since the atmosphere is perfect for that."

The food was very good, no complaints at all. I love swordfish and this place did it right. The lobster bisque was very good as well.

It&#39;s very convenient to all the theaters in the loop. They also have a very nice loyalty program. I signed up the first time we went, and got a $10 certificate. I also got a $40 &#34;gift&#34; for a birthday meal. Sweet deal!

Hubby and I both loved our entrees the second time. He had the pork tenderloin, and I had the salmon. Both were nice and flavorful and moist as well. We both had the minestrone soup. It was very good and came with a crisp grilled slice of french bread.

They also gave me a birthday dessert. It was tiramisu with a chocolate covered strawberry. I don&#39;t like tiramisu, but for those of you that do, it was a good rendition. I took a bite and ate the strawberry. 

The first time we went, I had the polenta appetizer and grilled calamari salad for my meal. Hubby had a pasta. The polenta was excellent. The calamari salad had small rings that just didn&#39;t seem substantial enough. It wasn&#39;t a bad dish, but I think they have so many good items that I will not get it again. Hubby thought his pasta was good that night too. We also shared the cheese plate. It was good. You can see pics of all of these.

We started with the stuffed calamari. It was delicious. I&#39;ve never combined prosciutto and little squid before, but it&#39;s a great - if salty - combo. Not a bad portion for this scale of restaurant, and very share-able. Most bites were tender and delicious, but a couple were chewy. Nothing wrong with that in my book. Flavor was exceptional.

Over the course of the night, we each had a couple mixed drinks, all off of their cocktail menu. Well-made, didn&#39;t skimp on the booze. Getting those early in the meal with some empty bellies certainly warmed us right up!

Almost simultaneously with the calamari, we were served our romaine salad. They forgot the seasonal blueberries, but that was forgiven. We requested a different dressing, which she put in, and the chef then advised us against. Ended up going with some sort of sweet vinaigrette that went very well with everything in the salad. Good suggestion.

Speaking of the service, our waitress was attentive, despite helping a large party nearby and several other tables. She seemed a little flustered at times, but never once rushed us or failed to adequately answer our questions.

Our main course was a strip steak that was perfectly cooked, sliced easily, and as I recall was covered with an amazing red wine and peppercorn glace. Highlight of the night.

We finished with some profiteroles with a variety of small scoops of ice cream. They were challenging to eat because they &#34;squished&#34; but damn they were delicious.

Overall 4.4. Service could have been a little bit faster from the kitchen, but the food was very good and the waitstaff high quality. Worth a visit!"

The staff was very attentive, greeting me as soon as I entered and provided prompt service throughout my meal. I had a fantastic glass of chardonnay, and the waiter was very willing to recommend wines if asked.  I opted for the gnocchi and I have to say, it was probably some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. It literally melts in your mouth -  amazing.  I actually like the fact that the portions were not massive, it was just right. I didn&#39;t feel overloaded, but felt like I had a great meal. For dessert, I tried the chocolate truffle cake which was just as good as it sounds. The one drawback, I would say the cake was too large of a portion. It was delicious, but very rich, and about half the amount served would have been plenty, I could not finish it. I&#39;ll definitely come back the next time I&#39;m in Chicago."

We had the beef carpaccio was simple and good. My lobster ravioli was delicious! I ordered a small which only came with three raviolis. My boyfriend ordered the veal ravioli which could have definitely used some more sauce. He got a large which is only six raviolis.

After a day of traveling from San Diego to Chicago, we were definitely hungry and hit up another eatery after to satisfy our hunger. Good food. Small portions."

You don&#39;t stay in business downtown for over 20 years unless you have it going on.  Went on a Saturday night with some out of town guests who wanted Pre-theater dinner ahead of the Goodman.  Place serves excellent super-rich Restaurant food.
Pricy, but good. For a starter, i had Spinach and Ricotta Gnudi,(whatever that is). -- one of the best dishes I have ever eaten anywhere $14--this is plenty for an entree as well.  Deserts are excellent.  Someone ordered a  bottle of 2013 ChiantI--(i suppose DOCG) and it was $48--this is at most a $10 bottle at the store.  Nice service.  Place is spacious--it was full of tourists --overall good job"

My choice for tonight&#39;s dinner was the Montepulciano (my favorite Italian) which had great body, flavor and finishing. I also really enjoyed the warm bread served with white beans and mascarpone pate (it&#39;s not hummus!).

The menu offers small plate or entree size options, which was great since I wanted to try more than one dish. I placed one order of asparagus ravioli and one of lobster risotto (both small plate size). 

Raviolis were amazing. The dish tasted homemade, clearly made with fresh ingredients and looked great! The risotto was very flavorful. As a northeastern I know what Maine lobsters taste like and everything was cooked to perfection. Bonus points to the Parmesan crust.

The lemon mascarpone panna cotta was the perfect delight to end my lovely solo dinner at Trattoria. 

Service was excellent and I even had the chance to chat with the chef! I am looking forward to come back next time I&#39;m in Chicago."

Baby kale caesar salad - highly recommended by a table neighbor. it was good but a bit salty

But shoot man, you gotta have money to eat here.  I was here for work and didn&#39;t have to pay for my meal, so that was nice.

I mean, $12.00 for a salad that&#39;s about the size of a little saucer?  $15-25 for some of the dishes (I think my dish was around 16 or so dollars)?  And then $30.00+ for the main entrees?  You aren&#39;t getting a gigantic portion.

That said, some may say it&#39;s all quality over quantity, and I get that.  Again, that mushroom thing tasted fantastic.  

...But I also think it wasn&#39;t anything mind-bogglingly special, and that you can get lots of great dishes at restaurants that are much cheaper.

Service was nice, as they put up with our large group while it was busy.  And honestly, if they hadn&#39;t been nice, I would have understood, because I can imagine it gets hectic in a restaurant like that.  Workers are cool.

The meal came with some bread - cut up pieces of french bread and some sort of spread.  It was a&#39;ight.

The irony is that my boss later commented that he thought it was quite economical.  Glad he paid.

Overall: Really pricey, food is pretty great, but nothing really blew me out of the water - I&#39;ve been to much more affordable places with dishes that fascinated and thrilled me.  But that&#39;s just me.  Good service."

Located in the basement of an office building (elevator available for ADA access) the atmosphere is a little old-school. It could probably use a bit of a refresh but it&#39;s still rather nice. Make a reservation - Trattoria 10 is very popular pre-show.

I started with roasted polenta - rich and delicious. The texture of the polenta was wonderful - not heavy or cakey at all. The Mister had a wedge salad which came with tasty Gorgonzola and crispy prosciutto. Trattoria 10 specializes in ravioli which they make in house - you can get a full or half portion (same thing on pastas) making it great for a lighter meal. I went for the spicy Italian sausage version and loved it. Unlike most places, Trattoria 10 doesn&#39;t drown ravioli in sauce - my dish had dollops on top of each individual ravioli which was then garnished with generous shavings of Parmesan. It really was spicy too - definitely would order this again.

My husband went with the scallops and he said they were perfectly cooked. Presentation was lovely - they were served with a mixture of orzo and julienned vegetables. The wine list isn&#39;t huge (maybe 15-20 bottles of red and white) but its accessable and the prices aren&#39;t too terrible.

The wife ordered the tiramisu and said &#34;it was fluffy and bitter.&#34; Apparently that is good for tiramisu. 

It was somewhat disappointing that the wife ordered a $12 glass of white wine and the glass was about 1/4 full. We saw other people getting wine glasses that were appropriately filled. 

There were two other minor problems: no plates for the bread and bland white bean spread."

One of them is very keen on the Italian food scene. This was the middle ground for all of us to meet and the reviews were great. 

A few of us arrived early to get our beaks wet before dinner. I&#39;d have to say this was the most unenthusiastic bar keep I have encountered. No greeting, barely asked if we&#39;d like another drink, hardly said thanks for having a seat when we left. Craft beers out of the bottle and no drafts. Liquor pours were $12+ and things just kept going down hill. Uninviting to say the least.

Table service was a step above. Our waitress knew her stuff top to bottom and helped make recommendations for wine (pointing out the most expensive bottles first of course). Bread was fresh out the oven and a field green salad to start. Readied myself for the black tagliatelle pasta. Great dish and I was overall impressed with the cuisine. Everyone else seemed pleased. 

Of course, no split checks. Should have seen that coming. It was one let down after another. Perhaps we didn&#39;t fit in with the theater crowd? Maybe it was the location and I am used to a less-tourista atmosphere. Forgetful for the most part. Nothing drawing me back except for the proximity to a 20 bus stop downtown. Meh."

My husband loves butternut squash ravioli and we had heard that Trattoria No. 10 has great butternut squash ravioli and is only 2 blocks from the Goodman theatre so it was a no brainer.  The butternut squash ravioli was excellent.  Tried the lobster ravioli as well.  It was delicious and had a healthy amount of lobster.  I love that you can get half orders (i.e. try multiple types of ravioli).  Also enjoyed their variation of a Caprese salad.  The Mahi was slightly over cooked so I&#39;m not sure if I would get that it.   Shared the warm apple crostata for dessert.  It was fab and I don&#39;t like cooked apples.  

Trattoria No. 10 is a great choice for pre-theatre dining.  Decor is a little dated but it&#39;s still is a warm, cozy place.  I liked that it didn&#39;t seem as touristy as other restaurants in the theatre district."

Location: Excellent, right in the Loop. Off of a smaller street though, so we had difficulty getting a cab afterwards and Uber drivers just couldn&#39;t seem to find us. Kind of a cool place, in the basement (you have to go downstairs).

Service: Wonderful, our waiter was very attentive and the hostess at the beginning was similarly kind and helpful. 

Ambiance: Fairly casual, I was wearing jeans and didn&#39;t feel out of place. We were seated very close to a large party so it was louder than I would have liked, but that&#39;s not the restaurant&#39;s fault. 

Food: I had the butternut squash ravioli, the tagliatelle with shrimp and scallops, and the apple crostata. All were wonderful, no complaints about any of the food. The ravioli starter was tasty though portions were very small (they give you about 4 ravioli total). The tagliatelle was a real standout - it had plenty of shrimp, scallops and calamari (unlike some places where they really skimp on the seafood!) and tons of pasta underneath. Well-seasoned. The apple crostata was warm and yummy with a scoop of gelato. Filled with raisins and cranberries as well, so a medley of fruits really instead of just apples. Each dessert also came with a cute chocolate sauce decoration of #CRW for Chicago Restaurant Week! 

Interesting to note - the bread at the beginning doesn&#39;t come with butter. Instead they gave us what seemed like a hummus (it was some kind of bean spread). It was delicious so I enjoyed it, but maybe not for everyone. 

Overall, quite pleased, especially for the Restaurant Week menu."

Two of us had the signature lobster ravioli and the other had the butternut squash ravioli. Perfectly Al dente. As for the lobster ravs, don&#39;t skimp and get the small plate and your desires will be asking for the larger plate. Nice dessert menu. All this coupled with a comfortable ambiance made it a very pleasurable experience. The only reason I didn&#39;t give them 5 stars is I would have wanted a bit more extensive wine list.

The dessert sampler is really good though, just enough for 4 of us to try a bit of each. The chocolate ganache is also very good; if you love chocolate, definitely order that.

Ambience: Classy, mediterranian chic.

Appetizers: I had the sauteed mushrooms with goat cheese on garlic bread, it was very good, perfectly salted. 
The sweet potato ravioli with Butternut and Acorn Squash was astounding, one of the best I&#39;ve had.

Mains: Here&#39;s where our opinions diverged. The lady got the fettucine with shrimp, a rather boring and underwhelming preparation. I got the Italian style ribeye steak, it was decent. But again, the standout was the ravioli, unfortunately I forgot the preparation.
Osso Bucco (veal), as an extra secondi, was done amazingly.

We had a server that I could barely hear, and couldn&#39;t understand us. We had to repeat the order slowly a few times which is annoying. He checked on us and should have seen and removed the two empty plates that were there for a good 15 minutes. There are also no specials here, which I found weird. It seemed like everything on the menu either cream sauce, fish,or  asparagus on it. It&#39;s an Italian place, would it kill you to put something in a red sauce?

Oh god, here&#39;s the kicker: This is where I got the worst old fashioned of my life. I never even went past 1 sip of it. It was a muddled mush of bad orange and maraschino fruit throughout it &amp; way too much sweetness. It was $13.25 for a very small old fashioned, even though he charged me for Makers Mark rather than Knob Creek. That&#39;s just ridiculous.

I had the Caprese Salad which was a complete disappointment. Swimming in oil with big chunks of random tomatoes, and for some reason, they salted the mozzarella chunk in the middle but not the tomatoes.
I also had the Corn Chowder which looked cool when they brought out the bowl with garnishes and were going to hand pour the soup over the garnishes, but unfortunately what was poured out of it was chunky cream of chicken, oversalted nastiness. Bleh! That should only be done with a pureed soup anyway. Not something with chunks of chicken and vegetables in it.

My other half, in addition to our nasty old fashioneds, had the shrimp ravioli and said the pasta was undercooked and it was incredibly bland.

Caprese Salad, Corn Chowder, Shrimp Ravioli, and two Old Fashioned cocktails ran us $85.
Never again. Yuck."

I didn&#39;t even bristle knowing it would be the 4th out of 5 Italian meals I was partaking in that week, including one that very evening.

I&#39;ve always wondered about this space; it seemed strange that a $$$ restaurant was located in a windowless basement below Sopraffina. Somehow Trattoria 10 pulls it off, and on a gloomy Chicago afternoon, I would&#39;ve preferred to stay inside than venture back into the windy, overcast day.

While Trattoria 10 was a good place for a business meeting, I wasn&#39;t overly impressed with my meal, the ravioli with asparagus, aged provolone, onions and sun-dried tomatoes. My biggest complaints are two. First, my pasta was too al dente or firm. Personally, I think you should be able to easily cut ravioli with the edge of a fork; mine required the aid of my butter knife. Second, my meal was oversalted. It&#39;s unusual for me to complain about the amount of salt in a meal, as I am usually the first to reach for the salt shaker. However, in this case all I was reaching for was my glass of water to try and blunt some of the saltiness of my meal. Should I have sent the dish back? Probably, but I didn&#39;t want to disrupt the flow of our business lunch or insult my host who quite adores the place.

Despite the lackluster food, the service was attentive and friendly. Glasses were filled regularly on cue and our server was there when we needed him without feeling like he hovered.

First we had the potato leek soup and arugula salad. Both amazing. I thought mozzarella with apples in a salad wouldn&#39;t go, but it&#39;s just a few tiny pieces and trust me...they do. 
Then we ordered the ravioli. You have to get this because it&#39;s what their known for and this is the best ravioli I&#39;ve ever had. If you randomly asked me what my favorite food was I would say ravioli so I&#39;ve tried it at many different places. By far this is the best. I had the ravioli with asparagus and that was really creamy. I preferred the butternut squash ravioli, the inside was so sweet and the ravioli literally melted in your mouth.
All dishes you can order full or half sizes we did half and shared everything to try more. Steak was great and they allowed us to share with two different cooking styles. The waitress was very accommodating. They have grass fed beef and use local farms. Definitely great Italian restaurant- I would recommend it and make sure to end with the tiramisu."

We had a server that I could barely hear, and couldn&#39;t understand us. We had to repeat the order slowly a few times which is annoying. He checked on us and should have seen and removed the two empty plates that were there for a good 15 minutes. There are also no specials here, which I found weird. It seemed like everything on the menu either cream sauce, fish,or  asparagus on it. It&#39;s an Italian place, would it kill you to put something in a red sauce?

Oh god, here&#39;s the kicker: This is where I got the worst old fashioned of my life. I never even went past 1 sip of it. It was a muddled mush of bad orange and maraschino fruit throughout it &amp; way too much sweetness. It was $13.25 for a very small old fashioned, even though he charged me for Makers Mark rather than Knob Creek. That&#39;s just ridiculous.

I had the Caprese Salad which was a complete disappointment. Swimming in oil with big chunks of random tomatoes, and for some reason, they salted the mozzarella chunk in the middle but not the tomatoes.
I also had the Corn Chowder which looked cool when they brought out the bowl with garnishes and were going to hand pour the soup over the garnishes, but unfortunately what was poured out of it was chunky cream of chicken, oversalted nastiness. Bleh! That should only be done with a pureed soup anyway. Not something with chunks of chicken and vegetables in it.

My other half, in addition to our nasty old fashioneds, had the shrimp ravioli and said the pasta was undercooked and it was incredibly bland.

Caprese Salad, Corn Chowder, Shrimp Ravioli, and two Old Fashioned cocktails ran us $85.
Never again. Yuck."

I didn&#39;t even bristle knowing it would be the 4th out of 5 Italian meals I was partaking in that week, including one that very evening.

I&#39;ve always wondered about this space; it seemed strange that a $$$ restaurant was located in a windowless basement below Sopraffina. Somehow Trattoria 10 pulls it off, and on a gloomy Chicago afternoon, I would&#39;ve preferred to stay inside than venture back into the windy, overcast day.

While Trattoria 10 was a good place for a business meeting, I wasn&#39;t overly impressed with my meal, the ravioli with asparagus, aged provolone, onions and sun-dried tomatoes. My biggest complaints are two. First, my pasta was too al dente or firm. Personally, I think you should be able to easily cut ravioli with the edge of a fork; mine required the aid of my butter knife. Second, my meal was oversalted. It&#39;s unusual for me to complain about the amount of salt in a meal, as I am usually the first to reach for the salt shaker. However, in this case all I was reaching for was my glass of water to try and blunt some of the saltiness of my meal. Should I have sent the dish back? Probably, but I didn&#39;t want to disrupt the flow of our business lunch or insult my host who quite adores the place.

Despite the lackluster food, the service was attentive and friendly. Glasses were filled regularly on cue and our server was there when we needed him without feeling like he hovered.

Great service, attentive to our needs but never felt like anyone was hovering. I love the ravioli and the tiramisu.

It&#39;s nice to find a restaurant in the Loop serving up fresh food; I feel like this area  is so over saturated in quick dining restaurants for the lunch crowd. Trattoria No. 10 could be a nice place for lunch but it was a perfect place for a quick and delicious girls&#39; dinner. Our server was delightful and didn&#39;t judge when my friend and I each had two glasses of wine in about 50 minutes. Start with the gnocchi, the pieces are lightly crispy, almost like a breakfast potato, and the contrast with the creamy ricotta cheese is surprising. For dinner, you can&#39;t go wrong with any of the ravioli, as that is what Trattoria is known for. However, I broke tradition and ordered the parapadelle with chicken and was not disappointed in the slightest. The ragu was the perfect consistency and the noodles were certainly homemade (or tasted that way!). For dessert, get the house made gelato or sorbet, both are bursting with flavor! I would recommend the pistachio gelato over everything."

I don&#39;t really eat pasta, I wouldn&#39;t normally go out to an Italian place, but I figured they&#39;d have some good wine. We were pleasantly surprised and we didn&#39;t feel like total a**holes walking in with our street clothes and backpacks while everyone else was in business Loop attire. That&#39;s what sitting at the bar is for, right?

A white Pinot Noir? What is this you say? I am intrigued. Delish. Good wine selection.
Beet ravioli was interesting in concept but the calamari with cannellini beans was the real stand out, as was the chef&#39;s cheese plate. THE CHEESE PLATE. Rarely do I rave about a cheese plate, but the homemade accompaniments perfectly paired with each cheese. Do it.

Let me tell you, Monday nights in the Loop are just plain slow, especially because there are no performances in the area.

That proved good news for us, though! We were seated right away at a table far from other people (so we could be louder). Service was fast and the food was great!

We all chose to order the smaller portions of the pasta dishes and we all had just enough to eat. I ordered the squid ink black linguini with mussels. It was fresh, hot, and delicious. The other girls I was with both ordered the duck confit farfalle. The duck was rich and the sauce with pearl onions was a perfect addition.

We all shared a plate of 3 desserts: tiramisu, chocolate molten cake, apple tart. The apple tart was by far the best with the chocolate cake not far behind. I love dessert. But tiramisu is never my favorite. It wasn&#39;t the restaurant&#39;s fault. It&#39;s just not my thing. 

So anyway, if you&#39;re looking for a place in the Loop for an intimate dinner on a Monday night, look no further than Trattoria No. 10!"

It isn&#39;t bad, but it really isn&#39;t great.  It is over priced and I won&#39;t be back.  There are just too many good restaurants to eat at, and way better Italian in the city.

Went here tonight with 2 friends to check out their restaurant week menu.  $33 bucks for an appetizers, entree, and dessert is a decent deal.   It ended up being $65/pp with a glass of wine and tip.   Really not worth it - bad pick on our part.

Appetizers were good.  I had the butternut squash ravioli and my friends had the mushroom ragu.  All were flavorful, smallish portion size.

You had 3 entrees to pick from.  I had the  fettuccine with shrimp, sun dried and grape tomatoes, leeks, fennel and a saffron butter sauce.  It was good and the shrimp were amazing.   My friends both had the Ravioli filled with asparagus tips and aged provolone cheese, onions, and a sundried tomato sauce.    They both said it was not good and not fully cooked - hard and chewy.  Personally, I would have sent it back, but they did not.

Desserts were decadent, as only desserts can be. 

The restaurant was loud - it was hard to carry on a conversation at our table.    Everyone is on top of each other - not well laid out.

Again, I would not back."

For dinner we had the the herbed pappardelle and black tagliatelle. Great portion sizes and we licked our plates! I can never finish pasta dishes, not the case this time.

Whether mushroom, butternut squash, beet or sausage - your tastebuds will be delighted!

The one area they could improve are the desserts.  They are just ok - not in line with the rest of the food.

Service is great snd the space is nice even though it&#39;s in the basement.

Definitely give this place a chance!"

Prolly the best airport food experience I&#39;ve ever had (and I&#39;ve had A LOT of stomach aches at airports). So glad I got in the (daunting) line, cuz it only took about 5 minutes from start to finish. Super friendly staff and the sandwich I got (Mediterranean on flatbread w/chicken) was BOMB (excuse the language TSA). Also got chips, bottle of water AND a cookie that was fresh AF. All for under $12.

Looking into living here. So happy."

I walked up to a long line but decided to stick out the wait because airport food is always shotty but chains typically tend to be a more consistent decision. Being that it was my first time here, a lady approached me at the end of the line and asked to take my order. Feeling the pressure, I went with the chicken salad. As the line moved, rather quickly I might add but it was very long, I changed my mind. Turkey it shall be! I found the order taker and informed her if my change. Thank goodness I changed my mind because I would&#39;ve been so disappointed if they sent my chicken salad sandwich through the toaster. The toaster seems to be a default so if you don&#39;t want your sandwich hot - specify that to the order taker! 

The sandwich came out fine despite my last minute change. They have standard bread choices of white or wheat and standard topping selections. 

All in all, it&#39;s an okay sandwich place and probably one of the better options for midway by a landslide. Service is prompt, seating is limited and remember, it&#39;s a sandwich place. Nothing special, nothing crummy - just a sandwich place."

This is my second time at a Potbelly, the first being in DC...a non airport location.

The line was close to out the door during an early morning rush. However that did not deter me in the least as I had the time. A gentlemen with a machine was taking orders to expedite which is genius. The line moved quickly.

The dining room was clean and most every table taken. The kitchen staff hustled their butts off and was extremely efficient. From what I could see the kitchen was clean and orderly. When I got up to grab my sandwich the man who took my order had moved to this station. I got a sausage, egg &amp; cheese. The automated process was impressive. Checkout a breeze, fair price and the young lady was friendly.

I sat down one one of the stools against the wall which works great for singles. I realized I forgot to grab my receipt. I saw the same man who took my order now working the coffee station funny enough. He took care of pulling the receipt and did it with a smile.

Delicious, saucey, toasted, 9 inches crafted of mouth-watering layers of meat, cheese, and lettuce left us absolutely fulfilled and screaming at our lungs that this is BY-FAR the best and cheapest (~$7) airport food we&#39;ve had.

We requested ours &#34;loaded&#34; which seemed to mean &#34;with all of the free things you can put on top,&#34; following whatever flyertalkians and other airportians wrote on their online blogs that revealed themselves after we Googled &#34;what to do&#34; followed by &#34;four hour layover&#34; followed by &#34;MDW Chicago.&#34;

I try to avoid them, but the freshly baked cookies here are also very good.  Lastly, even though I stick to water, they do offer a nice selection of bottled drinks in the cooler that are unique for this place.

This time around with flight delays and long airtime I caved.  After a good 20 minutes of roaming around midway airport to spot thee shop to spend my hard earned cash- this place was the winner.  You can never judge popularity by the lines in an airport since duh- people are just hungry by then.  

What caught my eye was the pastrami sandwich and the fact I was in Chicago, so I thought &#39;can&#39;t be too bad, right?&#39; The lady took my order as I was standing in line, so by the time I got to the register it was a pay and go transaction.  I also bought a bag of Zapp&#39;s hotter &#39;n hot jalapeno chips just because.  And for airport price, I paid $10 for pastrami sandwich, chips and drink--which my wallet likes.

During the flight I pigged out.  The sandwich was pretty tasty on soft whole grain bread too.  Meat was thinly sliced and flavorful.  Top it off with the chips.  I&#39;m now in the search for those Zapp&#39;s chips!  They they perfect spice flavor and crunch."

Yum! 

The chicken was hardy, the extra avocado I ordered was a wonderful touch, the artichoke hearts, chickpeas and tomatoes lent other flavor bursts... No need for salad dressing :)

The line is almost always out the door but it moves fairly quick. Not as quick as the 8-minute estimation they have note on their walls, but if you&#39;ve got 10-15 minutes for a decent and nominally priced sandwich you&#39;re golden. 

If they don&#39;t have something you want, ask if there&#39;s other sandwiches not listed.

It can be hard to snake through the line when you have bags, stroller, etc. with you so it is wonderful that have a separate line for people that need assistance. The folks at the counter were great. They saw our little munchkins sitting glum and gave them some chocolate chip cookies. It totally made their day and kept them happy while we waited for our flight.

In this talk thread, a Yelper mentioned Potbelly. After recently eating in Potbelly for the first time, I say ditto to the Yelper.

   Flying nearly across the continent from Washington DC to Las Vegas, we had a stopover in Chicago Midway. This was the perfect time to eat out. Last summer I vacationed in Chicago. I was well informed of Chicago&#39;s outstanding food. And I was well informed of all the Potbelly Sandwich Shops. It was time to give them a try.

   Before I go on, I wanted to bring up that if you are unfamiliar with potbelly; it does not mean being chubby. It is a word for stove. Potbelly Sandwich Shop goes back to a time when a couple that owned an antique store started to sell sandwiches. This store was off Lincoln Avenue in Chicago. Now there are several Potbelly Sandwich shops. Mostly in the midwest. Anyways, on the layover, I was thinking about eating by the time of my Las Vegas bound flight. A long line greeted me. The line moved fast, thanks to an employee taking the customers orders on line. This really expedited the progress of the line. 

   The dining area is the food court in the Southwest Airlines terminal. On my table lied the pizza sandwich. What a great idea! A sub that tastes like a pizza sandwich. Potbelly offers the choice of original or multigrain wheat bread. The whole wheat bread that I picked complimented the ingredients of the pizza sandwich. The ingredients were pepperoni, meatballs, capicola, marinara sauce, provolone cheese, mushrooms, and Italian seasoning. This is one of those delicious sandwiches that leave me asking myself, &#34;Why doesn&#39;t Subway, Jimmy John&#39;s, Port of Subs, or Firehouse offer a pizza sub?&#34; A second question is &#34;How come Las Vegas can&#39;t get a Potbelly? &#34; 

   The pizza sandwich and a Coke came out to around $10. Not bad at all. Especially in an airport.

   I agree with the Las Vegas Yelper on the Talk thread that Potbelly is a chain that we would like to see come to Las Vegas. The Potbelly pizza sandwich left a good taste in my memory toward this sandwich shop."

The sandwiches are delicious and are not priced at a premium like a lot of things you see at airports so you actually get a fair deal.

There was a huge line when I came up, but it moved so efficiently that I was remember being impressed with how well coordinated everything was. Almost as soon as I got in line, someone with an iPad took my order and somehow, by magic...as soon as I got to the front of the line, they knew exactly what I wanted and it was already prepped.

I had the turkey breast sandwich with avocado -- had some tomatoes in there as well. The sandwich was good, but I initially thought the turkey would be roasted and it wouldn&#39;t be the turkey meats, but that&#39;s alright. The roll the sub was perfected toasted. I wish they would have made the sandwiches with some pre-made addons as I felt a little lost when they asked me what I wanted on there and didn&#39;t know the options ahead of time. I also didn&#39;t know I had to ask for some sort of dressing separately, so when I finally got to eating the sandwich, I missed the mayo and the dressing which led to a healthier, but less fulfilling sandwich.

It is always a struggle to find decent food in an airport and Potbelly does it up right.  

My last layover in Midway I was not looking forward too.  Travel weary, I was tired and had just gotten off a plane with a ton of crabby kids and families who had just finished their vacations at Disney World.  I was hungry so I figured I&#39;d grab a quick Wreck Salad at Potbelly.  The line was so LONG!  But Potbelly was on it!  They were expediting orders by having a server take orders on a ipad which communicated to their kitchen.  By the time you were up to the counter your order was in process.  This appeared to be working quickly and efficiently.  
I had not complaints and the staff was doing a great job of keeping up with the rush.  There was even one super cranky, rude guy who&#39;s order had somehow gotten missed.  He was so nasty but the staff just kept smiling and tried to get his order prepared and to him quickly.

Good sandwich at a decent price. Had the Italian sandwich - meats nicely flavored, but what I really loved was the bread! Bread was perfectly toasted on the outside but had that nice slight chewiness inside. 

Service was great - after standing in many long slow lines in Chicago prior to getting to the airport, it was nice to see a place that had their act together. They had one worker taking orders in the line, so by the time you reached the front, your sandwich was ready for you to pick your other toppings, pay, and get out there.

I heard their policy is to get you through the process in 8 mins so that&#39;s pretty good especially since Chicago&#39;s layovers are known to be a pain in the ass. I had the 6 inch &#34;a wreck&#34; sandwich w/o cheese. For $4.95, it wasn&#39;t bad... I was just hoping for much more meat!"

I ordered the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. Added hot peppers and onions on multigrain bread. I love that they run their sandwiches through the oven, allowing the cheese goodness to spread throughout the entirety of the sandwich. 

My food was prepared very quickly and was wrapped nice and neat. The woman taking the orders and the man adding the veggies and sauces were very friendly. Upon going to the cashier, my experience went downhill. The cashier was barely audible, speaking on a very low tone and failing to make any eye contact whatsoever. Jessica didn&#39;t even offer me a drink, so I had to grab a water that was located right next to her cash register myself. I also purchased a banana to go with my sandwich. Jessica didn&#39;t ask if I needed a bag, so I asked for one myself. She then proceeded to hand me a bag and make me put my own items in there! Is this Potbelly&#39;s policy? I was shocked.

My sandwich was good but I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s any better than one of the good deli sandwiches I&#39;ve had back in California. I would still ultimately pick this place over the other gloomy options at Midway. Maybe I didn&#39;t ask for enough mayonnaise.."

I don&#39;t ever expect much from an airport restaurant.

Especially when I&#39;m there for breakfast. I had no idea what this spot was about, but it was right in front of me, so I went for it. I also saw they were brewing Intelligentsia coffee, so that sold me too ;)

I didn&#39;t realize it was basically a sandwich shop. When I walked in a little guy with an iPad/tablet took our order. I was a little off guard and not ready to order, but who could go wrong with a bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich? I was hesitant, because breakfast eggs at these types of spots generally freak me out - rubbery and faux egg tasting.

After I gave him my order, I proceeded to the Disney-esque line to where I told the nice glad what I wanted on my sandwich. Since it was for breaky, I passed on all additional toppings. She wrapped up the sandwich and handed it to me. At the register I ordered my soy mocha, paid, and was on my way to the terminal.

When I finally got to my gate, thanks to five of those walking escalator things, it was time to devour my breaky. You know what? It wasn&#39;t half bad at all. It was actually really good. The bacon wasn&#39;t limp and crappy, it was thick, crispy, and a nice cut. The egg wasn&#39;t as faux as usual, so its texture didn&#39;t creep me out. You&#39;d have thought I was dying of hunger, how fast I ate it. Don&#39;t judge but I also ate some sun chips with it, they were too tempting to pass up.

Moral of my story is don&#39;t judge a restaurant in an airport, just assume you&#39;ll pay and arm and a leg for whatever you delight in! 

I believe in breakfast at the airport, again..."

I ordered &#39;A Wreck&#39; in the &#39;Bigs&#39; size. As my last meal before a long flight, why not? The Bigs is 30% larger for less than adding 30% the cost.

The wheat bread was soft and slightly sweet. I loved the combination of meats and the spiciness of the peppers.

Best coffee. (They brew intelligentsia). Warning - it is boiling hot, and if you want room for cream you have to tell them.

Breakfast sandwiches are amazing and the best value in Midway. I recommend the bacon, egg, and cheese on white bread with mayo/onions.

For dinner, Potbelly has the best salads in Midway. The grilled chicken and cranberry salad is amazing."

I personally love the Roast Beef with the peppers.  Plus the Hotter than Hot Jalapeno chips (they could be hotter, but whatever) are delish too.  

It is a great option before a flight.  Some seating inside the restaurant, but tons more in the main dining area."

The servers were really attentive to people coming in and approached pretty quickly once they saw I had something in mind. The food itself was okay. I ordered a flat bread chicken and cheddar sandwich. For the toppings, I asked for hot peppers, tomato, and lettuce. The cheese went all the way to the bottom, so I ended with a goop of cheese chunk at the end. Not sure if it was the way it was wrapped, but the end of my sandwich was also dripping with oiliness, an inconvenient situation in the seat of the plane. Oh my glob, what a messy situation. But overall, I think it was pretty decent food considering its circumstance. Might try something else on the menu next time, though."

Thanks to Anthony U., the DUKE himself for the heads-up! (There is another listing for PB w/no reviews and is the one I&#39;ve been checking into for awhile now apparently.)

I&#39;ve chowed here many a time and it&#39;s quick- amazingly quick- friendly &amp; it&#39;s standard yummy Potbelly. 

Regular for $5.50 (6&#34;), just a buck more gets you a big (9&#34;). Your only choice of bread: white or wheat. Or they can do a &#34;less bread&#34; version for the same price. 

All the standard stuff - meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato etc. Giant fat pickle stick available at a price. Cookies, coffee, chips, soda (bottled) too. (No way I&#39;m paying $2.24 for 20 oz of bottled soda though - which really isn&#39;t that bad a price for an airport, but no.) 

There&#39;s counter and table seating - some outlets scattered here n there. They are also kind enough to hand out a free small cup for water (even to non-customers.)"

I believe the key to five stars and great customer service here is the fact many of their employees have worked at busy downtown locations and weren&#39;t just hired to work at this location. I have found many chain restaurants at most airports operate like an island with little connection to other stores. 

Even if there is a long line they move fast. The employees are super efficient and generally have a smile and friendly disposition. It also helps to know what you want BEFORE you get to the order spot. If you want one of their shakes or malts you order that before you start your sandwich order. This helps the malt to be ready when your sandwich is and gets you on the way faster. 

I almost always get the wreck sandwich on a wheat roll, a chocolate malt, and a bag of chocolate chip oatmeal cookies. This runs about $13 with tax and seems fairly reasonable considering food in airports is more expensive and the service here exceeds most other shops at Midway. 

On occasion I&#39;ve had breakfast here and it&#39;s truly a gem considering some of the other breakfast options at Midway. There is a ham, egg, mushroom, and cheese sandwich that is super good. I wish they offered breakfast sandwiches later in the day too but I guess to remain efficient they have to limit it to mornings. 

I&#39;ve not had any of the salads here so I can&#39;t really comment on those but sometimes I&#39;ve had the tomato soup and it&#39;s thick and rich. 

If you&#39;ve never had Potbelly before they have a spot on their website for new customers and understanding the menu and fast ordering process. You won&#39;t be disappointed here."

Cons: the dine in area is really filthy. Like I could see hairs and old crumbs all around on my table. Also the employees on the toppings line couldn&#39;t move as fast as the people taking meat orders from the iPad, so they had a backlog of sandwiches that created a little bit of inefficiency.

1. It&#39;s cheap. A large 9-inch sub will run you about $6-7 while the regular 6-inch size is even cheaper at $5-6.
2. It&#39;s fast. The service is both friendly and no nonsense. Line up, place your order, wait for it to be put together/toasted along the assembly line, customize it with the next person, pay, and done.
3. It&#39;s tasty. If you haven&#39;t had it yet, the Wreck is the way to go for first timers--it has the kitchen sink of all delicious sandwich meats: salami, roast beef, ham, and turkey. Get it with the veggies of your choice (I recommend everything, including the peppers--don&#39;t skimp), and wolf if down while it&#39;s still warm and toasty.

Thanks for making my MDW layovers and having to deal with the excruciatingly stingy airport Wi-Fi (a whopping free 15 minutes, really? What year is this?) go by so much more pleasantly with your deliciousness, Potbelly!"

No milkshakes!!!! I love their milkshakes! So sad every time I come through, no milkshakes. That would give them a 3.5 stars but I round them up because I love them that much.

Be sure to get hot peppers on your sandwich. I normally get the skinny turkey, no cheese. Now the &#34;skinny&#34; is called thin cut. It&#39;s less bread. I&#39;ve also had the PB&amp;J, Meatball, A Wreck, Italian, and breakfast sandwiches...all SO GOOD. You can order a &#34;big&#34; and they give you more meat.

Don&#39;t let the line scare you away. They go fast. You order your bread, meat, and cheese first. Then once it&#39;s toasted you ask for your toppings. 

The line can get crazy/confusing when it is busy. Don&#39;t be startled if the person behind you gets to the register before you. I jumped ahead of someone once because my sandwich was done fast and I got called to the register. They looked at me like I was the most awful person in the world.

After three years, the owners have finally moved from their previous location to bring top quality meat tacos to the neighborhood.

The tacos are king. Simply prepared with slow cooked meats, I tried a three taco plate with lengua, al pastor, and guisado. All were on double corn tortillas and finished with a sprinkling of fresh onion and cilantro. My favorite was definitely the guisado, a pork taco finished in mole sauce. Portions were generous and the meal comes with a side of rice and beans (also very good) for $9.50.

A plate of homemade chips and hot red and mild green salsas came to the table gratis as I sat down. That&#39;s always a nice touch during these days of charging extra for chips and salsa.

It was quiet this Sunday afternoon. I was the only guy in the restaurant at 7:30PM. My server was also the cook and she was super friendly.

There were quite a few other options for taco fillings including steak, chicken, and veggies. El Nuevo Taco Loco is no nonsense, high on flavor, family owned, and a great value."

Well, that was three years ago and the &#34;opening soon&#34; sign quickly became a joke to residents of the neighborhood. I never thought it would actually open but a few weeks ago it did and last night I finally got to try the taco place that enticed me to move to the area.

I was not disappointed. It was definitely worth the wait but I wish they&#39;d opened sooner. I had the three taco dinner and my husband had the suizo burrito with carne asada. My three tacos were the picadillo, pollo and carne asada. It&#39;s hard to decide which taco I liked best because they were all delicious but I think I&#39;ll have to go with the carne asada. It was really flavorful and the beef was very tender. The pollo and picadillo were also some of the best I&#39;ve had in Chicago. I teach international students so I&#39;ve had picadillo prepared by people from Mexico before and Nuevo Taco Loco&#39;s is very authentic. My husband loved his burrito so much he ate it all without even offering me a bite. I guess I&#39;ll have to go back and try it for myself.

Seriously, I will be back. It&#39;s definitely going to be my new taco place. The food was excellent and the woman who served us (my husband said she was the owner because he overheard her talking in Spanish but I don&#39;t speak Spanish and we&#39;d had some wine so I don&#39;t know if I trust his translation) was extremely friendly and greeted every customer with a warm smile.

At first I was more than thrilled due to the overall reviews......
My husband, friend and myself entered the restaurant at 1:40pm, wanting to catch the 2:48pm train. There was one guest in the restaurant, Gilmore Girls blaring in the background and our server, whom was less than thrilled to wait on us. We soon found out besides her less than lackluster table side manor, she was also the counter help and the cook. She took her time to help us, and acted unapproachable whenever we asked for something as well. She was  probably one of the worst/unprofessional servers I have ever encountered in my life. Also, since I have been in the restaurant business for 29 years, that is a very hard title to claim. 
At one point a customer came in to order at the counter and she had to stop, I assume, preparing our food to help him, which took over 10 minutes alone. When she resumed cooking she slammed the microwave door several times, which didn&#39;t leave me very excited for my food. Anytime I see a kitchen use their microwave for other than employee left overs, I don&#39;t have much faith in the food. 
We realized that we would soon be late for our train, due to the length of time the food was taking to prepare so we asked her if we could have our food &#34;to go&#34;. Her poor, irritated response.... &#34;It&#39;s already on plates.&#34; 
After a polite urging, we got the food to go and as she rang me up she charged me for the complimentary chips and salsa. I asked her why and she said as rude as you can imagine, &#34;because you didn&#39;t dine in.&#34; I didn&#39;t have the time to argue with her that the very reason we didn&#39;t dine in is because she was understaffed, didn&#39;t show the least bit of hustle or concern for us as customers what so ever. With that comment I paid almost $45.00 worth of microwaved food and bad service. What is funnier still is had she been more understanding I had every intention of leaving her a very nice tip. Needless to say we ate while we waited for the train and to be honest the food didn&#39;t make up for the bad experience. 
*I hope the owner takes this review very serious because as a manager of a restaurant in the north shore, I would never allow my staff to treat a guest or guests so poorly. She was the blond with pink highlights, although you can&#39;t miss the bad attitude. 
*As someone reading this review, walk a block west to Garcia&#39;s and get fantastic service along with great Margaritas!"

The beans and rice were all over the place. I called to speak to someone and the lady hung up on me and was extremely rude. Nice customer service.  I will never order from here again.

The food is delicious.  We ordered the pico de gallo, guacamole, combination fajitas, and horchata and sides of beans and rice for the little guy.  The pico de gallo was super tasty - made with a ton of raw onions and lime juice, with a little cilantro, jalapenos, and tomatoes. The guacamole was creamy and delicious, but the portion was a bit smaller than I expected based on the price.  The combination fajitas had chicken, steak strips, shrimp, peppers and onions.  Perfectly cooked, well seasoned.  Came with warm corn tortillas, rice, beans, tomato slice, lettuce, guacamole, and sour cream.  Enough food for 2!

As we were paying, the woman mentioned that the flan that she had just made was delicious. So of course we had to try a piece.  It was great!   Cinnamon flavor without overpowering the sweet, creamy egg-yness of the dish.  My friend said it was the best flan she had ever tasted!

I hope this place gets busy enough to hire a dedicated waitress.  Our only complaints were having to ask for napkins, water, plates, etc. 

The place was never empty, even though we came between the lunch and dinner rushes.  I am looking forward to trying their tortas and of course more flan."

I always like the rice and beans on the side with Mexican food but always end up leaving most of  the beans behind. However they prepare them here made me finish all of mine and my dads. And my moms. The rest of our food was great. I had chicken flautas and they were crispy and flavorful. The guacamole was fresh and tasty. Food prep was quick and service was friendly. This will 100% be our go to Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood.

So excited, I actually drove down from work (32 miles... yes, I said 32) to check it out. I&#39;m really pleased to say I wasn&#39;t disappointed at all. 

I came in on a Thursday night and it wasn&#39;t very busy. I know it&#39;s relatively new, so I wasn&#39;t surprised. I was greeted &amp; seated promptly. Fresh chips &amp; two different salsas (roja &amp; verde) were brought out right away. I was already impressed. The chips were nice and crispy and the salsas complimented them perfectly. Everything was fresh. 

The first thing I ordered was Horchata. I love it and love trying it everywhere I go just to compare. Their Horchata was different... in a GOOD way. It was a little darker than I&#39;m used to and was full of flavor. I REALLY liked it. 

Next up was my actual meal... Hmmmm.... what to order? I hate going into a new place and ordering tacos or burritos. I wanted something different and I found it, Guisado de Puerco. I truthfully didn&#39;t know what to expect, but it sounded good, so I went for it. I LOVED it. The pork was so tender, perfectly seasoned. The flavor was outstanding. Not to salty at all, which is a pet peeve of mine. It was served with rice, refried beans, lettuce &amp; tomato on the side, along with piping hot tortillas to complete the meal. This is a weird thing to say, but it didn&#39;t taste like &#34;restaurant&#34; food. It tasted like I was eating in someone&#39;s home, which made it even more special. I really, really like this dish! My only suggestion would be more lettuce &amp; tomato on the plate, as I ran out when I was filling my tortillas, but trust me, you won&#39;t be disappointed at all. I highly recommend this one!

I finished my meal and couldn&#39;t move. My tummy was happy &amp; I was really full. Of course I was offered dessert and of course I said yes, but I had to take it to go! Carmel custard, with a squirt or whip cream. I won&#39;t lie.... I didn&#39;t eat right when I got home, but when I finally popped it open, WOW... SO good! I love the flavor, great texture and it didn&#39;t get watery like so many of the others I had before. You may want to grab a piece to go. If you decide to eat there, you might want another one! 

All I can say is this is exactly the kind of food I love. Simple preparation &amp; simply delicious. I&#39;m not &#34;in the neighborhood&#34;, but I will definitely be back.  Lots more to try!"

However, once checking out the menu and tasting my food, it def sets the bar. It&#39;s byob so that&#39;s a nice addition. The chips are freshly made in house and the salsa was nice and spicy. I ordered the steak fajitas. It was served with a bowl of beans, guac and sour cream. The steak was really juicy and tender. I don&#39;t eat refried beans on their own but the ones served there were really good, so much so that I was eating spoonfuls of it alone. The portions were perfect and the price was even better, especially considering spidering the quality of the food. I&#39;m definitely Italy planning to go back."

El nuevo taco loco is muy loco!!! If I could give this place zero stars I wouldn&#39;t waste a second. I came in one evening and the restaurant was vacant. The owner was there and greeted and served us like it was such an inconvenience to have our business. She had the worst attitude. The food is NOT cooked fresh. She went into the kitchen for 2 minutes and came out with what I believe was microwaved food. I don&#39;t think meat could be prepared fresh in 2 min. We ordered to go, so we didn&#39;t look at our food until we were half way home.  When I opened the box everything was completely soggy, and the liquid from the &#34;stewed chicken&#34; had seeped through the tortilla, the styrofoam, and the plastic bag! When we came back to complain and ask for a refund, the lady flatly refused and said that we could have done anything to it because we left the premise. Ummm that&#39;s what you do when you order something to go...you leave the premise. She even said some BS about us not knowing what authentic Mexican food was, because if we did, we would know that the &#34;stewed chicken&#34; in burritos gets your food wet. Thanks for the lame excuse and your lazy cooking. Not to mention the worst service I&#39;ve ever had."

I had been keeping such close tabs on their Facebook page for news about an official opening that I was their first official customer! I&#39;ve been back several time since.The restaurant is clean, and everyone working there is super nice. 

By far my favorite thing to order there is the horchata - it&#39;s so smooth, creamy, and delicious - I even prefer theirs over Garcia&#39;s (which was my old standby). Home made tortilla chips are brought out to your table whenever you&#39;re dining in, and they are amazing! Nice and crunchy but not oily from being fried. They serve the chips with two different salsas (red and green), both home made, which are delicious. I&#39;m not a big fan of salsa on my chips but the green one was great. I haven&#39;t tried too many of their main dishes yet but everything  has been very tasty and keeps me coming back to try more (their rice and beans!!! so good!!!!). They also have desserts, some are made in house and some are from a local bakery, they&#39;re all good. Every single one.

Right now they&#39;re cash only, but they will be accepting cards soon. One of the best things, in my opinion, is that you can pay up at the register. This makes splitting the bill with large groups so easy!"

I also tried the awesome posole at El Nuevo Taco Loco. With so much hominy and chunks of meats, it was almost like a winter stew. The posole also came with some nice sides, which was a great touch. 

Emily took care of me during my visit at El Nuevo Taco Loco. She was super friendly and professional. She definitely accommodated special requests for my order.

I seem to have this notion that everything in and around the loop is pricey until I stumble on spots like this. We stopped by last Friday for a snack for the lady and a whiskey soda for me. They offer everything from hot dogs to burgers to Italian beefs and all under $10. Woohoo! As for me, just a Maker&#39;s Mark and soda... ONLY $6! What a deal!

I have had some ok and bad festival food but this was by far the most disgusting sandwich I have ever had. Way to make a gross money sucking sandwich.

The bartender was no where to be found and when he did show he took his time serving his buddies who had shown up AFTER us, before even acknowledging us, despite another person at the bar pointing out to him that we had been there for several minutes WAITING and that he should serve us first.

The food here is nothing special. The prices were reasonable, but we left there feeling dissatisfied. A couple of hotdogs from a street vendor would have been money better spent.

I have been here for breakfast, didn&#39;t get the cheeseborger yet.  I got a perfectly cooked 3 egg feta cheese omelet with a generous amount of cheese, hash browns, and toast.  I finished off the whole 3 egg omelet.  Dining companion got fried eggs, bacon and toast, which looked like it was perfectly cooked. You can see the cook make them to order on the grill.  I also saw them make someone a gorgeous Denver omelet, which I will try in the future.  Today they had chili for 2.95.  I ordered some to take home. It was thick, well seasoned and a generous portion and they had also tossed in 3 packets of saltine crackers. I hope they have chili again. It seemed like it was a special today.

Also, unlike the SNL skit, and the original Billy Goat on lower Michigan, they have fries. Haven&#39;t tried them yet. The chips are Vitner&#39;s, which I consider a plus. 

If you do get a hamborger or a cheeseborger, they do have condiments, they are off to the side by the cash register and you add them yourself."

I thought people moved slowly at my job, but the disdain with which the employees treated my food assured me that what was to proceed, wasn&#39;t going to be pretty.

The food? Wow. I ordered a double cheeseburger and a hot-dog.  Bread was stale for both. Cheeseburger was gristly, and not even lukewarm.  Hot-dog? You know that lone hot dog that you forget was in the refrigerator? And you decide to nuke it, not realizing that it&#39;s lost all of its flavor due to years of unsealed refrigeration? Yeah.  That&#39;s what it tasted like.  But you just paid $3 for it.

I remember this SNL skit done by Bill Murray, Dan Aykoryd, and John Belushi. Oh the hilarity! Now, according to a few friends of mine, this is one of the many tourist attractions to see because of 1.) the SNL Skit 2.) the Cubs curse and 3.) cheezborger! 

We came here for lunch the day of our departure and I was a bit excited because of the 3 reasons above. Their are many locations in Chicago of the Billy Goat Tavern, but the original (I believe from what locals say) is located on Michigan Ave lower level. We stopped by to take pictures of the place and it was really cool! Anyway, I got a cheezborger and the food is okay. So far, the burgers in Chicago have not been as great as I expected them to be, but everything else is pretty darn good. The burger is plain and simple, but I guess that is the beauty of this tavern/grill...simplicity! My California friends and I were shocked at how low the prices were for food! We shared fries, which I thought were good. I gave this place 4 stars for the service, low prices, and the atmosphere. A lot of locals come here and you get a welcoming feeling from the locals, as well as, the workers. Tons of TVs on the wall to watch sports and what not.

I had the pork mofongo with Puerto Rican rice (yellow rice with veggies). The pork was tender and lightly fried and came with a buttery garlic sauce. The mofongo tasted as good as any in Puerto Rico. The bf had a chicken jibarito (which is a sandwich made from plantain) with a side of rice and a beef empanada. Our friends had half a jibarito and the chuletas. The jibaritos came with a fantastic garlic sauce that set off the already fantasy flavors. Our food came quickly and our waitress was sweet, she even helped give us tips during our Heads Up game!
They&#39;re BYOB so we made ourselves some rum and cokes to go along with our delicious meal. And for $55 for our group of 4, this family owned spot is the place to be!"

La Cocina Boricua de la Familia Galarza is one of the most legit Puerto Rican restaurants around. As many have said, it is family-owned and, as a result, is very homestyle, cozy, and comforting. 

Stopped by here the other day with my S.O. As soon as we arrive, there is a full table of 10 unvested, on-duty Chicago PD detectives and police officers. All of them packing heat and staring intensely at us. If that ain&#39;t true Chicago-style, I don&#39;t know what is. You know the food is good when all the cops roll up to eat at the joint.

And NO DUH... The food is good here, dummy. Their jibaritos -- a Puerto Rican x Chicago sandwich made of two pieces of flattened, fried green plaintains as the bread with some type of meat filling, sliced tomatoes, mayonnaise, melted white American cheese, and lettuce -- is seriously so darn juicy and honestly almost flawless. Not too greasy, not too salty, not too anything. The arroz con gandules (aka P.R. Rice), that comes with it, is a perfect blend of rice, sofrito, tomato sauce, Sazon, and pigeon peas. If I can get real for a second, I will say that I like it even better than the one at the original source, Borinquen Restaurant (now El Nuevo Borinquen) on California ave. 

We also shared one alcapurria and one pastel as an appetizer. Both of them had a nice, well-seasoned, not-too-dry chicken filling. I&#39;ve never had an alcapurria before, but theirs was pretty good. It was like a large, green plaintain-based croquetta. And the pastel? Damn... I love me some pasteles. Theirs was flavored with the banana leaves they wrapped it in, and the mashed green plaintains that made up the masa base was soooo mouth-melting soft. I often wish that pasteles would be available at other times other than Christmas. But if you come here, you don&#39;t gotta wait. You can have it year-round, baby!

Note: The only bummer was that they seemed to have taken the mofongo off their menu. C&#39;mon! Where is my mofongo? Bring that back!"

Once upon a time it was an establishment that seemed to of been taken very seriously, but for some reason it has downgraded with not only service, but more importantly food. I am not a fan of food that is reheated and sits at the counter for more than ten minutes before coming to the table, especially when there are only about 5 patrons in the whole restaurant. 

I was once a regular here but know for a fact that since owners have changed, the downgrade is evident. What ever happened to down home cooking and just plain and simple howdy you do when you come into an establishment. I just think that the aura of the place has changed. Mind you, the food at best was mediocre compared to what it use to be. Did they change chefs and/or since the other people working here are no longer here, did it just completely change altogether? I would hope that it would stay the same but alas, it is most indubitably different. (Insert sad face here) 

Chicago has always been welcoming to the Latin cuisine and for that I am happy due to my culture always being represented with food and seasonings, but this time around I can&#39;t say it is so. The change is evident and the food has suffered tremendously. I shutter to the fact that although it was not crowded, it took forever to even get a glass of water (and did I mention the glass of water had pink lipstick stains, heck I don&#39;t use that shade of pink). 

I think that was definitely the last time I come here due to the fact that there are way more Latin inspired restaurants to try instead of coming to a place that has since lost its fizzle. Oz has spoken and well, good luck."

We ordered:
-lechon plate: My partner was a HUGE fan of this - it&#39;s a pile of tasty roast pork, with rice and tostones. What&#39;s not to love?
- pork jibarito: As I already mentioned, it was a LOT of food! Very tasty, though. I&#39;ll get the half portion next time. I also enjoyed the rice and pigeon peas.
- alcapurria - really tasty fritter patty, and at the price, easily a quick and cheap meal on its own.
- tostones - Obviously delicious and crisp, but we shouldn&#39;t have ordered it, given our main dishes. I love the mojo that came with it.

There are a good number of Latin restaurants, but this one is amazing that is not in Humboldt Park and is strictly Puerto Rican.

We sat ourselves and we instantly felt like we were at Abuelita Elena&#39;s. If you don&#39;t feel the love in a Puerto Rican or most Latin restaurants, then it is not legit.

We get complimentary cups of chicken noodle soup and bread. That soup was delish and could have had so much more of it! Seriously heartwarming.

Being newbies to the restaurant, the boo and I ordered everything, so we know for next time. We got two pasteles, a mofongo, a lechon jibarito and a chicken guisado (both with arroz con gandules) and a side of yuca al mojo.

The pasteles were pretty good and definitely satisfied my craving. These are similar to tamales and had pork in them. The mofongo was quite good as well, as the accompanied sauce worked well with the garlicky pork plantain mash. I also enjoyed the jibarito (plantain sandwich) and this was pretty massive. We had to take half of it home. The arroz con gandules was very satisfying. The flavors were definitely there. The rice was just a touch over. The chicken guisado was definitely one of the highlights of the night. The sauce was a little different from what I&#39;m used to but it was amazingly tasty. The chicken was super juicy and falling off the bone. Portion was also very satisfying. The mojo sauce was addicting and could eat that with everything. I asked for a plastic container to bottle up the remaining mojo, but the lady brought over two mojo filled containers instead. Score!

The owner stopped by and chatted us for a bit. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. Didn&#39;t have to wait too long for anything. 

Definitely coming back and trying some other dishes, in addition to some favorites.

Nothing compares to grandma&#39;s home cooking, but this is a close second."

We were so happy to find out that we could actually eat the arroz con gandules. Being a no pork eater, many Puerto Rican dishes end up being off limit. They use Turkey in their arroz con gandules.

Earlier this year the friend and I visited San Juan, PR and had authentic mofongo and love it! However, the mofongo I ordered from La Boricua was different than I remember and did not contain fish or prawns. It was a take out order placed over the phone, so it may not have been exactly clear what I wanted. I may have to try this spot again next time I am in town. It was slightly overpriced for Bucktown.

Apparently being the person who always wants to share, even when the other party isn&#39;t planning on it, is frowned upon.  I wouldn&#39;t know.  I pretty much always get my way.

Anyhow, that article made me think of all the wonderful dishes I would have missed out on if I didn&#39;t always SUGGEST sharing.  I mean, I would never flat out say &#34;you get that and I&#39;ll get this and we can share&#34;.  Alright, I would, because that&#39;s typically how it goes down, but it almost always pays off.

I tried half a steak jibarito and half of the lechon and both were exactly as I&#39;d hoped.  I don&#39;t like to give Mark G credit for pretty much anything, but his review where he describes the cheese as a chihuahua/mozzarella type is spot on.  It&#39;s creamy and thickish, yet melts wonderfully, and I have no clue what it actually is.  While jibaritos are one of my favorite foods, the American cheese they put on it typically makes me gag.  Way to switch it up La Cocina!  Way to switch it up.

Even though it wasn&#39;t my special day, I ordered like it was.  That means when I heard &#34;I want guachitos, you&#39;ll like them,&#34; my mind was thinking &#34;blahblahblah, papa rellena&#34;.  Look, you either need to come here starving, or come here looking for two meals from one.  The portions are pretty big, especially when you consider the prices.  Additionally, they give you chicken soup and bread.  Before the jibaritos even came out, I was basically full and ready to go home and put on sweatpants.  I didn&#39;t though.  We still had beer to drink and it would be a travesty to have two types of jibaritos placed in front of you and not try them fresh from the kitchen.  Both meats were very tender and very flavorful.  The nice thing about La Cocina is that instead of making one giant jibarito and cutting it in half, they make two smaller (and I use that word loosely) ones.  

The only thing I wasn&#39;t crazy about was their arroz con gandules.  I might be spoiled from growing up with a Puerto Rican best friend whose grandma makes the best rice I&#39;ve ever had, but theirs had a weird taste I couldn&#39;t put my finger on.  It wasn&#39;t bad, it was just too noticeably different for my liking.

La Cocina is definitely one of my top spots for jibaritos, and the fact that it&#39;s byob is pretty sweet too."

The platanos - mouthwatering. For a hint of comida Boricua in the Midwest, this isn&#39;t a terrible first try, but I know there is more to explore. (Hopefully, with more veg friendly options!)"

All of the people who work here are literally the nicest. Their jibarito&#39;s are rly good steak sandwiches but better because who even needs bread when you have plantains. Also you get this crazy delicious soup with your meal and the warm feelings of not being surrounded by hipsters.

Today, I decided to go with my daughter. This is a very family friendly place, with quick service and just damn genuinely nice people running this restaurant. 
  
The steak jibarito was off the chart!!  The plantain was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside unlike other places I have tried where its just so darn dry. The steak in the jibarito was not fatty, and very tasty. The arroz con gandules was delicious, not oily but well done. 

I was so happy to have tried this place. Unfortunately, I have to tell my big brother that he was right (hate telling my siblings when they are right about anything. LOL).  Best Jibarito I have ever had. YUM!!!"

I got the chicken jibarito and my husband got the steak one, both were delish as was the Puerto Rican rice that came on the side.

La Cocina Boricua sets the bar for latin sandwich cuisine in Chicago.  
Not only are the sandwiches:
well crafted, 
crispy, 
well-cheesed, 
well-garlicked, 
and balanced with flavor... 
But they also pile on sides of rice and soup to make sure that you will get your fill.  
If there is an apocalypse, I am loading up here since one meal will last me for days.  

If the meal (1) didn&#39;t mess with my inferiority complex of not being able to handle all the food, and (2) didn&#39;t make me want to lounge all day... then I would eat it a LOT more often.  But for the sake of fighting back my fat-kid tendencies, I can only indulge in this deliciousness occasionally. 

P.S. the service here is all warm and fuzzy.  The ladies that waited on me were both personable and friendly.  They gave me the kind of feeling of a neighborhood mom making sure that I eat - and that I eat MORE than enough."

We were welcomed by the owner, who had our table ready from the time I called.  The decor is homey and quaint, and dominated by the wonderful smell of home cooked island fare.  

She talked to us a bit about their specials before we reviewed the menu.  It&#39;s a BYOB, BTW, with a liquor store just next door.  They had these lovely fried plantain chips that were sprinkled with a little garlic salt.  Amazing!  I had a whole fried snapper that was so fresh and garlicky... my wife had a chicken special.

Being pretty familiar with the area I decided I would try it out and see what all of the fuss was about. I came on a Sunday evening around 6pm, and there was a fairly decent crowd. The place is self-seating style, so of course I chose the seat closest to the kitchen to smell all of the deliciousness!! The restaurant has a very cozy feel, with lots of Puerto Rican memorabilia hanging around on the walls.

 A few minutes after sitting down, we were greeted by a very friendly waitress who asked us if we had any questions about anything on the menu. After asking for more time, she came back a few minutes later with literally the most amazing chicken soup I&#39;ve ever tasted. Generally I&#39;m not a fan of chicken soup, but this was amazing! So after my indecisiveness started to kick in, I decided to practice some Spanish and ask for some suggestions. The look on the waitresses face was priceless! It was like &#34;este moreno habla español?&#34; Haha. But back to the review. 

I ended up ordering the Combo Caribe (Pork Chop/Chuleta, Tamal, Tostones, and arroz con gandules) along with &#34;Guachitos&#34; for an appetizer. One word.....DELICIOUS!!! The guachitos (tostón, guacamole &amp; salami) had the perfect blend of flavors! The combo caribe gave me everything I wanted (definitely use the salsa de ajo on the tostones...AMAZING)! I must say that I am now obsessed with &#34;tropi-coco&#34; (a carbonated coconut drink). I literally went out and bought a case after I left haha.

Overall a great experience and I will definitely be back to try out some other options!"

This restaurant has a cray long name, but it&#39;s worth stumbling through because it is the bomb. My boyfriend (at the time) and I were hunting for a new spot and the Yelp photos didn&#39;t lie. This place is so authentic that you shouldn&#39;t be surprised if a Puerto Rican abuelita comes out to give you your food and in the process, tells your boyfriend how bonita you are and that he should lock it down. 

The food gives me anxiety in the best way possible. I wanted to order everything on the menu. Everyone has raved about the jibaritos and I&#39;ll do the same--but the mofongo also hit the spot on a cold day.

&#34;Um, ok.&#34;
&#34;That means the Puerto Rican Kitchen of the Galarza Family!&#34;
&#34;OK.&#34;

Clearly, I was the more excited party to try this restaurant (note the exclamations).  It&#39;s a cozy restaurant with nine tables (two are booths).  On an early Saturday evening, there were only two tables full when we arrived.  The place was totally full by the time we left.  I felt like I really was dining in someone&#39;s kitchen at home.

I had the steak jibarito.  A jibarito is a sandwich, but it&#39;s a sandwich with PLAINTAINS instead of bread!  I haven&#39;t had decent plaintains since I was in the Dominican Republic last year.  They were crispy and a little greasy, and the steak was tender.  I liked the white cheese they used as well.  I threw some salt on those plaintains, added some Valentina hot sauce and chowed down!

They also serve complimentary chicken noodle soup and bread when you dine.  I thought it was a nice touch.  Dinner has never been this inexpensive for us in the city - only $20 for both of us!  

There&#39;s a huge cooler of sodas, including Jarritos (they have pineapple!) and Mexican non-alcoholic sangria.

Don&#39;t worry about the mouthful of the name of this place.  La Cocina&#39;s menus are in Spanish and English.

Worth noting:  It&#39;s right down the street from Tile Outlet.  I live in the suburbs, but I remember this commercial from my childhood.  I&#39;ll be honest that I squealed when I saw Tile Outlet and belted out, &#34;TILE OUTLET 2444 WEST FULLERTON IN CHICAGO - JUST THREE BLOCKS WEST OF THE KENNEDY EXPRESSWAY!&#34;"

I ordered the Jibarito which is steak sandwiched between two jumbo plantains without expecting much, and was floored when I tasted it. It was one of the best things I&#39;ve ever eaten in my life.....no kidding. It was that damn good.

 I also ordered an empanada which had some form of picadillo (beef, potatoes, carrots) inside. It was really tasty. The puerto rican rice and beans (both mixed together and served seperately) were simply divine. I heart the food here, and was glad the person who brought me here, did. Their soup is super good as well and would be good for a hangover as well. I believe we ordered the plantains and garlic sauce too which was good but I prefer my plantains a little more on the crispy side. 

All in all, this place is amazing and delicious and the employees are friendly and make sure you enjoy your food. I&#39;ve ordered pickup from here and it was still just as good. This is the beginning of a beautiful relationship."

The only complaint I have is that I didn&#39;t go sooner.  The welcome from the woman I assume is an owner/partner was warm and genuine.  She made a great suggestion to try to mofongo since I was already familiar with the pork jibarito (tried it in several other restaurants).  My wife got the fried chicken and we shared an order of the Guachitos (tostones with guacamole and sausage).  

All of it was amazing.  Prices were reasonable and we took almost half home as leftovers.  The owner/server/most friendly host was great, as was the other staff.

Really the kind of restaurant experience I wish I found more often.  Everything was better than expected and I&#39;m excited to take friends and try other menu items."

The staff here is always on top of things and the service is always good and friendly.  The cost is small for the quality of the food served.  I love the chicken gisado (spelling) and the jibaritos.  I wrk down the block and come here at least once a week.  The Puerto RIcan rice is delicious.  A combo of flavored rice and small beans (peas).  Works with any dish. The homemade chicken soup is always tasty. I only wish they had some more vegetable choices as sides. But aside from that this place always hits the spot.  No alcohol so BYOB."

It&#39;s definitely worth it and more. I have tried the pork jibarito which is also very yummy. I just took my roommate there today, it was his first time. He got the cocina combination which was the lechon, tostones, and rice. He said it was the best Puerto Rican food he has ever had. The service there is also great. Patty is amazing!!!!

Not in place of the chicken one but also getting the steak one so that I could have had two jibaritos. The savory plantains that serve as buns + succulent meat + copious veggies and cheese = perfection. The rice is your typical Latin American rice (think Spanish rice).

The pork chops are a little too dry for my liking but if you mix it with the avocado, garlic oil and sweet plantain, it&#39;ll work wonders in your mouth.

Lastly, they have some type of passion-fruit juice that must be tried. It&#39;s sweet but not too sweet that it overpowers everything else you are eating.

The lady serving us could not be sweeter and they give you free soup and bread. She actually even comped us on the drink as well saying that we &#34;had to try it.&#34;

All for around 12 bucks a person? I&#39;ll be back again.

Personal Recommendation: Jibarito with any type of meat inside."

With no urge to cook, I decided that it felt like a sit down restaurant kind of night. But it&#39;s so hard to choose, with the insane amount of restaurants to choose from. So it became one of those random point on the yelp map picks. 

So after a quick ride down the Fullerton bus, we arrived at Cocina Boricua. The place looks like any other cute mom + pop owned place- lots of random pictures all over the walls, a small waterfall in the corner, and a cute little bar. We were immediately greeted by a bunch of smiling faces as we walked in, and the place was not very crowded at 7pm on a Sunday.

The place is BYOB, and as soon as the waitress saw that we had a bottle of wine she brought out two glasses and a corkscrew for us. So nice of her :) She was patient with us as we debated over the many tasty options on the menu. We started off with some empanadas (beef and chicken), they were good, the chicken was one of the best empanadas I&#39;ve ever had. I finally decided on what was recommended by many yelpers: the steak jibarito. The boyfriend ordered the pork with plantains. She brought us out some bread, but none of the soup that everyone talked about. 

Our food came out quickly, everything was hot and delicious. The jibarito was amazing (you actually get two sandwiches, each a full meal for me), every bite melted in my mouth. The plantains were crispy and the rice was good. The pork was really good, nice and tender. 

After we finished our meal, paid our check and left a tip, we still had a bit of wine to finish so we stayed and talked. The waitress continued to refill our water glasses, which is something most servers wont do (usually they ignore a table after it has paid). Such fantastic service!"

The place was pretty busy but the wait was only about 30 minutes and there&#39;s an awesome arcade bar next door to help pass the time.

She was really all over the place, checking on customers, cleaning, bringing out food and drinks, etc.. The staff in general was great. Initially I was going to order a steak sandwich, but Patty told me (almost demanded) I should order the steak jibarito instead. I&#39;ve never had one before, and I&#39;m glad I ordered it. The fried plantains were perfect and the Puerto Rican rice was delicious. For dessert we got the tiramisu, which came with some whipped cream and a strawberry cut to look like a rose.

The jibarito has certain earned a spot on my the top 10 must eat in life.  It also lends another reason why humans remain the apex predator because of good roast pork done very well.

Going there for dinner was like dining at one&#39;s favorite aunt&#39;s home.  The hostess (probably the owners or related to...) treated us like family, very friendly and gracious.  The decor is cozy and sets the stage for a great casual dining experience.  We were not hurried after having finished our meal even though new patrons left after being told of the wait time for a table.

Tried the chicken roll on a bed of salad. Exquisite!

Across from Chase Park, on the corner of Clark and Leland, &#34;Bella &#39;Mbriana&#34; replaced Cha&#39;va coffee shop about a year ago.

Well, both names of their establishments have apostrophes.  Rosa J., the English grammar fanatic, dragged hubby along this morning for a run and enticed him with some delicious light lunch.  

&#34;Bella &#39;Mbriana&#34; is actually a full-service restaurant if you choose to dine in.  However, coffee, panini, or gelato to-go are available.  The young man in the house speaks fluent Italian and has connections with other family members from Naples.  I recalled that hubby talked about Naples sometimes since it&#39;s like a hour and 30 minutes train-ride south from Rome.  

We ordered these following drinks and dishes: 
- cappuccino: yes, it was strong, so don&#39;t go for that before a 1.5 mile run.  Nevertheless, it was exquisite and authentic.  
- caffe d&#39;orzo: it resembles the look of coffee, yet it&#39;s non-caffeinated and made out of grain.  In other words, it looked very deceiving.  The taste of this would surprise you because it was light, soothing, and resulting no post-caffeine effects.  
- speck sandwich: it was one of the lunch specials of the day this young man mentioned.  I liked the crunchiness of walnuts that complemented the salty speck.  
- tuna sandwich: it appeared to have some pesto sauce in it.  I&#39;m a fan of pesto, so I probably will order this next time.  
- pistachio gelato: when I first looked at it, the color seemed to be more like old wasabi.  Once I began to taste it, this was amazingly delicious.  All gelati were homemade, and they probably used the matured pistachio nuts based on the color I observed.  
- stracciatella: some said it&#39;s an Italian version of chocolate chip ice cream with more smooth texture and taste.  Hubby enjoyed the gelato and was glad that this place exists since I&#39;ve started running and working out at Chase Park.  

I think this neighborhood joint is truly a gem.  Transportation wise, paid street parking, CTA #81 (Lawrence), #22 (Clark), and #78 (Montrose) busses are available.  This isn&#39;t too far from the Metra Ravenswood stop (Ravenswood/Lawrence...approximately 4 blocks west) and CTA Lawrence Red Line station (pass Lawrence and Broadway...approximately 3 blocks away east)."

Well we love it too and have enjoyed fantastic dinners there...incredible owners and staff and such a calm place to feast on Italian  food. We have yet to leave a morsel of food on our plates it&#39;s so good...and the sauces rule. They are getting their liquor license in a couple weeks. Wishing them the best of luck and success.

Having tried multiple soup and panini for lunches, the quality has always been high and reminiscent of authentic Italian Cafe fare.

Now, if they just introduced aperitivo--between here and the nearby Spacca Napoli, I could get my Italian fix anytime."

It&#39;s a simple place, with tables parallel to the front counter and a few more in the room to the side.  If you knew Cha&#39;va Cafe (the old business in this location), you&#39;ll understand the layout.  For the daytime hours, the concept is casual Italian, ordering food at the counter and eating at one of the tables.  We haven&#39;t been for dinner yet, but it appears the dinner service may be a little more formal, with a fixed price, multi-course meal on the menu.  

For our first visit, we had breakfast, consuming some delicious pastries (excellent Italian &#39;donuts&#39; fried right before your eyes, a pastry similar to a brioche, and an amazing biscotto) along with even better coffee.  The coffee is sourced from Italy (Caffe Moreno) and is excellent.  Service was also outstanding.  Highly recommended, and we look forward to going back to explore more of the menu."

I&#39;m a little concerned about the location as it seems to be in a place that doesn&#39;t get a lot of traffic, but I&#39;m hoping the people in the neighborhood will help keep it in business.  I ordered a meatball sub and was very happy to have that perfect combination of crisp bread and soft meatball.  The tomatoes in the Caprese Salad also tasted like they came right out of someone&#39;s garden.  I grabbed a menu on the way out, hoping they had a delivery service for another night, but the nice man behind the counter told they aren&#39;t delivering at this time.  That being said, I think I&#39;ll probably stop in for a coffee and gelato when I&#39;m on the 22 and maybe pick up a sandwich for home."

Yes, this review is entirely based on a gelato experience, and that&#39;s okay. There were about 8-10 gelato flavor options. I decided on cherry, remembering the delicious fresh fruit gelato of Italy. However, this fell short. Far too icey to be considered gelato. I&#39;m not sure if they stored it too cold or for too long. I nearly threw it out. My grocery store gelato tasted more Italian than this, which is very sad! I wouldn&#39;t go back for gelato, maybe for food or their other desserts."

Is this a coffee shop or an Italian restaurant?  I bit the bullet and entered and I&#39;m glad I did.  Now I get it. It&#39;s a laid back Italian concept cafe where couples eat plates of (delicious) pasta alongside people on laptops sipping cappuccino.  Order at the counter and plates are delivered to your table. My gnocchi was piping hot and very flavorful.  The finishing olive oil was to die for. Affordable enough to come in and have a panini and do work but can also see myself meeting friends here for a full Italian meal.

The interior is well designed, the walls are orange and it has a nice, relaxing vibe.

First impressions: the decor isn&#39;t inviting, and honestly feels like a cafeteria. The pastry selection is lacking, as are the ready-made sandwiches in the fridge. Not sure if they&#39;re working with local bakers/vendors, but the offerings seem cheap and store bought. I&#39;d be shocked to learn if anything is made in house. Unimpressed with the coffee, as it tastes stale and like cleaning solution. And they don&#39;t even offer milk options at the counter, just cheap packets of creamer. My lemon tart was forgettable and too sweet. I&#39;m so disappointed that I have to go further north or west for a decent cafe experience."

Also, we heard they make their own gelato including authentic pistachio which was our favorite snack in Rome last year. Went last night for dinner. The atmosphere is a little sterile and coffee-shop-ish, which is fine if you&#39;re going for coffee or gelato, but it wasn&#39;t very comfortable for dinner. Food was an A+. (Even though they were out of pistachio gelato.) We had spaghetti with zucchini and leeks, a gorgonzola risotto and a burratta antipasto. Delicious, all of it. Unfortunately, the service was awful! We waited almost 40 minutes between our appetizer and entrees. No one came to check on us. Then after the food was served, we did not see a waiter again until we asked for the check. They don&#39;t serve bread or breadsticks or anything, which could have kept us distracted... So, we&#39;re torn. We live in walking distance, so will be back for gelato or espresso. Dinner?

They have a good cocktail menu. We tried the caiprinha (very tasty) and this other vodka based cocktail. both were well done the 1st time around.

Food wise, the hubby&#39;s El Filet was way better than the Costeleta Organica. The filet was tender. I have to remember to get that next time. Costeleta was too tough to cut through even thought it was cooked medium to rare and it didn&#39;t have much flavor. But the regular mashed potatoes are better than the spinach mashed potatoes that came with the El Filet.  

Service was fairly attentive. They kept their delicious bread coming. The drinks were slow to arrive the 2nd time around and I was pretty much done with my dinner."

I had the opportunity to visit Folklore again, and they hit it out of the park - specifically, the steak was wonderful and more than made up for the paltry first visit.  

Drinks:
We went on a Wednesday night, and the caipirinha were $7.  There must have been 6 whole limes in the drink, which was impressive in and of itself.  The TEY QUERISI MEING (that&#39;s take it easy man, for those who can&#39;t figure it out - I didn&#39;t and made an idiot of myself) was once again stellar.  I said it before and I&#39;ll say it again, it&#39;s a good thing I can&#39;t make them at home.  I asked for a spicy red, and they brought me a glass that wasn&#39;t even on the menu; it was perfect.

I ordered the Solotario with gorgonzola; took the cheese off the steak - it didn&#39;t need it.  At all.  And, by the way, I ordered rare, and it was indeed rare!!!!  My dining companion ordered the skirt steak, WITHOUT membrane (which I recommend unless you know what you&#39;re getting into) and it was also delicious.

Service was attentive but relaxed, empanadas once again didn&#39;t disappoint, two thumbs up!

I&#39;ll be back, but now at least I know what to order to get my steak on properly."

Nothing like a candle lit dinner (and live ~soothing~ guitar music) for a date night or just a girls&#39; night out. They also have indoor and outdoor seating. We came here on a late Thursday night and the outdoor area was packed but the indoor had plenty of seating.

We weren&#39;t very hungry so we started off with drinks. Got the Pisco Sour which was DELICIOUS (highly recommend) and the Fernando which had quite a kick to it. We also had a couple empanadas which were very good. I saw another Yelp review recommending the berenjena so I got it and I agree, it is on point cheesy eggplanty goodness!

The service was a little on the slow side but the waiter was very friendly (even helped me pronounce berenjena without judging me). Be prepared as it&#39;s a little bit on the pricey side if you&#39;re getting more food, but worth it IMO for the location and the ambience!"

Ambiance is nice with candle lighting and the for large tables you don&#39;t feel too crowded.

Appetizers for really tasty. Tried the empanada sampler and got a taste of beef, chicken, corn, spinach and ham and cheese. The dough was flaky and the ratio of dough to filling was good. Also tried the provoleta. The cheese was delicious with bread. I enjoyed this more than the empanadas.

For entrees, my husband and I shared the rack of lamb and bone in ribeye. The rack of lamb was overseasoned with herbs. Could not even taste the meat and it was on the salty side. The dish would have been good if they held back a bit with the seasoning. The bone in ribeye was cooked very well. Our cut had a lot of tendons in it so it was a bit chewy. However, the flavor was great. We had mashed potatoes for a side and it was creamy and buttery. Complimented the meat well.

The servings are huge here and you get a lot of value for steak. Cocktails are also very good. Everything is made fresh."

Once seated we were served some nice bread while we looked over the menu. I had the Costella Organica which was one of the Chef&#39;s Specials. The dish was a Rib-Eye steak topped with onions with a side of mashed potatoes. For $30 I was blown away with the size of the portion and the quality of the dish. In my opinion it towered over the other steaks for double the price at the high end franchises in Chicago. 

We were served a complimentary salad before the main course arrived as well. Service was quick and they allow split checks.

Service 10/10
Food 12/10

Ordered the Parrilla. The meat is cooked really well. Crisp edges and tender inside. Breads were GORGEOUS. And the ambience and servers are wonderful. Which would have made this a four star place.

BUT.

I found the chorizo and blood sausages to be salty. The salad was meh. Provolita and sweet beef empanadas were okay. Walk in knowing that you are paying for the ambience and service and not just for the food, and you&#39;re golden.

I believe it is the same owner as Tengo Sur, another place I love!!  I came here on Thursday and a live band was jamming away.  Turns out Friday is 20% off all hospital employees and teachers. I love that this place supports those fields.   Anyway, it was comfortably busy.  All the tables were filled but the service was still great and I could actually hear the other members at my table. 

Food:
- chorizo sausage - you get two links which is quite enough to get the appetite going.  
- vesuvio -beef steak filled with cheese. We got it medium rare and it didn&#39;t exactly meet my expectation. However, it was still good and the sides (spinach and potatoes) were amazing. 
- berenjena - AMAZING!!!  This reminded me of eggplant parmigiana combined with ritolo.  breaded eggplant covered with plenty of sauce.  This was definitely the fan favorite of the table.
- rack of lamb - also amazing.  it came with great sweet potato mash as well

Drinks 
- la negra - very good. it&#39;s great for alcohol newbies as well.


I would definitely come back and hope to!"

I am a Division Street neighbor and feel so lucky to have it on the block. It fits so many needs -- date night, solo dinner at the bar, family gathering, al fresco during the summer or a cold, snowy night, &#34;spendy night&#34; or cheap happy hour. They have an interesting wine list, and the food is well-matched to the ambiance. The vibe inside is very relaxing, with ample candlelight and low-key music. On the whole, they have knowledgeable, friendly staff. (Of course, every once in a while you get somebody who is busy.) I don&#39;t even eat meat and I love the food - the empanadas are a great bar snack or can be made into a full meal, and the eggplant appetizer is one of the most delicious dishes ever. 

I just think it&#39;s rare when a place can flex to whatever the situation calls for, and so just wanted to say thank you Folklore for always being there for the neighborhood."

Folklore was a great experience. The mood inside the restaurant is very intimate FYI. I believe its the first thing I noticed. The dining area&#39;s main source of light is by candle...real candles too, not those electronic ones you tend to see here and there. I thought I was going to accidentally light the bread napkin on fire while passing the basket down the table. 

Any-who back to the review, it is street parking only so be prepared to search. We found a pay to park a block or two down the way. The restaurant is located right on the corner. As I said above, the restaurant has an intimate setting. A friend called it &#34;boo-lighting&#34;, yet its great for families and friend dinners as well. The service was good. The waiter was very laid back and insightful on the menu. I ordered the Medio Pollo Y Limon which was the half chicken with lemon sauce. I switched the wedges out for mashed potatoes. The lemon sauce was AMAZING, yet the chicken was very much so dependent on it. It wasn&#39;t very flavorful without the sauce. The mashed potatoes were great! I went with a large group, and it seemed the stars of the night were the steaks! I highly suggest getting a steak over chicken if you&#39;re indecisive and you enjoy red meat. Everyone with a type of beef or pork raved about their food.  

My drink and dessert were good. I forget the name of my dessert,  but it tasted like a big pastry and it wasn&#39;t very sweet. The dessert star seemed to be the Carmel Cheese cake.  I will certainly visit Folklore again in order to try a more popular dish."

I ordered a second cocktail hoping maybe it was the first one (the spicy tequila cocktail) that was a fluke, but the second (whiskey based with absinthe) was no better.

But the food here is delicious, and I couldn&#39;t bring myself just to give 3 stars. I had the el filet, corn and spinach empanadas. Yes, I&#39;m a pig. Skip the spinach empanada (really mediocre) and go straight for the corn--- that sauce the corn is coated in is legit. Now, I&#39;m not a fan of steak, and usually go for the seafood dishes, but I figured I had to get a steak dish at a steakhouse. Plus I&#39;ve never had Argentinian food before, and I wanted to experience as much as possible. I ordered my steak medium, and it was cooked to perfection. This actually is one of the best steaks I&#39;ve ever had, and I savored every bite. Also, the servings here are huge--- I got two big pieces of steak, ate half of one (stuffed from the empanadas and drinks) and had lunch for the next two days. Even when I was rewarming the steak, it still was just as good as the first day. The spinach mashed potatoes that accompanied it was pretty darn good as well.

You&#39;ll have to be really patient with the service when you&#39;re here, but just grab some drinks and enjoy the patio!"

This place is the perfect spot for a date night; the dark ambiance, candlelight, and tiny tables are perfectly suited for romance.  We were also lucky enough to come on an evening when they were playing live music which further added to the experience. 

They do not normally take reservations for small groups but the awesome host bent the rules for us because we were celebrating. We were greeted quickly and offered a prime spot in the corner near the front windows. Our friendly waiter greeted us right away and helped me sort through their amazing cocktail program. I was totally torn but he steered me in the right direction in the form of a pomegranate mojito. Even though I&#39;m not a rum girl I couldn&#39;t have gone with a better pick. 

When it comes to the food the choices aren&#39;t much easier... we struggled to sort through the vast menu which had so many awesome choices. We started off by splitting a corn empanada and the proscuitto with hearts of palm. I have to say both were great but the true standout was the empanada, so much so that I ended up ordering another one and while my boyfriend opted to order the chicken. Neither disappointed and it&#39;s also worth mentioning that the vinaigrette they serve these with is an unexpectedly awesome complement to the empanadas.

As for entrees we both knew we wanted steak but choosing one proved to be a quite challenging endeavor with both of us ordering something we had not walked in the door expecting to. I went with the El Filet off of the Chef&#39;s Specials menu and was totally blown away. I was presented with two perfectly done filets drowning in an outstanding onion sauce along with a heaping pile of spinach mashed potatoes. It couldn&#39;t have been any more delicious and I was almost disappointed that I was full I couldn&#39;t eat more of it! My boyfriend&#39;s entree, the Costeleta, was also ridiculously great. I was glad he chose something so completely different than my entree and that I got to try a sampling of the awesome fare that Folklore has to offer."

Had a few cocktails and I must admit they were pretty strong!! 

Order the churasco and while the flavor was good it was a bit too chewy for me. I didn&#39;t even finish it but that&#39;s maybe cuz I over indulged in the empanadas. Other wise I wouldn&#39;t mind coming again and maybe trying a different cut of meat. 

The atmosphere was very nice perfect for a date night with a significant other."

Every time we go there we embark on a romantic dinner  to Argentina. From their delicious meat delicacies to their famous Pisco Sour. The staff are very respectful and courteous. Prices are fair for the quality of the food and the ambiance of the restaurant. If you happen to go there during the week you will find live music. I feel the band is a great addition to the atmosphere. One thing I would definitely change is the level of noise coming from their speakers while the live band performs. I don&#39;t even feel that they need any speakers to add since the restaurant is not enormous. Customers should be able to talk to each other and not scream while the live band plays. In addition, the instruments are already acoustically loud enough to give a good amount of harmonious sound. Besides this I can&#39;t complain at all. 

Food: Try the fillet minion it is phenomenal with spinach smashed potatoes. The gravy is very flavorful. Beer prices are adequate. Their Empanadas are a 6/10. Chicago has way more places that produce better Empanadas, but overall would try as an appetizer.
Atmosphere: The candles by the bar gives this restaurant an Argentinian romantic Gothic authenticity. The place is beautifully constructed for a first date or for a nice classy not expensive dinner. 
Drinks:For a consistent Pisco Sour look for the guy with a hat on. He makes them the best out of everyone in the Chicago area. This place has the best Pisco&#39;s in all Chicago area! Will definitely be returning back.

PS: Desserts are not bad at all, not sure if you will even have space after eating a grandiose meal."

Amazing prices for what you get, which is a very nice restaurant and bar with a great cocktail list. Ambience is nice and romantic, but still fun. The candles were a nice touch, but this was not just a date spot because there were plenty of big groups. I&#39;m so glad I found this place on yelp and loved the surrounding area as well.

Food: complementary bread that kept coming warm and crispy but soft on the inside, house salads that come before most entrees- with all this you won&#39;t leave hungry for sure! Definitely get steak at this restaurant because the meat is very reasonably priced but still of good quality and flavor. I was very pleased with my sirloin medium rare. 

Drinks: a nice extensive cocktail list to choose from. Prices are expected of a nice restaurant ($10-12), but you can use the money you saved from the food. 

Overall a great find thanks to yelp reviews!"

First off, you walk in and the atmosphere totally grabs you. Makes you want to come back for a candlelit dinner (aka why we made a v-day rez right then and there!). 

We had the pineapple and pomegranate mojitos-yum! A little heavy on the sugar, but so delish. Our bartender was awesome, very friendly.

Complete menu with all the usual staples. Empanadas were good and come fried as opposed to oven-baked. Asado prepared very well and with lemon wedges.

A tip for groups: rather than order an asado for two, order two individual one-person asados. You get twice the food for a fraction more of the cost. 

Service was not strong on a Sunday afternoon. They had one server and one busser for an almost-full dining room. Clientele was mostly Argentines shooting for the traditional Sunday afternoon asado, but people seemed frustrated by the single, often-absent server. It was also freezing inside; the building appears to have a significant draft. Would give four stars if there was a better service experience, but it has all of the elements in the making of being a better experience."

It seems like the more expensive and non BYOB version. This review is just from sitting at the bar on a Friday night and ordering some drinks and empanadas...but the food menu just seems overpriced to me.

We sat at the bar and enjoyed a nice $12 cocktail each. We told our bartender we weren&#39;t really thinking of ordering food...and our cocktail glasses sat empty for a good ten minutes before he came back up to us and asked us if we wanted another. I just felt like we were snubbed a little bit by just sitting at the bar. We did actually want another drink and also an order of empanadas...but I was almost over it by the time I ordered it. 

The cocktails were made really well and I really enjoyed that part of the evening, just wish the service was on par to go along with it."

Luckily, we walked in around 715 on a Friday night and was seated quickly, by 8pm it was packed. I had the pisco sour to start with, so good but towards the end I realized there wasn&#39;t much liquor in it so I ended up getting a glass of pinot noir which was really good to end off the night. Tried the blueberry whiskey drink which was really good as well. Our server was busy but still attentive and very friendly. Had the beef, chicken and spinach and cheese empanadas, so good, but the best was the beef! We shared the para dos which is for two people, but more like for three, we took plenty home for leftovers. It always comes with a house salad and potatoes. My favorite was the grilled short ribs and the beef sweetbreads, the chorizo sausage was better than the flap meat. My least favorite was the black sausage. We did get dessert, I don&#39;t remember what it was called but it wasn&#39;t too sweet, they bring you out a platter and there&#39;s about 7 different ones to choose from."

I had the Empanadas (chicken, beef, and sweet beef) and they were awesome.  I also tried the Tortilla de Espinaca, it was okay, it tasted like a frittata.  We also tried their Provoleta, very yummy. Also tried the Ensalada Paisana - very yummy as well.

Highly recommend this place, I will definitely come back.  
Staff was very nice, pleasant, and attentive."

Management was very gracious in apologizing for the incident and asking for a chance to make it right.

As expected, the cocktails are still fantastic, and fortunately the food lived up to the expectations we had the first time we came in (definitely get some empanadas and the provoleta appetizer). Best of all, the service throughout was attentive and personal.

Based on this experience, we&#39;ll definitely be back."

This place is really convenient, which is all the more reason to drop by more frequently! 

The first time here we dined in. The service was very attentive and I absolutely loved the romantic decor. It has a dark atmosphere with real tall wick candles lot at each table. There was complimentary bread service, which tasted delicious. The bread came out hot, light, and buttery with a slight crisp to it. We ordered a few empanadas to share and agreed that the corn was the standout. For my entree, I got the tortilla de papas. Honestly, it was a little disappointing and I would not recommend you order it unless bland, dry food is your thing. I probably just didn&#39;t order the right menu item that time. They also brought us complimentary salads, which was great!

The second time here we carried out our meal. We arrived, told the host we wanted to order food to carry out, then he informed the guy behind the bar, who poured us water while we waited. For a little under $20, we got seven empanadas for $2.50 each. What a great deal! We enjoyed eating those from the comfort of the apartment. These are honestly the BEST empanadas I have ever had. The corn is still my favorite, but the spinach and cheese is also a leading contender. I don&#39;t eat meat, but my boyfriend does and he declared the beef is the best, complete with beef, egg, and cheese. We will absolutely be back for empanada carryout!"

I&#39;m one for trying different things when I&#39;m a repeat customer, but the meal I&#39;ve had was so good that there really is no reason to try anything else.  If my heart wouldn&#39;t explode in a month, I&#39;d eat it every other day.

Maybe God&#39;s nectar (liquor) is to blame.  I mean, it makes music sound even better and relatively unattractive women turn hotter than molten lava when you indulge in it...so maybe I should eat here and just drink sparkling water to see if my opinion is altered.

You&#39;re going to order three-four empanadas (which are outstanding).  

Then you&#39;re going to order the El Filet and shower me with praise because it is quite honestly the best $57 I&#39;ve ever spent ( 3 X&#39;s $29 = $57...I went to college).  Words cannot describe this meal, but you cut two cuts of meat and the spinach mashed potaters are second-to-none.

I even think the candles are better in this place.  They seem brighter than everywhere else and that&#39;s important when you&#39;re dining in Chicago because you need a cars headlights to read any menu across town when you eat after dusk.  

I&#39;d give this place 5 stars, but the waiters don&#39;t make you feel too terribly good about yourself with those fancy shmancy accents of theirs.  Two of the three visits I was with three women and their husbands and it&#39;s like these voices put them in a vampire-like trance.  

The ladies start throwing their hair back and checking their make-up in a compact when these jokers come close to check up on the table or ask if anybody wants desert.

It&#39;s completely ridiculous.  I don&#39;t go into the Spearmint Rhino in front of them and start fawning over all of the young maidens trying to make their way through this world.

Is there a Rhino in Chicagoland?

Eat here.  It&#39;s great."

They were very accommodating for our large group (10 people) and the second we walked throw the door (which was a little early) our table was ready. I was a bit nervous hosting a dinner here since I&#39;ve never been but everything was great! They have real candles lit on the table, which gives the dinner a really nice touch. The food and drinks were unique and tasty. Oh, I&#39;m not big on sweets but desserts were bomb. Our waiter was really attentive but not overbearing. Overall, folklore really made my dinner celebration an awesome experience for all of my friends. The only downside is parking. I had one friend say she was driving around for 20 minutes looking for a spot but I think everyone else got lucky. I&#39;ll definitely be back."

I obviously had to try this place at some point! We finally had one of those nights where there was so much snow and I was THRILLED to have found a parking space that was already shoveled out without any pesky dibs chairs in my way. There was no way I was going to surrender my precious parking spot to go somewhere for dinner. Folklore was a no-brainer. We were seated right away on a Friday evening, which was great because I was hungry. 

I noticed the romantic atmosphere right away. There are tall candlesticks on every table. Our host lit the candle as we were taking our seats. Not to be cheesy, but gazing into my date&#39;s eyes over candlelight had a great romantic vibe to it. We were provided with a basket of warm, soft, fluffy bread to enjoy while we perused the menu. This was perfect bread. I couldn&#39;t tell if they make the bread on the premises, but I was impressed by it. There were little plastic containers of butter, also. We decided on two empanadas to share as a starter. The gf doesn&#39;t eat meat, so we were stuck with spinach and corn. The corn was definitely the stand-out; I highly recommend ordering that one. The spinach one was decent; it had a lot of spinach in it, but it lacked flavor. the braided crust was amazing, though--crispy and light.  

I ordered a dish with an Italian name (which confused me a little because this is an Argentinian place) that was basically a meat party in my mouth with ham, beef, and mozzarella. My meal was pretty darn good and I felt like I got a filling portion for $19. As hungry as I thought I was, I ended up bringing leftovers home. I guess that&#39;s what I get for filling up on bread. My girlfriend had some kind of potato tortilla, which looked like a massive solid omelet/skillet. I thought it lacked flavor, though. It could use some hot sauce! I wished they had some type of condiment options to add spiciness to the food. 

I&#39;m definitely going to be back here. That corn empanada is the best one I&#39;ve ever had. We identified Folklore as the perfect place to enjoy a drink, the aforementioned empanadas, and maybe even dessert. (I know they have it, but we didn&#39;t look at the dessert menu this time around because we were so stuffed.) This is a solid addition to the Wicker Park dining scene and is definitely worth a visit for a romantic evening."

El filet with spinach mashed in a red wine onion reduction. Two huge filets for $30 includes a nice salad before the meal. The quality of the filet&#39;s were phenomenal. 

Warm crusty bread in the beginning. Appetizer of cheese fondue with olive oil, roasted red pepper, and herbs/spices.

Had the la pina cocktail. Absolutely delicious...

Partner had veal with chimichurri  and Vesuvio potatoes came with salad. Also had Malbec...

This was one of the best overall dining experiences I&#39;ve had in my 8 years of living in Chicago.

Environment: I really liked the set up of this place. The large communal tables mixed in with tables for parties of 2-4 and the soft lighting gives Folklore a real intimate feel.

Drinks: Each drink we tried we thoroughly enjoyed (thankful for Uber on this night). I recommend you try:
- Prickly Bear 
- Pisco Sour 
- Blackberry Mojito

Food: The food was divine, delicious, damn good! I sampled each dish that my friends ordered and I liked all of them equally. MMM my mouth is watering because my taste buds are crying out to go back to Folklore Argentine Grill. We had:

- Berenjena: some of the best eggplant i have ever had! If you don&#39;t like meat or feeling like you want to spare a cow...then try this dish.

- Bife Vesuvio: utterly amazing! I mean the steak was filled with spinach, cheese, garlic and mar del plata. I mean who ever thought up this dish ranks in the top 10 of my favorite people.

- Mar Y Tierra: 8oz filet with 2 jumbo shrimp. The steak was very flavorful and cooked to perfection. I love me some shrimp, especially when they word jumbo is involved.

-EL Filet: filet served with delicious spinach mashed potatoes.

I will be going back to Folklore again and again for sure!"

We ordered a parrillada para dos and a vacio. The most delicious side I have ever had was the spinach mashed potatoes.... Speechless!!!!

We had a Chilean red wine which was also a very nice treat, pepper undertones which really complimented the steak perfectly. I could not have been happier with the selection."

The bread is warm and a great starter before getting your meal. Don&#39;t get full off of it though! We decided to get two separate meals even though we knew the portions would be huge. They were. I got the churrasco and that was heaven. It was made just right and came with wedge potatoes. My partner got a steak stuffed with spinach and cheese. This was a huge portion, but unfortunately it was not what we were hoping it was. It was a little on the dry side and we wished we hadn&#39;t gotten it. However, it did reheat well the next day as a side for our breakfast! Overall, check this place out, share your plates, and don&#39;t get stuffed steaks."

Just seriously, Folklore, get the hell out of town because you have ruined everyone else&#39;s empanadas for me. You&#39;ve just ruined a little piece of my life with this pinnacle of very reasonably priced, multiple filling siren pockets. (Siren pockets are trademarked, so back off). 

I tried 5 different varieties and they all impressed. Perhaps the most unexpected were the corn, which really rung my bell. The meat choices were solid. The spinach was a true flavor explosion (wait, did you say implosion?) Did I mention that each type has a different exterior design, so you don&#39;t look like a jackass trying to mind reader the hell out of these argentine fortune cookies? I didn&#39;t attempt to eat anything else because why have the rump roast when you can have filet mignon (...and help me, I&#39;m poor). I also really appreciated the interior aesthetic...like a less funny version of Disney&#39;s Pirates of the Caribbean (that&#39;s a compliment, I&#39;m laughing at the pirates, not with them). I would have attempted to eat there but the lack of a shirt and increase in curse words shut that down.

We got 3 empanadas to start which were very tasty. For entrees: The person I was with had the chicken milanesa which he said was a slight disappointment. I had the gnocchi which was not bad but lacked some seasoning/flavor. The entrees each came with a salad which we did not realize so that was a nice surprise. The portions were all far more generous than expected. Plenty of vegetarian options.

As a vegetarian, I appreciated that there were a plethora of options for me. Notables included the Provoleta, which is argentine provolone cheese grilled with olive oil and roasted peppers. The cheese comes out gooey with crunchy, crusty, edges- DIVINE! The tortilla de papa was very well executed. The big surprise at Folklore was the heavy Italian influence that many dishes had. We got the fettucine (Tallarines) with white wine cream sauce that was out of this world! This cream sauce is special. It has lots of garlic and the perfect creamy texture.

I am not going to be biased in this review even though I do have extended relatives out in Argentina. Lol. 

Place of business/location: Restaurant has a location in the gentrified street called Division St. Division had been an impovershed area back in the 1990s. I am totally culture shocked by the rapid real estate development in this street area. Wow. Division may become the new &#34;Rush&#34; st of Chicago. Parking may be a frustration for first timers so please arrive early to get off street parking. The restaurant has a nice decor and can be seen on the corner street.  You can get off from the I-94 expressway. I give a rate of 4 . 

Hours of Operation: Restaurant caters the dinner niche and opens late afternoon around 5pm-11pm. I give a rate of 4. 

Pricing: Pricing is moderate for this restaurant ranging from $10-$70. The restaurant has reasonable rates for the food compared to other places like Mortons or Gibson. They offer good quality steak at a competitive price. I give a rate of 5. 

Food/Cuisine: If you know a little bit about Argentina, the country has an european immigrant population. The restaurant will have familiar Italian dishes along with Argentinian foods . I had a 12 oz steak along with vegetables, garlic , and potatoes. I had ordered the steak to be medium and it was tender/juicy. You could taste the delicious steak from the sauce. I give a rate of 5.

Sanitation: The restaurant had been clean and restrooms in proper sanitary condition. Tables had been clean as well. I give a rate of 5. 


Ambiance: The ambiance was good with the background music and environment. People had been very happy dining in the restaurant. The environment gives a great dining experience with a glass of red wine after a good steak. I give a rate of 4. 

In conclusion, I rate this restaurant a 4."

Quite simply, the service was just bad. My girlfriend and I got sat near the window in the dining room and were there for about 75 minutes in total. During that time our server only came by our table, without me flagging him down, 3 times.  We were done eating our meal, and ready to leave, but waited for more than 20 minutes for someone to give us the bill. Had I not gotten up and flagged the server down I imagine that we would have waited quite a bit longer. 

In short, the restaurant has outstanding food. However, the owners should do some additional training with their service team if they really take the restaurant to the next level."

Gorgeous, warm, inviting, a tad dark in the evening as each table is lit by candlelight and the overhead lighting is minimal. It&#39;s certainly romantic, has great decor, and floor to ceiling windows at the front of the restaurant.  It is also in a great location in Wicker Park, and offers a walkable neighborhood for after dinner.  

The food is the problem.  The salad was so basic. Literally served with raw onion and a large slice of tomato, and although it is supposed to be served with mixed greens on this evening we received all kale. If you don&#39;t know about kale, it is bitter when eaten raw.  I was not impressed. Hubby&#39;s steak was overcooked and not well seasoned. My stuffed chicken was ok, but not anything I would order again. The best part of my meal was the squash, the best part of hubby&#39;s meal was the potatoes.  

Our waiter did not come to our table for probably 15 minutes. The people seated after us had already placed their order before we even received water. Once our waiter finally came to our table he thought we&#39;d already given our order for drinks and food.

 A tad too pricey for all that drama."

I finally had the perfect occasion and the restaurant ruined my night. I wish I had brought my out of town family to a better Chicago restaurant. 

We were here for dinner on a Friday night. It was kind of loud. Loud enough that you could only hear the person right next to you and it made it impossible for the 6 of us to couldn&#39;t carry on a conversation without yelling.

The service was exceptionally slow. They didn&#39;t take our order until we had been there for about 45 min. They brought out only half of our drinks, and then the other half 10 min. later. We couldn&#39;t order dinner when we ordered our appetizers because our waiter rushed off.


We ordered a series of steaks and pasta for dinner. Most of us got what we expected, the servings were larger than expected. One of us ordered medium rare steak and it came out medium well which was really unfortunate because if you&#39;re paying $30 for a steak you want it to come out how you prefer it. 

The main reason for this post is that they must have completely forgotten to put in the order for the last person (pasta with fish)!  They brought out our 5 dishes and then a few minutes later came by to say that the sixth dish would be &#34;just 3 more minutes&#34;. 15 minutes later, when they finally brought out the last dish the rest of us were finished eating. There was never any apology from the server/restaurant.  This whole ordeal ruined our celebration and ended up leaving with a really negative feeling about the restaurant.  

I&#39;m sorry, folklore, for the price we were paying, you should have gotten our orders right and had them all on the table at the same time. I won&#39;t be returning."

I don&#39;t go out to eat very often, but this is the place I choose when I do. Some of the best steak I&#39;ve ever had (El Filet medium rare). In fact, I will admit I enjoyed it more than my $85 steak from Chicago Chop House. Tender and succulent, served with lots of juice on the plate for dipping. The atmosphere is cozy and authentically Argentinian, and the service has always been impeccable as well.

Last night, I went for my birthday with my parents who are from out of state. They loved it as well. And they gave me a free dessert for my birthday! :) Well, after dinner I realized I locked my keys in my car! So our waiter goes out of his way to contact someone to come unlock my car for less than half the price of a locksmith, even while he is busy serving other tables. It was so kind!

So, to sum up Folklore: Delicious food, amazing atmosphere, great service, and genuinely caring employees!"

So glad we ended here!  Folklore was certainly the highlight of what was already a great day filled with food and drink.

The crawl was sponsored by Fireball whiskey so had already had plenty of tastes of it.  What was great here was that Folklore made their own unique cocktails and they were stupendous!  We sat at the bar and spent quite a bit of time talking with the bar manager.  He was terrific!  If we lived in Wicker Park I could see making a drink here a regular thing.  

They also had a sampling plate of empanadas, one corn, one beef, one chicken, one ham and cheese and one forgot.  No matter they were all terrific and I say this when we already pretty full.

All seriousness, though - The food was superb. Argentinians know their carne! The prices are high, but the portion sizes are hefty and the quality is outstanding. (You get what you pay for!) The ambience is relaxing and comfortable, both inside dining and out. The staff is friendly, attentive, and accommodating. Wine bars, etc. within walking distance. 

I recommend the filet, spinach potatoes, and you must try the empanadas!

Cons - As always in the great city of Chicago, the parking stinks, and this establishment doesn&#39;t offer valet. There are other restaurants in the vicinity that do, though. Finally, if street parking, watch out for residential permit parking and meter maids...They&#39;re abundant."

The first time the deal came with several items on the menu so we tried empanadas, pasta, gnocchi, filet and flan for dessert plus four different glasses of wine. The deal was a very good bargain! If they had it, I would do it again!!! 

The second time we had the parrillada para dos and nothing else. The meat was delicious. It comes with a nice salad which is a good complement to the meat. The parrillada included filet, ribs, sweatbreads, black sausage and chorizo. Everything was just great!!! I think for the two of us was way too much food. In fact, we couldnt finish. I guess that if you are not very hungry, just take a parrillada para uno and one or two appetizers. Portions are generous. 

I will definitely go back again!"

Service was pretty good.  Our waiter was helpful in pointing towards the favorites on the menu.  We ordered a bottle of malbec and took advantage of the Tuesday special (half off bottles of wine).  It was a good bottle of wine for the Tuesday special but I would have been disappointed if we paid full price for it. 

The food was solid. We started off with beef and chicken empanadas.  They were really good and I liked the chimichurri sauce with them.  For dinner, we split the half chicken and the skirt steak.  It came with a basic salad which was okay.  The chicken was nice and juicy from the white wine sauce.  It was good but nothing to write home about. The steak was perfectly cooked and was very juicy.  The portions were fairly large and we had a lunch in leftovers. 

We found ourselves comparing Folklore to Tango Sur finding that Tango Sur on top particularly because of the BYOB. With the half-priced bottle  of wine, it was $100 with tip.  We would go back, but for the price (especially with no wine special), other places are higher on the list."

I think in the U.S., particularly within the PhD suspenders crowd (ho ho ho!) you&#39;d be slated for reducing a the culture of a country to the two things middle Americans knew it for in the sixties. Anyway, it still happens and always makes me feel a bit weird - like that time I asked an Indian friend with genuine interest about what kind of food he makes when he gets home from work and his wife smacked him and started telling us about how to find a recipe for butter chicken. At least on the British TV, the mockery and knowledge that we should all know better just barely supersedes an acknowledgment of something pleasant and even endearing about that imbecile who packs a suitcase of crisps when traveling abroad (think: Karl Pilkington).

So, the partner and I were watching a BBC culinary travel show where the presenter decides to visit Argentina. The entirety of the show afterwards basically involves him touring various numbers of strange tourist-trappy places in search of the perfect authentic beef experience all while remaining adorably ignorant. (&#34;Gasp! The Argentines eat feedlot cattle!&#34;) Well, since there is a $160 reciprocity fee for entering the country and I don&#39;t have the BBC backing me to drive from Buenos Aires to Mendoza, this all left me feeling somewhat hungry for meat. Flash forward to me desperately searching the interwebs for a deal and we have Folklore. 20% off on Fridays for hospital or school employees. Perfect.

Parking is street here, but not too difficult to find. The restaurant is very dark, but the waiters will light a little candle for you when you are seated, creating a perfect little bubble of privacy away from the three drunk nurses at the adjacent table. This isn&#39;t to say that Folklore is a dive - far from it. The restaurant definitely has an upscale style - brushed copper and wood - the house staff is friendly and attentive, but not intrusive, and in general, I felt well-cared for, but at ease. To wit, jeans and a T-shirt, and you don&#39;t spend the entire time trying not to look like an idiot in front of your waiter.

We ended up sharing an empanada and getting a parrillada for two with ALL THE CHIMICHURRI. My favorites: the sweetbreads and short ribs. So much meat. Beef needs were met. We had leftovers. 

When we got in the car, we were already talking about going back. Only downside: could have probably used some salad because anticipating constipation is horrible. Then again, as long as we&#39;re talking about travel, this is probably about as authentic as the experience can get.

TLDR: Ye Gods of Chimichurri smile upon us once more!"

Our party of four tried to get a table at Tango Sur on Saturday night at around 7pm, but it was packed with a long wait, so we called Folklore, they had a little more availability, so we headed there. Neither restaurant accepts reservations for parties of less than 6 people, so if you want to be seated right away, you should get there by 5:30pm or go much later.

For drinks, we had caipirinhas ($9) and pisco sours ($12), both were great and artistically made. The antipasto ($10) wasn&#39;t as good as we&#39;ve had it at Tango Sur. The meats and cheeses were cut in thick chunks instead of thin slices. The four of us shared everything and ordered medium rare. We all received simple salads of lettuce and tomato, served with oil and vinegar before the entrees. The Vacio ($22 flap meat) was delicious. The Churrasco ($20 sirloin steak) didn&#39;t look very appetizing, but it tasted good. The Para Dos ($40 combo for 2 of short ribs, flap meat, chorizo, morcilla and sweetbreads) was awesome, except for the morcilla (blood sausage) which we never like anywhere. Don&#39;t be afraid of the sweetbreads, the texture is like crispy breaded and fried calamari, but more tender. The flan is the best I&#39;ve ever had, order it even if you are stuffed!

Overall, the service seemed a bit better than Tango Sur. All the food was plenty, even for 4 carnivores. We had leftovers to take home. If you want to bring your own wine, it&#39;s a corkage fee of $10. Our bill for 4 came out to $200 including the tip, which was reasonable considering all the food."

That said, I am struggling with a review of this place.  I ordered to go and had read several of the past reviews.  I ordered the fresh made guacamole and the Korean BBQ Burrito. The guacamole was excellent, while the burrito was lackluster.  I ended up unrolling the burrito and just eating the meat, which was descent.  I am not a fan of rice in my burritos.

Service was not as fast as expected and the extremely small store footage was a surprise.  Don&#39;t let it turn you away, just me being picky.

Novel concept and it obviously gets love..definitely better than Micky D&#39;s and BK across the street."

The concept sounded interesting and the reviews were pretty food so we gave it a shot- super glad we did. 

We got:
avocado eggs rolls- they were only kind of eh. The only low point really.  

Husband got the shrimp tempura tacos- he gobbled them up in a flash. He said they were great, I didn&#39;t get a chance to try a bite they were gone that quick. Beans and rice were standard. Pretty solid. 

I had the Korean BBQ quesadilla- great, filling but wish it came with sour cream or something to dip it onto. Just me though. Also wish it came as an option as a dinner portion with beans and rice.  

Drinks- I had the pineapple lemonade- awesome, will stop there just for that. Husband had the mango water. He thought it was fresh and tasted great. 

He also got the chocoflan which was a chocolate cake topped with flan. I managed to steal a few bites, again, really good. 

It&#39;s a small place so we got everything to go, everything was packed well and traveled nicely. We live about a half hour or a little more away and we would make the trip again for take out. 

Staff was friendly and the food was made fresh and quick."

I had the Chicken Chipotle Dinner and a Pineapple Lemonade. Total was just under $15. Best part of my meal was the drink, but I wouldn&#39;t pay $3.50 for that again. The ratings here are misleading. I&#39;m from San Francisco and we have a pretty good selection of great Mexican Taquerias and this place would never survive, especially with these prices. So if you are visiting and are use to real authentic Mexican Food, I would suggest skipping this place.

It is one of those hole-in-wall type places, as I drove past it and had to park in the McDonald&#39;s parking lot across the street (their parking lot only has enough spaces for 5-6 cars.

I was very pleased with how nice and helpful the employees were.  I ordered my meal to go and had to wait only a few minutes.  I had the Spicy Hawaiian Pork Burrito, Dumplings and a special mixed fruit lemonade (Mangonada).  All were fantastic!  I love how they mix together two of my favorite cuisines perfectly!

First of all, the price isn&#39;t &#34;$&#34;  as listed by its name. Each dish is roughly around $10+ and realistically, for fried rice or a burrito, $10 is a lot. 

Secondly, the wait time was ridiculous. It&#39;s a fast-food joint and no one was waiting for their order. All the same, it took about 30 minutes for us to get our four dishes. We had to sit and watch our burrito sit on a counter for about 10 minutes for no particular reason. If it takes about 30 minutes to cook fried rice, something is wrong.

Third, the quality of the food is poor. Everything (by that I mean the &#34;famous&#34; shrimp fried rice and the jalapeno pad thai) were soaked in teriyaki sauce. Our fried rice tasted like teriyaki soup with rice in it because it was that saturated. All the food looked bright and colorful, but the actual taste was totally compromised with standard sauce. The chicken in our pad thai (as another reviewer had commented) was stiff and dry. The burrito tasted standard. The Korean BBQ tacos were okay but not as mindblowing as everyone said. 

While people mentioned the outstanding service, I didn&#39;t really experience any of it. The only time they were actually proactive about their service was when we were on our way out and they asked if we could review them on yelp. Multiple times during our meal, we asked them for knives. The woman would refer us to the cabinet behind us, but there weren&#39;t any knives in them! We used forks to cut up our foods out of exacerbation.   

This place is no where near 5 stars and I would not recommend driving out just to eat here. It&#39;s mediocre at its best."

If you are in the area, this is a must! It is a small restaurant, we missed it the first time and had to go around the block. There are only a few parking spots here and most patrons seem to order take out. They do have a few tables inside and outside to dine at. But whether you dine in or take out, you need to try Dos Ricco&#39;s!!!

The waitstaff are very friendly and will talk through the menu with you. This was very helpful as we wanted to order one of everything ;)

We ended up ordered the avocado egg rolls, Korean BBQ Beef burrito, and the Chicken Fusion Burrito with mandarin sauce for food and the Coconut Kiss and Japanese Lemonade to drink.

1) Avocado Egg Rolls - A MUST!!!! Like OMG drop what you are doing right now and get at least 2 orders! The aioli dipping sauce is also the bomb.

2) Korean BBQ Beef Burrito - Fabulous!! Why is it so good?!? Tender Korean BBQ in a burrito form, blessed with a kiss from heaven. A little zippy.

3) Chicken Fusion Burrito with Mandarin Sauce - It was a tough call between this and the Korean BBQ burrito but I&#39;m going to have to say this one was EVEN BETTER than the BBQ beef. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?!?! Talk about blowing one&#39;s mind with an amazingly awesome flavor explosion. Also a little zippy but ugh, I want it in my belly right now!

--two sauces are available to enhance your fusion experience: a red sauce and a green sauce. Both are very flavorful and neither is overly spicy.

4) Coconut Kiss - if you like coconut water, then you will love this drink! Coconut water with a &#34;kiss&#34; of cherry and fresh coconut pieces. Yummy, refreshing, and healthy!

5) Japanese lemonade - this was so good I was only able to try 1 sip before my fiancee drank it all. Refreshing, tasty, delicious. We need more of this in our lives.

Dos Ricco&#39;s may not be close to downtown/touristy areas, but I will make a point to come here when I am in Chicagoland. They are located just east of Midway airport. They also cater; this would be the best catering ever for a wedding (my wedding, yes yes yes! lol).

If you want to try something new, that is not overly crazy and extremely delicious, than you need Dos Ricco&#39;s in your life!"

Burrito Fusion (Beef w/Mandarin)  ***
Tasty and quite good. The down part was the rice and the amount of it versus the meat. Very filling, but needs more protein, especially for the price.

Kung Pau Chicken. **
Okay, but really not that great. I wouldn&#39;t order it again. I really wasn&#39;t happy to see the pre-cooked rice come out of a big bag, instead fresh out of a rice cooker. If you want to cook Asian, then cook Asian. The meal was just okay, nothing special. It tasted like a packet you&#39;d get at the grocery store. 

Korean BBQ Steak Taco ****
Outstanding! Very flavorful and well made. Although a bit small and lacking a goodly amount of meat, it was delicious. If I had stopped with just this, my overall rating would have been different.

Atmosphere  *
Very small, with seating inside of only 4 very small round tables. No AC made it extremely  hot inside. It was 81 degrees outside and with no AC or ventilation, I was sweating like a BBQ&#39;d pig! At least they should invest in a fan to get some circulation. After the taco, I got the rest to go just so I wouldn&#39;t pass out due to heat exhaustion. 

Location  *
Right next to a VERY busy road. Be careful on the sidewalk.

Staff &amp; Friendliness  *****
Outstanding! Very friendly and helpful. It was nice to be able to watch the chef cook. He is obviously very dedicated and loves his work. 

Overall  ***

Suggestion: Drop the fusion and do what you do best, Mexican. While what I had was okay, it is not truly a fusion and they&#39;re better off sticking to one method. At least get the spelling right  (See photo)"

To bad so sad food is subjective and I&#39;m not the only one who thinks your business is a candy factory instead of a culinary experience. 

Fact, most people from out of town talk about how gross and over priced your food really is....

Like I said I&#39;m a south side native with a travel companion pass because my spouse works for the airlines and avid businesses traveler. 

As a matter if fact I flew 155 times last year. My expense account has allowed me to try all kinds off food all over the U.S. I&#39;m not rich just have a road warrior job that allows me those spoils. 

No matter how you spin it your food is gross to me and many other people. When your client base is primary Mexican and the only Chinese food they ever had comes from their local &#34;Chop Suey&#34; grease spoon your food taste good. 

Relax.... Your not the only Chef that has ever been criticized. There is entire TV shows, magazines and  web sites were food is criticized. Nothing personal, you think your food is awesome and I think it&#39;s garbage let&#39;s just agree to disagree. 

You are nowhere near 5 starts it&#39;s your location and fusion that makes you popular. Your food is gimmick there is no culinary talent attached to your dishes. 

It&#39;s nothing personal I just don&#39;t agree that your food is any good and so do many more people. 

I hope there is never a shortage of teriyaki sauce because you will be in big trouble."

To be honest though, I just wasn&#39;t blown away. I&#39;d give it 3.5 stars if I could. 

The place is tiny and hot inside, with only one picnic table outside along Cicero Ave. I was OK with dealing with this, but you have been warned!

Food- after reading reviews, I ordered avocado egg rolls, chicken jalapeno pad thai, and the pineapple lemonade. The egg rolls were good- decent (medium) size, loaded with avocado and lettuce, but without the spicy aioli (which was amahzing!), they were pretty bland. Cost was around $5.50. If you are against mayo-type dressings, you may want to skip this. The pad thai was good, but offered ZERO spice. I found pieces of jalapeno in mine, but all seeds were removed so it was nothing more than pad thai with a pepper in it. I rated it a 0.5/10 on the heat scale. I can get pad thai that is even better a lot closer to home. The pineapple lemonade was fantastic though. I thought it was a perfect balance of lemon and pineapple flavors; no flavor won. I would definitely want that again!

My guy got the Asian wings and steak pad thai.  He said the meat was not really like steak, more of a beef cut. He enjoyed his wings. The total for both of us was about $27 before using the groupon. 

I enjoyed what I ate, but again, it&#39;s a little far for just good."

Ordered the fusion burrito with shrimp and teriyaki sauce. I also ordered the wontons. The person at the restaurant quoted me what sounded like $17.10 but I figured I misheard since the menu had these items priced at $8 and $3.99 respectively. Well, I get to the establishment and the wall menu showed $9.10 and $6.10 each. Obviously I had an old menu but even the take out menu in the restaurant had lower prices than the updated wall. I explained to them that the menu I had didn&#39;t have the wontons for that much and asked them to remove the wontons from my order (I can&#39;t see paying over $1.25 for 1). I expected that they would possibly honor the price on the menu they had but they didn&#39;t offer. So they lose stars for what I consider poor customer service.

Now as far the burrito, it wasn&#39;t bad. But it tastes more like teriyaki rice. It was rare when I bit into a shrimp. So they lose stars for that.

The location is very close the Midway Airport, about two (2)-minute driving distance south of the airport.  However, walking to this place from Midway is feasible.  

Be careful while you&#39;re driving because you most likely will miss it!  The exterior is extremely nondescript.  They do have a private parking lot; there are two (2) vehicle spaces available.  Nevertheless, the rest of the parking lot is up to you at what position you would like to park.  Thus it&#39;s a free-style parking, like a long program in figure skating.  

Once you&#39;ve overcome all of the difficulties prior entering into the restaurant, you will experience one of the most amazing fusion dishes you would ever find in the city of Chicago limit.  We ordered the avocado rolls, two (2) fried bean tacos, and two (2) orders of horchata.  Let me tell you.  You have to try all of them if you get a chance.  The horchata was super on point!  It&#39;s one of the best I&#39;ve had, comparing to the ones I&#39;ve had in Logan Square and Albany Park.  The avocado rolls were crunchy (very creative use of the wonton wrappers), and the avocado paste was rich and creamy.  By the way, the southwestern dipping sauce for the avocado rolls was so delicious.  We dipped the tacos with it as well.  The bean tacos were filling even though there was no meat in there whatsoever.

Vegetarians will enjoy themselves in this joint.  Some items on the menu have the &#34;VF&#34; as the indicators that they can accommodate your vegetarian requests if you desire.  The service was friendly.  The young man behind the counter knows all of his regulars.  This place is a GEM in the neighborhood.  

Forget the generic airport food.  Get your orders to-go since you get these gourmet-quality items at very reasonable prices.  If you have time, there are a few tables to sit down and chill."

This place boasts Mexican and Thai food on their signage. But, I&#39;m pretty sure the Korean bbq steak tacos were inspired by Korean food. Nevertheless, there are many good things to try. My friends and I ordered the chicken wings (sticky, sweet with some heat), avocado egg rolls (could have used more avocados than lettuce) with a spicy sriracha aioli, and an oversized crab rangoon (overflows with melty cream cheese, lobster and crab meat goodness) to share. 

Then we each dove into our entrees. The tempura shrimp taco was good but could have used actual tempura batter to make it less heavy. The Korean bbq steak in the taco could have been marinated with the sauce before grilling instead of tossing the meat in the sauce after it was cooked which made the sauce taste like an afterthought. The pickled onions on the taco were a nice touch though. My friends raved about the Korean bbq steak burrito bowls (ask for sauce on the side or no sauce at all if you don&#39;t know if you can take the heat), and the orange chicken rice bowl.

The horchata was good. A couple of us upgraded to add white chocolate to the drink. While tasty, I&#39;m not sure how much it added to the overall drink ... let alone calories, but I digress. 

The dining room is small, with a few café style rounds. Al fresco dining is available. While there, the restaurant was consistently busy which is great. On my next trip, I may consider ordering the pad Thai burrito bowl. It looked delicious!"

Look for the auto body shop; it&#39;s right next door.  You won&#39;t want to eat inside because it&#39;s really small and hot, so be prepared to make a take out order. 

I ordered a Korean barbeque taco and the chicken pad thai.  I was not expecting the portions to be so huge!  The pad thai was two meals worth for me and it was filled with huge chicken chunks and tasty cilantro.  The Korean barbeque taco was juicy steak, bbq sauce, onions and cilantro.  Everything melded nicely and the onions were a great contrast to the sweet bbq sauce.

The food is unique and full of flavor combinations I&#39;ve never experienced before. We came here because of its proximity to Midway Airport and its high Yelp reviews.

We had :
Ceviche - bright and light, subtle seafood flavors, with refreshing citrus
Dumplings - fried just right, with nice taste of scallions and a sweet dipping sauce
Korean BBQ Tacos - charred for smoky flavor with kick of cilantro and just the right amount of spice to make you feel it
Horchata - offered with white chocolate or caramel, but the original was sweet on its own

What really stood out was the service we experienced. We had our two children with us and we were sitting around a small table, when the owner (I presume), came out of the back to kindly ask some other patrons to move a bit so he could slide another table over to us! He, along with the other chef came out a few times to ask us how our food was, and offer desserts.

This was not what I was expecting from a small, shack-like (no disrespect), intimate venue like this. Ricardo and the team here deserve the praise and accolades they&#39;ve received.

This place may not look to appealing from a distance but let me tell you this. You have never seen or tasted burritos like this following more of a Asian style with there ingredients.

Let me start with there drinks from there coconut kiss to there pineapple lemonade.They are  all perfect not to sweet nor to watered down. There appetizer as well are  appealing from there avocado tools to there Thai wings(not to meaty) but the flaver is all there. Now for there main course. I personally love there chipotle chicken and there Korean bbq steak. 
That being said I hope you give this greatly combined Mex and Asian style food joint a try.. there owners are just simply the best very attentive and friendly."

The food prices are reasonable, especially considering the quality of flavor. I enjoyed the shrimp tempura burrito and DH enjoyed chicken Chipotle tacos. However, it is small and loud.

I had the Japanese lemonade after having a sample and it was amazing! Highly recommend trying it. For the appetizer we tried the avocado rolls which were unique and tasty and the steak salad which was surprisingly filling. The best part about the place is how nice the owner was. After we ate he came out to ask how the food was and offered us dessert. Definitely will be coming back

I never knew how badly I needed a restaurant like this in my life, until I found Dos Riccos. Asian and Mexican fusion? My husband and I were sold on that alone, I mean what could that possibly entail?

The food was OUTSTANDING! I now know where I will be eating at the end of every trip from Midway. You are led to believe the avocado rolls are the best, because of all the pictures on this yelp page, and you&#39;d be correct. If you order anything order them, then order the Mexican egg rolls, because you can never have too many egg rolls. Then please order the Jalapeño pad Thai, because it will put most Thai restaurants to shame it&#39;s so good! Lastly, put an end to your dream like meal experience with their beverages, either the mangonada or pineapple lemonade. 

Do it. You will not regret it!"

The Mexican Asian fusion was delicious. It was unlike anything I have ever tasted. Recently went it in to grab some more grub and some delicious pineapple lemonade and was disappointed. The price of all items increased but the taste and quality of the food decreased immensely. My wife ordered Mandarin Chicken and it was uninspiring. My sweet and sour chicken burrito was bland and I regretted the choice. Sadly the pineapple lemonade did not save the meal either. The wantons were the best part I just wish they were bigger and had more filling.

I have been there a couple of times and they were very different experiences. The first one was complete chaos. Phone was not working so could not order for pick up. When I got there, the line was huge and had to wait for a really long time, wouldn&#39;t have been such a big deal had I not been on lunch, but I was so...  

Second time around totally different story, ordered over the phone for pick up, get there no line, parking space available.

I have tried their steak, chicken and Korean tacos, all were great. I also had a pineapple lemonade, it is great. I can/t wait to go back and explore their menu a little bit more.

Parking here is a big deal, their parking lot is kinda small and there is no street parking.

The owner I&#39;m assuming was a tall Hispanic man who frequently asked if we needed anything else, we dined inside since they have about 4 small tables. I had seen on another yelpers review the spicy Hawaiian pork tacos but they were not on the menu, when I asked for them they happily made them for me.

However once we got our food it went downhill,  we ordered the fusion burritos one steak and one chicken teriyaki. It was the sweetest teriyaki I&#39;ve ever had, and it was more of a rice burrito with a garnish of meat.  For $9 burrito I would hope for more meat so disappointing.

So when I tried Dos Ricco&#39;s the standard is high. 

I tried the burrito with bulgogi (Korean beef), rice, cabbage and cheese, and sriracha sauce. Overall, it was very good! My only suggestion would be to give it a bit of the vinegary kimchi &#34;taste&#34; to give it a nice contrast. But overall it was solid and I plan to return to try a few more items on the menu!"

It&#39;s a somewhat nondescript little hole-in-the-wall on Cicero Avenue a few blocks south of Midway Airport.  If you are staying in one of the nearby hotels, you are in for a treat if you eat here (or take it to go).  The simply decorated seating area is pleasant enough, but can get warm and smoky once they start cooking in the kitchen.  While the menu stresses Mexican and Asian cuisine, for the most part they keep the two tastes separate.  

We ordered a bunch of items from their menu and passed them around.  Perhaps the stars were the Thai chicken wings (spicy and crunchy) and the bowl of jalapeno pad thai noodles.  The beef Korean BBQ  taco was not available this evening for some reason (was the Korean chef out??), but the steak and chipotle chicken tacos were good, as was the grilled steak burrito.  They do not serve booze (sorry - no margaritas) but the horchata was pretty tasty."

The service is super helpful, which really makes it a joy to visit the place. Be aware that it&#39;s not really a sit down restaurant, as there are only stools for about 10 people in the small ordering and eating space."

I think it might have been Chicago&#39;s Best. Somehow the idea of Mexican/Asian Fusion both intrigued and disgusted me. But having tried it, I can honestly say it&#39;s not gross at all. In fact, it&#39;s not bad at all.

When we entered we were greeted by Andy Dick&#39;s twin brother, a super friendly dude who explained every aspect of the menu. After much deliberation, we decided on two types of tacos, the avocado egg rolls and the jalapeño pad thai. 

They were kind enough to let us sit outside and brought us each dish as it was prepared, tapas-style. Meanwhile, my wife sipped on a Coconut Kiss signature drink that was much too sweet for me. And I had the pineapple lemonade, which tasted more like a cleaning product than a beverage. 

The avocado egg rolls were tasty, but nothing special or original about them. They&#39;re done at several other places just as well. But the avocado was fresh, and in large chunks.

The Korean BBQ tacos tasted like any other pulled beef barbecue you get anywhere else, but put into a nice taco tortilla and garnished. The chipotle chicken tacos were SUPER salty, and not as flavorful as I&#39;d expected. I would not order those again.

They said something about the pad thai being rated #1 in the city. And y&#39;know what? I see why. It was really good. And the jalapeño really added a nice kick to it. But unfortunately we went with just the chicken kind, and the chicken pieces were dry and salty from being over-seasoned and cooked too fast. I&#39;ve made that mistake with white meat chicken a lot, so I&#39;m kind of a pro and f*cking it up. 

All in all the food was just okay. I wouldn&#39;t revisit it. But the service was outstanding and that takes my review up from 3 stars to 4."

Stopped in today for some takeout.   The owner/chef and his sister were behind the counter - absolutely the friendliest people I have come across in a long time.   Real genuine people.  

He talked to me about their menu and suggested the torta special they had that day.   I also got the crab wontons, kung pao chicken and a pineapple lemonade.   They food was made fresh, right in front of me - in under 10 minutes.    I wanted to try an assortment - and happy that I did.  I now have lots of leftovers, portions are big.   

I love crab rangoon, but their wontons were amazing!   I&#39;ve never had anything that good!    The torta was made on a flat bread, with red peppers. tomatoes, lots of chicken, cheese, and a wonderful sauce.    Kung Pao was good, not spicy enough for me, but still good - lots of veggies, chicken, and rice.

I usualy never order a drink when doing takeout, but they mentioned a pineapple-lemonade, and I had to try it.   It was so refreshing! 

This is a BYOB restaurant.  They do not have tables, but about 10 stools and a counter.    I can&#39;t wait to go back - the food is amazing!!!"

So, since my co worker lives in the area, she was nice enough to pick us up some takeout for lunch on her way in one day. I ordered the infamous avocado rolls, and a mandarin orange fusion burrito. 

They were both great! The aioli sauce that came with the rolls was literally my dream come true. I loved it so much that at one point I was dipping my burrito in there as well. 

The burrito also didn&#39;t disappoint. I think what got me hooked was the quality of the chicken. It was so tender and juicy, the mandarin sauce was the perfect pairing. My only regret was not asking them for some Sriracha sauce on the side. Being Mexican myself, it almost felt morally wrong to eat a burrito with no hot sauce. Even if it was &#39;Asian fusion&#39;."

The restaurant itself is tiny, with only a couple of tables. During the summer months, there is a table outside. It is right next to Cicero, so the outside isn&#39;t great for kids. If it hadn&#39;t been for Yelp reviews, I certainly never would have given Dos Ricco&#39;s a second glance as I drove by.

But the food!

I love good asian cuisine (having lived in Asia for a number of years), but have never experienced the style of latin-asian fusion that Dos Ricco&#39;s puts out. The avocado spring rolls are divine, and the burritos and tacos are also delicious. Kimchi really lends itself to tacos, but I&#39;ve only seen such tacos at a few places.

Dos Ricco&#39;s is an experience, and I would strongly recommend anyone with a few minutes before/after their flight to drop in."

Entered restaurant which was presentable, nothing to brag about; it was small, seating was tight.  Reviewed menu, lots of typos and what I thought would be tasty meals.  I placed ordered with cashier who was also the cook....wondered if she washed her hands between handling money &amp; cooking????   I should have checked.  There was a guy serving and packing food; a young male, who didn&#39;t cook....The lady was nice; took order; spoke Spanish at first but went into English since I&#39;m non-Latino and the menu is as well.  Everything sounded good on the menu.  I ordered avocado rolls, asian fusion burrito, 2 steak tacos &amp; a bowl of rice plus a horchata.   The horchata wasn&#39;t bad; it taste like a standard horchata infused with ginger.  Different, but I liked it.  The rolls are not impressive at all.  Just fried dough stuffed with avocado plus a dipping sauce; nothing impressive, greasy, tasteless....The burrito was made like this(my guess)....a burrito taco shell, some pizza cheese, 2 day old rice, and frozen Asian styled chicken(I tasted more breading than chicken)...it was supposed to be tempured styled w/mandarin sauce?????   I ordered my partner the tacos and he said it tasted like beef jerky, definitely not steak and the rice was bland......my assumption is that the 2 employees that worked there once worked in an Asian buffet restaurant and since they are Mexican thought the 2 ethnicities blended together and decided to open this place...hmmmmmm no...I believe in racial mixing; i&#39;m a product of it, but not food.

It was worth it.  My girlfriend had beef, chicken, and fried shrimp tacos, which were delicious.

Two spicy shrimp tacos and a regular shrimp taco! The trimmings are plentiful and flavorful-not as spicy as you would think though. Wifey and I attacked the food like there was no tomorrow n took these bad boys down!!!

Thai chicken wings - I personally thought they were kind of gross even though they were labeled a customer favorite. It was just way too much sauce. I can see why other people like them since I don&#39;t particularly enjoy wings due to lack of meat. 

Avocado rolls - the item I most enjoyed, but a very oily food

Pork dumplings - Meat inside exceeded expectations, but I still wished it wasn&#39;t such a fried food

Korean BBQ taco - it was okay, but not anything impressive

Last thing I&#39;d say is that I wished I avoided the appetizers altogether and got a burrito. Just keep that in find. My curiosity around the appetizers personally didn&#39;t pay off."

I was initially intrigued by the Asian/Mexican fusion concept...how can that possibly work?  Egg-foo-youngritos?  Kitty-catacos?  I imagined walking out of there with an oddly-filled burrito and some Kikkoman soy sauce packets.  

Instead, Ricardo served up the most savory steak burrito I&#39;ve ever tasted!  His steak Torpita does a much better job of soaking up all the delicious meat juices as you eat your way through it - but it is ok to lick your plate clean anyway, right?

The food on the other hand makes the review worth every star it is getting. The food is amazing. Now they can take a bit long to cook the food compared to other Mexican or even Asian restaurants, but its because they are cooking everything fresh. I have tried almost everything on the menu, and have not found anything that does not taste amazing. Do your self a favor and stop by this place. I would say my favorite food is their burritos. The burritos are almost like Chipotles but mixed with a little bit more of Mexican. You can not go wrong if you are looking for some great take out food."

Horchata - This was good. It was sweet, but not overly sweet. Also, didn&#39;t have a strong cinnamon flavor like most horchatas.

Korean BBQ Taco - This was good. I just couldn&#39;t put my finger on this distinctive taste. It wasn&#39;t that greasy either.

Poblano Mozzarella Burger - This was pretty good. Had a unique taste and it was cooked nicely. We thought it would have more of a kick, but it didn&#39;t.

Kung Pao Chicken - We didn&#39;t really care for this. My guy thought it had too much MSG or something and didn&#39;t really care for it. I didn&#39;t really care for the chicken being deep fried and maybe I&#39;m not use to it this way.

I would like to come back to give the Pad Thai and some other items a try.

We joked where else can you get Chinese, Korean and American/Mexican in one place. Give it a try if you are in the area. There is a small parking lot so that helps."

In the beginning I was rooting for this place given that it was a different and ingenious idea. I&#39;ve bought from this place at least 8-10 times but on the most recent visits I&#39;ve had these issues:

Bought a yelp deal and they wouldn&#39;t honor it because only the owner knew how to redeem it and he wasn&#39;t there at the time so I ended up paying for the deal and the meal...go figure, so I decided to give it another try.

The following visit wasn&#39;t any better, I paid for my order which included 1 poblano burger, 3 tacos and a pad thai, about $38 total so the owner asks how many sauces I need and I said 2 of each (green,red) so he says to me, I&#39;ve included two so you have to pay for the additional ones, I said ok but I don&#39;t want to use my credit card to pay 50 cents for the extra sauces, he pauses as if to let me know that I have two choices, take 2 or pay for the 2 extra ones, so after the long pause he says &#34;Ok, I&#39;ll give you the extra sauces but I&#39;ll charge you next time you come&#34;...Are you kidding? Making a big deal about the tiny sauce cups after I spent close to $40? Ok so I tell myself it&#39;s okay it&#39;s a business so every little bit of money counts for them. When I get home with my dinner I realize that the steak tacos have are missing the grilled onions and bell peppers they usually come with, only cabbage and cilantro in them, that bothers me a little because it&#39;s shows there&#39;s no consistency on how they make their meals, if he had mentioned that they were out of onion/peppers I would have been okay with substituting those ingredients but the fact that they swap the ingredients hoping you won&#39;t notice just makes me mad...

So about a week later I decided to pick up 3 poblano burgers since they were pretty awesome, when I get there I noticed they were getting ready to prepare some sauces, I saw a large clear container filled with boiled/cooked tomatoes which they were using to make the sauce...fast forward to when I get home and discovered that instead of the normal raw tomato slices they put in the burgers I see that the owner put 2 large wedges of the cooked tomatoes in each one of the burgers...I could not believe my eyes, why would he cheat me like that...&#34;oh we&#39;re out of tomatoes, no problem I&#39;l just throw in a few of these hot and disgusting cooked tomatoes in there and no one will notice, cooked tomato is still tomato isn&#39;t it?&#34;...

That was it for me, I gave this place too many chances to get things right but each time I tried they kept proving that they are not consistent with their recipes, they don&#39;t care about customer satisfaction (I&#39;m not even a picky/whiny customer) and they almost rather lose a customer than give away 50 cents worth of sauce to keep that customer happy. 

Food is good but not good enough for me to put up with the annoyances."

I usually have tacos or the burritos. But I&#39;ve tried some of the other items on the menu. I had the chile de arbol fried rice which was good but I thought it was kind of bland. The avocado roll is actually deep fried - I was expecting something akin to a sushi roll.

I had the different burritos on occasion. The Korean one is tasty. It is made with rice a la Chipotle. 

Bottom line; good solid Mexican food with an Asian twist."

I really enjoyed the bulgogi (Korean BBQ) burrito, and their spicy asian wings had a tasty burn to go with the crispy breading. I went for a aqua fresca to complement the meal, and left entirely satisfied.

Chipotle chicken tacos- These have layer upon layer of savory mouth watering deliciousness. THESE tacos are show stoppers!! ..and I&#39;m not even a chicken taco fan but these babies have won me over!! If I could rate each food item, I&#39;d give these 5 stars. 

Korean Tacos- Eh. The meat is soft but you will run into unpleasant chewy gummy stuff. The flavor is ok, really not that special. (2stars)

Steak Tacos- Terrible. Seriously. The meat is tough, chewy, flavorless, and dry. (Fallen star)
Orange Chicken- Very tasty! Lightly battered with a sweet/savory/citrusy sauce, came with white rice.  (4.5 stars)

Kung Pao Chicken- Extremely salty. Lightly battered. We&#39;re talking can&#39;t take more than one bite type salty. (Fallen, salty star)

Avocado Rolls- Delicious! Savory mix of flavors and the accompanying sauce is delish as well. (4.5 stars)

Coco drink- Good, nothing outta this world. Actually seems like they poured open a Goya coco water n put it in a plastic glass with a squirt of red food coloring. I don&#39;t understand what the red was supposed to be for, it only added color but no flavor. At $3, I&#39;d skip this drink. (2 stars)

Pineapple drink- Yummy, strong citrus flavor, tangy and sweet. Very good. (3.5 stars)

Clean. No bathrooms. Service is a bit slow. 

I&#39;ll definitely be coming back for only the select items that are the bomb.

Thanks to Yelp, we discovered Dos Ricco&#39;s within a mile or so of the airport.  Who knew that Mexican &amp; Asian fusion could be such a treat. 

We started with the Avocado Rolls (fantastic), then sampled the Shrimp and Chipotle Chicken Tacos (subtle and wonderful...with a bit of sriracha for kick)... Then we went for seconds! 

Also had a fabulous salad I can&#39;t recall the name of.  Topped it off with their homemade horchata which was exceptional thanks to the unexpected hint of anise.

Even though it&#39;s an order-at-the-counter place, the service was excellent...positive vibes all around, and these guys&#39; pride in the business they&#39;re building is evident.  One of their employees came in on his day off to get lunch and immediately began pitching in to help serve us and share his enthusiasm for his favorite dishes.

The majority of other patrons we met were flight attendants for Frontier Airlines who have discovered this tasty treat just down the street from the hotel where they stay during layovers. It&#39;s a humble little gem with innovative dishes worthy of a major chef.   

And a bargain, of course."

Be adventurous with the menu, I&#39;m still working my way through it, and with each experience I become more of a believer. The service and hospitality of the staff is really warm, and it&#39;s a place you feel comfortable and attended to - not rushed in and out. Turkish people take meals leisurely.

The doner is amazing. For those unfamiliar it&#39;s a Turkish gyro. If you like meat, if you on a paleo diet, if you wanna avoid carbs, this place has lots of great options if you can avoid that bread."

Sometimes the food takes a while, but that is because everything is made to order!! No heat lamps here, everything comes fresh from an oven or pan of some sort! The owners are super sweet and hospitable. They support a lot of young people, such as students by giving them jobs, so sometimes they aren&#39;t the best career waitress ever, but I think its great that Zizi gives opportunities to people like these. 

Some of the negative reviews here read very much like people who own competing Turkish restaurants, or friends/family of such people. 

Zizi&#39;s is also vegetarians and gluten-free friendly. I personally love the veggie moussaka, the ezme, the fresh salads with falafel. If you like Turish/Mediterranean food definitely give Zizi a try!"

Immediate reaction after eating a delicious meal,
I really loved everything - this place is the real deal,
We came for lunch right when they opened it,
It was empty so we didn&#39;t know what was expected,
We sat down and it started to get the lunch crowd too,
And it looked like they had a lot of take out and delivery on queue,
The server she was kind and as we looked through the menu,
She brought out homemade bread and a carrot, yogurt garlic dipping sauce for me and you know who,
As we ate the bread in the sauce fireworks went off in my mouth,
I knew that I was living that low carb life but to the window that went out,
It was amazing bread that should be in all the high end spots,
But it is the type of homemade food that they would no nothing about,
We got the lamb donör (gyros) and the kefta platters, with a choice of rice only or rice n couscous mix,
We waited with baited breath for the food I was hungry so I really wanted it,
And when it arrived and we took the first bite,
For that moment (and the entire meal) I felt like everything in the world would be alright,
The kefta was grilled to perfection and the lamb donör was beautifully sliced,
I was so glad this food and this moment of perfection finally came into my life,
Served with some grilled veggies and a yogurt sauce, the owner came by with a smile ear to ear that showed me he loved his job,
I could not decide what was more lovely, the food, the waitress, or the fresh flowers on every table, 
And last but not least was a dessert only written about in fables,
It is the national Turkish dessert I can&#39;t remember the name but it was wild,
like a tiramisu and a panna cotta had a torrid love affair which resulted in a beautiful child,
As I left headed home on the brown el track,
I already daydream of the moment when I get to go back,"

The Turkish bread with sesame seeds was under cooked. The chicken Doner was Over salted, the rice was under cooked. The entrée stated that it included 
Veggies as well. unfortunately 90%of the veggies were potatoes with No flavor.
I asked the server for more veggies instead of potatoes because I didn&#39;t want to Overdose on carbs. Mind you ; Bread, rice and then potatoes. .
the server comes back and Guest what ?
She brings More potatoes.  I told her again that I wanted veggies and she just stood there and smiled clueless to what I was talking about.

The broccoli/carrot side dish was excellent. The chicken was spiced tastily in the wraps, and the chicken salad was okay.  It was just spring mix from Kroger, nothing special.  But they did cook the chicken when we placed our order.

The bread is also remarkable and is the best tool for soaking up the delicious carrot spread. 

I have had the chicken kebab, chicken doner kebab, the kofte wrap--all meals that I would definitely order again. The portions are hearty and the food is always super flavorful! I really loved the fresh french fries and the seasoned bulgur!

Complimentary carrot appetizer and homemade bread. The carrot dish is a cold shaved carrot salad with non-acidic dressing. I couldn&#39;t figure out what the carrot dish was but it was great especially when eaten with the bread. I ordered Zizi&#39;s kale salad with a side of chicken. The salad was made up of chopped kale, garbanzo beans, pickled beets and portobello mushroom and tossed in a red wine vinaigrette. The salad was fresh and crisp and the chicken had a ton of flavor. My only complaint was the dressing was a tad too acidic for me. Nonetheless I finished the entire salad. My friends ordered a variety of dishes and they all enjoyed their dishes and complimented the taste and flavor. 

Overall, nice place for casual meal and to catchup with friends. The entire meal took nearly two hours and we never felt rushed. We had about 7 people in our party and even though they couldn&#39;t provide individual checks they allowed us to pay individually at the register. It&#39;s BYOB, affordable, and steps from Beercade and Diversey Brown Line."

There are several different mediterranean restaurants I go to, in town. But I loved this place for 3 reasons:

1.Location is very easy, right by the redline.
2.Delicious and well cooked food.
3.Sympatethic, friendly and honest customer service.

Then a friend, who has never had doner, recommended I try this place and I thought it&#39;d be another dead end.  Luckily for me I was wrong, and for that I came out of Yelp retirement.

I went to the unassuming storefront with few outdoor tables and walked into a pretty large space.  After being seated I was greeted with an unexpected starter of some sort of carrot spread and bread.  The bread was oven fresh and the spread went great with it.  The amount of carrot spread they provided was portioned perfectly for the basket of bread.

Now if there&#39;s one thing that I learned that truly makes a doner great, it&#39;s the bread.  When that doner came out sandwiched between two beautiful pieces of warm bread I knew it was going to be good.  The first bite was a symphony of spiced lamb, creamy sauce, and that splendidly soft and chewy bread that reminded me of that night in Germany.  This doner is legit.  It had the right amount of onions and cabbage so that everything complimented each other nicely.  This is what I&#39;ve been searching for.

The fries seemed fresh cut and were lightly salted.  When the very kind waitress asked if I wanted ketchup or hot sauce, I was pleasantly surprised to get sriracha.  It went well with the fries and the doner.  Though it&#39;s not like the doner needed anything more.

I will definitely go back because the doner was spectacular. I&#39;ll bring others with me so I can try other things on the menu, particularly the lahmacun. But really is the doner on that wonderful bread that lures me back. Lastly, the wait staff was attentive and really nice, and that&#39;s always a huge plus."

I would have given it 5 stars, had it not been for the soggy french fries served with my amazingly delicious Chicken Doner sandwich.  (Just FYI, Zizi&#39;s french fries are made from &#34;real&#34;  potatoes.)  Too bad they weren&#39;t served hot , right out of the fryer. The chicken, was perfectly seasoned and cooked .  The veggie garnishes were fresh &amp; crisp. The Lebanese bread it was served on was to die for.    

Unfortunately, as one astute Yelper put it, &#34; they haven&#39;t spent much ....on the decor&#34;.  But that&#39;s OK.  I&#39;m here for the food, not the decor.  A simple bud vase with a few fresh  flowers is always a nice touch, but when every table has  a vase of drooping flowers, that&#39;s not cool.

Really like the laid back atmosphere here and very pleasant employees. Iskender Kebab is my favorite here, but I really wanted to try the Beyti Kebab, and I believe it&#39;s a relatively new item on the menu since I never saw it here before. Frankly, I did not like it. The pieces are cut extremely thick and meat is not juicy at all! Also, I wish you guys offered a side different than fries, like a simple salad or rice, not everybody likes fried stuff. Just a suggestion."

Just north of the Diversey Brown Line stop on Sheffield it&#39;s a cozy spot that&#39;s easy to get to and filled with delicious choices and warm friendly staff. The owner Zizi is often working the counter and is one of the nicest people you&#39;ll ever meet. Some of the must haves include the carrot dip, Zizi&#39;s favorite wrap with chicken or lamb, and the Döner sandwich is always a quick go to. And the best thing is, everything is always fresh. It&#39;s also BYOB which makes it a great date night spot or place to enjoy a bottle of wine (paired with something tasty of course) with friends. Definitely a favorite spot and one I&#39;ll be back to quite often."

(Cheap plastic tables, open metal shelves for the kitchen to put the food out on, etc.) The servers were nice, and they brought us some complimentary flan that was delicious. The bread was also good.

But fundamentally this is a grab-a-bite place (or a pickup-and-take-home place). Most of the other patrons seemed to be girls who had been to yoga together and were still in athletic gear. Good food, but not a place to spend an evening, which I did not understand based on the other reviews."

You can also see the kitchen from the seating area, - very clean place. The owner gave us complimentary tea and dessert, which was super nice, but we would&#39;ve become regulars even if not. Highly recommended.

End your meal with Turkish coffee and baklava."

I&#39;m only giving them three stars, though, because they claimed that they could give me a decaf latte, and there was no way it could have been decaf, because I was wide awake ALL NIGHT!

Food:
Ordered the combo platter
I would order this again loved trying all the different types of foods. We really enjoyed the ezme. 

Falafel 
I wouldn&#39;t order this again it was too mushy in the middle but did have a nice crunch. 


Chicken Döner Kebab
We were undecided about the rice or couscous and our waitress was awesome and did half of each! :) The meat was a nice combo of white and dark meat and everything on the plate with it was cooked well and wasn&#39;t oily. 

Overall, we&#39;d eat here again as it wasn&#39;t busy, the staff was friendly and food was decent (and not oily). Points off for Falafel and bathrooms. 

Baklava with tea (highly recommend getting with tea to balance out the sweet baklava). Not as flaky as we&#39;d have liked but the honey flavor with the chocolate swirl on the plate was perfect."

There were times when I couldn&#39;t even take bites, not because I was full but because I just wanted to stare at my food and think about everything it was doing to my life -- I needed answers. 

Each bite made me feel as if I were flying, riding the lamb kebab around like it was my little unicorn horse and the only thing that could unhorse me was another lamb kebab riding another lamb kebab, armed with a javelin made out of more lamb kebab. The ultimate jousting weapon. 

But what&#39;s this? The kebab plate comes with some kind of magic zucchini saucer? I need to eat this saucer? what if I just rode it to space instead, rode it through the night and maybe fought my other self atop those crazy lamb kebabs, bending time and reality to my rule like the puppet master i was born to be. 

As tempting as that sounds, just eating the saucer is even better than that. I don&#39;t need to fly anywhere unless that other planet is filled with these silly saucer. Maybe the planet could be made out of them, maybe then space travel would be worth the investment. 
 
The bread comes out strong and thick, like a clay discus. It&#39;s fitting because I often think of myself as an olympic athlete, one specializing in joust. The bread goes well with the rice, the meat, the vegetables, the yogurt sauce...but most of all, the bread goes well with my face. Yeah, that&#39;s right. Yogurt sauce covered bread is tasty, but it&#39;s even tastier if it goes directly into my face. No questions asked, yet all answers given. 

I&#39;ve been up for hours just thinking about it. I don&#39;t want to sleep, if I try to sleep I might realize that I was already asleep and that this whole meal was a dream, which would make more sense than it actually being real...  

...all for less than $20."

We started with the lahmacun. We loved the spices on it. Then we got the kofte platter and chicken doner kabab to split, one with rice and one with couscous. The kofte were fantastic! The flavor was spot on and reminded me of my grandmas kefte. The couscous was very tasty with an almost sweet tomato taste and small zucchini slices. I kept going back for more. We both really enjoyed the chicken. It had a great crispy flavor and paired great with the rice. The vegetables on the side were also wonderful. Zucchini, potatoes, sweet potatoes and tomatoes. They were so tender and very flavorful!

You&#39;ve got to start with the hummus and bread. Absolute musts. The bread is unlike anything I&#39;ve ever had, in the very best way. Soft and chewy, perfect for breaking apart and dipping in the hummus.

Beyond that, my standard order is the eggplant lover&#39;s platter with chicken. It&#39;s delicious every time and they give you a TON, so be prepared to get a few meals out of it.

All the food was good and really fresh. The top three dips or spreads were all served with a huge fluffy piece/loaf of bread, three in total. Sadly, due to its thickness, not as nice as other pita type breads for dipping. 

Carrot Spread $4.25 - Was really garlicky but good. 
Hummus $4.75 - I&#39;ve had better, but probably just a preference thing
Tabouli Salad $6.95 - a little different than I&#39;m used to, but probably just more fresh! 

Zizi&#39;s Favorite Pizmahmagun Wrap $9.95 - Its huge, with lots of chicken and a strong onion presence. I would get an extra order of the yogurt sauce next time. The fries were a tiny potion and really soggy, but I expected that as it was carry out so no biggie."

It&#39;s an unassuming, family-run hole in the wall serving up extremely flavorful food that reminds me of döner places I stumbled upon during a short stay in Munich.

First off, the complimentary bread has been served warm, fluffy, and pleasantly crunchy on the outside every time. Typically I&#39;m not one to fill up on bread baskets, but Zizi&#39;s makes that very hard, it&#39;s terrific.

Smoked eggplant salad ($7) was indeed very smoky, and the silky texture made it perfect with the bread.

Carrot spread ($4.75), which Zizi sometimes serves us on the house, is packed with garlic and yogurt, pretty addictive with the warm bread as well.

Lahmajun ($4.50) flatbread was large and filling, with just enough lemon flavor, the ground beef was very strongly seasoned.

Lamb adana ($15) was extremely flavorful with a big hit of cumin and pepper flavor. Mild couscous and yogurt are a great choice for the strong flavors of the lamb.

Iskender ($16) is one of my favorite plates of food in Chicago, and is really the dish that made Zizi&#39;s a 5-star for me. It&#39;s heaps of shaved döner sitting on an equally huge amount of their amazing bread, cut up into chunks. The slightly sweet and spicy tomato sauce and yogurt/walnut butter mix on the side are refreshing for the heaviness of the dish. It&#39;s enormous, but I finish it every time.

On our visits dining in, Zizi and one waitress were pretty much taking care of the entire restaurant. They were working very hard, but when it gets busy, service may not be the most attentive. 

I&#39;d keep coming back to Zizi&#39;s just for the iskender, but the other things I&#39;ve tried more than merit a visit as well. It&#39;s incredibly well priced and tops the places I tried in Munich as well as a lot of döner shops I experienced in Istanbul."

It&#39;s always good to get the opinion of someone from the heartland of the cuisine, I always say. She said she liked eggplant; so she would choose the Bosphorus platter: grilled meatballs and eggplant ratatouille baked in the oven with mozzarella on top. Mama would be proud that I ate the ratatouille, given that her ratatouille and her hard-earned, meticulous Julia Child masterpieces were wasted on me when I was young.

Turns out that the server was Russian; so her recommendation came from a much different ethnic heritage. More fool me. Nevertheless, the dish was delectable: well-seasoned beef, delicious eggplant, and an un-American amount of cheese--just enough, without turning it into an extra-cheese thin crust pizza. 

The decor looks a little like a cross between a sandwich/gyro place and a cozy restaurant. I like being able to see the kitchen where they&#39;re cooking, but it looks a bit like a take-out counter. The dining room is simple, but nice, and even had small flowers on the tables. 

We had a dessert of Kazandibi, described as a Turkish flan. It had a white, gelatin consistency and seemed to be broiled or otherwise flamed on the top. It was very tasty, and it actually tasted a bit like s&#39;mores, much to the delight of my tongue. Now I could give proper ethnic advice from the heartland about a good s&#39;more.

They took reservations, which was nice, except that the place was only about half-filled on a Saturday night. I hope that their business is good on other days and at lunch, because the place is a gem."

Dine in if you can, because then you get free homemade bread and the carrot spread. It was so difficult to not eat the entire bread basket by myself because it was SO DANG GOOD.

You literally can&#39;t stop eating here and they have huge portions so it&#39;s about the best place ever if you just plan on being a fatty for the rest of the day. 

The Iskander is insanely good. It&#39;s a lamb doner kebab and heavenly homemade Turkish bread covered with yogurt, garlic, and tomato sauce, Easily two meals, but as mentioned is tough to get your taste buds to quit so if you can&#39;t show restraint then you may want to stick with a sandwich or a wrap. 

The place works as a casual date spot cause it&#39;s BYOB or if you just want to pick up a quick lunch on your own it&#39;s great as well since there&#39;s a really attractive Turkish server to talk to.

They don&#39;t skimp on the chicken which by the way, was fairly moist and had good flavor by itself. I absolutely adored the sandwich bread - not sure what it&#39;s called but it&#39;s yummy! Two meals in one for sure. 

Would have been 5 stars if not for the fries which I was not a fan of. They were much too soggy. It MAY have been because I had mine after a ten minute walk but even with that, it was still overly soft. *Edit: I came back and had the fries in the restaurant this time. It was not as soggy but still softer than I&#39;d like. Good seasoning though.

The dolma is fairly standard. I wouldn&#39;t say that it&#39;s particularly special. The first time I tried their falafel, it was also average, then on the next visit, I had it again after learning they had changed the recipe a bit. Sigh, it came out worse this time - the inside was much too soft for my liking! Go back to before please!

There was also kind of a long wait for our food even though there was no one in front of us in line - be prepared as this is not as fast as your typical mediterranean speediness. If you have time, I highly recommend dining in. They bring you their amaaaaazing homemade bread with carrot spread. SCRUMPTIOUS, mouth watering delicious.

I have tried soooo many different places but the way they prepared it wasn&#39;t the same! Some people even lied to me when i called prior to going to their restaurant. They were oh so sure that their Doner would be better! At some point i even gave up due to all the BS i have tasted! So a few days ago i have had a craving for a Doner but didn&#39;t want to be disappointed and pissed off (FYI i take my food very seriously) and didn&#39;t know where i should turn! I use to just Google &#34;German Style Doner&#34; and would call those places but this time i used this head of mine and used Yelp (which I should have done a long time ago). So my search for Doner &#34;Zizi&#39;s Cafe&#34; came up. I took a peek at the pictures and almost had a heart attack. I thought i was going into cardiac arrest but i caught myself before!

I called the restaurant and asked him not to BS me and that i will be very pissed if i showed up and this Doner was not what i was asking for. He assured me and said &#34;If its not like the one in Germany; your meal if free. So i showed up and man was i surprised. They were real Turkish (as in it was 100% Turkish owned and ran). They knew exactly what i was looking for. Come to find out Zizi speaks German and i think he use to live in Germany.

My Doner came up ASAP! Wait was less than 10 minutes, Now when it comes to a Doner its all about the bread and the sauce. ZIZZI GOT IT RIGHT!! He came through with his promise and served me my Doner the way i LOVE IT. It was perfect and i was VERY VERY VERY PLEASED. This place is a definitely must go for some great Turkish food and more! His food really took me back to Germany and reminded me of all the good times i have had as a kid.

Zizzi came and checked on me a few times and made sure that i was pleased with my food. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GERMAN STYLE DONER THIS PLACE HAS IT!!

Thank you and i will return with FRIENDS"

I don&#39;t know why or how, but it is so good that I ordered extra this time. If I had to find a fault, I&#39;d say that the sandwiches are messy and hard to eat because of the size and cut of the bread.

My beef with Zizi&#39;s is the service, which everyone seems to laud.  The first time I visited, it was TOO friendly.  Pushy, really.  I spent several minutes studying the menu and knew exactly what I wanted.  When I tried to order a salad and a wrap, the guy (I think the owner) insisted on cooking me something else which incorporated the basic elements of what I wanted to order.   What he brought to the table was a hot entree, and I had asked for a wrap and a salad because it was a hot day and I wanted cool food.  I should have been more forceful about placing MY order.  I mean, I&#39;m not a guest in this guy&#39;s home; I&#39;m a paying customer.  Just give people what they want, you know?

The second time it was a totally different story.  My wife and I dined on a busy Saturday night, and the service was minimalist and awkward; plus we waited a long time to get both our dinners and the check.

But again, the food both times was stupendous.  The bread alone is worth five stars.  The yogurty carrot slaw was pretty good, too; I could eat that combination every day.  The entree was also fantastic.  It was a base of mashed roasted eggplant with some chicken doner meat, a small scoop of rice, and a savory red sauce.  The punchline of this story is that, on my second visit many months later in the chilly early spring, I voluntarily ordered the same entree that I had eaten unwillingly on that hot summer day.  It was delicious both times, so clearly this guy knows how to cook."

We just finished our meals and I think it was the quietest meal of our lives. We both thoroughly enjoyed every tasty bit of our food. I am blown away especially since we ordered delivery. 

I ordered lamb kabobs and my husband ordered the Lamb Shish Begendi Platter. Both of our lamb was cooked and seasoned perfect. My husband&#39;s dish was lamb over couscous with an eggplant puree with cheese and veggies... DELISH! I almost took over his dish when I had a bite. Mine was lamb over seasoned white rice. The rice was seriously the best rice I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s almost like white powdery fluffy snow but rice consistency. It was the perfect moisture, not sticky, and def not mushy. So good! 

Our plates came with this bread that is to die for. It&#39;s a mix between pita and sourdough like bread. Really enjoyable. Over all this has got to be by far the best Mediterranean food I&#39;ve had in the city so far. I will be back for sure, and I&#39;m bringing company."

The atmosphere as my dining companion put it &#34;is nonexistent.&#34; We were willing to overlook that for some grub. 

Very interesting service nice to the point of being almost cloying. However, he has a lot of personality, is sincere, and informative.

It&#39;s BYOB. 

We started with the famous complimentary bread with carrot yogurt garlic spread. Everyone raves about this bread and I&#39;m wondering why. My partner and I both weren&#39;t impressed.

Zizi showed him his fresh fish so he ordered the Mediterranean Sea Bass Special which is chargrilled whole and comes with rice and salad. Zizi deboned the fish at the table with a knife and fork rather expertly. Ha! Z made sure to take out some of the better bits for me insisting I try. The fish was very good and flavorful; my partner said it was some of the best he&#39;s had for a while. He also enjoyed the salad which was by his admission simple, but had great dressing.

I had the chicken shish platter with cous cous. For some reason it was plated with a portion of cous cous, some white long grain rice, a couple of grilled zucchini slices, three small toast disks, and yogurt sauce. The grilled chicken was good but as Zizi said himself to my companion &#34;it&#39;s grilled chicken.&#34; then they both shrugged. The yogurt sauce was great, very fresh and not overly seasoned. The cous cous and rice were a disappointment. I really like more inventive and playful cous cous recipes. 

As a surprise Z brought dessert. Like the whole Sea Bass I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s on the menu. It was a generous piece of custard pie that was rich in texture but delicately flavored of vanilla. Very similar to a creme brûlée and served with fresh strawberries. We both really liked it. 

We were really impressed with the welcoming warm service and quality. However, it&#39;s worth mentioning the bill for our two entrees was $37.95. I would still return to try more of the fascinating menu and get that hospitality."

Instead, I&#39;m just left scratching my head. Zizi&#39;s wasn&#39;t bad, per se, but I don&#39;t understand the stellar reviews. Maybe I&#39;m just biased, having recently come back from Istanbul and Cappadocia where I had some very delicious and very mediocre Turkish food. I&#39;ve found--as a lover of sauce--I prefer cuisines of other coasts along the Aegean and Mediterranean. In Istanbul especially, I found the food fairly dry.

I have the same complaint about Zizi&#39;s, so maybe that&#39;s on me. But dry doesn&#39;t have to be a bad thing, if the food is also tasty. We got the hummus, along with a complimentary chopped carrot appetizer, to start. The hummus was fine, not anything special. I got the beef-lamb doner kebab, while the wife picked the chicken wrap. The sandwich was moderately flavorful and fairly dry, with a relatively tasteless tzatziki to complement. I did really like the bread in silo. The sandwich bread is the same as the complimentary basket, which worked well with the dip but less so with dry meat.

Atmosphere was a little sterile, and service came with the brusque Turkish style. I would&#39;ve liked the dive-diner feel if the food was amazing, but I just didn&#39;t think it was."

Service was horrible. There was only one waitress, our order wasn&#39;t taken for 30 minutes, and she didn&#39;t take it.

 They gave us and every other table a free appetizer, carrot spread, it was disastrous. I&#39;m Turkish so I know my food, this was nothing that should be given away, it should have been thrown out. I&#39;m sure they realized this and that&#39;s why they were comp-ing it. My father use to own one of the well known Turkish restaurants back in the day and I cook this stuff at home, my husband tried it first and he wanted to spit it out. 

I&#39;m sorry zizi, I noticed that you were slightly apologetic about the horrible service when paying but in the restaurant business when you are apologetic it doesn&#39;t help, I expected more since other TURKs reccomended this place. 

We were never asked about dessert or tea. This is what I look forward to when visiting Turkish eateries. I had dessert to-go, in the good restaurant business it would of been comp-ed as an apology for the lack of service. Many people might of wanted dessert that evening but since they weren&#39;t asked, you lost business. 

It&#39;s also confusing when someone brings you menus and takes your order at your table but then you need to go up to pay but get no warning that you need to pay there. I would like to have a check at my table and have server tell us to pay upfront.

We came back after the movie for some dinner. I had the &#34;beet salad&#34;. I&#39;m putting &#34;beet&#34; in quotes because its really an arugula salad that has a few beets on it. I really don&#39;t like it when restaurants do this! You want the beets to be the main event, but in this case it was more like a garnish. Next time I&#39;ll ask."

We were promptly seated; the ambience is super cute (purple lounge theme). 

We ordered the buffalo chicken spring rolls- they were good but pretty rich. Those would have been a better order with more people. We each got a half salad and split the burger. The half salads are plenty to share. The burger was great and huge! We left full and satisfied. 

Service could improve- our waiter was a bit MIA but all in all a decent spot for late night eats."

THE PIG (special, $15) -- excellent taste and texture on braised pork shoulder.  I love bacon and pineapple salsa. Nice that the buttered bread is grilled.  Unfortunately, after a few bites, the sandwich became too sweet.  More jalapeño bits would minimize the sweetness.

HOUSE FRIES -- perfectly fried old fries.  For esthetic purposes only.  Thou shall NOT eat as it is VERY dry that ketchup could NOT even save.  And they say ketchup makes everything tasty?!?

SLAW -- ok.  Not my type.  Unmotivational.

CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP -- comes with special menu.  Nothing to brag about.  Pasta was a bit undercooked.

WINE LIST -- I like the Interesting Red and Interesting White categories.  Sounds adventurous from small off beat vineyards.

The Sparkling Wines/Bottles are the usual suspects.  Break the bank if you feel like celebrating.

DESSERT -- common selections of cheesecake, chocolate, pie, ice cream...all sweet.  I love my desserts and I passed.

It seems, SWEET is the general palate at Bellwether that is too overwhelming for me.  But, I would still return for the Mussels."

Decent pricing for location. 

Big screen tvs will satisfy the avid sportsman.  But please add a some soulful music selections (e.g.Latin Jazz, afrocuban, DC swing, light R&amp;B, etc.) to diversify the constant house music beats. Doing so will acknowledge the current spirit of multiculturalism that permeates popular music today!

We went here for dinner on a Friday night and left very satisfied. They have glasses of wine for $8 and an ok margarita for $10.

Our server was friendly and helped us decide on the entrees. We had the short rib ($22) and gnocchi ($16). The short rib was really good and a great value as it was huge - it came with like 4 pieces if meat, a large serving of polenta, and lots of green beans. I&#39;ve had many short ribs in the city, and this one was at the top in both taste and value. The gnocchi was also quite tasty although I thought the portion size could have been a little bigger.

Mid-afternoon, place mostly empty: it took the 3 of us 10 minutes until a server helped us and after 40 minutes, we still didn&#39;t have our sandwiches so we asked them to make them to go. The server apologized and said she had no idea why the kitchen was being so slow today. 

I ordered truffle fries and a veggie burger. The truffle fries were bland. We decided they only had a drop of truffle oil left and were trying to be frugal. The veggie burger was a mash of beans and no taste. The veggie burger came with a side of fries itself. Those fries had no salt (zero) and since we gave up on them and got it to go, there was no way to add salt. Related note: the to go bag had our sandwiches all sideways, no napkins, and no utensils. 

For a bad experience, the worst part was getting charged over $50 for it (BLT, veggie burger, tacos, truffle fries, water). Next time we&#39;re staying at a nearby hotel and want a quick bite, we&#39;ll go to Whole Foods across the street."

I&#39;m always weary of hotel bars but my boyfriend actually lives in the condo apartments connected to Bellwether so we figured why not?

Damn, these bartenders were good. We grab drinks here and there pretty often and it takes quite a lot to make a lasting impression with us. We were there at happy hour (on a day they also had weekday specials) and the bartender introduced the menu to us and told us quite honestly that the happy hour special was much more worth it.

We grabbed a dogfishhead pumpkin ale and the bartender first stopped us and asked if we wanted a sample. Apparently they get bad feedback all the time and he didn&#39;t want us to be stuck with something we didn&#39;t like. Appreciated. Then some guy next to us ordered the same thing only to change his mind mid-pour (after the bartender had already started pouring). So the guy gave us that free drink! +1.

We also ordered their flatbread special. I gotta say, it was pretty disappointing. For a seemingly more upscale (vs grungy pub) food establishment, I would hope that the flatbread wouldn&#39;t fall apart - what I mean is it kind of seemed like they went to a supermarket, bought the premade stuff and hoped throwing cheese on it would fuse it all together...except that that didn&#39;t happen."

It was happy hour, and the drink specials were the average prices anywhere else. They were a bit pricy. After the movie, we nevertheless returned with even more friends due to the convenience of the location. Amazingly, they were able to seat a group of 9 right away, and it didn&#39;t take long to get our drinks. Unfortunately, our server didn&#39;t ask if we were going to need separate checks, and at the end of our meal (most of us ordered drinks and food), he told us it was too late to split the check or take multiple credit cards. Therefore, I deem Bellwether Meeting House &amp; Eatery unfit for groups. We could have told him that we&#39;d need separate checks from the beginning, but it sure would have been nice if our server would have asked since we were engrossed in conversations and since we were trying to figure out what to order. Plus, it was so loud in the restaurant that I couldn&#39;t actually hear what was being said at the end of the table. I had no idea that the separate check request hadn&#39;t been conveyed. The restaurant is beautiful. The food is decent (but a bit expensive for what it is), and the location is great since it&#39;s near touristy venues, conference hotels, etc. What a shame that it&#39;s not very good for groups when tourists and conference attendees often travel in packs."

There were a few tables but the downtown lunch rush was over.  The place was really clean and decorated nicely.  The seating was comfortable and the environment was quite.  We could talk normally and were not competing with other tables to hear each other.  

The food was AMAZING.   Everyone had something different but my BLT was off the chain!  I had mashed potatoes with it that were very bland but the experience was good.  The waitress was nice but a little slow with refills  The food took a while to come out of the kitchen but I was okay waiting for it because it was tasty.  I recommend going here when visiting Chicago and I will go back because the food was great."

I had the red snapper entre and asked to substitute vegetables for the other sides - the kitchen accommodated me with a mixed vegetable saute of asparagus, broccoli, and brussels sprouts that was almost the star of the show, upstaged only by the perfectly cooked  snapper (the skin wasn&#39;t crispy, but the actual filet was so good that I gladly pulled it off to get to the meat).

The wine, cocktail, and beer list is comprehensive and delicious.  Service is informal and very good - there when you want someone, not when you don&#39;t.  Strongly recommended."

This place used to be great and used to advertise late night food. As a local resident this was a reliable place. Then out of random they decided to change their food hours and when we sat at the bar looked at us such as &#34;how did you not know?&#34; This is no way to run business and this explains why you need to cut staff late at night to survive. No wonder you&#39;re about to fail. Close your doors so you can bring a good establishment in to run a proper late night business in an area that would kill the revenue needed to survive.

I had the chiliquiles. Absolutely the worst. No flavor no depth and no originality. 

We ordered a cup of chili and it was terrible. 

The bagel and salmon plate was equally terrible. Dry salmon. 

They were out of buiscuts n gravy. Really? Flour, milk and sausage. There is a Whole Foods Market right across the street. Take a $20 out of the till and go buy some!

Tonight I learned to never order a cocktail here.  The bartenders have no idea how to make one, nor does the establishment stock the bar with the ingredients that you&#39;d expect from cocktails in the bar&#39;s price range.  Hopefully you will not make the same $15 mistake I did.  It was the worst Manhattan I can remember.  It tasted like flavored syrup without even a hint of whiskey.  A Manhattan doesn&#39;t have flavored (or unflavored) syrup as an ingredient, and it should be almost entirely whiskey.  Moreover, high-end Manhattans (which is the price range of this establishment) should not come with low-end  Maraschino cherries, get Luxardo at a minimum!  Yeah, I paid them $15 to serve me this nasty-syrup swill, but they couldn&#39;t have paid me anything to drink it.

The pulled pork sandwich was ok.  I wouldn&#39;t ever order it again, but I did finish it."

Hostess was very funny when I used the words &#34;We have a Reservation&#34;; it was obvious they get a lot of street traffic with the theatre right next door.  Funnier was how she offered us our selection of 2-tops and 4-tops because &#34;we had a reservation&#34;.

Ambiance and noise level were perfect, unfortunately from that point forward things started to go downhill.  Our server did not seem new or even overwhelmed, yet drink service was slow, glasses were empty before offering a refill, and I don&#39;t even recall him coming to ask how everything tasted.

We started with the Oysters, yes if you are following me, or rather stalking me, that is 2 nights in a row of Oysters.  Then we both ordered the Salmon on a bed of kale salad and pine nuts.  I added a beet salad as a side.  The Salmon, cooked medium was PERFECT!, although I could have eaten 3.  The bed of kale salad was tasty, yet the portion seemed rather large.  The beet salad, should have read Mile High pile of Arugula with beets thrown on top as an after thought.  Again Tasty, but not what I want in a &#34;Beet Salad&#34;.

I rarely do desert, but I&#39;m in chaos mode, so it&#39;s time I dirty up my eating a little bit.

Server simply presents the check by standing it on the table.  &#34;Um, we&#39;d like a desert menu please.&#34;  No apology, or anything.

I had the Chocolate Mouse, tasty although it had been piped DAYS before.  While my companion had the Pecan pie something or other, it was really more like a torte, served with spoons, we had to ask for forks.

Only NOW, do we see a member of management enter the front of the house, we&#39;re well over 2 hours into this, long past our movie time.  Yet we need not worry.  We did not pre-order tickets, and already had a backup plan should the need arise.

Food was tasty, but nothing to write home about.  Long and Short, after an hour of bowling I was HUNGRY again, and had to order food at Lucky Strike."

With that said, on my second night in Chicago, I took a &#34;nap&#34; at 7pm and woke up at midnight. I then realized I had nothing to eat since brunch. We were starving and were disappointed that everything closed around 9pm-2am. We also had to factor in walking and we didn&#39;t want to be rushed out of the restaurant. We stumbled across Bellwether because it was the only restaurant opened till 4am (which I take granted for in New York). The restaurant was beautiful and was on the other side of the river from our hotel. Food wise, it was okay. The calamaris were very chewy for whatever reason, the chipotle chicken spring rolls tasted like things you get at Costco, and the beef sliders were okay. I think the best was the truffle fries that came with the burger. However, I appreciate them being open at odd hours during the night for starving people like us. Service was great too!"

Something about that place had charm and character that this new place is lacking.  The best way I can describe it is this place lacks soul.  Or maybe it&#39;s got a bit of an identity crisis as it still figures out what it wants to be.

So while parts of it still remind me of the old corner pub that it once was, today there are sparkling chandeliers twinkling overhead, white table cloths  but coupled with a menu that still feels more bar-esque.

We went before a show at the AMC theater next door.  We sat at a high top in the front room which again felt more casual but a bit odd as I looked at the people around me at the linen draped tables.

We started with the oysters which were quite good.  And my martini?  Perfection in a glass.  For my entrée I just went with a burger and my friend had the fish tacos.  Both came up quickly and were also pretty good.

Service was friendly and functional and we were able to get in and out in time to make our movie.

I asked the waiter if the pasta was suppose to be super sour and he said yes we put lemon juice on top of the dish.... It was more than on on top, it was all throughout.  Our waiter was nonchalant and really didn&#39;t care that I had to eat sour spaghetti. My dish was not shrimp scampi. You couldn&#39;t taste a bit of garlic or butter. I think they should rename this dish sour spaghetti topped with shrimp My husband on the other hand ordered the smothered chicken breast and risotto and that was very good.

The kitchen staff forgot to put avocado on my BLT, which is a basic ingredient for the dish according to the menu.  My friend ordered a coffee which arrived warm, but nowhere near hot.  The server, who was friendly, was going to bring another fresh cup, but apparently forgot and we had to ask the bus boy, who was clearly the hardest worker in the place.

I went here this past Friday, October 16, 2005, and they sat us in a table all the way in the back of the restaurant which was really distracting because that is where the kitchen is and the register where the servers enter the orders so there was too much traffic.  Our waiter an older slim man with a heavy accent possibly European but I am not sure was horrible.  He took forever to take our order in fact the people seated in front of us who arrived 15-20 minutes later and were a party of 4 got their food before me and my girlfriend.  We asked for suggestions for a tropical cocktail and he had no suggestions.  He was also very short and rude and for the cherry on top when we paid he came over to our table and demanded his pen back which I had in my hand.

The space was beautiful- they had it all lit up with lights, which gave it a nice holiday theme. We were able to bring in our own DJ too which was a nice option! 

The staff was AMAZING!! Rachel helped me coordinate the event, and was extremely helpful! She helped me pick out menu items and made the process extremely easy.

The general Manager, Vincent, was also amazing! He grabbed all of our guests coats as they entered the event, and made sure that the people entering were our guests only. He kept checking up on us throughout the event, to make sure that everything was going smoothly.

I was so happy with how the event turned out, and all of our guests had such a great time. If you are ever looking for a space to rent out to have a party, definitely check out Bellwether!"

Upscale casual seating, with a full bar on one side and large street-level windows on the other, the whole thing comes together in an off-beat way that doesn&#39;t seem forced.  The waitstaff was eclectic, but efficient, a little too much so with the waiter that obsessed over keeping the water glass full: completely full, but he was good.  We started with the pretzels and jalapeno beer cheese, and I&#39;ve gotta recommend this!  The pretzels are a fluffier dough with a butter-soaked outside browned to perfection, and the beer cheese jalapeno fusion was just spicy enough without becoming just plain hot.  I got the Stuffed Chicken Breast with risotto, and while it had more garlic and less fennel than I wanted, it was still very good.  Prices aren&#39;t bad for the location, and what you get.  I recommend you give it a try."

Our server came over and asked about the food but did so while walking by our table and didn&#39;t even stop to hear an answer. This was absolutely some of the worst service we&#39;ve ever had.

But it didn&#39;t seem overly noisy downstairs either. Our server George was absolutely GREAT. He was fun with banter as well as knowledgeable about the menu and patient and accommodating with our large group. I had a stuffed meatball on linguini with sauce. The meatball had a captivating grilled/smokey taste.  It has haunted me ever since. In a good way. I keep ordering Italian food here and there to try and copy the experience, but all falls short.

Located in striking distance of my preferred theater (AMC 21), I stopped in here around 1 pm after taking in the Saturday am viewing of Monuments Men. What can I say, all that wartime violence made me work up an appetite. 

I decided to perch up at the bar. The cocktail list is definitely on the terse side, but I knew that I wanted a Bloody Mary. The drink came out promptly, which gave me more than enough time to look at the menu. Having done a reconnaissance online, I already had some idea of the food offerings. I went with the pulled pork sandwich, which came with a side of fries. The portions are substantial, with even enough for leftovers. The service itself was attentive, and it seemed like the bartender warmed up to me as a customer as time went on--doubtless, my generous tip and the fact that the place was not packed helped on that score. From looking online, it seems like the happy hour (half-priced hot appetizers from 3-6 pm on weekdays) is a well-kept secret. I will definitely be back here and am hoping this establishment remains viable for the foreseeable future."

Clarkes, however, it&#39;s no longer there.  Now it&#39;s Bellwether Meeting House &amp; Eatery.  Please note... this is an over due review....

The owners certainly did an amazing job of decorating the restaurant with the hanging of the crystals from the ceiling to the brightness of the room to the bar area.  I will say, the only negative item are the &#34;booths&#34;.  The booths are a little uncomfortable.  The booth seating will be a little hard to explain so here goes.... the bench is shared between and the guest behind you.  When that person moves, you can really feel it.  Same with the backing of the booth.  The seating  can be a little frustrating.

I was greeted by the hostess and was sat promptly.  The server was very prompt.  He went over the menu and took the drink order.  When he returned with my beverage, he took my order.  I had ordered the cheeseburger (medium).

Within the appropriate time, my meal was delivered.  The burger was just right.  I was surprised how juicy the burger was.  No complaints here.  The serve did check in without being bothersome.

Based on my experience, I would return."

I don&#39;t know what took me so long to find you, (as I&#39;m kicking myself for missing your Cuban delights), but it&#39;s never too late. First, and this is no offense to anyone, certainly not the restaurant, but we had no interest in any of the wildly fusionized Spanish delights and made as quick as possible a beeline to the Cuban delights.

Ambiance is cool and sleek and Miami near the water modern, reminding diners of a swanky supper on Biscayne Bay or an old nostalgic favorite spot on SW 8th Street. Ah, the memories! 

To say the least, the Ropa Vieja is simply wonderful! Every bite of shredded flank steak has just the right amount of garlic, peppers, tomato deliciousness. The rice and black beans were so wonderful, cooked to perfection - just like it was always done in Miami...I was tempted to lick the plate, especially with the outstanding sweet plantains, prepared perfectly, just the way they turn out every time in Miami. 

The yummy coconut rum flan - did not disappoint, either. The Guava cheesecake is Miami-style awesome as well. While I would probably remove the Latin specialties from the menu and make it entirely Cuban, I can&#39;t say other customers would feel this way. At least next time, we won&#39;t hyperventilate over the menu with worry that we won&#39;t find anything authentically Cuban on the menu. You do, unfortunately, have to sift past a whole bunch of apps and mains that are not Cuban variety whatsoever. 

Forget that 3 hour nuisance of a flight with passengers packed in sardine can style and come to Havana instead!!"

I had the caipirinha (yummmm) and the coffee. 

Our service was really what stood out. The waiter and the hostess we accommodating and were sooooooo sweet to my mother, whom had never had Cuban food before. They were patient and were very kind with their recommendations.

Those are food trucks or restaurants not in the area, but close enough. 

If you don&#39;t make a reservation- you should be fine. There was a private party upstairs, so we were seated in the downstairs dining room which felt like we were in a basement party. A loud chatter restaurant and our waiter could care less that he was there but he was friendly and just asked us what we wanted to order. Service was a bit slow. 

FOOD! Amazing. My friend got a cuban sandwich and i got the steak jibarito. For 13.95 it was a great portion, perfectly cooked steak in my sandwich between two crispy plantains. I have no complaints.

Unfortunately, that&#39;s where the love stopped. As someone who lives much of the year in Florida, I&#39;ve had a lot of Cuban food at many different restaurants, and I&#39;ve never encountered anything like what is served here.

First off, the lunch menu has been taken over in part by Tex-Mex items such as quesadillas, not a good sign. Perhaps foolishly, I stuck with something that sounded authentically Cuban, and had the Pollo from the dinner menu, along with a cup of black bean soup.

Good black bean soup is smooth, with plenty of whole beans and crispy bits of onion. This gritty slurry had none of those characteristics. 

Traditional Cuban chicken is roasted, with a crisp, garlic coated skin and moist interior, exactly as described on the menu. What showed up, though was a soggy mess covered in a weird salty white gravy that had almost no flavor.

It had more flavor than the &#34;congri,&#34; it was served with, though. That mixture of rice and black beans was dry and utterly flavorless. Fried yucca was similarly flavorless, but had a nice crisp exterior.

The saving grace on the plate were the ripe plantains, which were perfectly caramelized and still hot from the sauce pan. Sadly, one out of five is not enough to get me to ever return.

It&#39;s a shame because the service was efficient, and the place looks great. They just need major adjustments in the kitchen."

I went with the jibarito and it was pretty good. Better than some of the versions I&#39;ve had at some other latin joints. The steak was quite tender and packed with flavor along with the two fried twice green plantains made for a good lunch. I need to get back here for the mojito though!"

The tortilla soup had a bean-y texture, which was not what I expected, but still tasty nonetheless. The guac and ceviche were also good and generous portions. 

For our main dishes, I ordered the Havana roasted pulled pork and my boyfriend got the carne con tequila. My boyfriend loved his steak and said it was super flavorful. I kept stealing his Latin fries that were tossed in a delicious chimichurri sauce and would definitely recommend getting a side of these fries. I also really liked the pulled pork dish (even as leftovers the next day), but my one gripe was that the roasted cream corn sauce that it came with was a bit too sweet to me for this savory dish.

Overall, Havana is a great place if you&#39;re looking for a casual place with strong drinks, flavorful food, and a varied menu. Will be returning to try their other tasty sounding dishes and drinks sometime soon!"

The overall atmosphere was very welcoming and I hear on Fridays after 10 they move the tables creating a dance floor for live Latin music. I definitely plan to revisit! If you are in the area and have the taste for Cuban/Latin American food definitely visit this place.

Anyways Waz suggested we eat here to try the Jibarito sandwich.  We ordered the Steak Jibarito - not knowing what to expect... the food arrives and its a flat steak in between a flat fried banana!!!! OMG so goooood! It also comes with dipping sauce, not sure whats in it, who cares the sandwich was yummy! Its about $13 bucks and def worth it. 

We also ordered chips and guac... delicious. 

The rumors are true... chicago does have better food in town.

Now im on a mission to find me a Jibarito sandwich in San Diego!"

Loved the chicken in plantain leaves so full of flavor. We went there as a big group and ordered a bunch of things and except for the beef (Ropa Veija) that was a little rubbery according to the hubby every one seemed pretty happy with their dishes. The entrees are pretty large in size so we skipped the appetizers. 
The cocktails kept following and had a good amount of alcohol in them. The service was quick inspite of the place being jam packed on a Friday night. 

Coming to the best part, the music!! Love Latin music and they seemed to mix it with English songs from time to time. Our group had a great evening! Will definitely be going there again!"

It certainly delivered! The tostones were perfectly fried. And while I&#39;m used to eating them with just a sprinkle of salt, the accompanying dips were packed with flavor!

My friend and I split the shrimp skewer appetizer and Cuban pork plate. The shrimp dish stole the show, the pork was just ok. I was expecting a slow roasted, fall off the bone cut of meat rather than slices of pork. 

Great mojitos to wash the meal down. The restaurant was packed all night. It&#39;s no secret that Havana is full of energy and delicious cuisine."

It was about 10 on a Saturday and we were easily seated. The food was delicious and came out pretty quickly. We&#39;re ordered a margarita pitcher for 35$ and I&#39;ll say it was pretty strong. Parking is tough but that&#39;s Chicago. Very nice! 

They cleared the middle tables and at about 11:30 it became a dance club with a live band and DJ. The band playing was very cool and me and my girl danced the night away. Definitely will be back. This is a good option to take a date or it seemed like there were plenty of available women for the single guys."

This is a gem of a joint right downtown.  There are several places around it so I will have to visit this street again.  I will be returning to Havana for several reasons.

Just to let you know, Havana is a very intimate restaurant (small).  There are only a few booths and a line of tables in the center.  It is dimly lit beautifully and is a date night showstopper.  From the front door to the bathrooms everything is clean and exceptionally kept.  The decor is romantic and classy but not stuffy and pretentious.  So on appearance, from the charming outward appearance to the quaint seating area, this place is wonderful.

I had a reservation, I showed up about 10 minutes early and was seated at my reservation time so thumbs up for not making me wait as it was packed in there.  I was waiting on 2 people in my party anyway.  The host had a pleasant and professional demeanor which I appreciated  My cousin and I had a drink at the bar while we waited and the bartender was polite and cheery and again professional.

All the staff is well trained because I also loved our waiter Eddie.  He was honestly suggestive on drinks and meal choice and seemed genuinely concerned that we had a great experience.  We didn&#39;t wait long for anything and he checked on the table properly.

2 people in my party aren&#39;t big eaters so after appetizers and drinks they couldn&#39;t finish their entrees and they are not the type that brings home leftovers so they had a lot on their plate.  Eddie was concerned and asked if they were satisfied with their meal.  He was assured that they were, it&#39;s just that they were full and don&#39;t do leftovers, But I feel that the fact that he asked was excellent behavior.  A genuine concern again for our experience.

I enjoyed the live Latin band after 11:00 and the music that played throughout.  Some people were even dancing in the front.  This is an enjoyable atmosphere.

If all that isn&#39;t enough, the food was fantastic.  We all loved the chimichungas, and the guacamole and salsa for the chips were flavorful and well seasoned.  I had a chicken dish with poblano pepper cream sauce and it was on point.  The portion on the paella is over the top and delicious.  The chocolate cake brought out for my birthday with a candle on it was a nice touch from our waiter and it was fudge deliciousness, we all shared a bite and it was a great dessert. Everything we ate tasted great and authentic.  I wasn&#39;t disappointed in anything at Havana.  I seriously have not one complaint.  I will return."

Carne asada and three pitchers of mojitos. Left happier. Went back five years later off the fond memory I had of the first visit. 

Visit 3: This coming Friday
Can&#39;t tell you how much I&#39;m looking forward to it. 

Not sure why reviews range the way they do on this place. I&#39;m thinking guest education. The food&#39;s delicious. It&#39;s consistent, on my drawn out ass timeline. It opens to a dance floor on Friday nights. And $15 pitchers of mojitos!? And this coming from a guy who keeps a recipe on-hand for subpar occasions. You owe it yourself to go. 

If it&#39;s your first time, and especially on a Friday or weekend, give yourself ample time. Or bring company. And order from the especialidades. With the exception of the jibarito. Save that for Cafecito-on E Congress."

I was going to try something different but I loved the jibarito so much last time that I got it again. And again, it did not disappoint. 

The plantains were fried to perfection and while the steak was a bit thinner than I recalled, the total sandwich was perfect for lunch and again, I love the sauce that it comes with. Delicious! The sandwich also comes with fries and chimichurri dipping sauce, which was tasty, but I couldn&#39;t eat many of the fries without being too full.

Havana is a Cuban restaurant on the southern tip of River North. It is very small - about 10 tables or so on the inside. They also have an area out on the sidewalk with another four tables. There is a large wooden bar that takes up much of the interior space. 

We were immediately greeted and seated - we had an early dinner, around 5 PM. The sidewalk seats were all taken but it was wide open inside. We had a very nice table by the window so we could watch the foot traffic outside.

The waiter asked if we had any questions on the menu or Cuban food in general. Since Cuban is one of our favorite foods, we really did not have any questions. We ordered their large guacamole platter while we decided. My wife and I both ordered caipirinhas. They were tart and excellent. The guacamole platter came with tri-color chips with three salsas - the guacamole itself, fresh pico de gallo and a VERY spicy salsa.

I was really torn on what to get. I absolutely love Cuban sandwiches, but we were celebrating, so I ordered Carne con Tequila - a chargrilled skirt steak served with tequila-infused sauce and Latin fries tossed with homemade chimichurri. It was fantastic. In talking to the waiter later in the meal, I asked about Pisco, a South American Liquor I&#39;d never tried. He brought me a shot. It was very good, very similar to white tequila.

After dinner, and all of the drinks, I had a Cuban coffee to finish out the meal. 

There were some earlier reviews that mentioned slow service. I agree, but it was not unbearably slow and we were not in a hurry. The service allowed us a relaxing meal where we could enjoy the decor, the food and the company.

This was a great experience, one I am eager to share with others."

Chimichangas ($9) were terrific, perfectly crisp and filled with moist chicken in an addictively good poblano cream sauce.

Empanadas ($11) were just ok, the manchego was the best by far while the chicken and ground beef weren&#39;t that interesting.

Carne con tequila ($18) wasn&#39;t great, the steak was slightly overcooked and I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the tequila sauce. The chimichurri was good, but tasted a little weird alongside the tequila.

Pulled pork ($17) was a little underwhelming, the pork was tender but not very moist, and the potatoes and creamed corn were good but also added a lot of carb-y, creamy heaviness that wasn&#39;t balanced by any sort of acidity.

Seafood paella ($21) was a mixed bag. The seafood was plentiful and the chorizo was great with the pineapple, but the dish was a little dry overall and the rice wasn&#39;t crusty/crispy.

BBQ ribs ($19) were amazing. The ribs were incredibly flavorful and fall-off-the-bone tender, and the guava-infused BBQ sauce was tangy and unusual. 

Jalea de mariscos ($22) was also a fantastic choice, a lot of fresh shellfish including scallops and shrimp in a creamy coconut sauce over rice, I guess it&#39;s sort of like Cuban curry. Definitely recommend.

Havana has its share of hits and misses, but get the empanadas and either the ribs or jalea de mariscos and you&#39;ll leave full and extremely satisfied. I will be back for those."

Generally, this was a great meal.  We tried both soups on the menu; I thought both were great, but my friend thought that the black bean might have had a slight edge.  I tried the Torta Cubana and was very satisfied...the ketchup had a little spice to it, which served the perfectly-cooked fries very well, and the bread the sammie was served on was excellent, as were the fillings.  My friend tried the Ropa Vieja...she thought it was good, but &#34;not as good as the spots I used to hit in Miami&#34;, whatever that&#39;s worth!

The only negative was service/food delivery speed...we arrived at about five before noon for our noon reservation, but we didn&#39;t get out until just after 1.  For soups and sammies over the work day lunch hour, things moved a little slow for my taste.  Otherwise, I would come back here; menu prices seem fair and you get a ton of food for the price, at least off the lunch sammie menu."

I went on Friday night because I&#39;d been on the road and wanted to eat. So my buddy chose this place, neither one of us had ever been. It&#39;s rather small, yet has a restaurant/bar atmosphere. We sat outside, it was just really loud inside plus the weather was great. It was great to people watch. The staff was super nice, very cordial, extremely attentive. There wasn&#39;t a moment where my glass was empty (always a plus!). The owner/manager came by and spoke with us, which I thought was great. Our waitress, I don&#39;t remember her name, was very attentive while busy at the same time. Really nice lady. The food was great. I ordered the flank steak w/black beans and rice. I don&#39;t remember it&#39;s actual name, but I was expecting something different, nevertheless it was really good. Their plantains I would say are absolutely the best!!!!!!! They were sweet, a little gooey, and soft with a slight edge of crisp. I know, you would think &#34;how did they do that&#34;, if I could only tell you, I&#39;m still trying to figure it out myself. I really wanted to go back the next day but they weren&#39;t open when I checked out of my amazing hotel! While at the restaurant, I also checked in with yelp and they offered a free dessert only on Monday - Thursday, so I was a little sad. I addressed it with my waitress who then asked the manager and the honored it.The little things like that made my experience really worth going there. I chose the Key Lime Pie. The dessert menu was small, they offered 2 types of Flan and a few other things, but my Key Lime Pie was just right. The graham cracker crust was perfectly matched with the sweet and tart of the key lime. They drizzled a puree of lime on the left side, and whipped cream on the right, with a twisted lime slice, it was really good. I wish I would&#39;ve tried the Mojito Pitcher, but I was driving so I couldn&#39;t do such...but it looked great. The next time I go to Chicago, I&#39;m ordering a pitcher just so I could try it out. Another thing I appreciated was the waitress. She was kind enough to inform us on the time it takes to cook certain foods, just in case if we had to hurry. She had great recommendations and a great sense of humor. I will definitely go back!!!"

After reading some of the yelp reviews I was hesitant, but let me tell you-this place is amazing! We started off with a classic mojito, and it was perfect. Not too sweet, not too minty, just the right amount of everything. We ordered the ceviche appetizer and it was really good, especially with the plantains! For my entrée I had the salmon and oh man the flavors were everything. It had a BBQ flavor while tasting fresh and had a kick to it, which I thoroughly enjoyed since I tend to douse my food in hot sauce. 

The service was perfect, we were enjoying drinks and conversation and were not looking to get in and out. Personally, I think enjoying a meal for a long period time is one of the most relaxing things. Definitely recommend this place as it is provides different flavors than you&#39;ll find around River North!"

Wow!  This place is incredible!  The Chimichangas are phenomenal!  Who doesnt like fried, chicken-filled tortillas in poblano cream sauce, with cilantro sour cream and pico!

I had trouble deciding between the Havana Steak Sandwich (Tender slices of skirt steak with melted cheese, lettuce, grilled onions, and spicy mayonnaise served on onion ciabatta bread) or the Jibarito (which is basically the same as the steak sandwich with the difference being twice-fried green plaintains instead of the ciabatta bread).  The Havana Steak Sandwich is OUTSTANDING!  I could eat this everyday!

My friend and I had two mojitos each and shared the yuca con mojo. The mojitos were ok, tasted good but nothing spectacular. The yuca, though, not good at all. Fried yuca should be crispy on the outside, tender on the inside; this was just tough, no crunch, like it had been fried and reheated. The mojo (garlic sauce) didn&#39;t taste like garlic, and had this strange sweetness. Their chocolate cake was good though, not amazing, but good.

We also really love their guacamole and salsa starter as well as the Roasted Pulled Pork with jalapeño mashed potatoes and creamed corn...I wish they&#39;d add a little more of the creamed corn but it is still delicious!

I found this little gem on Yelp and I went to check it out.  The restaurant has a very nice ambience and good food.  For starters we ordered a guava mojito.  I heard so many great reviews about mojitos here, but I was a bit disappointed with my mojito because it tasted a bit watered down.  Not bad, but not what I was expecting in mojitos that have rave reviews.

For an appetizer, I ordered the fried plantain chips with warm black bean sauce and salsa - Platanos Maduros.  Wow!  The chips were perfect - crispy and crunchy coated with a spice that gave it the right kick.  The black bean sauce and salsa were perfect choice to eat these chips with.  Highly recommended!

I ordered the black bean soup - Sopa De Frijol, for starters.  A wonderful soup that is very flavorful and just yummy.

For the main course, I ordered the Chiles Rellenos.  Just perfect.  Highly recommended if you are a vegetarian.  The dishes were amazing with fresh flavors and ingredients.

If you are a dessert fan, don&#39;t forget to try out the Coconut Rum Flan.  All in all, this is a great restaurant and a great dining experience."

On my last visit, I decided to skip a full meal and go for appetizers. My choice was the Empanada trio and the Chimichags. Both dishes were flavorful, priced well and more than enough. I even took advantage of the Mojito special. (Pitcher for $20 on Fridays) enough for two people to easily share, which I did. The Mojito was as good as the food and I look forward to going back for the Capriahna special soon. Havana is good for date night, and after work drinks. Can&#39;t wait to try the dancing sometime."

You can literally see the writing on the wall, turn around and walk out. When you look around at the crown molding in the restaurant, there are different words for the foods they offer. Two stood out immediately, Marquitas (should be Mariquitas) and Plantanos (more like Platanos). If you claim to be a Latin restaurant at least spell the words correctly.

Moving on to the food. I was beyond disappointed with my food and service. I ordered Ropa Vieja and had 2 bites of the meat and that was enough for me. I admit I am spoiled by my Cuban mother-in-law, but this is ridiculous. Super fatty, chewy and totally the wrong flavor. The beans were just soaked in water with no salt and no sofrito. 

According to the group, the Cuban sandwich was good and the pork dish was ok. However, no one would return. Except maybe for the flan and Cuban sandwich. 

What bothered me the most is that the guy who took my plate ( I&#39;m assuming the manager as he was different from our waiter) saw that I didn&#39;t touch my food and said nothing. No, &#34;did you enjoy your meal&#34;?, &#34;can I wrap that&#34;?

My boyfriend suggested coming to Wyler Road for sandwiches. I just wanted to recharge myself... and my phone. Alas, I&#39;ll never forget the relieving whoosh of cold air when we finally walked into this bar.

We were greeted by several smiling faces who gestured us to sit wherever we wanted. My eyes quickly darted to the drink menu, and the cute-sounding Watermelon Basil Daisy caught my attention. It had tequila, orange curacao, basil, and watermelon. What&#39;s not to like? Delicious cocktail!

I was ready to order a sandwich off the regular menu, then our waitress pointed out a special. House-smoked duck, lettuce, tomato-peach conserve, pickled onion, and lemon aioli on a rosemary roll. WHAT!!! Everything about that sandwich sounded amazing. I couldn&#39;t resist, so I ordered it... and it tasted as good as it sounded. I loved the savory flavor of the duck, lightened by the flavors of the conserve, onion, and aioli, and complimented by the herbs in the bread. Would recommend if this was ever on the menu again.

My boyfriend and I sat on the barstools facing the windows. Perfect for people-watching. Well, house-watching since there&#39;s not many pedestrians. More importantly there were outlets to charge our phones while waiting for our food and drinks. This seems like a hip place to hang out and somewhere I&#39;d like to come regularly for sandwiches and cocktails if I was a local."

The pineapple mai tai made the trip. They were so easy to drink, and after only two it was Lyft time. As should be the case if mai tais are made well. Did curds and a sandwich before I adios-ed and although I&#39;m not from Wisconsin I think these deep fried little apps would have made a cheese head proud. 

Although I didn&#39;t particularly looooove my short rib sandwich it was alright considering the price of only $13 bucks. Good just not great. I&#39;m sure the other sandwiches are awesome. They look awesome. I&#39;ll have to come back and try them. 

Wyler Road is worth it.

Saw it on Chicago&#39;s Best and decided to make the trip to Logan Square to check it out for myself. Really cute inside, with a retro-hipster design going on. We sat at the bar, and our bartender was so nice and helpful. Great service. The beer menu isn&#39;t very long but they have good options and some good deals. As a vegetarian I appreciated that there were a good number of veggie/vegan options. I ended up getting the Beer Cheese Melt with a side salad. One of the best side salads I&#39;ve had, and the Beer Cheese Melt was really good. Only thing I would change is to remove the middle layer of bread (there are three pieces) because the middle layer got a bit soggy, but it was very tasty still. We also got a boozy lemon rhubarb milkshake which was delicious as you can imagine. I also enjoyed the music selection. Highly recommend!"

It took me a while to make it here to try their well reviewed sandwiches, but I&#39;m glad I finally did! The slow roasted pork carnitas torta was out of this world good. Also quite large, but I manned up and ate the whole thing. My husband had the fried chicken and biscuits concoction and it was also very good (kind of like a fried chicken version of biscuits and gravy). Honestly, cannot rave enough about the food. The house made chips were delicious and fresh too and it&#39;s nice that they come in several flavors. Cocktails were also quite good and worth stopping by for even if you aren&#39;t hungry enough to order food. Also, special shoutout to the amazing house made peach and blueberry gelato. While we didn&#39;t like the sprinkles (they were mike and ike flavored and that&#39;s just not our thing), the actual gelato was incredible. Totally worth the calories :) 

The overall vibe was very relaxed and we enjoyed sitting outside in the back patio. Bonus: it&#39;s dog friendly. The inside is your usual industrial hipster chic, but they&#39;re not rubbing your face in it. Service was very attentive and friendly. Can&#39;t wait to return!"

Let&#39;s start with the downs... These tended to dominate the experience. My sole purpose for venturing to this lovely little neighborhoody joint was to try to delectable-looking clam belly sandwich. Unfortunately, I was dismayed to find that they had taken it off the menu! That pretty much sealed the deal right then and there, ruining my experience. I bitterly settled on the Rib Eye, which I regretted immediately upon first view. The minuscule portion was certainly not worth the $13 price tag, and the meat wasn&#39;t even hot; lukewarm would describe it more accurately. The fried onion rings dominated the taste of the SLIDER, while I couldn&#39;t even taste the chimichurri (the only reason I settled on this sandwich in the first place). My lady friend&#39;s fried green tomato sandwich was nothing to write home about, either. 

The friendly staff and draft cocktails are all great and dandy, but for God&#39;s sake, bring back the clam!"

The potato balls were alright but not something I would insist you have. The cheese curds were average, the sandwiches were basic. The side salad was pretty good, but c&#39;mon, who wants to hear me rave about the side salad?!? The service was great and parking was easy.

It always makes me laugh when places in the US are all proudly &#34;Est. 2015!&#34; when most places in Europe opened in 1600 or someshitlikethat. But, I get it, I&#39;m not in Europe, and I digress.

What this place is, is a great little neighborhood joint! It seems a bit out of the way (this is good!) and as yet undiscovered. This won&#39;t last long, as it is in oh-so-hipster-fabulous Logan Square. Get in there now, I guess. 

The back patio is very nice, and chill. Another bar is being constructed, which will add tables as well. They&#39;re going to need them.

The menu is pretty simple - sandwiches, salads, wraps, apps, but each thing looked like a gem. We got the Cheese Curd appetizer, because 2 of the 4 of us are authentic Cheeseheads, and the other two are willing participants in that sort of nonsense. Cheese curd appetizer appropriately cheesy and gooey. A big hit.

For my sandwich, I got the Reuben, and my companion got the Croque Madame. Both were great! My Reuben was a good size, and very flavorful. It could have had more sauerkraut, but there is never enough sauerkraut for this Kraut. The addition of pickles was a successful one. The Croque Madame was tasty as well. Both sandwiches were $11 each, which is pretty standard for this area. The chips that come with the sandwich were DELICIOUS. Salt n&#39; vinegar goodness, I LOVED them. The spicy chips were tasty as well.

Cocktails. Good beer selection, the beer lovers in our party were fans of their picks. I went for the Bourbon Mule which was a delicious drink. Not badly priced at $9 here in Hipsterville. The Strawberry Rhubarb Daisy was very refreshing, and had a stalk of Rhubarb stuck in it. No one speaks of Rhubarb, and I believe more people should. Very tasty summer drink.

I love how this place is integrated into the neighborhood, and looks like it&#39;s been there a long time. Will definitely come back in summer for the patio, and in colder months to enjoy the nicely designed barroom. Unpretentious vibe, with a friendly, attentive, efficient staff. Great place!"

I&#39;ve been thinking about the shortrib sandwich for a couple days now.  It was really that good.  They even let me get it without bleu cheese on it.  I just can&#39;t do those stinky cheeses.  

Our server was friendly and helpful, as I said, that sandwich was great and I enjoyed the generous side salad that came with it.  My charming and indecisive companion thought there were TOO MANY veggie options.  What a weirdo.  Good beer list, good cocktails, good times.  Also they have cheese curds.

Well-curated selection of beers. Creative list of easy-drinking cocktails. Fun appetizer options. Sweet and sassy staff. Fried foods might need just a little bit more tweaking - cheese curds batter reminded me just a little too much of corn dog in boring fried shell texture, there wasn&#39;t much flavor going on despite the fried basil, and the exteriors of the whole belly clams were just a touch on the wet/greasy side. I appreciated the opportunity to eat some fresh-tasting fried whole bellies in Chicago, but I wish the kitchen had removed some of the innards of my batard so that the sandwich eating experience was more cohesive. Tequila-lime milkshake was a pleasing end to this meal."

I have been here twice now. It has been pretty amazing both times. I especially like their bloody mary and my favorite sandwich is the Short Rib. 

// Reuben - This sandwich comes out warm with a ton of flavor. A good amount of corned beef and it is done well. Muenster cheese, russian dressing  and bread and butter pickles. Its a slammmm dunk! 

// Chicken Salad  Sandwich - this sandwich is cold and it pretty interesting. It wasn&#39;t my favorite but I did enjoy the oddness of the sour grape jam. It added a nice fruity taste to the chicken salad. 

// Short Rib Sandwich - This sandwich is delicioussssss and is my current favorite. Comes out with tons of meat. I really enjoyed the crunchiness of the fried shallot. I am a sucker for crunchy in my sandwich. 

// Bloody Mary - about 12 oz but it is yummy. Not a whole lot of garnishes but has a spicy rimmed garnish. I would recommend it. 

I forgot the prices but everything is pretty reasonable. about 8-14 $ per item. It has a really nice indoor decor and the staff is very nice. Food always comes out hot and quick."

Lunch for 5 people and 1 baby - $100 after tip BEAT THAT, EVERY OTHER RESTAURANT!

Grilled cheese - amazing and gooey

homemade chips - got the salt and vinegar and the spicy, I loved them both, but I am opting toward the S&amp;V

Ribeye - HOLY CHRIST YOU GUYS THIS WAS THE ONE. Loved everything about it, the bread, shmear, meat, jesus lord in heaven this is my church. Such nice presentation also.

Tomato bisque - tasty, tangy, hot and with sprinkles of cheese on top

Milkshake - my kids drank this all up with gusto, I even watched the bartender make sure he got a good dollop of whipped cream on top. 

BBQ sandwich - one of the 4 ladies i was with got this and it was so great. 

They use mismatched plates which makes me feel like I am in someones house, I love it. They have a ton of great beer on tap, I had a Revolution Brew, I will for sure be back, hopefully this place brings more of these kinds of restaurants to this hood. I even saw some old school neighborhood guy sit at the counter drink a coffee and order a sandwich to go, that is great. So many kids there also!

They&#39;re very friendly but the pacing was weird. Its not too offensive since it is a little sandwich shop with a bar. We weren&#39;t upset but we did notice. It was pretty empty when we arrived for an early dinner on a week night. There were a few people at the bar. We took a seat and ordered a couple of draft cocktails. You would think that would be quick and easy but we waited a long time for those drinks! Like a really long time. I had the Pimm&#39;s Cup which was lovely. Just an herbaceous, light, summery drink. My boyfriend tried the ruby negroni which was also refreshing.
After we ordered some sandwiches we had some time to hang. I could see that my boyfriend&#39;s croque madame was made right away and sat on the counter, waiting, for a bit. That was weird. I had the special fried chicken &amp; biscuit sandwich. 
When looking at the menu you think the prices are great, but then you get your sandwich and see how small it is you think, the prices are terrible, but then as you eat you think that this is just enough food. So I don&#39;t know. Its not crazy expensive but you&#39;re not taking food home either.
I wish I would have seen/read the full description of that chicken sandwich because it was drenched in hot sauce. I am a wimp when it comes to heat. I got the gravy on the side so my boyfriend could try it, and he loved it, but I wish I had 86&#39;d the sauce altogether. It was painful. The chicken thigh was great. Very delicious but small. It was served on a small biscuit, not sandwich sized, which I thought was odd. This is a knife &amp; fork kind of sandwich. As it was the biscuit wasn&#39;t awesome so no biggie that there wasn&#39;t more of it.
My boyfriend&#39;s sandwich was delicious. He loved it. 
We tried the spicy chips and the vinegar chips. They are both amazing. There were a few plain chips that snuck into my batch that were kind of sad. Definitely in need of seasoning and/or dip. But I would order those chips if they offered dip as a starter. They were perfectly cooked.
I would definitely come back here for a casual hang. Its not quick but the delicious food and draft cocktails made you not care."

Probably the best I&#39;ve had outside of France, which is saying something.  The ham is super thinly sliced, the mustard is strong but not overpowering, the cheese is creamy but the sandwich doesn&#39;t drown in it, and the egg on top isn&#39;t too runny or too hard.  Seriously, this sandwich is excellent.  I&#39;m a big fan of Croque Monsieurs and Croque Madames and Wyler Road has something going for it with their sandwich construction.  I&#39;ve never tried any other sandwich and, honestly, I&#39;m afraid too because the Croque Madame is just too got not to have every time I come in.

The cocktails are yummy and they have ice cold Coors Banquet for $4 a pint, which is delicious.  The Potato Balls with Cheez Whiz are excellent.  The chips are only OK, but that can be overlooked due to the overall excellence of other things on the menu and that Croque Madame.  Get that sandwich if you like cheese and mustard.  

I love Wyler Road and can walk here from y house, which is amazing.  I love the food and the atmosphere.  The decor is modern, the service is friendly, and the drinks are plentiful.  Street parking can be a bit difficult, so walk or take the bus if you can."

I had the mac and cheese, which was on special and a little bit overly soupy. The biggest trouble was it took us nearly two hours to get our food (in spite of not being overly crowded), which was frustrating. 

However, because we were staying nearby we went back for a nightcap later, and the service was awesome. Our server that night was attentive, genuinely friendly, competent, and delightful.

I eneded up coming here to try the clam belly sandwich and it was fantastic.  The only complaint that I had about the sandwich is I wish it were a little bit less bread.  It would have been much better if they hallowed out the middle a bit as is done with Louisiana Po&#39; boys.  The somewhat delicate flavors of the clams get a little lost with the hearty bread, the tangy aoli and the much welcomed crispy bacon.

All of the sandwiches come with chips standard, I would like it as welll if they allowed you to substitute one of their other sides (even for a charge over the chips).  That aside the chips were quite tasty as well.  They were nice and crispy and even though I went for the spicy chips, they barely regisitered on the heat scale for me.

The beer and cocktail selections make this place live up to all that Logan Square has to offer."

I used to live a block away from here and I liked the Brown Sack which inhabited this building previously. Now I don&#39;t live quite as close and Wyler Road occupies this space. I paid a visit to the new joint to check it out. 

Good vibe when you come inside. It&#39;s a little strange to find a hip place like this on such a residential corner, but I suppose that&#39;s the neighborhood nowadays. They have a decent beer list and some draft cocktails. The menu is relatively small, which is actually nice, and everything sounded good. I decided on the short rib sandwich which is topped with fried shallots and bleu cheese. Flavor was great, you definitely get the short rib flavor from the bone. So much different that a regular shredded beef sandwich. Price was more reasonable than I expected, sandwich and chips or salad will run you $10-12."

A lot of people like this place and I was excited, expecting more of something like the local deli near my childhood neighborhood. Me and my boyfriend popped in a few days ago to check it out on our date night. It&#39;s really aesthetically cute and the space is great, if not a little small and cozy on the inside. I did not get a chance to check out the patio. Inside, tables are close together, spaced awkwardly and it was kinda loud with the group next to us.

I ordered the Italian, and my boyfriend got the Ribeye Sandwich. He ordered a beer and I got a root beer float. I have to say, it was a bad call on my part that I would ever buy a $7 root beer float. There was hardly any root beer and some places will give you the bottle but not here. Maybe their soda is on tap? My boyfriends sandwich was something like $13 and mine was $10. I knew what I was paying going into it, but for what we got, ---two sandwiches and two drinks, it ended up being about $45. I guess you pay for the ambiance?? I must have been spoiled growing up in other Chicago neighborhoods where you could get a really good deli sandwich, chips and a pop for $5-8 total. 

The staff was super nice, the food was good but I was expecting something interesting, different than what I would usually go to for a deli at that price point. I could not believe that we had to both throw down $20 for a sandwich and a drink, and that we had a server bring the food. Just a weird/expensive concept. I don&#39;t know if I have it in me or my wallet to make another trip."

wyler-road-chicago,Justin B.,Lp3VkVECiewJKV_pXzONqw,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,167,299,pO07utSOs_qXfH3mUw7YzQ,3.0,2015-11-18,"This was only just fine...which in many ways means it was a bust for our group, given that we saw the phrase &#34;...menu...by the executive chef of Au Cheval&#34; on one of the write-ups on Eater, which should have made the mouth water.

Brought a party of four to the space last week.  We all liked the layout and the seating mixed with the large bar area works well for a fancier-than-normal neighborhood joint, if that makes sense.  We tried the special, a sloppy joe; we also tried the Croque Madame and the Veal Heart Philly.  The Madame was the winner of our sandwiches, with the joe coming in second.  The philly was terrible, or just bland, or that taste profile can safely be removed from the menu; in no way did this one work.  All sandwiches come with the housemade chips, and both the normal and spicy versions were very good.

The interesting thing about the sammies--they are priced reasonably well (the sloppy joes were $7; normal prices range from $9-$14), but they are a little small.  As in:  two of us at the table were considering ordering a second sandwich each.  When I go out to dinner, I&#39;m expecting to get enough to leave at least full, especially in Chicago, where the portion sizes sometimes drift into the &#34;this is enough for two people&#34; category!

Prior to dinner, we tried two apps--the cheese curds and the Vanguard Potato Balls.  The balls, which tasted like twice-baked potatoes with better fixins, were good, but I&#39;m not sure I would Kool Aid Man a wall to get at them again; the curds were ordinary but the sauce they were served with was a winner.

Drinks are priced very fairly ($9); my wife and I got the Old Fashioned and the Manhattan, and we liked both.  Based on the food, we both agreed that this place might be better served for us as a place to grab drinks first before eating elsewhere, similar to our feelings regarding Analogue.

The worst offender of the night?  The Rootbeer Malt &#34;boozy float&#34;, which was incredibly boozy and not very good.  The alcohol totally overpowered whatever non-alcoholic ingredients were in the glass, and for the price, I was better off just taking shots at the bar.  Not a win.  25 Degrees still owns this category in Chicago, in my opinion.

Also--do NOT come to this place if you were going to settle in for a long night with a first date.  The food comes out lickety-split, as in just minutes after we ordered the sandwiches, they were on the table.  Same for the apps.  Weirdest thing of the night was that it took 15 minutes for the staff to make the boozy float; I&#39;m guessing someone in the back just forgot to make it.

I will come back for drinks here, or to order the Madame with the spicy chips.  The sandwich size is perfect for lunch but less so for dinner."

Worth the search though for a nice selection of sandwiches that run the range -- reubens, short rib, steak, fried clams, etc -- w/ a casual gastropub vibe at night. Saw a lot of people on dates the night we came in. 

All sandwiches come w/ your choice of salad or house made chips, including salt and vinegar. All great. Reasonably priced higher quality meal.

This place is a vast improvement over the Brown Sack, which had previously been in this location. The roast beef sandwich is amazing, the fish sandwich is huge and perfect, and the beet salad is enormous and great. They also allow well-behaved dogs on their patio. 

Only real downsides are that the service can be slow because there&#39;s usually only one waitress working (Nora? She&#39;s funny, kind, and efficient) and they run out of their staple dishes quite a bit, but I&#39;ve never been disappointed by their food.

5 stars for their interior and cleanliness. I would love to come back here for some drinks and check out their patio in the summer. 
3 stars for their food. The pictures look so fresh and awesome, but sadly my plate looked the opposite. Maybe it was because we came on a day when they were closing early and we came 30 mins before the kitchen closed, but overall their food looked thrown together in a rush. I got the fried egg BLT. It had maybe three tiny pieces of salad lettuce that looked more like shreds, tiny bacon pieces and a tomato slice. Their hot sauce was killer, but way too much on the sandwich it was overpowering. I&#39;m pretty bummed because this place looked so good. Maybe they were in a rush to leave? I will give it a shot for drinks and appetizers again.
1 star for espresso. Way too acidic and bitter, awful taste."

It&#39;s well worth the hike off the beaten bath for the fantastic sandwiches. I did my research before going, and it appears that this place is backed by chef de cuisine Shay Linkus (Vanguard, Odd Duck) and executive chef Forster Sorensen (Au Cheval, Green Street Smoked Meats). Sandwiches range between $7-13 and come with chips or salad. They have great beers on tap, and a cozy Wisconsin cabin vibe. I recommended the Reuben sandwich! I also had a special, which I can&#39;t recall the name. It was their take on a turkey meatball grinder with kale. Also, cheese curds are life..."

So when the news came that the location was being re-opened with a similar concept, I was elated.  Living right across the street, I noticed people coming in/out before their official opening date, so I decided to drop in.

Wyler Road takes all of the good things the Brown Sack was and improves upon them.  Really extensive variety of sandwiches, there is something there for everyone.  They also have a great selection of draft beer and an impressive cocktail menu.

I found the size of the sandwiches to be perfectly proportionate for the price.  Every sandwich comes with house made chips or a simple mixed greens salad.  My first time there, I had the mushroom etoufee melt.  I wasn&#39;t expecting the sandwich to be so rich, but it reminded me of a vegetarian roast beef sandwich.  I&#39;ve also tried the rib eye sandwich, which is topped with homemade onion rings and au jus.

I will likely change my review to five stars in the future, but there are a few minor things I&#39;d like to see worked out.  First and foremost, there is a ventilation problem with their kitchen setup which caused smoke to dissipate throughout the restaurant both times I went.  They kept the front door open to air the smoke out, which resulted in a decent amount of flies getting into the space.  There were also a few hiccups in the service, but that&#39;s inevitable with a new space and staff.  I look forward to seeing Wyler Road flourish and welcome them to the neighborhood."

On our first visit to Wyler Road, we were underwhelmed. Opening jitters, and all that. But I must honestly say that they&#39;ve improved greatly.

Our second visit to Wyler Road (post &#39;reboot&#39;) was exceptional. The organization of the restaurant and staff have improved greatly. Service was exceptional. Elisa, our waitress, was easily one of the most attentive restaurant professionals we&#39;ve had the pleasure of meeting in quite some time. They&#39;ve also developed more of a &#39;team&#39; mentality where it seems as if everybody is helping each other out to serve, clear tables, etc. Whomever reorganized the front-of-house staff deserves major kudos for getting everybody on the same page and acting like a well-oiled machine.

The cuisine has also improved since our first visit. The kitchen staff seems to have worked out their kinks well. Food came out quickly. We shared a bowl of the soup, cheese curds, and the &#39;Croque Madame&#39; sandwich which were all well executed, presented, and priced.

One of the great things about Wyler Road is their selection of &#39;draft cocktails.&#39; This is to be expected given their ownership, but I&#39;ve found at other restaurants that these can be hit-or-miss. Here though all of the selections hit the spot. We finished with their signature &#39;boozy floats&#39;. If you still have room, these are a nice desert option.

Wyler Road&#39;s chef, Forster Sorensen, came out to greet us. He is a credit to the profession. Humble, seeking constant improvement, and visionary: we believe that Forster is well on the way to making this a true destination experience with a casual, after-work, let-loose kinda vibe. 

Ever so close to a 5 star. Homemade chips that came with the excellent sandwich could have used a bit more time to make them crispier (still, they are very good). The dessert selection could use some work. And the opportunity to get even more &#39;Wisconsiny&#39; is most definitely there with perhaps some seasonal specials and smuggled New Glarus brewery selections for in-the-know regulars (hint, hint). These would tip the scale for me. Let&#39;s just call it 4 and 1/2. We are looking forward to going back, but you should go for the 1st time. You won&#39;t be disappointed."

Service was decent but not great, as was the beer list; I&#39;d like to try their cocktails, which looked terrific, so I&#39;ll hold out another star if those turn out to be good.  The food was very tasty -- I had a Reuben that was one of the best I&#39;ve had in a long time -- but the menu is a bit limited at present.

Thanks to all the great reviews we went with the potato balls and cheese curds which were excellent and travelled really well, although it may be because we&#39;re in Logan Square.  The only somewhat flop for us was the short rib sandwich,  I was hoping for a juicier sandwich but it came on a large French baguette and the meat to bread ratio was not great leaving every bite with too much bread.  The short rib was flavorful bit a little on the dry side and the Bleu cheese was very minimal. I was hoping for more of a sauce but instead had crumbles.  The house made chips were tasty and all the side sauces that came with the apps were excellent!

It was a beautiful fall day and I was ready to sandwich.

The atmosphere is pleasant, it puts you at ease right from the start. With seating both indoors and outdoors, I opted to belly up to the bar inside so I could watch the sandwiches being created in the open kitchen.

The service was attentive but relaxed. You are at liberty to graze through a sandwich at your leisure.

With 21 sandwiches on the menu, divided between cold and hot, it took some time to make a decision. While I was mulling over the sandwich list, I ordered cheese curds, which arrive with fried basil and some of the best homemade ranch dressing to have ever met my lips.

Cold sandwiches include a chicken salad with fried chicken skin, chimichuri, and sour grape jam on wheat, a turkey with aioli and spinach and a spicy tofu with grilled avocado, pea shoots and hot sauce. The hot sandwiches include Wyler&#39;s version of a Philly cheesesteak with veal heart, a rib eye with onion rings, chimichurri, au jus on cocktail rye, and a reuben with buttered pickles in place of sauerkraut. The sandwiches range from $7 - $14 and come with a side of homemade chips or a side salad.

There are several beers on tap to choose from, along with cocktails like old-fashioneds and wine.

Wyler Road is very chill and relaxing. It&#39;s a place to come, sit, enjoy a drink and sandwich. And the sandwiches are good. I tried the reuben, one of my top 3 favorite sandwiches and despite the bread being buttered just a bit too much, I loved it.

Booya. *not five stars because it shouldn&#39;t be, it&#39;s casual cool, hipster chic, and the second you 5 star that shit you&#39;re going to ruin it. But between you and me, it&#39;s 5 star all the way. Consider this your wink homie."

The sandwhich concept i like, still a lot of kinks to be worked out.  I feel like there could have been way, way, way, way more meat on the sandwhiches.  Everything sounds so much more upscale than you really get.  You almost have to look two to make sure its what you ordered.

Currently closed for repairs, hope they open back up soon!

I like the decor, the drinks were good, the house chips were nice and the staff was friendly.   
Come on guys just get those sandwhiches nailed and we have a winner.   It was also cool meeting all my neighbors for the first time.  

On last thing, please install bike racks!!"

The cocktails are good, but the concept of a &#34;draft&#34; cocktail is lost on me. In this case it might be the difference between &#34;good&#34; and &#34;great.&#34; Maybe I&#39;m being persnickety, but I think the drinks lacked a certain freshness and somehow watching someone dump a 9 dollar cocktail out of a spigot (opposed to a carefully handcrafted cocktail) leaves something to be desired.

For an appetizer we got the potato balls which were sinfully good and should probably be illegal. For our main course, we ordered the Smoked Salmon and the Italian with Salt and Vinegar chips. The sandwiches were delicious, fresh, and awesome portion for price. Everything came out fresh and fast.

The bartenders were super courteous, attentive, and made great recommendations. The space is clean, open, but still cozy and inviting. We went on a Sunday around nine p.m., so it was relaxing and not at all crowded. 

I realize the vibe is &#34;Sandwich Joint,&#34; but for a place with a full service bar, I think Wyler Road would benefit from adding some fresher/healthier alternatives and expanding the appetizer menu. The appetizers, by the way, are listed as &#34;sides&#34; which was kind of confusing. 

Overall, the place is doing what it&#39;s doing really well, but there&#39;s nothing super extraordinary about it. I don&#39;t really mean that negatively, because the next time I&#39;m looking for a relaxed lunch spot to have a sandwich and a beer, I&#39;m totally there."

Considering I didn&#39;t care much for the brown &#34;hack&#34;. The atmosphere does look nice but I ordered for pickup. My sandwich was bland, favorless and dry. Really was looking forward to homemade chips. The spicy chips are in no way spicy but instead extremely and overly seasoned, really nasty having to tried them. I actually went to the frig to grab some mayo because I needed some flavor and I wasn&#39;t about to throw food away that cost me $10. Will I go back, maybe for drinks but then again the spicy chips pissed me off so much I&#39;ll probably avoid this joint for good."

I wasn&#39;t thrilled with my sandwich. It lacked something, but I&#39;m not sure what. It tasted okay, but just needed something. It was kind of bland and tasteless.

My wife shared a bite of her sandwich with me and it was nasty. When I think of etouffee, I think of spicy or cajun. This was more like a hoagie bread that had some mushroom, onions and gravy with melted cheese. Nothing etouffee or cajun about it. There were some tomatoes inside, but I swear they tasted canned. 

The watermelon drink was delicious, cold and strong. I could have drank a few of them for sure.

I think I will give this place a month or so to work out their kinks and dial in the menu."

I&#39;m also pretty sure the waitress brought me the wrong beer - ordered a cherry wheat and most definitely got the sour ale on special (which was delicious but very different from my order so I didn&#39;t complain).  Also, it&#39;s one of those places that you will leave and have to wash your clothes immediately due to grease.  But my salmon sandwich with side salad was light and tasty and the cheese curds crispy and shareable.  Overall, would go back another time and hope it could be a 4 or 5 star experience."

Great bartender, great food.All around I loved it. The last two times however were horrible. Second time , I sat at the bar., this was during the week for lunch. There was one other person at the bar. The bartender was on her phone and really too bothered to even come give me a water. After about 6 minutes she finally came over. I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich because there was a great picture of it on Yelp. When it came out , there was barely one thin layer of salmon. ( The picture had about 3) When I asked about it she shrugged her shoulders and ignored me. When I pressed this issue she went in the back. Her response was&#34; the chef says salmon is really expensive right now&#34; Really? This was a $11 sandwich!. After complaining again the manager finally came over. He was really rude, didnt say he was sorry, didnt ask me if I wanted to try something else. Just said give him his money back and walked away!
After being coaxed by a friend to try it again, I went back. Ordered the short rib sandwich and an Oberon beer. the $7 Oberon came out in a glass that i&#39;m sure wasn&#39;t even 12 ounces. I&#39;m guessing 8. Whatever. Then the sandwich came out. Half the $13 sandwich was fat. It was dry and fatty and disgusting. I had to dissect it and take the piles of fat out. Our waitress was very nice, but I will never go back and waste my money again.There are too many better places to go!"

I will tell you that they do have a &#39;shot special&#39; but only if you&#39;re part of the staff.

Now its over priced sandwiches. I went to Wyler Road for the first time last night. First off its like walking into an Ikea catalog. SOOO HIP. The music was loud and the lights were super bright. We were led to out table pretty quickly which is always a good thing. We were given WAY more than enough time to look over the menu. To be honest there were a lot of things that sounded amazing. My friends and i had a hard time deciding what to get. We chose to start with the cheese curds which were honestly pretty good. they were by far the best part of our meal. 
 We ordered the Clam belly sandwich which honestly tasted like rancid fish. Nothing worse than balls of deep fried rubber that taste like old tuna salad. Huge disappointment. My friend was to shy to say they didn&#39;t like it so they got a box to go and even tried to leave it on the table. lol. it was so disgusting that we didn&#39;t even want to take it home. The rib eye was also a huge mess. The flavorless, doughy onion rings did nothing to help the gristle aka rib eye. I just can&#39;t imagine thinking its acceptable to charge those prices for that quality of food. 
 I will admit they can make a decent drink. A little too sweet for my taste but i suppose it could have been worse. 
 Tip: Avoid the spicy chips.Someone either has a heavy hand or you need to evaluate your premixed spice selection. There is no  way anyone likes those things they way they are. Greasy  potatoes covered in old bay? barf."

I was excited about this place as it&#39;s right by my house and looked like a good place to sit and do some work and drink a beer. It needs a lot of work, however, to be anything worth visiting again.

We stopped in on Sunday for a sandwich and a beer. I ordered the cheese curds as I&#39;d heard they were really good--but they were out. Instead I got a grilled cheese: beer cheese, caramelized onion, and tomato. It sounded great, but the result was kind of disgusting. OK, really disgusting. It was like two pieces of warm, wet bread covered with Cheez Whiz that had been mixed with onions, with slices of cold tomato. The bread was warm and the filling was icy cold and watery. I think what they did was heat the bread and then pack it full of some sort of pre-mixed onion and cheese batter, then slap cold tomato on it...I don&#39;t think they actually heat the whole thing together (which is kind of what a grilled cheese IS, but okay) and it was pretty nasty. The bread was so soggy that it fell apart in the middle when I picked up half of the sandwich...a whole chunk of it just kind of slipped out of the middle of the slice and slapped the plate before I could take a bite. The bite I did take, from the frozen center of the sandwich that made a Hot Pocket look like fine dining, was so unsatisfying I gave up entirely and just ate the salad it came with.

Two stars because he ordered a Reuben and it was really good. Pretty good beer list, and nice atmosphere. However, it seemed a bit smoky in there, and about an hour after we left I realized that we both smelled really strongly of fryer, like we&#39;d just worked a shift a McDonald&#39;s. So yeah, hanging out with my computer doing work is out, because I don&#39;t want to have to shower again after I leave. Two stars because I think if you can find a spot on the patio in the fresh air, and only order a salad and a beer, you&#39;ll probably be ok. I&#39;m going to wait a while for them to get the food and the exhaust fans worked out, and I&#39;ll try again, because it would really be too bad to have lost the Brown Sack and for its replacement to be just a big slice of wet bread."

The sandwich porn they posted with the review really wowed me, so I immediately posted a link to the facebook profile of my friend Katt, and she was all about it. Later at night I showed it to my pal Nicholas, and he was all about it as well. So, I wrangled the group together, and we made plans to visit on Saturday afternoon.

On Saturday, we left Katt&#39;s house at about 2pm, picked Nicholas up from his block, and made the trip from Bridgeport up to Logan Square. We ended up parking over in front of my ex-girlfriend&#39;s ex-apartment, and walked over to the restaurant. Upon entering, we saw many tables, a large bar, and a few people of varying ages were eating. We were offered a table, but then Nicholas had the idea to sit at the bar. So, we all went to the bar, sat down, and were handed menus. All three of us immediately began going over the drinks, and made our first round selections. Katt ordered an Old Fashioned, I ordered a Bourbon Mule, and Nicholas ordered a Manhattan. When the drinks arrived, we all had a sip, passed them around each other, shared our opinions, and quickly began drinking our own drinks. All three drinks were both tasty, with an adequate amount of alcohol for our south side bodies. 

Following that, we ordered our sandwiches. I ordered the Rib Eye sandwich, Katt ordered the BLT (off menu), and Nicholas ordered the short rib sandwich. Each of us were given the option of salad or chips. Nicholas and I went with salt &amp; pepper chips, Katt went with the spicy chips. We also ordered a set of cheese curds.

The cheese curds were the first to come out. I have never been fond of the term &#34;chese curd&#34;, but Katt convinced me to try them. I tried one, and was pleasantly surprised by how tasty it was. Following that, I ate many more, as did Nicholas and Katt. The real highlight of the cheese curds was the dipping sauce they make. I believe it was home made ranch. I&#39;ve been turned off by home made ranch in the past, mainly the homemade ranch of Skylark, as it&#39;s way too watery. The ranch of Wyler Road however was pretty much fuckin&#39; perfect.

A little while later, the sandwiches came out. My rib eye sandwich had a big ass stack of onion rings topping the meat, a standard hamburger-style bun, and an inch or two of rib meat at the bottom. I had to pick off some of the onion rings, because the sandwich was a little too tall to fit into my mouth. I left a few onion rings on there to get the full effect of the sandwich. Looking to my right, Katt&#39;s sandwich looked fuckin&#39; incredible. It had an egg on top of the sandwich, followed by this amazing mess of meat, cheese, and seasonings. Katt passed me her sandwich and I took a bite, then I passed it to Nicholas and he took a bite, and then I passed the sandwich back to Katt. Nicholas then passed me his sandwich, and I took a bite of that, and then Katt had a bite of his sandwich. I then started eating my sandwich before realizing that I hadn&#39;t offered any sandwich to either of them. So, I passed the sandwich over to Katt who took a bite, and Nicholas took a bite of my sandwich as well. 

All three sandwiches were fuckin&#39; amazing. I would have to say that Katt&#39;s blt was the best of them all, but that&#39;s kind of like ranking angels. We all plowed through all of our sandwiches &amp; drinks, and were then ready for more booze. 

I ended up ordering a boozeed up rootbeer float, Katt ordered this double rum drink, and Nicholas ordered a can of his favorite beer - Coors. I got my drink, and I was a little surprised by how big &amp; extravagant it was. This time around, we didn&#39;t share our drinks. I don&#39;t know why, we just didn&#39;t. I also had decided that I couldn&#39;t just eat one sandwich while I was here. So, I ordered a grilled cheese.

The grilled cheese was amazing looking. It had 3 pieces of toast, with the top layer being both bacon &amp; I think cheddar, and the bottom layer being muenster. Thankfully, they had cut it in half, as I was already starting to feel a little full. However, because I am an addict I decided to try powering through it. The sandwich was amazingly good. While it was difficult to get it into my body, the taste was just too good to pass up. I managed to get about 90% of it into my body before I had to stop. I was just too full. 

Katt and Nicholas had returned during my attempt at eating the grilled cheese sandwich. Katt finished her drink, and had ordered a coors herself. Nicholas was still finishing his. I wanted to order a coors so I could drink more, but we had already closed out our bill. For the three of us eating a total of 4 sandwiches, 1 appetizer, 4 cocktails, and 2 beers, the total came out to about $100. Reading wyler road&#39;s facebook page, it seems that they have regular drink specials.

The bartender pushed the food, I said all I wanted was drinks, and she got on the phone and text someone and the rest of the staff just talked to their friends.

I substitute ham for the chorizo. They&#39;re very flexible and everything is made to order. Very fresh, and fairly cheap. Lots of sun on this corner makes this an excellent place to sit and relax.

I was looking for a place near me to have breakfast. After asking Suri, this place popped up. I used the link provided to look at the yelp reviews and I was sold. 

It was close, had parking, and got great reviews. They did not disappoint. A slogan seen on the building says &#34;good food fast&#34; and they were right. You look at the menu overhead and order. Once your order comes up you are called to the counter to get your tray and go sit down. I sat at the counter overlooking canal port and 18th  street. 

This place is true chicago neighborhood food at its best. Good, homemade and no fuss. They also have a healthy choice menu with stuff like grilled chicken that looked great. I was also very taken by their veggie juice menu. I had a beet, apple and orange juice drink which was fresh and bended on the spot. Fantastic. Sure, I could get a juicer and do this at home, but why should I when I can get it here ?

I had pancakes, hash browns and bacon. Yummy. The folks inside are a fantastic mix of race and ethnicity all enjoying great food on this place that is easy to find and great."

Polite, on-the-ball service.  Napkins and condiments readily available. The double cheeseburger was fresh, on a sesame bun, and they use red onion, which I always think is a nice touch.

So glad we did.

They have healthy food options for meat-eaters and pescatarians alike.  They have great salad options as well for vegetarians as well.

However, on this particular day, I didn&#39;t want just a salad or a &#34;green sandwich.&#34;  I wanted something a little more substantial but healthy too.  Being a vegetarian (technically a pescatarian), I was happy to find they had a grilled fish sandwich for $5.80.   It didn&#39;t come with fries, but that was fine with me.

When I got it, it was amazing; the tilapia was warm and fresh and the cheese was great and the bread was delicious.  It was stuffed with tomato, red onions and romaine lettuce.  My boyfriend had the double burger and a Chicago dog (which came with fries).  We also got a canned soda to share.  Everything came out to be about $16.95 (tax included).

Typically you will see a few beat cops taking a break here, as well as construction workers and local residents.  Their burgers are pretty good for fast food, although I usually think they put too much mustard on them.  Almost everything on their menu is under $5, which makes pretty much anything you might order a good value.  

Where Ken-Tone&#39;s really stands out, though, is in the fresh juice department.  For $3 you can get a ~24 oz(huge!)  glass of fresh squeezed juice, AND you get to choose your juice combination!  Choose from apple, orange, carrot, beet, celery, lemon, or any combination thereof.  When I think of all the tiny glasses of juice I have gotten at other diners for $3.25 or higher, I feel my love of Ken-Tone&#39;s grow just a little bit larger.

I also had the Singapore noodles which were really well made, both portions were large but I could eat that lamb for the rest of forever. They also have free dessert which you should ask for, I asked for the dessert menu, they said they had none but we&#39;re serving &#39;pudding&#39; and I asked the cost and they said free. The pudding was more like a sweet soup made of kidney beans and tapioca and is served hot. I ate the whole thing it was super delicious. 

Also the service was really quick given that the restaurant was almost totally full. Huge tables too, you could come with a party of 8-10 people"

It is more like a hole in wall, but the food is great, and very cheap. You can get a family style for 2 or 3 people for about $30 with desserts - cannot beat that!

I will highly recommend this place for the seafood, it is fresh, and price reasonably. They have lobster for $26! 

Absolutely my &#34;go to&#34; place when I craved Chinese!"

I have been here a few times and the one thing I usually notice with Chinatown restaurants is it can be hit or miss. This is my third time here and the first two were pretty decent, so I figured I would be in for a bit of a disappointment.

It&#39;s a pretty small dining area, but they do try to squeeze in as many tables as they can so be prepared to wiggle around especially when it is packed.

We ordered our usual fare of dishes from seafood (clams, oysters, and lobster), meat dishes(chicken and beef), and a variety of vegetables.

Our first dish that came out was the clams and it seemed like they made 2 of those dishes at once and split them for us and another table and it looked like the other table was the winner in that one.  Other than that the food came out quick the rice was alright but not as good as some other resturants.  The bill came out at a pretty reasonable price as well. The 3.5 stars really was for dishes being smaller than I had remembered and the long wait we had even though we had reservations.

I would come back though for some decent fare."

The only problem I had was that when we called to reserve for 14 guest they try to squeeze all of us in one round table. They eventually gave us an extra table which was odd bc it was square table with a round table. SIGH, this is how it is in Chinatown. Customer service is weird.

Anyhow, we ordered the Dinner set for family of ten included 2 lobsters, whole crispy chicken and I love the Pi Pa Tofu. It also included a whole sole fish, and we also added dishes to the meal. We had beef chow fun noodles, beef and Chinese broccoli and we also ate chicken with bitter melon so much food! Their crispy chicken was excellent very juicy beautifully done. We had three rice casserole dishes and it was really delicious. I wish they had more room for bigger 14 people. I would probably return with less people."

My favorites were the noodle dish, the lobster and the steak. Everyone raves about the rice casserole, but I found it incredibly bland and the sausage mediocre (as a rule of thumb, if you want some decent sausage, you go to a Polish deli). The seafood stuffed tofu was ok. 

The service: 4/5. The service was fairly quick and we ended up at $90 for 5 people, which is hard to beat.

After several days touring the south part of the country we returned to Chicago and as usual were ravenous so we stopped by in Chinatown to grab a bite to eat before going home.  Golden Bull is a small restaurant that I feel produces very good quality food.  When we got here the restaurant was packed. 

We were lucky to be seated without having to wait.  After sitting we ordered 3 half size dishes so we could have some variety.  We were also given a bowl of rice to go with the dishes ordered.  This proved to be more then enough food.  They gave us a beef stock soup for free that was ok, but lacked any real flavor.  After a very short wait our waitress started bringing out our dishes.

The first dish we ordered was a fried salt &amp; spicy smelt w/jalapeños, as usual it was very good.  The second dish we ordered was a fish filet with garlic, ginger and Chinese broccoli.  This dish was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Each bite was savored as the flavor melted in your mouth.  The third dish was a half size dish of shrimp egg foo young.  The flavor was pretty good, but dish was just ok as it was too salty and the egg foo young sauce was gooey with too much corn starch.  

After dinner they give a complimentary dessert of sweetened hot red bean &amp; tapioca.  This may not be to the liking of some people, but I enjoyed it.

In the past their food is very good prepared seasoned and cooked to perfection.  I have eaten here before and their food is becoming one of my favorites in Chinatown, unfortunately the egg foo young&#39;s saltiness and gooey sauce knocked them down a star rating tonight."

Maybe it&#39;s the unassuming location on Cernak as most of the places I go to are on Wentworth?  Well whatever the reason, the Golden Bull is now on my radar screen, and it&#39;s BYOB so be sure to grab a bottle of wine before you head out.  You may also want to call ahead and make a reservation as this place is always packed!

The space is smallish and no frills and on most of my visits, it is full of older Chinese people so I have to assume it must be authentic Chinese.  If you are looking for ambiance, you are not going to find it here as there is harsh lighting, and functional seating areas.  But you come for the food and not the ambiance!

On my recent visit, I went with a friend of mine who is Chinese so  I let her do all the ordering.  We had many, many courses ranging from soup to appetizers to their signature chicken and lobster dishes.   My favorites were the hot and spicy chicken and the beef rib tips.  All were plentiful and the pricing VERY reasonable.  I think our entire meal was under $25 a person!

And know if you want, what I will affectionately call &#34;American Chinese&#34; with egg rolls and friend rice, while they will make them for you, they don&#39;t seemingly come out like they do at other Chinese restaurants.

Go for the food not the ambiance and you will be happy."

Everything came at random times, some people were done eating before some of the others&#39; food even arrived. The server misheard one of our orders and brought the wrong item, then tried telling us what it was we ordered (which was wrong) - very unapologetic, and not concerned that he made a mistake, nor did he try to fix it. What we did get was good (not great), and we tried seven different dishes. Some were incredibly bland and below-average (pigeon, fish), while others were quite outstanding (vegetables, fried rice).

They have salt n pepper baby octopus that I have pregnant lady cravings for at least once a week (I have never been pregnant but I imagine it&#39;s the same feeling). I get it with the cilantro/jalapeño/soy oil that they give with other seafood dishes. The soy sauce here is especially good because they make it themselves. It&#39;s not too salty and has a bit of sweetness to it. 

Long ago they had a late night menu where dishes could be ordered in a smaller size for a special price. This was before the renovations and new decor. However they now offer small and large sizes for most dishes and I prefer it this way because then I am not relegated to coming here only after 10pm lol. 

I have liked everything I ate here. The only reason for one less star is that when they are very busy and packed I feel the quality of the food goes down a bit. For example, the last time I went was during a dinner rush and my fried rice had hard chunks in it (bottom of the pot rice I&#39;m assuming). If they could be consistently great I would give 5 stars!"

The Golden Bull Restaurant is a tiny, reasonably decorated place. The menu is quite expansive and does have a little but of everything. An appealing factor is that they have set menus for x-number of people, which is more than enough to share. A few qualms I have about the place is that there is only street/meter parking out. You can find additional parking in the lot by where the train tracks are. You have to ask for ice water. It&#39;s assumed you will have hot tea with your meal. Service of preparing the food is also slow, even though I know it is fresh and made to order, I would like some speediness to my food. If you are a traditionalist and are looking for the stone pot sticky rice, place that order as soon as you walk in because it takes 40 minutes to prep/cook this dish of deliciousness. If you want the hand shredded chicken, also place that order in the minute you walk in because they literally hand shred half a chicken for that dish and it will take 30 minutes to prep and season the dish. We had ordered the dinner for 3, which came with 3 beef &amp; barley soups to start, we decided with the beef with Chinese broccoli, stir fry lobster, and instead of the sweet and sour pork, we went with the spiced salt and pepper pork. 

Beef &amp; barley soup: clear beef broth, barley beans, carrots, and little chunks of beef. It wasn&#39;t overly salty, but had a delicate flavor to it.

Beef with Chinese broccoli: Beef is pretty standard, wasn&#39;t overly impress with the quality of the meat or the flavoring of it. Did enjoy the heaping helping of leafy Chinese broccoli, and stem. We did pick out all of the veggies in this dish. 

Stir fry lobster: This was my favorite dish. The lobster was sweet, juicy, and tender.  A bit on the small side, but a solid piece of shellfish. The sauce that the lobster was cooked in was decadent in flavor. It was rich and creamy due to the fact that I think cornstarch was added as a thickener. The sauce had egg and pork in it. So if you&#39;re a non-pork eater, I would check with the server if they can make it without it, otherwise, it is just delicious and a must order. Just keep in mind that you have to work for your meal here.

Spiced salt &amp; pepper pork: I love this dish. It&#39;s battered with lightly and seasoned very well. It is &#34;deep fried&#34; in the wok, and the meat is tender and juicy. They garnish this this with some sauteed jalapenos. 

Hand shredded chicken: We got this dish last. Like after we killed our first 3 dishes, this one came out last. We were already full. I&#39;m not sure if it was because I was full I would this dish to be overly salty in some parts, and under seasoned in other parts. But I think I will have to give this dish another chance the next time I visit.

Taro &amp; tapioca dessert soup: Kind of bland and flavorless goop. I&#39;ve had this at other establishments and it was amazing. Here, not so much. Maybe it was an off day.

Overall experience, food, service, cleanliness, etc is a 3 star. I wasn&#39;t WOW&#39;d the food was good, but just took way too long."

I read the top rated reviews and Golden Bull stood out for a few reasons: the traditional complementary hot tea and pork broth soup, the old style Chinatown exterior but modern interior, and of course, the food ratings.

My wife and I are not &#34;foodies&#34; but we certainly appreciate variety and uniqueness. Definitely were not going to go to Chinatown and have Beef and Broccoli or Kung Pao Chicken...and wanted the kids to have an eating experience.

Ordered five dishes and amazingly, one came out first (salt and pepper soft-shell crab) and then the other four came out.

The crab was the best I&#39;ve ever had...crunchy and spicy. Even my wife who does not eat seafood tried it and said it was good. The kids of course loved it but might have been a bit hot for them with the jalapeno garnish.

Then the Mandarin Pork Chops, French Steaks, Boneless Chicken with Black Mushroom casserole, and Farmer&#39;s Chicken arrived.

The Farmer&#39;s Chicken is a cold dish....the meat of the chicken is shredded and left on top of the carcass. The seasoning was incredible...we noted vinegar and cilantro in the mix. My favorite.

Mandarin Pork Chops were meaty in a sweet sour sauce. A bit tricky to pick up with chopsticks so you better be pretty good with them!

French Steaks were cubes of steak with a honey sauce. My wife&#39;s favorite.

The Chicken casserole was served in a pot with a medley of Chinese vegetables and was the kids&#39; favorite.

There were so many other dishes I would have liked to try but just can&#39;t eat that much food!

I&#39;d consider food for four and leftovers for $60 plus tip to be a bargain!

We did find some free on street parking in the traditional area of the neighborhood and walked two blocks.

About the only negative I can think of is no dessert menu...but we walked the area and found some bakeries that were open late afternoon and picked up a few treats."

After nearly a minute of waiting, i got up to leave when the hostess/waitress finally emerged from the kitchen and noticed me.

I ordered the crab rangoon and chicken chow mein. The rangoons were just ok - the wontons were very oily and the filling had virtually no crab flavor. They then brought me the wrong entree. After waiting for them to make me anther meal, i finally got the worst chow mein I&#39;ve ever had. It was awful. The noodles were stringy and crunchy and there was hardly any chicken to be found in the massive pile of uncooked noodles. The sauce lacked any distinct flavors other than salt.

I have to say they are one of the more consistent restaurants in chinatown."

Started off with hot and sour soup was not very good. To much cornstarch.But everything else was amazing .  
Had clams with black bean sauce cooked to perfection Had paper thin slices of Jalapeños.
King straw mushroom with Japanese tofu
Pea pod shoots were ok a little fibrous.
Shrimp pan fried with out the shell was really great. 
Definitely will be back.Now i&#39;ll have to get the kids to convert to G.B. a little smaller portions then LWW but sooooo much better. 
We sat next to a lovely  young Chinese family. Parents were  celebrating their 15 th anniversary and this guy was a  wealth of information when it came to all the local spots and then some."

People are really nice and work to make sure I was aware of what was being ordered and not letting the language barrier get in the way.

Our group of 5 got to choose our seats as we pulled together 2 tables to sit together. We got set up with some tea, but did have to ask for water. We also got recommended the farmers chicken dish, which we substituted for the tofu dish in the 6 dish special on the menu. This came with the ginger fried lobster, salt and pepper shrimp, shrimp and scallops stir-fry, whole steamed fish, and sweet and sour pork. Everything was pretty tasty. I think I could have done without the sweet and sour pork, but I really enjoyed the salt and pepper shrimp. All the meat and seafood items were cooked to the right temperature where it wasn&#39;t under or overcooked. The food was very flavorful without being overpowering or more on the salty side.

We had Oysters and normal charge from any restaurant would be $3.50 each and theirs is $4. Also Lee Wing Wah is running a special for $2.75. When I informed them, they did not care. The dishes looked good but the Salt and Pepper Rib was dry and nothing but bones. We had two dishes of Twin Lobsters and one dish was fresh and the other was not. The Oysters were not big like they claimed to be. The bill came to a few dollars shy of $200. The owner offered to take 10% off if we paid cash. I hate that we restaurants do that because they just want to take the cash and not put it on the book and report their income. Will be not go there again for sure!

The egg drop soup was good. And that was about it.  I had the fried quail and she had the frog with yellow leeks, we both thought it was ok.

We also got the crab rangoon which was the most disgusting thing in the world,  not really sure how to describe it but it was super sweet, just horrid.

Cheap cantonese food check! This was almost a 4 star review but due to the poor management of kitchen orders they lost a star. We first tried to come to this restaurant without a reservation, big mistake. This place is booked up and small so if you walk up you will be turned away. We made reservations for the following week during the saturday before Mother&#39;s day. People love this restaurant because the prices are low and you get a lot of dishes for the pre-fixe menu. We ordered the 10 person meal which included 
Pork bone soup with veggies- not filled very well, soup was good and clear
Jalapeno fried shrimp- rather small dish, I guess that is why the prices are so low. Otherwise cooked well with the perfect zing
Cold plate appetizer- another one that is puny in size and had a assortment of low end cold cuts i.e. pig ears instead of having the more expensive items such as roast duck or bbq pork. There was the traditional jelly fish, 1000 spice beef, and additional cut of pork
Twin lobster- cooked perfectly, no complaints
Fried seafood/shrimp balls- not sure what was inside but it was tasty with the sweet and sour sauce
Chicken slices with broccoli- cooked well, the chicken was tender but marinated with corn starch
Veggies- chinese broccoli, fresh nothing wrong with this dish with oyster sauce over
Steamed flounder- I use to love this fish, but now i prefer meatier white fish. This was fresh, lots of roe in the fish though
Sweet and sour pork- cooked well, not overdone
Seafood medley- cheap with a few scattered scallops, veggies and etc. Goes well
Crispy chicken and shrimp chips- not sure how they cook this so well. This has been raved about by tourist from HK. I think this made up for some of the weaker dish.

All this for about 130 dollar. So the negatives, mainly the way our meal was served. Somehow no one understands the concept of bringing out the appetizer dish first and phasing the other dishes. Instead everything came at once. By the time I was eating the lobster it was cold and wasted. We told the serve to slow down the pace but the food just kept on coming. This is becoming more and more of a problem going out to eat in chinatown. How can you enjoy your meal when there is not even enough room on the table for the food. 2 thumbs down for your mismanagement. Otw some of the dishes had there own flaw, but for 130 dollars to feed 10 people you can&#39;t go wrong I guess.


Pro- lower cost, amazing chicken dish, lobster!

Con- terrible management of dinner orders, if you don&#39;t have reservation they will send you away

Hidden deal- Pre-fixe family dinner menu is the best bargain!"

The dishes we ordered were all kind of overcooked. In particular, the bok choy was almost mushy, though it had great flavor. The Hong Sue tofu included shiitake and overcooked napa, and was fairly bland. I did appreciate that they had small and large options for almost everything on the menu, and found that the small version of my tofu dish was just right.

My partner loved the beef tongue, but thought the portion was small for the price. I guess we just expected better for Chinatown."

First of all, this place IS CLEAN. Most places such as Triple Crown, Three Happiness, Lee Wing Wah,  and many more are dastardly dirty and such a discouragement to return to even though the food is delicious. Golden Bull however trumps them on food at even more affordable prices and are not skimping out at all on taste.

The staff is RESPECTFUL AND COURTEOUS. I cannot stress how grateful and true this statement is. Attending most Chinese restaurants in the Chinatown area, the waiting staff is not fluent in English and get heavily flustered and visibly annoyed when the patrons ask for requests (more napkins, x-amount of cups of ice water all around, forks and knives please, etc.) 

This place is attentive to everyones needs and graciously accommodates. 

FOOD:
- affordably priced!!!
-never lacking in flavor
- HUGE PORTIONS (enough to feed 3-4 ppl comfortably)
- AUTHENTIC

I was so impressed with the food. I was expecting to see either really Americanized &#34;Chinese&#34; food and food that was just slopped together, but presentation (which is rare in Chinese restaurants) and taste were definitely met. 

The chef accidentally misprepared one of our dishes and after bringing it up with management, they were sincerely apologetic and re-prepared the dish and also removed it from our bill! TALK ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE. They truly know how to take care of customers (especially since we were a party of 10 ordering over 10 dishes)


Overall, I will be going here again and await my next return."

- reasonable portions at even more reasonable prices.  I love leftovers as much as the next gal but sometimes the troughs of food they bring out at chinese restaurants (ahem, joy yees) can be overwhelming.
- after the reno, its a small but cozy and welcoming place.  Definitely feels like a place families can come to on a regular basis for a simple dinner out when they&#39;re too lazy to cook

I&#39;m a big fan of the fried soft shell crab, the tofu casserole (look out there&#39;s shrimp stuffed in there - yum!), and 4.95 for a bowl of beef noodle soup is a steal.

Had an order of egg rolls, which were fresh and fairly tasty.  The &#34;complimentary soup&#34; was a relatively tasteless broth with a pork bone and some undercooked beans- meh. Tried a variety of dishes (Beef Kow, Sweet &amp; Sour Pork and Combo Fried Rice) which were pretty unexciting, though very fresh tasting.  I would only grade it as passable.  Maybe we should have ordered some seafood items, as most of what was being served at the surrounding tables was crab, shrimp, oysters, and the like- and it all looked very good. Sometimes it just goes that way.  I may stop by again and try something more &#34;exciting&#34;.  The Americanized Chinese choices were only average."

It was crispy but it lacked the tang from the vinegar. I thought I was eating crispy candy. The pork was partly fat and I was pretty displeased by it. The lamb stew casserole that also included some parsley and beancurd lacked the lamb taste. I tasted the oyster sauce that it was made with more than the lamb flavor. The bowl of rice I had the texture of leftover because it was dried, which made it hard. I didn&#39;t finish the food. 

food: 2 they preserved the crispiness of the pork chops but it lacked the slightly sour flavor. Lamb had no lamb flavor.

Atmosphere: typical restaurant with booths and tables. Pretty quiet but was loud when there are toddlers around. The toddlers kept kicking the booth footing. 2

Service: 4 waitress was nice, wore white dress shirt and black vest. She had strong body odor.... 

Price: I honestly felt the food tasted pretty bad for what I was charged. The pork was a good 10 dollars while the lamb casserole was 12 dollars. Prices are average. 2

Decor: 2 average restaurant with some paintings/ photo hanging around. For the table setting, booths did not have a covering and there were obvious signs of use from the stains. Chairs seemed pretty old. I guess it can contribute to the family feel? I love booth seats but was dismayed the back rest wobbled excessively. 

I don&#39;t think I will come back again. I came here since my friend recommended the mandarin pork chop that I have craved for, but I am quite disappointed."

This restaurant is really small, so on a busy evening expect a wait.

We ordered a chicken and rice clay pot (30 minutes needed) and it was delicious, fragrant, and phenomenal... and only $9 (NYC Chinatown usually charges $15-20 for the same one we ordered). Their salt and pepper soft shell crab dish was delicious, but a bit too salty. Their chicken was also very good - though we asked for a half-chicken, what we got seemed like less than a half-chicken... And pea sprouts are my favorite veggie, which they sauteed with garlic to perfection.

Problems: not enough help. The timing of our dishes&#39; arrivals was a bit awkward... and I noticed that other tables who ordered packages (they have several, and all are a great value) got their food with more appropriate timing, and even before our table when we ordered before them."

Out of the three entrees and one soup we ordered, only the veggie entree came in ok. Everything else was not good. 

The hot and sour soup texture was like water and there was way too little ingredients in the soup/water - felt like you were just drinking water. The Chinese broccoli with chicken was butchered - over chopped and over cooked. The pork in Peking sauce is a cornerstone of Cantonese cuisine, yet Golden Bull&#39;s version totally massacred it - treated the dish like it was Sweet &amp; Sour Pork. DISGUSTING.

Needless to say, not going back. They were busy, but I really don&#39;t know why..."

The atmosphere leaves you without much to look at, but with food like this, you won&#39;t feel like you&#39;re missing anything. Our server was a middle-aged Chinese woman with a friendly and attentive attitude. While we experienced a bit of a language barrier, it didn&#39;t keep us from ordering what we wanted.

The meal started with amazing complementary tea! From there, we split a plate of veggie fried rice. We both agreed it was the best we remembered ever enjoying. Loaded with fresh veggies and fried and seasoned delicately, so as not to get crusty and salty. I ordered scallops with veggies -- definitely the best sea scallops I&#39;ve ever had for $6.99. Tender, plump, and so fresh tasting...melt in your mouth seafood here, people. The garlic sauce complemented the dish so well. I can almost still taste it 4 days later (yes, I have brushed). My fiancee ordered tofu with veggies. The tofu was prepared better than I&#39;ve seen at most places. Tender and creamy, with a crunchy exterior. Best of all, it was some of the freshest tasting tofu I&#39;ve ever had!

In terms of food quality, Golden Bull was outstanding. And this meal was $18 + tip! I will make a point to go back here the next time I am in the Chicago area, and in the meantime, I am recommending it to anyone and everyone I can. Keep up the good work, Golden Bull!"

You know how it is when you&#39;re hungry, but you wanna eat something GOOD, not just any old thing like bad tacos, pizza, or burgers?  Yeah, that&#39;s how I was after a trip to the casino.  

So, after, literally, racking our brains for a place to eat after at trip to the casino, my friend and I ended up at Golden Bull - thanks to Yelp reviews!  It was completely empty when we walked by, so we were a little hesitant about going in.  But, I knew Yelp wouldn&#39;t steer me wrong, so I busted in there, much to the dismay of my friend.  

We started off by ordering shrimp balls ($4.50 for four).  This was deep fried goodness.  The best tasting I&#39;ve had in a long time!  I&#39;m not sure what they put in their breading, but it was fantastic.  

The Kung Pao chicken ($5) was really delicious!  Generous portion of chicken, topped with green peppers, onions, peanuts, served over rice.  It was also just the right amount of spiciness.  Yum!  My friend ordered the spareribs in blackbean sauce ($5), which was also tasty and good!  Love the huge portions for the price!  

For shrimp balls, one cup of hot and sour soup, kung pao chicken and spareribs, the total bill was about $20 (with tip and tax, ya&#39;ll!).  This restaurant isn&#39;t all about the frills and over-the-top service, but the food and price are really the standouts.  You&#39;ll love it, I promise. 

Best decision ever coming in Golden Bull to satisfy our late night hunger!  Thanks Yelpers!"

I am Chinese and grew up in a family that essentially worships food, so I think my opinion (when it comes to Chinese food, at least) is reasonably legit. And here it is:

To echo the sentiments from fellow yelpers, if you are looking for ambiance or a place for a first date--this isn&#39;t it. Though, in all honesty, it  isn&#39;t that bad compared to some other places I&#39;ve seen in Chinatown. The furnishings are on the older end but I can easily overlook all of that with the quality of food they render. 

I&#39;ve been coming to this place with my family for as long as I can remember. We usually go straight for their family combo menu as it contains pretty staple dishes: salt and pepper shrimp, Peking ribs, a stir-fried seafood combo with yellow chives, oyster in black bean sauce, and their signature dish--the &#34;pei pa&#34; tofu&#34; (little piping hot golden pillows of awesomeness, i.e. tofu mixed with minced meat and scallions, seasoned and fried to perfection with a sweet and sour dipping sauce) and ordering the combos is cheaper than ordering each dish individually, so it is definitely worthwhile, in case you were wondering. During special occasions/celebrations, we throw in an order of salt and pepper crab or the Cantonese style fish as well, which are always fresh and well prepared.

Of the countless number of times I&#39;ve been here, I&#39;ve never really had a bad experience. There are some oddball dishes, which I do not see myself trying for a second time, but otherwise, no big complaints. You are seriously missing out if you have not yet set foot into Golden Bull.

That said, what are you doing still reading this review. Go! ...and don&#39;t walk, RUN!"

The service here is always really good and they always treat us nicely. The place is kinda small and it can get packed fairly quick, so I would definitely recommend making a reservation earlier in the day if you are going with a big group.

Been here forever and we&#39;ve never dropped in...just was never on the radar. 

Was a little nervous this morning when we dropped in for lunch on Saturday at about 12:30 p.m. and the place was empty (we almost thought it was closed). But we took the leap and had a great meal.

Place seems very freshly renovated with new furnishings, though one might say it still looks some what plain in a grey/black/white color scheme (some chairs are yellow though!).

So what did we get? We got a small portion of the surf clams with vermicelli and cilantro, the shredded farmer&#39;s chicken, chives with fish cake and dried tofu aiming off the top of their specials. All very good dishes (though I think we missed the tofu in the chives dish, but there was plenty of fish cake to compensate). They do provide flexibility in portion sizes (small, large, etc) - we went with the large for the chives dish and half chicken - so that gives you flexibility on budget and whether you want some leftovers for home (and a better deal). 

Thrown in, a house soup starter too, decent rice and tea. Experienced staff person handled everything at the front of the house though admittedly while we were there it was only two tables total (maybe this is more a dinner spot and everyone was somewhere hip - and less tasty - or having dim sum.)

I&#39;m assuming because we were there for lunch that dessert soup wasn&#39;t offered. Validated parking really tops it off. 

Two &#34;large&#34; size entrees plus surf clams for two = $30 and taking home half of each of our entrees to boot."

There was zero atmosphere, no music, and when we walked in, we couldn&#39;t tell if it was even open bc the waitresses were sitting in a booth with their heads down!
We ordered the dinner for 2 ($20) and it came with a bland pork Fried rice, decent egg rolls and decent won ton soup. It came with two entrees also; sweet and sour chicken and almond chicken. The highly reviewed sweet and sour chicken was all bread an no meat, not to mention the breading was deep fried and tasted like a doughnut. The almond chicken was stringy and slimy but the sauce was alright.

We tried 3 dishes between two of us.  We ordered the smaller, lunch sized portion and still had plenty of leftovers.  The best dish we had was the Bbq pork. The other 2 dishes were big disappointments.  I ordered the Schezwan chicken because I like spicy food.  The dish was not spicy at all and the chicken was really slimy.  It didn&#39;t taste too bad.  The worst dish was the seafood chow mein.  It was really heavy and the flavors not all that great.  Good thing it was all really cheap.

The inside definitely reminds me of most of the Chinese restaurants I&#39;ve been to with the same decorations.  The walls seem to ooze the same familiar scent (which I didn&#39;t mind).

I&#39;ve been wanting to go here like many others ever since I saw it featured on Anthony Bourdain&#39;s tv show. What stopped me was the long drive, but I finally made the trek when out of town guests wanted to go. Luckily, there was no traffic on a Sunday afternoon and we made it there in no time. 

I ordered smoked salmon, white fish and trout and my friend ordered fried scallops and oysters. Since it&#39;s a small shack and no place to eat inside, we took our food outside and sat at one of the two picnic tables. We ate the fried scallops and oysters and saved the fish for later. The fried seafood was SO delicious, piping hot and fresh. I ate the smoked fish days later and it was still good. While all three were good, my favorite was the white fish.

Food is messy finger food, but very tasty. Bring good handwipes and grab the towels from the shop. The sauces were a very nice compliment to the food and we definitely didn&#39;t finish what we bought.

While I wouldn&#39;t come here every weekend (it&#39;s like a 20-30 minute drive with no traffic outside Chicago towards Indiana), it&#39;s actually a fun spot bikers will bike to, and it&#39;s just cool to check out since Anthony Bordain put it on the map."

We were all fairly full from brunch earlier in the morning and we were short on time, but we made sure to stop here for some smoked salmon. This. Salmon. It was rich and flavorful and absolutely amazing. I described it at the time as a sort of salmon jerky--kind of like beef jerky in the flavor profile, but obviously not a chewy strip of meat.

THE AMBIANCE:

Calumet Fisheries is a small seafood shack with an outdoor smoke house. You walk in and pick your food off of a menu on the wall and from the glass counters. It is super small and the venue is meant for you to walk in and order. Outside by the smoke house there are long tables bleacher-style for you to sit and enjoy your pickings.

THE FOOD:

It was three (3) of us on this food trip and we ordered garlic smoked salmon, garlic smoked trout, fried scallops, fried catfish, and macaroni salad. A thing to note is that they don&#39;t have lemons (sigh) and they don&#39;t sell beer (double sigh). Lucky for us we had packed some brewskis. We set up food camp on the table and dug in. The seafood, especially the garlic smoked trout, was AMAZING. It was delicious! Calumet Fisheries provides a hot sauce that had a tangy-ness to it. Other than that you might want to bring your favorite hot sauce as well.   The macaroni salad was not good. It had so much mayo. None of us liked it/ate it. 

Carlos, who works there, came over and talked to us a bit about the history of Calumet Fisheries and he brought us some fresh cooked salmon, which he broke apart in front of us so we could taste some of the most buttery and juicy parts. He is awesome. We also got a tour of the smoke house. Super cool. During our trip the crew of Man Fire Food on the Cooking Channel was there and I got to meet the host, Roger Mooking. Super sweet and down to earth guy.

THE TIPS:

It can get really hot so wear sunscreen! I would pack some lemons/limes, cold beer, and your fave hot sauce!! Street parking."

Calumet fisheries shows that you can have good sophisticated tasting foods without the fuss! Who knew that you could get a delectable smoked fish of most any kind from a shack on the river?

It is a gem and a treat. There is no dining room, just a picnic table outside but most people like me park and eat in the car and hope there is still food left when we get home!  They only take cash but this place is certainly worth a trip to the atm. You will not be disappointed with whatever you order. It is worth a trip south to get these eats.

Smoked shrimp (10/10) - large shrimp, smoked perfectly with so much flavor
Smoked salmon (10/10) - nicely cut, smoked the same way as the shrimp
Fried oysters (6/10) - I&#39;m not a fan of the texture of fried oysters so this may not be completely accurate but I didn&#39;t feel like their fried oysters tasted any different from ones I&#39;ve had in the past
Fried shrimp (8/10) - if you&#39;re not a fan of smoked foods, then I would recommend to go with the fried shrimp, medium/large shrimp, fry batter was nice and crispy

I like to go down there and order some fried shrimp for lunch and take home some smoked fish for later.
It can be a little tricky to figure out what to do with it besides put it on a bagel, can I recommend making fish cakes...yes, yes I can

It was a bit difficult to trek all the way down from Albany Park during the winter season.  As I&#39;ve announced publicly in one of my previous reviews, my &#34;foodie hours&#34; have been extended seasonally!  

I had a quick nap in my hubby&#39;s work fleet, and I woke up with yummy fish and &#34;smokin&#39;&#34; hotties in front of me.  You know fish can be just as hot as good-looking dudes or dudettes.  I consider them gender-free after being bathed in smoke.  

Normally you would think a place like this that has won so many accolades from the big-foodie people (yeah I&#39;m talking about Anthony Bourdain) wouldn&#39;t render a friendly service like I received this afternoon.  The young man immediately greeted us and was ready to take our order.  We chose the smoked shrimp dinner and fried fish dinner.  The total was $18.88 after tax.

For a seafood fry place, the price we paid was reasonably fair.  Well, how were the tastes of our food?  I&#39;ve never been that &#34;moved&#34; and &#34;agitated&#34; in my mind after tasting their smoked shrimps.  That 70-year-old smoker really is an excellent machine to deliver such aromatic smoke on these jumbo shrimps.  I believe I consumed five (5) or six (6) large, if not, jumbo shrimps.  Once again, the value for the quality of food I received wasn&#39;t a bad deal at all!  

All dinner combos came with fries, coleslaw, crackers, a choice of sauce (hot or cocktail), and salt/pepper.  All other side dishes were solid.  

Hubby also enjoyed his fish, but you all need to try other smoked products!  How many exclamation marks have I used in this review?  Well, here&#39;s one (1) more for you!  

I also noticed that there are three (3) city of Chicago public trash cans in front of the Calumet Fisheries.  I guess that&#39;s where my taxation goes...my foodie trash.  

We will be back when we do our summer weekend Metra trips around the far-end Chicago and nearby suburbs.  I know the Metra station isn&#39;t too awfully far away; I can walk as long as there is food to entice me!  

There&#39;s an ATM onsite if you drop your cash in the river accidentally."

This smokehouse has been family-owned and -operated by the Kotlick-Toll family since &#39;48, where the fish is brined overnight and special oak logs are used for the smoking.  Fish, such as catfish, chubs, eel, rainbow trout, sable, salmon, sturgeon, white fish, and herring are some that are available.  They also have fried seafood (shrimp, fish, catfish, scallops, and crab cakes), as well as sides and salads.  I tried their Pepper &amp; Garlic smoked salmon, a half order of the fried shrimp, and a half order of their fried smelts.  The smoked salmon was pretty good; just use a strong fork to flake it apart; they have packages of saltine crackers available, but you can bring you own.  It had a lovely smoked flavor, and the garlic and the peppercorn was not too overpowering.  Just having the fish with the crackers can be a little dry, so having some mayonnaise to spruce it up is a good idea.  The fried shrimp was forgettable, and the fried smelts were okay - the batter was more like ground cornmeal-like, rather than the crispy batter I was expecting.  Service was super friendly, and everything is made fresh-to-order (besides the smoked fish).  This is a cash only joint, so keep that in mind.  It is a carry-out only, but there are a couple of picnic tables in the front to enjoy your meal (I prefer to just chowing down in the car - that&#39;s how you do ittttttt) :P  I&#39;d love to come back and try out their smoked sable, sturgeon, and the trout :D

We didn&#39;t realize how far the drive was going to be but it was a great way to see Chicago since we just got into town. My wife got a half order of fried shrimp and I got a half order of fried oysters and scallops. Between all 3 I would say the shrimp was the best, then the scallops and oysters. They gave us hot sauce and I was expecting more heat but I liked the thicker consistency. It was a really fun experience and I would defiantly tell people to go visit if they are going to the south side."

This was easily a half hour drive outside of Chicago, and I&#39;d do it again. Smoked and fried fish aplenty, right on the water. It really doesn&#39;t get much better than this. If my endorsement isn&#39;t enough for you, the many awards on the walls should be. Anthony Bourdain is among their fans, too.

Smoked is the way to go here. I&#39;m sure their fried fish is fine, and the smelts we tried were tasty, but the smoked fish was by far the star of our meal. They sell by weight, so come hungry and plan to buy a couple of pounds to split with a group. There&#39;s some outdoor seating available or you can take it with you, but be sure to bring cash- I&#39;m not a fan of cash-only businesses, but at least there&#39;s an ATM here.

SMELTS: Grab a half order, available with a spicy or mild dipping sauce not unlike a buffalo wing sauce. They&#39;re hot and crispy, and plenty for sharing even with the half order. But I&#39;d take these to go and make a garlic sauce to serve them with, as done in European cuisine.
GARLIC PEPPER SMOKED SALMON: This was tasty, and by far the most recommended fish in the reviews. It was good, but not amazing. If your only knowledge of smoked fish is the lox on your bagel at a chain restaurant, you might really like this massive step up in quality.
SMOKED TROUT: Go classic. The smoked trout is divine. No pepper or garlic needed, just simple, smoked fish. It&#39;s flavorful, with plenty of skin, and I could eat it for days.
CRACKERS: Whatever you buy, grab a tube of crackers (they&#39;re 55 cents) to eat your fish with.  And don&#39;t forget to grab napkins, because you&#39;ll be eating all this tastiness with your hands."

I need to come back and try the smoked salmon and trout, and perhaps the smelts as well.

Heine&#39;s, which is literally around the corner, is just a step down from this for a fraction of the price.  The smoked fish here is good, but it&#39;s really expensive. I spent like $60 on smoked fish, and then my family was still hungry afterwards.  The best part is the location.  They are right on the water and you get to eat outside at uncovered  picnic tables.  It&#39;s nice eating fresh fish with the sun on your back.  It&#39;s a real treat to watch the bridge go up.

The salmon was sooo good! you get a big portion for just a few bucks, i thought it was totally worth it! the smokiness is in every bite and i never had smoked fish before but i am now a fan! The scallops were small but juicy and they don&#39;t go cheap on it either, you get alot (they were a bit pricey if you asked me but i am glad i got to try it) the shrimps were HUGE i swear it was like they were on steroids but hey i am NOT complaining.... i am just amazed.

This place is a 30 minute drive from downtown Chicago, so I would not suggest you take a taxi. If you decide to drive here, there is a $7 toll to get there and $7 to back into Chicago. The tolls can be pricey. I decided to stop by on my way home back to Michigan. You can park on the street or turn right into the fishery. 

Recently, Mark, the owner told me you do not need to take the skyway to get there. You can stay on 94 south.  When it splits with 57, get off on the first exit that will take you right to 95th street turn right and drive 3 miles and your at our door steps. Good tip for us tourist (;

The food is completely delicious. I really can not tell you how good this place is. I am still drooling when I think about their smoked pepper garlic salmon &amp; smoked shrimp. Prices can be a bit pricey at $15 per lb for smoked salmon &amp; $22 per lb for smoked shrimp, but it was definitely worth it. The flavors were on point. It was the best smoked fish I have ever had. The shrimp was just amazing! You can truly taste the true flavor of the shrimp. You can even smell the smoke from the shrimp. They do not have cocktail sauce. They have hot sauce and have an amazing tartar sauce. 

A few flaws are that they do not have a restroom, only take cash, and have only two tables to eat outside. Overall, I cannot wait to come back!"

Given my Texas bias, which means brisket sits on the Iron Throne, ribs and sausage are Baratheons-in-waiting, and every thing else are declared usurpers of Westeros, I&#39;m hesitant to think of things like smoked fish as barbecue.

To that end, my recent trip to Calumet Fisheries was like a visit from the lord of light, sponsored by Anthony Bourdain. The &#34;pit&#34; at Calumet looks like a free-standing, ironclad meat locker, but the smoke is legit. It wafts out and hits you like a proper BBQ joint should, and the output that the Calumet pitmasters pull from the smoke is pure gold.

First, some logistics. This is not an easy place to get to, as you have to drive far south on 90 or derail the trip off Lakeshore. Calumet is also truly a shack. It&#39;s to-go counter service only. On nice days when winter isn&#39;t coming or already frozen over, you can eat outside on a grass patch or on the few plastic picnic tables set up. Dogs are allowed outside the shack, and a bring your own soda or red solo cup policy is recommended. Ordering, as mentioned, is counter service. Anything smoked in the trays is ordered on the left, anything fried on the right. Got it? Good.

Now, onto the smoked fish. It&#39;s wonderfully delicious. The highlight of our self-made trio sampler platter was the sable, otherwise known as black cod. It&#39;s succulent, buttery, and amazing, kind of like eating a brisket cookie sliced off the point end, dripping in fat. Our second fish, the pepper salmon, tasted like the flat with a flavorful char and a firm, slightly dry, meat. To each his own. I prefer the buttery, melt in your mouth texture. 

We ended with smoked shrimp, easy to peel, easy to eat, easy to enjoy. Along for the ride (because as a Texas ex and Louisiana neighbor, I&#39;m a sucker for fried seafood) was a small order of fried oysters, strewn in a Chinese take-out box, piping hot, and also incredibly tasty. Dipping those suckers, and frankly, any of the seafood, in Calumet&#39;s hot sauce is a recommend.

On that note, if I had but one complaint, it&#39;s that Calumet doesn&#39;t serve its seafood straight from the smoker. The smoked food isn&#39;t hot, but instead cooled and served at chilled temperatures. The pitmaster recommended waiting for room temperature before eating to bring out the flavor. He also provided by wife with ample samples right out the smoker. If my jealousy shows, it&#39;s because I was inside, in line, when these shenanigans occurred. Reheating isn&#39;t recommended, and so I&#39;m just left wondering what a freshly completed, hot off the presses smoked fish tastes like. I&#39;m guessing it would be in contention for the best smoked meat outside Texas."

Our friend in Chicago thought we were nuts to drive all the way there for some smoked fish, but we know it&#39;s gonna be so worth it.

Salmon with garlic and pepper: so oily yet so tasty! Favorite!
White fish: actually our second favorite. Really good flavor.
Trout: pretty amazing fish, each section has its own distinct flavor and texture.
Smoked Shrimp: awesome.
Chubs: FAVORITE!!! But they are seasonal so we didn&#39;t have them this visit. We had it 5 years ago, amazing."

I went there on a Saturday and they had just brought in some Sable and Salmon from the smoke house so I picked up a piece of each. I must say I was blown away with how good both pieces of fish were. I personally liked the sable more but my husband enjoyed the salmon either one we were hooked. I really like when the fish is fresh out of the smoke house and it hasn&#39;t been refrigerated, you can call and ask they will tell you when they have a batch coming out."

However.  I am now a &#34;real Chicago broad&#34;, as my husband likes to call me.  And fried shrimp are F*&amp;$-ing delicious.

Calumet was my first fried shrimp experience.  It did not disappoint.  Sitting in the back of my buddy&#39;s car, eating greasy shrimp and fries with my fingers--perfection.  The ice cold Dr. Pepper was the perfect complement.  

You&#39;ve gotta check this place out.  Seriously.  My husband brought home a smoked salmon and a smoked trout.  Can&#39;t wait to eat that next :)

Like nowhere so bad that it&#39;s almost Indiana.  And it&#39;s next to a bridge.  And it&#39;s super dystopian everywhere and there&#39;s lots of metal and concrete.  In fact, it&#39;s so fcked up looking that Anthony Bourdain dragged his arse out here one time to film an episode of his show and was all like &#34;OMG, be a traveler not a tourist..blah blah blah, live life to the fullest etc etc.&#34;  

So now, all these dudes trying to live life to the fullest come out here in hopes of experiencing something new.   I don&#39;t know what exactly. They probably don&#39;t know either but the hope is that it&#39;ll be new or interesting in some way.  In terms of the food, part of the hook is that the fish here is smoked on premises in a shack behind the restaurant.  According to the proprietors this is super rare these days.  So there&#39;s that.

For me, it was mostly for the bike ride and to see the area.  This place seemed like a good end point.  On arrival, after admiring the signed Anthony B poster,  I ordered deep fried catfish + fries.  And I put a to-go order in for some smoked shrimp and smoked (garlic and pepper) trout.    The catfish meal was exactly what I would have expected..deep fried and catfish.  Okay by me.  Nothing special.

I put the smoked fish/shrimp in the fridge and tried it a couple days later.  A bit of a  surprise ensued.  The smoked shrimp was partially rotten.  Some was edible, other parts were mushy and I had to spit out.  The smoked trout while not rotten was surprisingly terrible.  I had a few bites and threw it out too.  And I buy smoked fish sometimes, so I know what I&#39;m talking about.

Back when I visited the restaurant, there were a few dudes standing outside (there&#39;s no seating inside) who ordered the whole menu.  You know..to live life to the fullest.  Anyways, they beered me a deep fried frog leg to try.  In an adventurous spirit I had a go.  Actually I only had a couple of small bites.  Not that great.  Which is what I&#39;d say about this Calumet Fisheries place."

We found out about this place from Mr. Bourdain. Therefore, expectations were very high. The smoked salmon exceeded our expectations. We also ordered other &#34;dinner&#34; items, fried shrimp and oysters. They were, well, fried. But this place is definitely worth it for smoked fish (salmon).

Pros: 
1. Smoked fish: the best that I have ever tried.

Cons:
1. Location: it is in the middle of nowhere, very small and there are no restrooms.

We ordered fried oysters, clam strips, smoked salmon, and a few smoked shrimp.  They forgot a couple of things that we ordered, but we were ordering pretty sporadically between the one counter for fried food and the other for smoked seafood.

I love, love, love seafood and especially smoked salmon.  It was pretty amazing!  The shrimp were great as well.  I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the fried oysters, but I bet there are someone else&#39;s jam.

I have to stop putting faith in seafood that is located in the city and at a low cost. This is mediocre at best. The scallops are not fresh and very chewy. The shrimp are clearly store brought and not fresh. The smoked fish is good, but to be honest. I can get the same quality out of a can of tin fish from the grocery store. The best thing was the cheese bites and that is very sad. If I am in the area and craving some cheese bites and smoked trout. I will make the stop, but other then that.

My only issue with them is they don&#39;t accept credit cards and they have an ATM machine (strongly advise not using because the owners of the ATM will assess a fee and you&#39;ll get charged by you bank also for using the machine). They really do need to get with the the times in terms of how people pay for things. So until they get their payment methods updated where they accept credit cards is to bring cash. I ordered some fish chips and they were pretty good tasting almost identical to the way Lawrences makes their fish chips. Also this place has had the same owner and remained in the same location since 1948. Again they do need to come with the times because Lawrence&#39;s Fisheries used to look like Calumet Fisheries, but the family that owns Lawrence&#39;s have gotten a website with their menu and the restaurant&#39;s history on it and even going as far as taking orders via the site and  expanded by remodeling the restaurant and even expanding with a second location. It&#39;s a cute little divey place and will get crowded on certain days preferably Friday and Saturday nights. Everything is cooked fresh to order which is what I like because I like freshly prepared food and not some mess under a hot lamp. There is only one picnic table outside so prepare to eat standing up, in your car or wait until someone leaves to use the table (weather pending). Overall the food is pretty good :-)"

- if you have a shellfish allergy, but still eat fish beware this can be a death trap! I&#39;m allergic to shellfish, but I&#39;ve been eating fish from this place since, I was a kid. A few months ago, I order the usual fish order and my shellfish allergy kicked in. My face started to swell and etc.  I did NOT order shellfish, but my order came in contact with something that touched shellfish. I&#39;m guessing they reused their frying oil, because there&#39;s no other reason for my allergic reaction. Whatever the case this is a great place, but avoid it if you have shellfish allergies.

If you don&#39;t get at least one smoked item, you&#39;re doing your visit wrong in my opinion, as that&#39;s always been their specialty. There&#39;s probably a reason that&#39;s the main thing I recall really liking here, and that the rest of what I ordered was good to not bad, but not sure if I&#39;d say go out of your way unless you&#39;re on the south side. It&#39;s worth a trip at least once IMO, just for how darn good I really liked the smoked salmon here. I hope to do a visit when the weather warms up later in 2015, to see how the rest of the smoked seafood compares to the smoked salmon.

BTW if you don&#39;t have a car, it&#39;s just a short walk(or bike ride) south from the 93rd Street(South Chicago Metra Electric branch) Metra station, to here. Go west from the station on 93rd St. to Baltimore Ave, Baltimore south to South Chicago Ave(major southeast/northwest road), South Chicago to 95th Street, then 95th east to the bridge. With this route, you won&#39;t have any delays between Metra and here if by some chance the drawbridge goes up, like it did at least on one past visit. And yes, this is the exact one seen in the 1980 Blues Brothers movie. No seating inside, except for a few tables outside, eating inside your car, or walk a few blocks east to Calumet Park and Beach to eat your food. Parking(no meters, and free btw) is mainly along 95th Street inbetween the South Chicago/95th traffic light and bridge, and at least one vacant lot immediately west of here has no parking signs, so be advised of this if you drive here.

Nearly forgot to note this place is CASH ONLY, btw."

My friends and I all piled into a car, bought a whole boatload of food, and ate at Calumet park, as others have suggested.  It was a chilly day, so I think the food will taste even better on a sunny, warm one.  We sampled both the fried food and the smoked fish, though I was disappointed that someone had apparently bought their entire supply of smoked sable for the day, so I&#39;ll have to try that next time.  I really liked the pepper-garlic salmon.  It was so moist and flavorful!  Perfect with cream cheese )brought from home) and hot sauce.  The smoked shrimp were really big and moist also.  Like Johnny T, I really prefer cleaned shrimp, but I do understand that the shells probably need to be intact in order for the shrimp to stay moist through the smoking process.

The fried things we tried (clam strips, smelts, shrimp) were also good, but I think I liked the smoked stuff better.  Of the fried things, I think my favorite were the smelts.  I kind of wished the clam strips had been more big pieces instead of small--lots of small bits.

I would skip the potato and macaroni salads--not my cup of tea.  Next time I&#39;d make and bring my own.

The folks at the counter were really nice and accommodating, especially since we were taking a while to strategize and put our order in.  They happily gave us extra paper boats and other fixings.  It&#39;s not necessarily the cheapest place, but the fish is really good, so you get what you pay for.  It&#39;s worth the trip!"

I&#39;ve had many of the smoked variety - salmon, sable, trout, shrimp - and a couple of the fried options as dinners to go - catfish and oysters. The anticipation of ripping open that white paper package kills me on my drive home.

You can&#39;t go wrong. Though, I will say the sable isn&#39;t always available and, to be honest, it&#39;s not as good as the salmon (too fatty). My personal favorites are the salmon and shrimp, which have an almost buttery taste with its natural oils kept heavily concentrated inside through the smoking process. Not to mention, the smoked salmon almost feels like a steal at ~$15/lb. The fried oysters are also surprisingly delicious.

For those who aren&#39;t fortunate enough to work in the beautiful NW Indiana area, make the trip. It&#39;s worth it. The Fisheries are an institution that doesn&#39;t fail to live up to its reputation."

Need I say more?  Well, I probably should:  This place is not close to you...it&#39;s probably in a part of the city you didn&#39;t know existed, even though the Blues Brothers car jumping bridge scene was shot here.  It&#39;s very far south and very far east, but if you&#39;re anywhere near the neighborhood it&#39;s a must.  

They have an assortment of sea food smoked in different ways and even their fried catfish, shrimp, etc. are good.  They are cash-only and there&#39;s no where to eat inside, so pack up some wet wipes, and plan to eat outside in your car."

My family did the smoked salmon, pepper and garlic smoked salmon, and smoked whitefish. The p&amp;g salmon and the whitefish were both standout. We also did the smoked shrimp which were interesting to try (have never had) and were good as well. My brother likes slaw and wasn&#39;t impressed by theirs. Good experience though.

I had the fried shrimp, oysters, and fish. Everything was fried perfectly. 

The shrimp was awesome and retained a lot of the shrimp flavor for being fried. 

The oysters are on the pungent side (not because it was going bad, just the type of oyster it was), but I didn&#39;t mind this because I like pungent foods. The consistency of the oyster kept most of its raw form, which I also liked, but it&#39;s a little weird to bite into a crispy fried batter and have something mushy/boogery flood into your mouth. This isn&#39;t a complaint, though. Still pretty tasty. 

The fish was good. Nothing special, but delicious nonetheless.

Fries were just ok. Typical fries. The cole slaw is 80% mayonnaise. 

The guy gave us a sample of the smoked fish and shrimp. Oh my goodness, did that fish melt in my mouth. They smoke it and retain a lot of the fat content, which is hard to do since smoking dries out meat. Next time I go, I&#39;m going to get a steak of smoked salmon. It was pretty amazing and the smoke flavor was great! The smoked shrimp doesn&#39;t retain as much of the smoke flavor due to the shell, but it was still good.

There is no seating. You eat in your car, or outside on the curb if it&#39;s not winter."

FRY FISH - I&#39;m not sure what kind of fish, but $7 got me a pretty good amount of fried fish pieces and they were pretty good.  The tarter sauce went well, as tarter sauces and fish go.  I would try the smoked salmon next time around.

FRY SHRIMP - $5 got me half order of friend shrimp, which at first I thought were the fish when I ate them.  The texture was more fish-like than shrimp like.  I dipped them in both tarter sauce and the hot sauce, but felt like neither sauce did the shrimps justice.  

Notes:
-Cash only
-Plenty of street parking
-There&#39;s no place to sit and eat, plan on taking it to go"

All were helpful and gave us a sample of the salmon. Boy, we were in for a treat! One of the guys (regret not asking his name) explained the sections of the salmon that taste best. He also suggested the eye but we declined; we&#39;re not that cool.  Since we had purchased other food before the sample, we did not buy the smoked fish. On Saturday afternoon, my man suggested smoked fish for dinner so here we go again. We ordered the pepper and garlic salmon and the smallest piece of sturgeon. Once we got home, we began with the sturgeon.  We regret buying the smallest sturgeon piece. The sturgeon was perfect! It was not flaky like other fish, it was very soft, flavorful and boneless (at least the section we bought). We bought a bigger piece of salmon and it was delightful. I expected to taste the garlic but I did not; however, we enjoyed it. Frankly, between the sturgeon and salmon, I prefer the sturgeon. 
The service during both visits was exceptional and we waited a few minutes to place our orders during both visits because there were several people ahead of us.   Knowing my man&#39;s eating habits, we will be frequent customers. We&#39;ve already determined that when family visits in a few weeks, we will be having smoked sturgeon for dinner."

Service: attentive enough. Both the bartender and waitress were pleasant, and there wasn&#39;t a whole lot of wait time for our orders. We went on a weekday though, so I can&#39;t vouch for weekend service.

Food: Decent. I had the kale cobb and as a person who normally doesn&#39;t care for salad, it was pretty good. The salad comes in two sizes: &#34;quite small&#34; and &#34;good lord, that&#39;s a whole lot of salad!&#34; If you go for the latter, split it with a friend.

Drinks: I probably had four drinks and didn&#39;t feel much of anything. Maybe my tolerance is evolving. Maybe not.

Hummus plate- good hummus, you can never really go wrong with such a dish, fresh veggies and toasty bread to accommodate

The garlic and lemon really overwhelmed the flavors for me, i asked for a side of marinara to use to dip, and i was delivered a generous dish of marinara on the side.

Same issues as last time. It&#39;s very LOUD, disorganized, and very BRO-y. I swear most of the dudes that come here are still reliving their frat house days. 

Anyway, my girlfriends and I came here on a Friday after work a couple of weeks ago. I arrived first and the outdoor patio was jammed packed. When I first walked in, I asked how long the wait was for outside and the hostess directed me to another hostess for the outdoor seating area. Okay.

I ask the other two hostesses how long the wait was, and she said about an hour. Meanwhile I ordered a cocktail at the bar. The bar was also jammed packed and I couldn&#39;t find a seat. I had my cocktail in hand when my friends arrived and we just decided to sit indoors since there was zero wait. 

We just decided to go with some appetizers: Brussel Sprouts and the Craziest Bread. The Brussel Sprouts were the SALTIEST thing I&#39;ve ever tasted. There&#39;s nothing healthy about these sprouts. The craziest bread was appropriately named. It was hella greasy and heavy. Just not good. Soggy bread is not my idea of good food. 

We stayed for a couple more cocktails, but as the day wore on, it was becoming increasingly louder and more crowded. Nooooo thank you.

Parlor was the first restaurant my party went to in Chicago, which started us off on the wrong foot. We did get seated right away which was impressive for dinner time on a Friday night. 

Besides it being over crowded and loud, our service was just miserable. Our waitress would only speak to one of us and not acknowledge anyone else at our table of 8, then we wouldn&#39;t see her for another 40 mins or so after we had to pull her away from talking to her friends. 

The food was mediocre and extremely over priced for what you get- a 13&#34; pizza that was literally paper thing was $15-$18 and had little to no flavor. 

I might be a grump about this place cause I was looking forward to having some deep dish pizza, which wasn&#39;t served here, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend coming here for anything other than the $55 margarita bowl that our table consumed two of."

Granted a lot of the girls had 8 lbs of makeup on but you really can&#39;t slap lipstick on a pig and make it beautiful.  

We wanted to enjoy outdoor seating regardless of the 93 degree temperature.  As we were being seated, I noticed a few tables with stripes of sunshine so I requested for a table completely covered in shade.  I will give the hostess the benefit of the doubt and assume she did not hear me asking to be seated in shade.  She took us to a table where there was patches of sun and rather than being whiny we convinced ourselves it would be fine.  

Immediately after sitting, our waitress came by and briefly asked us if we wanted anything to drink.  We asked for a little more time.  

After a few minutes at our table we realized the heat and sun were unbearable.   We packed our items and moved to the initial table (completely covered in shade).  Personally it didn&#39;t bother me much because I have dark skin, but for my poor white fiancé, well he burns.  I understand that shifting tables is not ideal as I used to waitress many years ago, but I didn&#39;t want to be considerate at the cost of my fiancé.  I noticed the waitress walking pass and kindly informed her we moved.  With a look of dismay, and not even stopping, she responded with &#34;you&#39;re not mines anymore.&#34;  Someone had a little bit too much bi... You know the rest of the 3 letters juice.

Moving tables was the best because we ended up with the sweetest waitress.  She came to our table quickly and not only asked us what we wanted to drink but also asked if we had been to the downtown Parlor location.  We said no and she thoroughly went through the menu highlighting some popular items and some of her favorites.

The pizza here is AMAZING!  We had the Sgt Pepper pizza (the most popular according to the waitress). Oh my god.  I don&#39;t know if all of their pizzas are thin but this was a thin wood fired pizza with the perfect amount of sauce, cheese, and spiciness!  I can&#39;t wait to go back and try more pizza from their menu!  (FYI, I&#39;m not a huge pizza fan, yes I&#39;m human, so this says a lot!)  We also ordered the breakfast burrito and my choice of meat was the pork belly.  Wow!  Of course it&#39;s not your traditional Mexican burrito so it can&#39;t claim &#34;the best&#34; title, but it was really really really good!  The pork was perfectly cooked and the chimichurri sauce!  The chimichurri sauce!  It was sweet.  I never had sweet chimichurri.  It was ahmmmazzzzing!  And the build your own Bloody Mary.  What the heck!  You had three types of vodka to choose from (which the waitress will bring), then you go the the Bloody Mary bar and choose from 4 mixers, lots of hot sauce, pickles, cheeses, meats, olives, peppers, lemons, etc etc.  You can grab extra skewers and literally make a charcuterie skewer!

I hope the service stays great because the downtown location has only three stars, not a lot of complaints on the food but countless complaints on service.  Leave the snob attitude at home because this is an industry where you put on a fake smile and suck it up and occasionally spit (just kidding).

Can&#39;t wait to go back!!!"

This review does not address the food, which I have never tried.  The beer selection is adequate for a restaurant this size and the prices are average. 

But The service here is unfortunate.  Specifically, the staff is not friendly.  The host sat us at an outside picnic bench at which there were 5-6 of us racking up a decent bar tab.  At some point the sun became too much and some in our group decided to move one table over to get out of the sun.  This was not a choice I made and I get that it can be annoying, but paying customers sometimes do this and restaurants have to be able to handle it.  The move caused such a major problem that you would think someone in our party had ordered broiled puppy.

The host, same guy who seated us, rushed over and told us our party was too small for the table, which was exactly the same picnic table as the original table.  The outdoor seating area was not crowded.  Maybe half of the tables were occupied.  Instead of dealing with a group moving over one table, which people do all the time, it became a major issue.  We had to pay the original server and were assigned to a new one. 

Then, despite the complete absence of wind, we were told that the umbrella on our picnic table had to be folded up because of the non-existent wind.  We had to argue with management to keep the umbrella raised, which is apparently what one has to do if one wants to drink a few beers here."

I love the atmosphere here, the service and the pizza of course is a winner too.  I&#39;ve been after work for pizza and drinks - and recently experienced brunch.  The two times I&#39;ve been now, I&#39;ve left loving it more than the time before.  A huge shout out to Maddie who served us this past Sunday - she had a great sense of humor and took amazing care of our party of 3.

The space here is cozy, rustic and good for hanging out and drinking.  The brunch Bloody Mary bar is spot on with great cheeses, meats, and peppers... you can&#39;t go wrong with the peppers.  The brunch birthday cake waffles were amazing - think confetti cake batter in a waffle iron that we shared as a table as sort of a dessert.  

A few works to sum it up - tasty, fun, lively.

Go here, you&#39;re going to be happy you did!"

When we got there the place was packed and it is huge. I approached the hostess and asked for a table she just asked me if everyone was there and I said yes then she talked to the manager I&#39;m assuming is the manager because he had a Bluetooth and was ordering people to do things. So, after a few seconds I decided to ask if we could seat at the patio and she said that there was a hostess there, so I decided to ask my friends first if they wanted to seat there, but since we noticed it was packed we decided to seat inside. But while we were deciding I noticed the hostess and the manager were talking, I&#39;m very intuitive and I knew they were talking about us in a negative way, I mean I didn&#39;t hear anything, but I could tell. 

Anyways, she took us to our table we ordered the nachos and calamari and a pizza. I didn&#39;t try the pizza, but I did try the calamari and this dish was amazing I liked the textured, taste , flavor, everything, it was really good. The nachos were a let down for me personally, the taste wasn&#39;t right for some reason. 

Overall the atmosphere it&#39;s ok, typical west loop restaurant kind of pretentious, service was OK. Maybe the front of the house can be more outgoing, so people don&#39;t think you are talking about them... May be?"

I hate when restaurant shave nachos and they are so loaded that they become soggy. Gross. These bad amazing flavors and were crunchy perfectness. We also started with the spinach and artichoke dip which I personally found way too creamy. 

For dinner, we got 4 pizzas to try. The barata, arugula and truffle oil pizza was delicious. As ways the margarita pizza. The brussels sprouts pizza personally was not my favorite. Really couldn&#39;t stand that one. 

Finally the atmosphere and drinks were perfection. After having dinner downstairs, I had more drinks upstairs on the rooftop. What an awesome spot and it even has a ping pong table."

We got the last available table as the joint was packed at 7:30 on a Wednesday night. The menu had some interesting pizza on there and our server Sydney was very good at breaking down what some of the best pizzas were. Was definitely a hard choice but we went with the Cheesus, Mary &amp; Joseph. This delicious pizza contains whipped ricotta, white cheddar, smoked mozzarella, minced garlic and oregano....added some pepperoni to it as well. The pizza came out pretty quick, but it was a delicious pizza for 2! They have a nice beer selection as I made the mistake (not really) of getting the perennial sump coffee stout which is 10% alcohol content...very nice! 

I like this place as I mentioned they have lots of delicious looking pies. The setup slightly reminds me of Piece in Wicker Park with the communal high tops. TVs on every angle to watch some good ol ball games. Coming for the delicious looking/sounding Sgt Peppers pizza next time."

Inside, they could do with a few fewer tables. Seemed overly packed in and the two tops were very small. I know my sister and I ate like fat kids but the table was so crowded when our food arrived that it was verging on uncomfortable.

The food was a+ though! We started with the craziest bread which was so yummy and stuffed with the most delicious goodies. It was like a Pinterest project gone super right! We opted for the I Feel Like Bacon Love pizza. The potatoes were a great addition. We got a side of Brussels sprouts and they were a perfect addition. Vinegary with just enough lemon the cut some of the cheesy bacony pizza goodness.

Will most definitely be back to try more of these stupid delicious sounding pies!"

Service is just meh. They were packed on a Wednesday evening, and I suspect that it&#39;s pretty popular throughout the week judging by the number of people who were here on a weeknight. I&#39;m surprised the management hasn&#39;t staffed up to meet the high demand of people. 

Also, one weird thing to mention is that one of our friends showed up in gym shorts and they wouldn&#39;t let him in! Like come on, give some leniency to your patrons! This is a pizza place on a weeknight, not an up-town bar on a weekend. Our friend had to go home and change! 

We got the mozzarella sticks for an app, the brussel sprout pizza, and the pizza with the jalepeno sauce. The brussel sprout pizza was excellent, with no shortage of greenage. It made you feel like you were eating healthy! The jalepeno pizza was disappointing though, as I couldn&#39;t even taste the jalepeno flavor. It was not spicy at all and surprisingly bland for the description. 

Beer was pretty expensive- $7-$9 for your typical Chicago drafts like Goose Island and Two Brothers. Really? Considering the number of people that runs through, you&#39;d expect the customers to be able to catch a break. 

I love the restaurant inside though, the physical layout that is. The atmosphere is kind of loud, but the super tall cielings and open wood-fired pizza area is a very fun set-up. I also really enjoyed all the brick on the interior, and perfect dimness of lighting. 

I would return for the ambiance and &#34;cool&#34; factor for the interesting wood-fired pizza, but I wouldn&#39;t be hopping to go to Parlor. Kind of expensive, and kind of snooty staff."

We got the Burrata pizza, which comes with a TON of arugula. It wasn&#39;t dry though, they had a nice dressing on it that took a lot of the bitterness away. Not a lot of burrata or cheese, which was my one constructive complaint. But I really enjoyed it. We also split a GIGANTIC hummus appetizer. Seriously gigantic - we took a bunch home.

Other than the challenge we had finding a table, it is a pretty cool place for after work hangout. I really enjoyed my time here even though I am not fan of eating pizza nor drinking bear. 

I came here for our happy hours after work. By the time, we found a few others from our group through the crowd, we realized none of us made the reservation. We were sent upstairs to get a table for 6 of us after the serious security guy (with those ear plugs you&#39;d see on the body guards of important people) stopped us then asked seemed a million questions. A few more folk joined to us a few minutes later. They had a hard time to come upstairs too even we send one of us to get there. 

I went for the Stiegl Radler (Grapefruit) beer and margarita pizza. Both are exellent. I loved the wood oven burns on the very thin crust of my pizza. We shared the craziest bread which was quite different and interesting. This bread is very heavy so share it with 6 people instead of 2. Gyro pizza was pretty tasty too. 

Sitting on the roof top was very pleasant during a summer afternoon. The relaxing atmosphere was exact thing I was looking for after a long day at work. I liked they have the choices for me who doesn&#39;t drink beer."

Well yes, a little, but luckily that group of guys in the corner just left. We spent the past hour or so trying to figure out which sporting event they were cheering on until we finally realized whatever they were celebrating had nothing to do with what was on the tv...

Ok so the food was good, not great but definitely deserves an &#39;ok decent&#39; at the price point. We would come back, esp for the people watching - HA!  Now, must mention that we wanted to order the chilaquiles, but I did a quick check on Yelp (2 of 2 reviews mentioning this dish were not positive) and decided to ask the server. Her response/facial expression said enough. I am so glad we asked and she gave an honest response. So we ordered the nacho bites (pretty good) and then the kale &amp; artichoke dip (very good - we asked for tortilla chips instead of bread). I was stuffed after these so I didn&#39;t partake in the pizza but my husband and brother shared the &#39;Abe Froman&#39;s Fave&#39; (w/ the spicy sauce) and said it was alright.

Chicago is the wrong city for you. I cannot tell you how ridiculous I find it that my girlfriend and I were turned away at the door at 4 o&#39;clock on a Friday after just leaving a cubs game, simply because we had jerseys on. I have been to your establishment a number of times before, truthfully never thought of it as special, but just enjoyed your patio space. I will never return and will not encourage a single person to either. You are not a fine dining establishment. You are not even an mid-upscale restaurant. Your name is &#34;Parlor Pizza&#34; for god&#39;s sake. 

I have to mention that the guy working the door who wouldn&#39;t let us in was very polite. He even apologized and said he hates working this door because he consistently has to turn people away with jerseys on. Does that sound like lost business? 

Chicago is a sports city; you are a pizza parlor. Figure it out."

They attempted to accuse me of &#34;embellishment&#34;- are you kidding me????!?  It was pretty bad.  Excuse me for having a less than mediocre experience and giving a damn about food safety and racism. Below is my review that got pizza parlor&#39;s panties in a bunch.  If you wanted a better review, then maybe the service should have been up to par.  The thing is,
when there is a problem, and many at that, fix it, don&#39;t get offended and blame others, change your actions for positive change.  There&#39;s always tomorrow. &amp;wait, I forgot to mention, the fries were good  :

The pizza was mediocre for being on the chicago playing field.  It took a long time too, all for a pube to be in it(haha ewww i
picked off someonelse&#39;s plate and figured a Yelp review was better than closing the whole restaurant down for business in that moment-yes a restaurant can shutdown for the day of there is hair in food).  I forgot to mention the chicken sandwich when originally posting.   My bf&#39;s &#34;chicken sandwich&#34; was so undercooked, raw, and pink on the inside that a good vet could bring it back to life.  That certainly does not follow health codes.  I would know since I have my food handlers license like most people should in the industry. 

But what was even worse than the food and lack of checking it before it is served is their classist dress code, and evident racism.   What a turn off.  Wake up, it&#39;s just pizza and it&#39;s 2016(get it together, that&#39;s unacceptable behavior and people are catching on).  Besides, as a company, is that really what you want to communicate.   &#34;Here come be bigots with us and eat our pizza and have a bigot fest, but if you don&#39;t look or dress like us- to hell with you.&#34;  So basically everything from their attitudes, to the unnecessary idiotic dress code, to the food, to the racism, I can assure you parlor pizza was absolutely gross and it tasted so awful, I wouldn&#39;t serve it to my dead grandmother because she would toss it back.

o_O p.s- I have lived in chicago for a decade and Italy for several years.   I can attest to the fact that this pizza and their &#34;customer service&#34; actually do suck. Lol &amp; not everyone sucked----there was one friendly female employee there-thanks for that breath of fresh air."

But man this place is sweet and an easy walk from UIC. It was pretty busy on Sunday afternoon with the outdoor seating area jam packed and the inside about 30% full. 

You can have large groups here, but we came in a group of 6 and their was no wait for the inside, but their was for outside. With the amount of seating they have, and how quickly people filter in and out, I doubt you would ever have to wait for indoor seating on a nice sunny day. 

Anyways, we got a pizza with jalapeños! and o my goodness those things were super spicy! We all eventually had to peel some off and hide away our Indian pride for the sake of our bathroom trip the next morning. I do think the pizzas are overpriced for the portions they give. But the coolness of the place makes up for it. They have a ping pong table in the restaurant, so you can burn your calories as soon as you&#39;re done eating. How considerate of the owner! 

They messed up our appetizers though, we didn&#39;t bother sending it back due to hunger. It&#39;s expensive for the portions they give, that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t give it 5 stars.

I mention this because if you decide to visit during a prime time or day of the week, it will be impossible to hear the person next to you. It is very loud. Loud music or whatever game is on is blaring. If you have the opportunity definitely sit outside. It is the best seat in the house. My favorite is the Srgt. Pepper pizza. You cannot go wrong. 

Watch out for the drunk crowd on Friday and Saturday nights. I was walking my two dogs with my husband north on Green Street one evening and four drunk men and woman came running towards our animals, startled them, and wanted to touch them. Unfortunately for me, my dogs do not bite. I wish they did. 

The jury is out on weather I will dine in again. I read in another review that they do not allow strollers in the restaurant or on the patio. Um, this is the West Loop - home to strollers, dogs, Mom&#39;s with Lulu outfits, and expensive diaper bags. Every stereotype I intend to portray.

As soon as we got there, we proceeded to the outdoor host and asked to be seated.  The young, unfriendly and seemingly annoyed host sat us instantly.  No mention of a server being right with us or even &#34;enjoy your meal&#34;.  Not one word was spoken.  When we sat down a bus boy brought us water, it was like 90, so that was a huge plus.  

When our waitress came, she did not introduce herself to us.  She asked if we wanted any drinks or apps.  I ordered a Shirley temple and the nachos for an app. Then ordered Aunt Chilada&#39;s Chicken Pizza with a side of ranch.  The carbonation in my drink was out, when I flagged her down stating so, she seemed overly annoyed that I was asking for a different drink. About 5 minutes later she brought me another one.  Wasn&#39;t much better, but due to the semi attitude I received, I decided to drink it anyways.  

Once the nachos arrived they were like heaven in my mouth.  Seriously, one of the best things I&#39;ve ever eaten.  The pizza arrived shortly after, no ranch. The pizza was pretty good, not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but I had just eaten the nachos; so it had big shoes to fill.  I could not get the waitresses attention to save my life, so I asked a bus boy for a side of ranch. He instantly brought me some and was constantly refilling our water and clearing our table.  When the waitress brought our check again there was not a hint of friendliness to her.  Working in the service industry you would think she and the host might smile a bit.....  

Seriously, if not for the bus boys this rating would have been lower.  Give those hard working men a raise."

First impression: it&#39;s really dark inside.
Second impression: these chairs are way too hard, I think my butt is going to go numb.

(If you wanna know, my butt did indeed go numb. Be forewarned, y&#39;all.)

We ordered a bunch of pizzas, an enchilada inspired one, pepperoni pizza with truffle oil and egg, and a sausage and pepperoni. 

The sausage was good quality, I usually hate sausage but this was delicious. The enchilada pizza was a bit too spicy for a pizza in my opinion but it was unique. I didn&#39;t try the pepperoni and truffle one but everyone else liked it.

I think the real star was the craziest bread. It was not what I expected (it&#39;s basically a rolled up pizza cut into slices) and it was delicious. The pizza was mediocre, especially for the price. The crust is too thin and soggy and cannot support the ingredients. it&#39;s not firm enough to pick up and too soggy to use a fork a knife... it&#39;s an awkward situation.

The bus boys are way too hype to fill your water. They came around too often and were careless with reaching across you. One of their arms were right on the side of my head. I just sat there awkwardly till they finished. I also didn&#39;t like that they let the pitchers make contact with the rim of everyone&#39;s glass...not sanitary.

If it weren&#39;t for their stupid dress code (it&#39;s just pizza, calm down) i would probably come back just for the craziest bread and a drink or two.

I won&#39;t be back, especially when there are more delicious places right around the corner."

The bouncers became belligerent. My friend took a picture of the situation but was not being antagonistic in any way. Once they saw him taking a picture, they subsequently kicked him out (literally carried him out) without discussion.  Our waitress and other staff were amazing but the bouncers and managers here are out of line. They have no guidelines as to how to manage their customers and act without consequence.

Here are some personal favorites, tips &amp; tricks-
1. If you&#39;re in a group order a punch bowl. It&#39;ll go a long way!
2. Don&#39;t order the salad. Get the pizza. I have yet to encounter one that I don&#39;t like.
3. Go with friends or a group. You&#39;ll have a lot of fun. Trust me!

SERVICE (5 Stars)
The staff here is rather nice and provides good recommendations. 

ATMOSPHERE (5 stars)
This place is adorable all year round but becomes magical during the summer. The outdoor garden lights, TVs, ping pong table, and people make Parlor Pizza oh so lively. In the winter, this place is just as lively but the party is indoors. 

ACCESSIBILITY (5 Stars)
Parlor Pizza is a block south of Randolph  so you&#39;re right off the main hotpot of West Loop"

We had the margarita pizza and Abe Froman sausage pizza. Both exceptional and both came with either a cecear salad or house. Kudos to this too since they were very good actually  

Outdoor patio is amazing. I could hang out here all day. When it&#39;s cold, I can stay inside and sit at the bar by the wood ovens. That&#39;s the place to be dude.

The pizza itself is pretty bad, the service is every bit as bad as the pizza, and the management is among the least friendly and inhospitable I&#39;ve encountered in the city. It&#39;s an odd place--it&#39;s a sports bar that thinks it&#39;s a lot nicer than it actually is. But really, Parlor is just some Wrigleyville fratboy hangout in disguise.

The patio is nice though, and the beer list is decent. If you want to hang out on the patio and drink a few beers, it&#39;s alright. But if you want good pizza and good service, Parlor isn&#39;t even worth considering. In that case, just head down the street to Forno Rosso or Pizzeria del Mercato."

Extensive draft list, however only a few seem to actually be being poured at any time. Waitress was extremely friendly and helpful, but came back so many times that I felt that she was trying to turn over the table ASAP. One guy didn&#39;t even have his coat off before she asked him what his drink order was. A few other reviews mentioned the noise- it was extremely loud. Definitely not a first date location if you want to have a conversation (unless you&#39;re concerned about having things to talk about-- lots of people watching, etc is available). They do take reservations (Open Table) which is a huge plus in my book. 

Pizza snob approved of the pizza (and that`s saying a lot). I`m not a huge pizza fan but I enjoyed mine. We couldn&#39;t decide on which ones to split so 3 of us got our own (everyone had leftovers to take home- the pizzas are 13&#34;, 6 large pieces each, thin crust). Everyone liked it. The last member of our group got the roasted chicken. It looked/smelled DELICOUS and he said it tasted amazing as well- but it was soaked in butter so if you&#39;re ordering the chicken to be healthy, don&#39;t. (Not to mention the waitress told us that it is cooked in feta as well).

It&#39;s a shame the service is so poor because Pizza Parlor itself is a cool place. Nice vibe, reasonably good food and a great outside area. The service however, is terrible. I live close to Parlor and have been there many times so I&#39;m basing this review off a number of experiences.

Firstly - they have a crazy rule that you cannot be seated at a table if you&#39;re alone. If you require a &#34;table for one&#34; your only option is to sit at the bar. A few weeks ago I went to Parlor to meet my girlfriend but she was caught up at work and running late. I explained to the host that she would be there in an hour but I was planning on eating first and meeting her after. I therefore requested a table so I could eat. I was told it&#39;s their policy to not seat individual parties and my only option would be sit at the bar. The bar was completely full at the time so I had to wait awkwardly for someone to leave, then cram myself into the busy bar to eat my dinner when multiple other tables lay vacant in the bar.

On a similar note - myself and a few colleagues went there for lunch yesterday and spent the afternoon completing a business meeting in Parlor. We were there for a number of hours and spent over $500. A few members of our party departed leaving my colleague and I sat at our table for 6 people. The second they left, the manager then came over and demanded (mid-drink) that we leave our table by the window for a smaller 2-person table at the back of the dark bar. I explained to him that four more people would be joining us shortly and we therefore wanted to keep the table for six but he said this was not an option and refused to serve us until we moved. Result = we moved to a table for 2 people at the back of the bar and our four friends had to float nearby when they arrived 10 minutes later.

Finally - I&#39;m all for &#34;attentive service&#34; but Parlor&#39;s service is incredibly over the top. They employ about 1,000 people responsible for filling up your water glass and cleaning your table and they check in on you roughly every 8 seconds. I ordered a small salad for lunch and I was asked 4 times in 15 minutes if I&#39;d finished by 4 different people. I also had to prevent someone taking my drink away before I was finished 3 times that afternoon. I appreciate their diligence in making sure their patrons are happy but during our meal we were ask by our server (twice), three different busboys and the manager if our meal was OK. Conversation was therefore impossible.

Advice to management - remember you work in the service industry. You need to be flexible and accommodating for your customers."

The 1st time we set on the roof during the summer for happy hour on a Friday night. It was a great atmosphere but extremely busy and took some time to get drinks and the such.  2nd time my wife and I went for brunch.  When looking at the menu I thought it would be good but it was blah and caused major heartburn.  Lastly we went with a group of friends on a random Saturday night. We waited 40 min for a table of 8 (so it was expected to wait). The place was crowded and overly obnoxious. It felt like a college bar that allows 20 yr old kids one.  With a city that provides plenty of pizza joints I would recommend elsewhere. If you are looking a an overly packed bar with below average food and booze then this is your stop.  Good luck!

I was brought to the section thats between outside and inside where 4 tables were empty (all same size, 4 tops) and was pointed to the available table (under a tv) i wasnt interested in this table and pointed to two of the other 3 that were open... each one i pointed to was &#34;reserved for a bigger party&#34; funny, they were the same size as the one i was being made sit at ;) 

Egg white omelette was delicious (hence the 2nd star) to add to that the heirloom tomato salad was a pleasant surprise, also delicious! however this is where Parlor gets pretty funny. You guys are catering to a west loop (semi-educated, rich-ish crowd that knows whats up) on my plate i had jam for the toast.. the jam was straight up Smuckers... for real? Denny&#39;s can do me with Smuckers :) dont be like Denny&#39;s.

I confronted the host after the meal, he tried to bs me about reserved seating outside, caught him lying to which he replied with &#34;ill sit you where-ever you want me to sit you&#34; thanks I already ate.

Came here the night that the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup on Monday. We had a reservation, thank god because it was beyond packed, but every bar that night was. They had always accommodated our party prior to Monday, which is why we watched the four games before the cup here. They were also honoring all reservations to the point where if you didn&#39;t have a reservation, you were told you wouldn&#39;t be seated, they cut the line off outside when the game started, and parties without reservations weren&#39;t allowed to stand next to or in front of your table. We greatly appreciated this as we had made our reservations the day the schedule for the playoff series came out, just in case the Blackhawks made it to a game 5 or 6

This place is probably one of my top three favorite pizza places I&#39;ve been to. We ordered the Cheesus, Mary and Joseph pizza after glancing over some yelp reviews, as well as the cobb salad (switching out kale for romaine), Pork-Q-Pie pizza, Sgt. Pepper pizza, chicken wings with ponzu and maple bacon sauce, and the Parlor chicken sandwich. Drinks ordered included the Debutante, gin gimlet, and assorted beers.

Our food came out very quickly. Everyone sampled the salad, the regular size was large enough to be a side salad for around 4-5 people. Everyone commented on how delicious the dressing was, and how filling but light the salad was at the same time. I loved the Sgt. Pepper pizza, my friend said the truffle oil was overpowering for her but everyone else seemed to enjoy it. My favorite pizza however was the Cheesus, Mary and Joseph. Whipped ricotta, white cheddar, D.O.P, parmesan, smoked mozzarella, minced garlic and fresh oregano on a light chewy and charred crust. The perfect blend of garlic, herbs, creamy texture with a great crust. This is my new go to here. 

I was told the wings were good, the sauces were both great. I tried a bite of the chicken sandwich, very generous with the avocado and the house giardiniera was different but tasty. Cocktails were also great- my friend&#39;s gimlet she said was on point, and the debutante was the perfect light, crispy refreshing drink I needed on a hot and  humid Chicago summer night.

I only have 2 complaints:

1. very dark, to the point where we were using our flashlights on our iphones to read the menu- we didn&#39;t mind however
2. somewhat of a small wine selection and I wish they had more reasonable wine prices- they carry a very generous beer selection (a whole menu of beer and spirits) and offer some beers for 5$, but a majority of the wines are 10-14$ a glass, wish they offered more affordable glasses

All in all our waitress was great and very accommodating despite the mob scene of hawks fans, we consider ourselves regulars now and will definitely be returning!"

Since the weather has warmed up, this place is packed at all hours. It&#39;s fun and loud and a great atmosphere for watching a game.

Food: wide variety of appetizers, like nachos, kale and artichoke dip, calamari, crazy bread with marinara and Brussel sprouts, all of which were fair sizes. The pizzas are a little pricey for the portion, ranging from $12-$16. The Sgt. Pepper and Cheesus, Mary and Joseph pizzas are safe bets, but there are more adventurous options available. A nice selection of craft beers make this a more unique dining experience.

Review from February re: service- My coworkers and I went for a happy hour event on a Friday at 4:00pm. We had called in advance to reserve a space for 10 people, which was readily available. However, the hostess would not seat us until all members had arrived. We changed our reservation to 6 to accommodate the people present, and then were seated in a far corner near the brick ovens and restroom corridor. The two tall tables were fine for the 6 of us, but became quickly crowded when the rest of our group arrived. Since it was early enough in the afternoon, we easily could have been seated at a larger table without inconveniencing other diners, but ended up in a corner with people standing around the table. Long story short: make sure everyone is present when you check in."

The chicken, tortillas, and onions were more of a casserole. This place is massive and using the space better than Moonshine did. It will be a good alternative to mediocre Smoke Daddy&#39;s."

Other than that, disappointed. Watched the servers physically pick up and snuggle some of the dogs at the tables, letting them lick their faces, etc. I hope all of you like dog all over your food, because I&#39;m not sure a handwashing covers all of that. 

Beer menu is confusing; it&#39;s meant to show you what they have and will have next, but between what&#39;s crossed out because it&#39;s empty and the few checkmarks, it&#39;s mainly padding 50 beer names to disguise the dozen they actually have. The cocktail pricing was absurd. My friend ordered a margarita, for which they charged her separately for a shot of tequila and then another $3 for mix and ice. I asked for a vodka lemonade and similarly came up with a $14 drink charged for the whole shot and the mixer. I have never seen that crap in all my 30 years. At what place have you ever been charged separately for cranberry juice and a shot of vodka or a whole glass of coke and a shot of rum? Call me crazy and cheap then but $10 for a shot and you couldn&#39;t throw in the mix? That&#39;s Violet Hour cocktail pricing right there, and these are NOT craft cocktails commanding that price. Helllll to the no. Rip off. Will not return."

The place is super busy...ALL the time.  The fact that they even take reservations is amazing so I would say this is a place you come on a whim...enjoy beers or drinks and chill out til there is a table available.  The staff was super friendly and accommodating.  I sat at the bar and despite how crowded it was, felt very welcome.  The pizza was solid.  I had the Abe Froman&#39;s Fave and it was really good.  Loved the crust.  The sausage was nice and spicy and the flavor rich.

Moving on to the beer.  Chicago has some really terrific local beers and I am totally about supporting them but I am a San Diego girl that will NEVER stop holding Stone Brewing IPA&#39;s close to her heart.  My heart skipped a beat when I saw Ruination 2.0 on the beer list and this place bumped up two octaves on the scale because of it.  So many bars and restaurants here have &#34;issues&#34; with how decisions are made on what beer makes it on tap so the fact that Ruination and other Stone beers are available here tells me that the dirty games must not be in play here.  Stone does not #paytoplay

I live in this neighborhood.  I am not tragically hip.  On the contrary, I am middle aged and boring but I know my way around the food, beer and cocktail scene.  I might not enjoy Parlor Pizza Bar on a Friday night but on a steamy Saturday afternoon, I found it to be pretty darn good."

The food at Parlor is on point--delicious artisan pizzas, creative appetizers, and custom options too.  Try the I Feel Like Bacon Love pizza...think a baked potato on pizza form.  Nom.  

I&#39;m a huge fan of Parlors cocktail list as well.  You&#39;ll find something for everyone in your group!   The rotating beer menu is great too,with choices sorted by type. The bartenders are always efficient and helpful when it comes to choosing the perfect drink to start (or end--ha!) your night. 

I&#39;m always a huge fan of places that take reservations and Parlor does that!  They&#39;ll call to confirm the day of and accommodate any last minute changes as well. 

Looking forward to my next visit!"

Service was prompt and drinks came out quickly.  I found the appetizer choices a bit limiting -- I think there were six options on the appetizer list -- but of the three we tried they were quite good.  The nacho bites were very shareable: individually-topped chips that were easy to grab and eat.  That works out better than a pile of nachos that eventually reveal a pile of soggy chips that are only consumable with utensils, at other happy hour spots.  The artichoke dip was good and the bread that came with it was great.  The bacon-lovers pizza (I don&#39;t remember the exact name) was tasty, with a clever combination that included sweet potatoes.

It gets a little loud, a bit tough to carry on a conversation, but I can&#39;t expect anything different on a busy Friday afternoon happy hour.

I would definitely come back again."

The draft list is great, only potential flaw would be that it&#39;s so comprehensive and structured that you don&#39;t know what&#39;s actually on tap currently (not a problem for a degenerate repeat customer like myself). Also not obnoxious $8+ prices for IPA pints. You can get 3 Floyds, etc for $6-7.

Excellent wings! Buffalo (maple sub-flavored) and the Habanero-Pineapple are great. They&#39;re not double-breaded/fried, just a solid size w/ good coating of sauce.

Burrata pizza is the best they have, and arguably one of the top Neapolitan pizzas in the area.

Ambience is great for groups and summertime. Primo location w/ large patio, far less concentrated w/ bimbos than River North, yet not hipstery by any stretch of the imagination. It would be no-brainer 5 stars if they were top-to-bottom as good as the wings, burrata and draft list (ie. don&#39;t order the nacho bites)."

It has an indoor bar area, an outside patio and another rooftop patio so they definitely have some nice area to seat people. The hostess was pretty nice and I told her we had two toddlers with us if it was possible to get us sat a little faster and she did do her best which I appreciated. They don&#39;t allow strollers outside so you have to check those in which we did and got some high chairs for my girls. Our server was very nice and told us about their very cool bloody mary bar with all the extra fix ins, that looked pretty cool if you ask me. We had wanted to order their calamari as an appetizer but unfortunately it&#39;s only on the dinner menu. Bummer! I then proceeded to order the craziest bread for the table and all I have to say is, don&#39;t be crazy and pass this up! I&#39;m still craving about it and it gets 3 stars alone for being so delicious. My toddlers who are very picky gobbled it right up. It had tons of flavor, tons of pepperoni, gooey cheese all over and it didn&#39;t even need the marinara sauce that came with it because it was that good. It&#39;s also a pretty large portion so it&#39;s very good to share with your friends or toddlers, whatever.

Then came the pizzas, so they recommended about one pizza for two people and they all looked so good but I decided since we had a heavier appetizer we would go with the veggie version burrata pizza with arugula and OH EM GEE, seriously, it was one of the best pizzas I&#39;ve ever had. Unreal, like the cheese was so delicate and delicious and honestly after 2 slices I was full, but I probably could have kept going.

I&#39;m honestly shocked at the low reviews as the only negative here is that they don&#39;t take reservations and no one likes to do the long waits if you ask me. But, the food was terrific, gotta come back in the evening sometime for that calamari, the atmosphere is super fun especially if you come and sit outside with your friends and I can&#39;t brag more about the pizzas, they were terrific. I will be back, but hoping the wait time will be a little shorter but now that summer is almost here, I can&#39;t imagine that happening anytime soon."

We chose to eat at 6 and found out that patio seating is first come first serve. They need to add &#34;club&#34; to the name of this restaurant--I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen so many huge dudes with earpieces at a restaurant meant to contain a crowd. 

The place was super busy, but we looked to be only the second party of 6+ waiting for a table, so we were confident a table would open up soon. 30 minutes go by and my party is getting anxious and hungry so we ask how long the wait is and were given the response, &#34;as soon as a table opens up.&#34; 15 minutes goes by and I notice large parties arriving later than we did being seated before us. Apparently they honor indoor reservations when they are at capacity by placing them outside. So much for first come first serve for outdoor seating. A whole hour and a half goes by. By this time my party was both pretty pissed and starving, but finally our name was called. They placed us on the second floor which made up a bit for the insane wait (elevated surfaces are always better). 

We got right down to business and ordered food and drinks. At the waitress&#39; recommendation, our party ordered a brussel truffle with added bacon, a sgt pepper, and a crazy bread. I mention the brussel truffle first because it was so damn good. The combo of crispy bacon, pancetta, and brussel sprouts was an explosion of happiness. I can see why it&#39;s a favorite. The sgt. pepper was a pretty standard pepperoni pizza that was overly oily as I looked at my oozing pizza--still tasty though. The crazy bread is essentially a loaf of bread stuffed and topped with cheese, pepperoni, and peppers. It was as good as it sounded, but I think it could be recreated fairly easily.

There are many things to love and hate about parlor pizza. Waiting for an hour and a half was unpleasant when there was no warning that my party would be doing so--I expected an hour at most since we were the only party standing in line. But with the place of this size, I guess you need to expect some hiccups with how things are run. 

In regard to their drinks, their punch bowl is essentially a massive bowl of ice, with a side of punch sitting at the bottom of the bowl. It&#39;s not the best way to spend $65. The bad stuff aside, on a nice and sunny day, this place is a can&#39;t miss spot with some pretty good eats. A firm 3.5 stars."

I had read a bunch of reviews of the craziest bread so was super excited to try that but it was only okay.  Not bad but not all that great either.  Your typical bread smothered in cheese and oil.

The servers at the bar all had resting bitch faces. She didn&#39;t even say hi, just said what would you like to drink. I&#39;ve notice in Chicago they have quit an array of drinks from beer to alcoholic beverages. 
My BF got goose island beer on draft, I had a mother punch and so did my friend  and my other friend had the white sangria. 

Sangria, too sweet yuck, the two mother punches both tastes like two totally different drinks. 
When we decided to leave I asked the bartender if we could keep the plastic cups and she said yes. So i dumped the three cups of ice in to anther glass. Took the EMPTY cups with me. I was chased outside by a manager, tall younger guy, who grabbed my cup to see if I had alcohol in it. Rude! Didn&#39;t even say sorry! I yelled back saying thanks for chasing me down ass hole.

The good:  Our waitress was awesome, brought us some oranges for Kid to gum to death, we had some beers, service was spot-on, beet salad and pizza was good.  Several other waitresses said our kid was cute, so you know, bonus.

The bad:  Nada.  Goes straight to ugly here.

The ugly:  Their stroller policy.  Seriously, what sort of pompous douchebaggery is it that inspires a restaurant in WEST frickin&#39; LOOP to have a &#34;no strollers&#34; policy on their patio AND in their dining room?  Dogs on the patio?  No problem.  A single stroller in a mostly empty dining room at 1 p.m. on  Easter?  WON&#39;T SOMEBODY PLEASE THINK OF THE umm...uuhhhh....  Well they&#39;re clearly not thinking of the children that are a large portion of the West Loop population.  No doubles, sure.  No strollers which block the aisle?  Yup, I&#39;m cool with that.  Fire codes exist for our safety.

Also, hostesses...if someone says their child is 5 months old and can&#39;t sit up yet, a high chair is not a solution.  High chairs are a solution for children who can sit, or who are currently in a car seat and can utilize the old &#34;upside down chair&#34; trick.  Please stop offering it to me after I&#39;ve said that&#39;s not going to work."

Only downside to this place was when I had gone- the power was out! Therefore, I couldn&#39;t try most of the menu (thankfully their pizzas are woodfire) I was really hyped up to try that cheesy bread they had but unfortunately it wasn&#39;t possible. The pizza options are great- a lot of them contain pork as an FYI but you can always substitute it for chicken or such like I did. Size wise, it&#39;s def a shareable item. My brother and I shared one pizza and granted I did wish there was more of it but I&#39;m sure if you&#39;re planning on sharing getting an appetizer before will do the trick. I do wish the service was a bit quicker (pizza baking wise), we waited for quite a bit but I&#39;m not sure if that was due to the power outage they were having or at the fact that the place was PACKED. They provide great texting service to text you when your table is available and offer valet (although there is street parking available close by).

The location and atmosphere is really what makes this restaurant! Large outdoor patio with covered and uncovered seating, which is open to the inside bar/dining room.

Service:  Our server was really good actually, which was not expected (having read some other Yelp reviews prior to going). She was attentive, split our checks and our food came out really quickly! Our bartender, however, was NOT. 

Drinks: They have quite an extensive draft and bottle/cans list and some pricier cocktails ($12-13 for a Moscow Mule) 

Food:  Can&#39;t argue with the Craziest Bread! It&#39;s meaty, garlicky and cheesy, which is basically the recipe for delicious. I really did enjoy it! The pizza is not top notch pizza by any means, but I did enjoy the Burrata Be Kidding Me. Nice combo of Burrata cheese and greens (tricks you into think you&#39;re eating healthy!) The Aunt Chilada&#39;s Chicken pizza was good and spicy, but I didn&#39;t like it as much as the Burrata.. Probably wouldn&#39;t order it again.

This place is huge. Large interior, just as large outdoor patio and a rooftop deck. They have a large beer selection that they serve in plastic disposable cups, it&#39;s that kind of place. I was not too enthused about having to sit outside in low 60 degree weather without any outdoor heaters. I had the chills all evening. Maybe they use it as a tactic to make people dine quicker and get out.

We had the brussels sprouts for an app, which was a good sized portion and also tasty. We shared 5 pizzas among all of us. This was a good amount of food, but don&#39;t expect to be stuffed. We had the abe froman&#39;s fave, i feel like bacon love, don&#39;t be a gyro, cheesus mary &amp; joseph, and hawaii pie-o. I liked the cheesus the most. The gyro tasted just like a gyro. The bacon love was a little too heavy for me with the cream and bacon grease. Someone said the hawaii pie-o tasted like a pina colada, no thanks. The crust was thin and crispy, neopolitan style. Some pizzas were a little too charred. We shared the smores pizza for dessert. This was ooey gooey goodness.

Overall, the pizza is okay. Crust is decent, but I prefer more traditional toppings. The best part about this place is that it can sit large groups pretty quickly, unlike most other trendy pizza places. I&#39;m sure it will be harder to get a table in the winter when they will have to close all their outdoor sections."

I&#39;ve only ever gotten food at Pizza Parlor once, but it was great food. We started with the monkey bread which was almost like a sliced up calzone. It was a bit garlicky but I loved that there were massive slices of pepperoni tossed in between each slice of bread.

I also got the Aunt Chilada&#39;s pizza with no mushrooms which has a great chipotle mayo spread on top of adobo chicken and a really unique chipotle marinara. It was superb. I would get it again in a heartbeat - although a number of the other pizza options looked very good as well.

In addition to the indoor area and patio, there is also a rooftop patio, which is where I found myself one sweltering July evening. I had come for an event, and was surprised by the selection of open bar items available. Usually it is strictly beer/wine/well drinks at this type of an event, but no, it appeared the entire cocktail menu was on offer...everything from a sweating can of Guinness to Coronas with limes in their necks in a bucket of ice that looked worthy of a photoshoot. I went with the White Wine Sangria (basically  sugar water in a plastic cup with no fruity bits in sight). After just a few sips, I opted for a glass of the Rose wine. I was pleasantly surprised to find the brand is Starmont, a pour that I know and love. At the end of the evening I sampled one of the pizzas that appeared to have some kind of pesto topping. It is a good idea to imbibe carefully as the stairs to navigate to the rooftop area are vertiginous. I clung to the railing and was able to make my way downstairs without incident.

It&#39;s always packed with people both indoors and on their roof top patio. For whatever reason, maybe it&#39;s because there are so many wonderful pizza options in Chicago, I&#39;ve never thought to give it a try.

Recently my company was invited by another company for a lunch date, and Logan was suggested as the place to meet. Boy oh boy I&#39;m really glad we made it happen because Parlor has some seriously awesome pies.

First up, my complaints. The seating indoors puts you on very very uncomfortable bar stools. The tables and stools are high enough that you&#39;ll find yourself dangling your feet trying to find somewhere comfortable. I was constantly adjusting. Not a huge deal but definitely a distraction. Also the atmosphere is a little too sports bar for my tastes. But speaking of tastes, we were there for the pizza so not a big deal.

The physical menu itself is a little confusing to sort out. The names of the pizza are trying way to hard to be funny. The general layout of the menu makes it confusing as to how one should order, and our server didn&#39;t do a very good job sorting that out for us.

Service was a little hands off, except for when the random hands of the busboys would reach in and attempt to grab the plates off the table. Parlor runs a tight ship, and clearly looks to get you in and out as quickly as possible. That&#39;s great for a midday lunch but I would find it irritating if I was there on a dinner date.

As for the pizza? It was incredibly good. Because we had a large group of diners, we ordered several different varieties and passed them around the table. The crust is perfectly foldable and the toppings were generous. 

My least favorite pizza was the &#34;Abe Freman&#39;s Favorite&#34; which was just a bit too saucy and kind of weakly seasoned compared to the others I tried. Still, it was quite good.

My favorite was the &#34;Burrata Be Kidding Me&#34; (oof) which was covered in a tangy dressed cold arugula salad with a hint of truffle. There was a great play in textures, temps and flavors with that one. Warm melted cheeses with cold peppery arugula is a great combination.

I also absolutely loved the &#34;Little Stinker&#34; and the &#34;Cheesus, Mary &amp; Joseph&#34; (double oof!) which both had a SOLID cheese game going on. Just thinking about the CM&amp;J is making me hungry.

Parlor is now on my go-to list for Chicago pizza places to recommend to friends. Awesome."

The food is great! I&#39;ve had the loaded nachos twice and they are to die for. also had a pizza which was good (but not the best I&#39;ve ever had). 

Also... Mike Dunleavey was there"

The short summary of this joint is that that have decent food and poor service. I don&#39;t mean our server was the problem, she actually seemed really nice. The problem was she was rarely around. The only thing worse than a nonexistent server is that they brought the food out as it was ready and not as a whole. Basically they brought out one plate every 10 minutes, and I&#39;ll give you one guess whose plate came out last. The first person to get their meal waited till it was cold, and by the time I got my pizza everyone was waiting on me to finish. It just seems like a really stupid way to serve a group of people food.

As for the food itself, it was good, I&#39;ll give them that. But it wasn&#39;t really good, it definitely wasn&#39;t &#34;I&#39;ll put up with poor service good&#34;. As I understand it, that&#39;s what most people said in their ratings and I&#39;ll say the same thing. 

Was Parlor worth a try? It definitely was. Will I make a trip to the near west side to go back? Probably not."

AMAZING carne asada tacos. They have so much meat in them we really enjoy them
The salsas are really delicious
The price isn&#39;t too bad considering the amount of food you get
The delivery has been early each time

The not so good:

The chips weren&#39;t very good, although we did enjoy the salsa
The guacamole was very thin and felt like it was more of a liquid sauce than the usual guacamole
The pastor tacos were okay, but not great

We&#39;ll definitely be ordering from here again."

We ordered a torta, tostadas, tacos, and horchata from them. The delivery guy gave us our food, but without the horchata so we called the delivery guy, but he didnt pick up. Of course, we called the restaurant directly and told them our situation. 

The woman who picked up the phone said that she would speak to the manager and call us back. After 20 minutes of not hearing from them, we called again and the same woman picked up the phone. She said the delivery guy gave us the horchata and did not believe us when we said we didn&#39;t get it. They even said they would send another one if we paid for delivery. But we didnt even receive it in the first place. We told them that this was ridiculous and her words were &#34;yeah this is ridiculous because you got two bags.&#34; Yea, she pretty much told us we were liars. The delivery guy will probably just find the horchata in the car, drink it, and hide it. Never felt so unfair and never ordering here ever ever again!! All i wanted was the horchata that i paid and ordered for. :(

Tl;dr, TERRIBLE customer service. Find a different taco place that gives you your horchata!"

Stepped into San Jose and sat ourselves. It was clean enough, not very busy, and the waitress hooked us up with some fresh chips and a pretty bland red salsa. We put our orders in, steak burrito dinner (no lettuce please) and wifey ordered tacos. Our food arrived a short time later... A couple things about my burrito. 1) DO NOT CUT MY BURRITO IN-HALF. I&#39;m a big boy and should I not be able to handle it, I&#39;ll have my wife cut it in-half for me. 2) I&#39;M DINING IN YOUR RESTAURANT - NO NEED TO TIGHTLY WRAP MY BURRITO IN FOIL. I get it... If I were taking my burrito for a walk, this would make perfect sense - However, I&#39;m sitting at a table and it just looks stupid for a burrito to show up wearing foil for a sit-down dinner. Once I undressed the burrito I realized it was oozing refried beans like everywhere. It was a HOT mess. I grabbed my first bite of it&#39;s steamy goodness but came up empty for anything remotely textured as steak in mi boca. Tasted fine so I went for the next bite...  Again, no real subsistence or steakiness to it. I finished up and was left feeling robbed of steak. I think it was in there because I tasted it - However, the seem to pulverize the steak to a point where someone with no teeth would be able to suck it down a straw (in combination with the fact that the burrito was tooooo OVER-BEANED). None the less, they do not steak burrito very well here. I would think they&#39;re trying to cut corners and save money - I never really saw a piece of steak fall from my burrito, just mushy beans dripping out.  My wife&#39;s stated her tacos al pastor were average but nothing to get giddy over.  
We probably won&#39;t return to San Jose... until I&#39;m 85 and can no longer chew my own steak. 
Clean place and friendly service earned them 2 stars."

The nachos, burritos, enchiladas... I read another review that said it was dry and as many times as we&#39;ve been here never experienced that.

That&#39;s always the question, isn&#39;t it?!?! Well, let me just start with this I LOVE FOOD AND FOOD LOVES ME. I am a constant YELPER when it comes to trying new food. Running around hungry after the NLC-National FBLA conference award ceremony tonight I figured what would be open at 10:30 PM? 
I looked on YELP and remembered that I had bookmarked a Mexican Restaurant due to the reviews. When I called and asked if they delivered to the Hyatt Regency McCormick she checked with someone and affirmed that they did. She was very very helpful and knowledgable of the food items. She then made a few suggestions based on my food restrictions (no shellfish or red meat), just cheese and chicken. She quickly accommodated me with one of the cheese filled potato MASA quesadillas and a chicken tostada which were bomb.com insanely delicious! 

Now you have to understand something...I am from California and I am VERY spoiled with my mother&#39;s Argentine cuisine and the local Mexican restaurant where I live. Like I said I know food, so you can understand when I say food is good here I mean it is OUTSTANDING! The pico de gallo and guacamole were like no other Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. CHUNKY AND FRESH!!
By the time I got to the lobby the driver was there at the concierge desk--he was quick concise and to the point. It was very nice. I&#39;ve been to quite a few cities-- London, Buenos Aires, and San Francisco--and I can say that I truly love Chicago for visiting this first time and this restaurant added the cherry on the top!  

Take my advice go for the Mexican if you&#39;re debating and forget about the pizza! Oh, all of it including tip and the BEST horchata I have ever had was $25.00. Can&#39;t speak for the dine in experience but man, this place ROCKS! See you soon, Taquería José!"

Ordered around 10:20pm and waited past the 45 min-60 min wait time. Attempted to call the restaurant several times only to hear a busy tone on the other end. Contacted Yelp to get a update and they told me to wait another 10 mins. 20 mins later the food Finally arrives. While I finally got my order. It was missing my drink item it was a little upsetting after waiting almost an hour and a half. The food was mediocre. Have had better authentic Mexican at other spots. 

Ordered 4 tacos 
Intestine was bland
Ground beef and pork were the only tacos to taste decent
And chicken taco tasted really dry

Also ordered a steak burrito with intestines for my girlfriend and she only ate half and said it was mediocre. 

Ordered a horchata as well but they forgot that. 


Side note: been about 40 mins since I ate the food and my stomach is bubbling now.. Sorry but I will not be ordering here ever again.

Guacamole had too much lime and really no avocado flavor.  Queso fundido was oily as hell to the point where it almost instantly separated.  Tostadas showed potential.  Shells weren&#39;t doubled, and the grease saturated the single shell they provided quickly, too gross to even bother with.  I had no choice but to scrape all of the toppings off, tossing the tomato that I specifically requested they not include in the first place.  Asada and pastor had great flavor but the heaping pile I was left to eat them from left little to be desired visually.   The chilies rellanos tacos were a mistake, but for reasons I can&#39;t even begin to understand for such a straight forward dish.  Salsa was unmemorable.  Take a pass."

I ordered from here a few times until they messed up multiple parts of my order. I ordered their nachos and they have just basic nachos and ones that have more toppings. I also wanted cheese on my vegetarian tacos. I called over the phone and specifically asked the girl working if they came with cheese. She told me yes but then realized she was wrong. I had said many times I will pay extra if necessary but I don&#39;t like them without cheese but she insisted since she made the mistake the cheese would be free. Well how nice of her. ...except when I received my food a lot of the toppings were missing, including the cheese on my tacos and every item was wrong. I figured I&#39;d call and they&#39;d simply replace anything they had messed up. Wrong again. I spoke to a manager who proceeded to say he&#39;d bring the toppings only and only if I paid extra for the cheese. What? First of all, the food would get cold by then. Any self-respecting restaurant would replace the wrongly made items. So I ended up on the phone with this guy for a half hour while he told me how replacing my food was not in his power. I got so frustrated I threatened to wheel my butt down there (because I was in a wheelchair at the time) to complain and if I had to I&#39;d call an authority or my bank to have them forced to refund us. He kept insisting his chef would never make so many mistakes, but he definitely did. It was at this point that he finally called the store owner and agreed to replace the food as long as we hadn&#39;t eaten it yet. Problem solved, but not without extreme frustration and the decision to never purchase anything from here again and to inform my friends and family to do the same.

Pick-up and delivery definitely take priority (this would probably be the way to go if you want to try their food), but if you choose to dine-in, be prepared to wait way too long for your food. The wait staff is inattentive and sometimes rude, and your order may even be forgotten. 

My last visit was surprisingly less accommodating than any other. The madness of deliveries and pick-up orders toward the front of the restaurant was unpleasant and actually distracted my waitress enough to leave my food waiting at the counter for about ten minutes (we had already been waiting 30+ minutes after ordering). My chicken fajita (usually to die for) had burnt onto the sizzling pan because it didn&#39;t get to my table in time for me to stir it up a bit. The two previous times I had ordered this dish, the serving size was double the amount, not burnt, and was served with a side of beans, rice, lettuce and some avocado. This time, though, the serving was pretty skimpy, burnt, and only served with the beans and rice (which are consistently amazing). When I asked the waitress about the lettuce and avocado, she just kept saying &#34;Extra, it&#39;s extra,&#34; as if I was bothering her (probably from taking her away from figuring out what the heck was happening with the deliveries). 

Needless to say, I only tipped about 5% this visit. Although the food was abnormally horrible, it&#39;s usually fantastic and definitely worth the lack of service this place has to offer. I won&#39;t give up on it yet."

They have your typical run of the mill food, buuuuuuut they also have some unique items. The masa quesadillas are something I&#39;ve never seen before, simply delicious and inventive. Even better that they are made fresh and you can choose your filling. As a vegetarian, I&#39;m always looking for Mexican restaurants to go beyond the zucchini taco. This place has potatoes, rajas and a few other things. They also have a fantastic juice bar and desserts. Will definitely come back."

Ordered 3 al pastor tacos with cilantro onions lettuce and tomato by far the greasiest Al pastor I&#39;ve tried so far AND there also was a bug crawling around in my food (like a fruit fly or gnat) the two bites I ate before the bug citing was pretty decent but the bug threw everything off

the third time and last time I ever order from them, the order didnt come at all, I called the restaurant an hour and thirty minutes after ordering food to find out that my order was marked as delivered. TSJ reached out to the driver and said the food was delirvered to a woman (not a woman) and that there was nothing that could be done about it.

I contacted the web portal I ordered with (eat24) and they refunded me my money because TSJ refused to do anything more that give me the drivers number (wtf?) so I could speak with the driver about who he gave my food to (again, wtf?)

Okay, I ordered three vegetarian tacos, no rice and I asked if they had the thinly shredded white Mexican cheese, I told them I didn&#39;t know it&#39;s proper name but where I&#39;ve gotten it before that&#39;s what they call it and I gave them an extremely detailed description. 

There was no language barrier because this girl speaks English just as well as me! She tried to put some like...nacho cheese type crap on my taco but thankfully I came in and showed the other waitress what I wanted and she fixed it. This was a call in order BTW. I&#39;m so annoyed I&#39;m telling this out of order. 

Okay back to the taco itself, after I placed the order I realized she didn&#39;t specify if the taco was hard shell or not and I despise soft shell tacos so I called back like 8 minutes later. I asked were they hard shell or not and she said, &#34;They&#39;re soft shell like you asked for.&#34; *death glare* I hate when people tell me I said something I know I did not say. 

I hate soft shell tacos and I would never order a GD soft shell taco. Anyway, so I&#39;m like, &#34;Um, no I did not say SOFT SHELL, I said taco, but I didn&#39;t specify and you didn&#39;t ask. Are they made already?? She says yeah, and since I&#39;m such a nice person I said, &#34;Well, I&#39;ll pay for them since they&#39;re made already but I don&#39;t want them because I don&#39;t eat soft shell tacos and I have no one to give them to. I want to order and additional order of HARD SHELL TACOS.&#34; 

*out of order due to anger* Also, I ordered salsa of which I got three prices for, the first person said it was $2.50 the second person said it was free and the third person said it was 3.30 so I have no idea how much this mystery salsa is. I really try not to argue with people that are making my food because we all know what happens when you argue with them, that&#39;s half of the reason I agreed to pay for the tacos I WASN&#39;T GOING TO TAKE. 

So I get there, we go through the cheese thing, she says to the other lady, &#34;No she said the queso *somethinginspanish* and I&#39;m standing there like...........alright now....with that &#34;she said&#34; crap. So she comes up with my order, in the smallest bag, with this extremely small package in it and I&#39;m like.......maybe they wrap it tight? So my order comes out to $15.07. I&#39;m thinking... hmm... 15? Well, I&#39;ll check it out when I get home...

This whole ordeal took about 40 minutes and now I&#39;m sure that first batch of tacos wasn&#39;t even ready because I stood in there waiting on the second batch for like 15 minutes. So I&#39;m ready to gtfo of there. I go home, open my tacos, no they are not tightly wrapped. They are the smallest baby tacos I have ever seen in my life. I ate the first two so fast if I hadn&#39;t taken the picture for Yelp before I ate them I would have sworn I only had two. 

So I&#39;m stewing in this anger now, I&#39;m looking through my wallet for the receipt and I&#39;m like.....*eye roll* Where TF is it?! So I call them and ask and she&#39;s like, &#34;Oh we don&#39;t give out receipts, we need them for the books at the end of the day&#34;....I am trying so hard not to swear in this review but what in the actual F-word?! You don&#39;t &#34;give out&#34; receipts?! 

So I explain and she&#39;s adding it up and she&#39;s like, &#34;Your total should&#39;ve been around $12.60&#34; and I&#39;m like &#34;Yeah...........but it was $15.07&#34; So she says she&#39;ll call the manager and call me back. So she calls back *shocker* and the manager confirms this price. She said I was charged .35 cent for cheese per taco *Even the three I didn&#39;t get*....the .35 cent I did not know about until hours later because I would have never ordered them in the first place.

So we add it up and it does come out to $15 dollars if the salsa was 3.30....... but then she says &#34;Yeah...the salsa is free but you paid for chips&#34;...... I didn&#39;t even fu***** get chips. I like to eat the salsa with my own chips &#34;Doritoes&#34;. I couldn&#39;t stay on the phone with her anymore so I hung up. I&#39;m going in there tomorrow and somebody better explain to me why I paid $15.07."

I really like the fresh chips that came with the salsa.  The carne asada tacos are pretty good, and I enjoy the small, diced nature of the meat.  FYI, it comes with onions and cilantro, which this muchacho is ok with. The al pastor tacos are ok.

My friend once ordered a ridiculous torta that came with (in order of importance) - steak, bacon, ham, and hot dog.  Well, that&#39;s how I would rank them in order of importance.  He says it was pretty good, so I&#39;ll have to take his word for it.

So I used my trusty Yelp app and found this place. Open until 2am, and serving individual tacos at a reasonable price. I honestly didn&#39;t expect much but boy was I surprised. First we paid $15 for 6 tacos, an order of rice and beans and a large horchata. I decided to take a bite of the chicken taco first and it was the most seasoned soft chicken taco I&#39;d had ever eaten. The green salsa was also delicious!

On my most recent trip, I tried their sopes and I really really liked them..they may have to be added to the heavy rotation list - I had a Sope de Papa (mashed potatoes) and a Sope de Picadillo (ground beef) - the sope itself was crispy yet soft - this is key.  I have an issue with restaurants that serve rock hard sopes - not good at all.  These, were very yummy.  The mashed potatoes were seasoned nicely - also key.  Some places that make mashed potato dishes serve them with too little spices, these were nicely spiced - with a nice kick!  The picadillo was your typical picadillo - pretty good.  Both piled with beans, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, tomato and sprinkled with cheese...  damn, now I&#39;m hungry and no where near Taqueria San Jose.

Credit card minimums yes, but I remember for years when they didn&#39;t accept cards at all and THAT was more of a pain in the rear, so the fact that they take them at all is a step up in my book.

I was one starvin&#39; Marvin last night after a festive yelp event and stellar planetarium after hours party... get it? Stellar? PS- I&#39;m totally retelling this joke in my planetarium review so don&#39;t get sick of it yet. 

First off, I have to give it up to Carol K, who has once again saved me from going hungry with her knowledge of the Bridgeport area and all around impeccable taste. Thanks, Carol- forever and always! 

The bf and I go in and it&#39;s just us, the super cute girl behind the counter, and the cook who&#39;s eating his dinner. We sit down and the girl, who is also the server promptly comes to bring us water, spicy delicious carrots, peppers, and onions, and takes our order. Now, we were both hungry so between the 2 of us we got 4 tacos and 2 burritos... and I have no regrets about consuming this most unhealthy meal. I finished every scrumptious calorie on my wax paper and in my aluminum foil and I&#39;m happier man, er, woman because of it. The veggie food was good and I&#39;ll defo be back but I would have liked some cilantro or other yumminess on my veggie tacos like the meat ones my bf ordered had. Sadly, my veggie ones just had shredded lettuce, wah, wah. At least next time (which will be very soon) I&#39;ll know to ask if I can sub lettuce for cilantro and gives this place the 5 star bump. 

Ooh... and if you&#39;re in need of a good pairing to go with TSJ, I would recommend starting the night out at Bernice&#39;s Tavern across the street, getting good and schwasted, then stumbling over to TSJ to refuel. 5 star night, guaranteed."

The Guacamole was very good.  The chips very fresh and the salsa and sauces were very good.  

The last two times I went there, I first had a chicken burrito with everything but cheese...and then asked them to add onions and cilantro to the burrito.  They did so  and I truly enjoyed.  

The last time I went, I had the chicken taco dinner.  I ordered with tomato, lettuce, onions, cheese and cilantro on flour tortillas.  It was very yummy.  The rice was tasty and the beans were yummy too.

Delicious, unhealthy, and basically cheese, beans, carne asada (choose your meat, I recommend the steak though!) on top of their homemade tortilla chips. I love their salsas that they keep in easy squeeze bottles on the table. The horchata is plentiful and vey reasonably priced. I&#39;ve had the torta, which was only okay."

Perhaps they need a way to distinguish between late night drunken reviews and day reviews, because Taqueria San Jose was marginally average at best.  I can think of dozens of better taco shops all over the city as well, so i was really disappointed after seeing the 4 star rating and then eating here.

Ok, best thing about the meal was the gigantic fresh orange juice I had.  I love fresh OJ, and they had a juicer up front.  Good stuff.  

Second best thing about the meal, the chips and salsa.  The chips were freshly made and their red and green salsa&#39;s were both fairly tasty.

ANd the owrst thing about the meal was the tacos.  If you can&#39;t make good tacos, i don&#39;t care how good anything else is, you can&#39;t call yourself a #1 Taqueria.  I had the Lengua, Carne Asada, Chille Relleno and Trippa tacos (one of each).  I didn&#39;t want to drown out the flavors, when i was ordering, so i went with the onion and cilantro topping instead of the mounds of cream, avocado and cheese that the neighboring table had gotten.  This was my mistake clearly, because those tacos needed drowning.

Lengua - was a thin slice of tongue laid out on the taco.  It had no flavoring and was completely devoid of taste.  I had to check that it had not fallen out of the taco after my first bite.  It hadn&#39;t, it was just tasteless.

Carne Asada - Tiny chunks of fried steak, that were greasy and unappealing.

Chille Relleno - The cheese definietly helped this taco out, becuase it was the best of the bunch.  It didn&#39;t really work as a taco though.  I like Chille Rellenos, but apparently not on a taco.  

Trippe - They fried the tripe and it tasted like dirty leather.  Yes, i know where the stuff comes from in the body, but that is no excuse.  I doused this sucker in lime juice and salsa and i still had to spit it out.

This meal was a total waste of calories.  I knew i should have gone for a hot dog at 35th St dogs instead...

I ordered 2 steak tacos and a breaded steak torta with a reg size horchata.

When we got home, my sister was confused at what she ordered. We paid for a reg size, but it looked like a king! Unless that is the reg size. haha.

I forgot to order onions and cilantro with my tacos and got lettuce and tomatoes. Horchata is very flavorful, and instead of breaded steak torta, i got the regular steak torta. Although the order was wrong, it was still good! They gave me both green and red salsa.

my beau eats almost 100% of the time camarones a la diabla whenever he sees it on a mexican menu... regardless if the mexican restaurant has a pop music centric jukebox or is showcasing &#34;COPS&#34; on their flat screen tvs.

let me just tell you.... never eat any seafood at a place that plays &#34;COPS&#34; or &#34;AMERICA&#39;S DUMBEST CRIMINALS&#34; during an evening dinner at full volume. If you must the burrito suizo is a safe haven...

Like a Friday the 13th - minus Jason (thank God)
Let&#39;s say it was more like a sit-com remake of the movie. Less drama, more triviality.

My dry eyes need extra medication, nobody was available to have lunch with me, I was totally unable to focus on my work, my dog was just intoxicating me (furrealz, dude...) and I was out of milk for my cereal.

Still bad enough, right?

So I decided at night after a killer workout orchestrated by the maniac JM that some tacos al pastor were in order.

Carbs+pork+a touch of sweetness+hot sauce = bliss
Equation proved accurate times and times again.

Taqueria San Jose does the job just right. A tacos dinner will cost you around $7 and will satisfy even the most irritated &#34;mujer al borde de un ataque de nervios&#34; (that&#39;s me, Almodovar style). Onions, cilantro, juicy and flavorful meat, slightly charred, warm tortillas, beans, rice, salad.
Green and red salsa come on the table in squeeze-me bottles.

Careful though:
- the tortilla chips are super greasy
- the TV program is quite unstable on a sports night and keep changing from baseball (White Sox) to basketball (Bulls) to baseball (Cubs) according to the customers&#39; wishes.
Disturbing, but not enough to stop me in my recovery dinner.

Good place to refuel. Far enough from everything else for me to show up in sports gear, still sweaty from my intensive session of kickboxing.

I&#39;m probably the only one who was willing to review this place that hated it. For the past 5 years, my partner at work has done nothing, but rant and rave about this place and how amazing it is. I mean he literally could be their employee because he speaks of it so much. Being that he is a food loving guru who should host his own show at times, my other coworker and I decided to try it out and see why it is that this man rants and raves about this place. Needless to say we are still pondering the answer to that as tonight I can assure was my first and last time at this location. Allow me to begin with what we ordered:

Appetizer: 
Squash- this was pure heaven and the only thing on the menu I&#39;d like to think we would order this again.

Dinner:

1/2 Farm Chicken- it fell off the bone which was nice. It came with fries that were well cooked and crispy. While they praise themselves on everything being grown local, the fries tasted like something out of a frozen bag. I just had to wonder, was grown local, frozen local, and was the packaging just as local?

Pork Belly- we ordered this because they don&#39;t serve the glazed bacon during dinner hours, only brunch, and let me tell you what a mistake this was. The Pork Belly was nothing but fat and dry meat. More fat than meat though and the size was nuts for the price! We wondered how this little thing was supposed to feed two people? Maybe if we wanted to eat the fat it would. We were definitely not impressed with this one. 

Country Rib- this was far from a rib! It was extremely undercooked and was impossible to cut. The flavor was more on the sweet side and it was so chewy that I felt like I was chewing gum. In the end my friend and I decided that my two boxer mixes would enjoy eating this more than we would as they would be able to handle it. I&#39;m sorry, but the moment it becomes better for my dogs than me, it&#39;s a MAJOR problem. They like princes, but I&#39;m the only one who get to eat like a Queen. 

Dessert: 

Waffle with a Cheesecake Napoleon ice cream- we enjoyed the waffle a lot as it was just the right texture. As for the ice cream, they make it themselves, and I tasted no cheesecake in it. Definitely not impressed with the ice cream. Waffle yes, ice cream no. 

Bavarian- we both loved the Bavarian. It was the perfect texture and the perfect dessert. It shared the same texture as a mousse and was simply lovely. 

Drink:
Lemonade- When you think of lemonade you think of sweet. This is not the case here, this lemonade is carbonated water and has real lemon it which made it so sour. I drank it even though I hated it because it was $3. No refills, not saying that I would have done it would they have offered them anyways or did they? I was to afraid to ask. 

Atmosphere: 

The restaurant was loud, had us screaming across the table, and listening into others conversations. It was nearly impossible for us to talk to each other. Think of a high school cafeteria with kids screaming and loud music trying to hide their screams. That&#39;s what eating here was like. Not only this, but I deal with Chronic back pain and the chairs were beyond uncomfortable. It was like sitting on the ground. I actually had to take an additional pain killer because the pain was that bad. If the food was better the pain would have been worth it, but it wasn&#39;t. 

Not only were we unimpressed, but we are still trying to wrap our heads around the fact that the bill was so high when the food tasted so low. Definitely not on my places to eat for dinner again, but hey maybe we caught them on a bad night.

I will say though that I would be willing to try this for breakfast and lunch as the photos look delicious, but dinner is a no go for me."

We started with a charcuterie board, and beer and wine, and went on to an avocado salad, sea bass filet, country ribs, and peach and nectarine cobbler. Each course was divine. I even tried the sea bass although I generally don&#39;t eat fish, and that was good too.

The country ribs and the tempura cauliflower with honey were by far my favorite. The cauliflower tasted like candy and I could NOT stop eating it. The ribs were so tender and also very delicious.

I&#39;d like to come back here when next in Chicago just to browse the store too, they seemed to have a good selection of meats and cheeses."

This area was previously known as a meatpacking and warehouse district, but has recently been transformed into a neighborhood full of some of Chicago&#39;s best eateries. Two of those being The Publican and its counterpart, Publican Quality Meats.

Deciding between The Publican and Publican Quality Meats is a matter of preference. Location is not an issue as both are located across the street from one another. The prior is just a restaurant, while the latter functions as a butcher, sandwich and specialty foods shop that also offers brunch on the weekends.

If you are looking for a more low key dining experience, I would recommend Publican Quality Meats. The X factor of dining here is that there is an al fresco dining area which is great on a warm and sunny day.

Last month, I visited this spot to enjoy brunch on my birthday. Got a spot at one of the outside tables. The brunch menu changes every weekend, but there are many items that seem to be regular items on it. You can find this menu on the restaurant&#39;s website.

Ordered one of the special weekend brunch items, the pork dirty rice ($12) and bottomless Intelligentsia coffee ($2.50). The pork dirty rice seem interesting as it isn&#39;t something that you would find typically on a Seattle brunch menu. Don&#39;t even know what kind of cuisine this is though it seemed Latin American or Cajun/Creole to me.

Whatever cuisine it was, I really like the dish. Primarily because of the pork shoulder which was tender and reminiscent of baked ham. The dirty rice was lukewarm, but the flavor was there. Maybe that is just how it is intended to be served. As for the coffee, it was as expected good since it is Intelligentsia. The service was great as they refilled my cup a couple times during my meal.

If you enjoy meat products and sandwiches, I would recommend checking out this spot. Brunch here is good on the weekends too, particularly if you can score an outside table."

I saw this place last time I was in Chicago and thought it was quaint when I walked by it to the Publican.  Little did I realize that it has some of the best brunch and baked goods I&#39;ve had in a long time.  Couple this with friendly and personable service and non stop refills on great coffee... oh my god, why didn&#39;t I do this the last time in Chicago!

We arrived fairly early on Sunday brunch so we had our pick of the tables but I do see the patio filling very quickly to enjoy the sun.  There is a bunch of inside communal tables and when we left, it was getting quite full.  The restaurant shares the charcuterie/deli and their storefronto so it can be a bit lively with a lot of people moving in and out but oddly enough, it never felt too loud or too congested like many of the other West Loop places.

Service is sooooo friendly here.  LOVE IT.  None of this pretentious eye rolling service that I&#39;ve seen plagued several good places.  They&#39;re so knowledgeable about all the dishes and ready to recommend someone based on my interest and steer us in the right way.  They also share an infectious enthusiasm for their baked good which made me buy a few  that I didnt plan and WOW, i&#39;m so glad. 

We got the salmon club, broc wallbanger, biscuit sandwich, kale side, matcha rice crispy, and their version of the chocolate chip cookie.  Oh plus two bottomless intelligentsia coffee.  EVERYTHING IS GOOD.  Honestly.  The salmon was not overcooked and had a great smokeiness to it which was just enhanced by the bacon vinaigrette,  ... the bread ... oh the bread.  Forget what you think of spongey tasteless white bread... this multigrain bread was so flavourful.  A bit of natural sweetness with a touch of nuttiness on the crust... I can only imagine it from the whole grains and being baked till it had a nice thick dark crust to it.  Honestly... just come here for the bread.  Broc wallbanger was awesome for our veg who inhaled it, the biscuit sandwich was said to be the perfect breakfast sandwich anyone can think of... bacon, perfectly cooked fried egg on top of a soft and tasty biscuit!  Kale side was really good cause of the nice balance of citrus on it.  

Before you leave this place after getting some amazing food... stop by the baked good area and pick up at least 2 things.  You owe yourself to be amazed at their spin on some traditional childhood treats.  These are a little upscale but damn... it will make you reminiscence of the good old days while thinking &#34;I&#39;ve been scammed my entire childhood not eating this.&#34;  My matcha rice crispy was ridiculously huge.  It was so good... the green tea gave a hint of bitterness, strong wonderful flavour of green tea but the marshmallow and vanilla (?) really balanced it out with a perfect sweetness to still make you smile.  It was that perfect gooey, chewy, and yet crispy texture that you want every time out of the oven.  Sooo goood.  As for the chocolate chip cookie... I didnt get to taste it cause the person said they would bit anyone&#39;s finger who attempts to take it from them.  They said it was so buttery and yet nutty (the whole grain flours I&#39;m assuming) while the chocolate bits were large irregular and had a true dark chocolate flavour... none of the waxy fake chocolate chips that is in most bakeries. 

So simply said,  truly one of the best brunch places I&#39;ve been to and definitely would return... even if it&#39;s just for the baked goods!"

Came in on a Saturday afternoon and there was a 20 minute wait. There&#39;s a little waiting area by the counter where they sell different meats and cheeses, and lots of interesting condiments / sauces line the shelves by the window. While we were waiting the meat guys offered us some pieces, and we had beers -- not a bad start. The interior feels more like a specialty meats / cheese shop rather than a deli or restaurant, but most people here come for lunch or &#34;a whole meal of food&#34;.

The seating here is communal, so if you&#39;re not down for hearing little snippets from the table next to you, this place might be a no go.

We shared the biscuit -- which was a biscuit so it was awesome -- the beet salad (also very good) and the parm. The parm was really gooey with cheese and super flavorful. Both times I&#39;ve been here I&#39;ve had it -- what can I say, I know what I like."

HOT CHARCUTERIE OR SAUSAGE PLATE ($18) -- I&#39;m not a sausage person, but the 3 different selections compliment each other.  Addictive.  Perfection to dijonnaise drizzle.  Taste great when freshly served, it still taste the same when reheated.  Serves 2+.

APPLE PIE ($5) -- the best apple pie in Chicago.  The crunch on top is addictive.  $5 is hefty but worth it.

CHAI LATTE ($4) -- housemade Chai.  Woo hoo!  Balanced spice with milk.

This restaurant wasn&#39;t on the planned list of places we wanted to try, but sometimes the greatest meals aren&#39;t always somewhere you plan. 

My friends and I ordered the Butcher&#39;s Cold Charcuterie Plate with 5 different meats. It was absolutely delicious and how great that it comes from a butcher shop. I ordered the spinach and potato soup because it was raining the day we came here. The soup was good, but came in a small bowl. If you come here, you MUST order the &#34;Return of the Gyro.&#34; I had never tasted anything like it. The sauce with the pork belly was something I still dream about even a year later.

C.O.O.L. He told me how wonderful this place is and how he loved grabbing a Parm#2 or a big dipper before he got off work. 

I definitely believed him as I spotted the &#34;Humboldt Fog&#34; and the &#34;Midnight Moon&#34; by Cypress Grove Chèvre (CA) displaying in the cheese fridge. Both are one of the finest cheese I&#39;ve ever tasted.

So I ordered
THE BIG DIPPER: sweet and spicy braised wagyu brisket, green garlic aioli, radish, jalapeno and snow pea slaw on ciabatta bread (4/5):
The flavor of my sandwich was undeniably rich. The side kale salad it came with was amazing as well. I have only one complaint: the brisket and the bread were both of the hard side. Painful to chew for someone with a disjointed jaw (like me).

note: I normally would not order a sandwich anywhere I go, but since the Publican Quality Meats is famous for its sandwiches, oh well. Gotta sacrifice.

Service was fascinating. The people working here are so friendly~ They come around and fill up your glass of water v often. Hurray."

I had the chicken salad with the buttermilk dressing on the side. The lettuce was delicious but I had to do a lot of cutting and work.

The cheese plate was also quite good and the pickled cherries they serve with are as my friend said &#34;so good I would eat a million of them if I could&#34;

Chicken parm sandwich was also amazing.  

Our waiter, Mitch seemingly wanted nothing to do with us after I innocuously asked for a carafe of water for our table. He said he couldn&#39;t do that, okay. Then did it and we drank the whole thing. Brought the check without ever checking on us, I did want another drink but ok, message received. -1 and really probably -2 for service but I&#39;ll round up."

We ordered a couple dishes to share: the porchetta sandwich, a hot charceuterie plate, and also a side of fried eggs cause we really wanted eggs :P I had a Kyle&#39;s go juice to go with my meal (coffee drink). The go juice is made with coffee, espresso, honey, and angostura bitters. 

The porchetta sandwich was absolutely phenomenal; it&#39;s served only on Saturdays after 12. We saw the butcher bring out the entire roast on a large cutting board. The meat is juicy, succulent, and tender. The sandwich is served red onion, pickles, aioli, mustard on a ciabatta bun. The porchetta portion was huge! We had difficulty keeping the sandwich together while eating it. The onions and pickles gave it some acidity to help balance out the fatty delicious meat. Comes served with a side of chips. The charceuterie plate was comprised of 3 types of house-made sausages served on a bed of red peas, pickled cabbage and mustard. They were all delicious; but my favorite was probably the cajun blanc sausage followed closely by the cajun boudin. I forgot what the other one we had was called :/ It all ate quite well with the peas and pickled cabbage and our fried eggs :)

I would absolutely recommend PQM to anyone looking for a casual, delicious meal. Their meat and cheese selection from their shop is excellent and they also sell baked goods as well. They have a small grocery section that sells some nice preserved goods and even select wines and beers. Would love to come back and try more of their delectable offerings."

First time missed the porchetta sandwich only available on Sundays after 11:30am but happily ordered The Big Dipper (sweet and spicy braised wagyu brisket, green garlic aioli, radish, jalapeno and snow pea slaw on ciabatta bread). It was very satisfying. The meat was well cooked with a savory combo. We also had the Turkey Slam, fairly basic but enjoyable as well. The pasta salad and kale sides were also refreshing and plentiful. The second time we saw the porchetta come out steaming and we ordered two sandwiches. The first bite was what I anticipated and expected. Nice fattiness and savory and juicy. Pairs nicely with the ciabatta. Delicious delicious sandwich. A must get if you&#39;re lucky enough to get before it runs out. The atmosphere and staff is also really relaxing and enjoyable. Great music. Attentive bus boys/girls and the kitchen staff holds the same integrity of their service as they do with the product. The coffee brewed is also Intelligentsia. They make a proper cappuccino/latte. Really looking forward to try the chicken parm sandwich next!

Cute little meat and cheese deli with a restaurant in the back. Really brightly lit, and the staff are all very lively and friendly. They have meats in display like a usual butcher/deli, and sell them in bulk. Near the back is a fridge with refrigerated goods (frozen raw meat cuts, cold broth in soup takeout containers, and ice cream/yogurt/cold dairy products.

Little restaurant in the back is adorable - it looks like it came out of someone&#39;s pinterest. The menu is mouthwatering delicious and made me sad I couldn&#39;t eat everything. I ended up getting the 3 piece charcuterie set, which comes with three heaping portions of preselected meats, as well as pickles, picked red bell pepper, whole grain mustard, and olive oil coated bread slices. One complaint is that there wasn&#39;t really enough bread, but there is never enough bread so I guess I can&#39;t fault them for that.

I was too busy already eating to pay attention to when the server was describing the meats (shame on me). What I got though was a mild, thick sliced saucisson of some type, pork rillettes with fig jam, and some kind of spicy pate pressed with dried apricots, all in heaping portions. The sausage and rillettes were absolutely amazing. If I had to rank them the pate would probably come last, but that didn&#39;t stop me from eating it all and scraping the last bit off the board.

Would absolutely recommend."

The Bf and I ordered the 3 item charcuterie plate, chef&#39;s choice. I believe he gave us a shredded duck piece with cranberry jam, head cheese, and another item i cant remember. The meats are served with a grainy mustard, sweet pickle, and a few pieces of toasted baguette.

I would definitely recommended this place for a quick bite or lunch. I saw some awesome sandwiches that other patrons ordered. A very chill place, nothing fancy smancy, great meat shop with lots of other specialty items to purchase. The staff are all very friendly. a 3 meat plate was around $20."

Enter Publican Quality Meats. When you enter the front door, you&#39;ll see a deli with a variety of specialty smoked or cured meats, and on the left, you&#39;ll see a small cafe with some communal tables and chairs. It&#39;s a fairly interesting offering they have, from soups, breakfast plates, to day-old cookies that they sell at a discount ($1).

The two times I visited on my trip were mainly for sausages and takeout sandwiches. I tried their &#34;Da Grinder&#34;, which was a medley of salamis and cheese, on a French baguette. The meats were salty, toned down by the mildness of the cheese, all accented by the crustiness of the bread. Not too shabby. The sandwich came with a bag of Deep River chips and a pickle spear. 

I also recommend getting the duck prosciutto and the green chile sausage. I wasn&#39;t exactly sure how to prepare them, but the cashier/host gave some good recommendations, and it turned out great. One thing I will have to say is that you should avoid the chicken salad. The chicken was a a bit on the dry side, and while they do use quality ingredients (radishes, homemade buttermilk dressing, and black chickpeas), the portion is also pretty small for $15. 

Overall, the place is great for some specialty meats, or a high quality sandwich. I&#39;ll definitely be back to try some of the charcuterie or other toasted sandwiches they have to offer."

Needless to say, we were not disappointed. We ordered the parm #2 and the big dipper with a strawberry Wisco pop and Dr. Brown&#39;s Black Cherry soda. 

The parm #2 had fresh breaded chicken with a rich tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese to add texture and mouth feel. I could definitely taste the difference.

The big dipper was out of this world. We got a sweet and spicy combination that paired perfectly with the delicious brisket inside the sandwich.

Both were expertly crafted with the perfect bread to complement each sandwich. I would also recommend their sides, the marinated kale and the cucumbers, which were tangy and flavorful.

Being in the restaurant gave me anxiety. It was really crowded, people were coming and going, there was no place to stand to wait for our order, there was a baby making noise, just not my thing.

The sandwiches were fine but really not that much better than any I&#39;ve had anywhere else, though the price was a lot more. The chicken parm sammy I had was the same as the one I get at the little Italian deli across from my office, plus a few bucks.

I love meat of all types and grades. I have also been playing with meat for about 15 years now. From bacons to sausages and now dry curing meats of my own. I walked in yesterday morning and immediately I was hit with a meat bat. Whop up side your head. There was a case of dry cured meat and one of bacon and sausages. The super nice young man behind the counter was very helpful as I stood there with my eyes bugging out of my head. Would you like to try some he asked? Why sure just start lining them up. I dug into the spicy coppa and the pancetta. The he showed me a prosciutto that was aged for 2 years in the huge chamber downstairs. We went though the process of how try do their meats and we compared notes till I was dragged living an screaming out the door. He did tell me that they aren&#39;t allowed to take folks down to their processing room but. If you happened to go to the bathroom it&#39;s right there. I did just that and got to take a look see. Oh My God that was a beautiful place. Now I did purchase a good handful of meat to share with some friends at home.

I am a bit confused as a first time customer, however. When I came in with my children (who eat nearly everything), we looked at the deli meats and knew that we wanted roast beef sandwiches, mine without bread. When we talked to the girl at the counter, she seemed a bit confused and mentioned that we could sit in the dining area and order.

When we ordered in the dining area, I asked for roast beef only with horseradish sauce. She didn&#39;t seem very sure about it but then said she could bring a plate of it, no problem. When my daughter ordered a roast beef sandwich that was not on the menu, it seemed to cause some confusion. My daughter, the ever loving negotiator, simply asked that if she went to the deli and ordered a roast beef sandwich, if they could make it and asked why they wouldn&#39;t be able to make it for the dining area. Ugh. Eventually all was figured out and she had a plate of roast beef, cheddar wheeze, lettuce, salami, and sourdough bread for a DIY sandwich plate, but it was strange to not be able to order simple things that were clearly in the deli, in the dining area.

At this point, my son decided he wasn&#39;t going to eat...

All of that aside, I would definitely go back for the deli meats and some of the goodies in the refrigerator. Maybe we&#39;ll take it home. ;)"

Came here for lunch w/ some friends on a Friday and we were able to get seated right away. I got:

-Pok pok gose: letherbee gin, pok pok thai basil, rhubarb, off color troublesome. This was a very refreshing drink that was tasty, too

-Return of the gyro: braised pork belly, raita, escalivada, pea shoots and calabrian chili vinaigrette. HOLY HELL THIS WAS AMAZING. I love pork belly and I love gyros, so when I read that PQM had married these 2 together, I knew I had to come here to try it and it definitely did not disappoint. The pork belly was amazingly flavorful and tender (they also didn&#39;t skimp on the portions, either!), and the vinaigrette tied it together very well. Definitely a must-get if you dine here

-Cold charcuterie plate: we all split this and we all loved it. There were about 5 different types of meat, and they all were phenomenal. Another must-get IMO.

Will definitely be coming back to try other items on the menu. They were out of the Roast Beef when we arrived, so hopefully the next time I&#39;m back I&#39;ll be able to try that."

Until last Friday when my friends and I ended up at PQM after being quoted an hour and a half wait time at Little Goat. I say &#34;ended up&#34; but I really mean we&#39;re soooo lucky to walk in, sit down, and immediately begin stuffing our faces with some of the finest charcuterie I&#39;ve had in Chicago aside from Hopleaf and Gather. It had big heaping portions so all three of us felt like we had plenty to taste. I started with the Pok Pok Gose cocktail which was a super refreshing summery gin drink. My boyfriend got the Bloody Mary which was similar to the one across the road at the Publican, with a Miller High Life beer back instead of a draft (champagne of beers--way classier). 

The guys got the pork belly gyros and they must have been amazing because I didn&#39;t even get offered a bite, and I&#39;m usually able to steal one! I was able to taste the slaw that came with the gyro and it was amazing--light and vinegar based and crunchy. I ordered the smoked salmon plate which had ridiculously good salmon. The only weird thing was the charcuterie actually took longer than our main dishes to come out so we were awkwardly eating everything at once. But geez louise was it good!! Perfect way to start off a nice long day drinking session, and I will definitely be back asap... And probably bring everyone who visits me in Chicago here as well!"

Upon entering you are greeted by some very knowledgeable folks behind the counter, and some cases filled with absolute delicacies as far as me to go. They had a lot of porcine options, including a ton of different ways to serve sausage. The guys really knew their stuff, and it was fun to listen to the different types of sausage and how each one was made.

The cuts of beef looked excellent and there were also some lamb options.

The back wall contained tons of cooking supplies, spices, books, and plenty of other kitchen pleasantries that would make for great stocking stuffers. Absolutely worth checking out if you&#39;re in the area."

I originally wanted to go to The Publican, but accidentally ended up at this location without knowing until I had sat down. Since I was already looking at the menu, I decided to stay here and see what Publican Quality Meats had to offer!! 

Because it is a meat shop, we decided to order the three types of charcuterie for an appetizer. We got the coppa di testa, duck rilette, and pate, and the dish came with different types of mustards, pickles, peppers, and bread. The rilette was surprisingly fantastic, and the bread was toasted and drizzled with olive oil. Preparation and care into their food is obviously seen, and this was the perfect start to our meal.

For my entree, I got the Butcher&#39;s breakfast which includes sausage, bacon, bread, two sunny side up eggs, and chorizo? hash. Everything was a little on the greasy side which is expected as it is bacon and a bunch of meats, but it was amazing. The sausage was so flavorful, and the chorizo hash had soft potatoes and crunchy bits with a hint of meat in the taste. So good. The plate was overall very well structured, and I surprisingly finished everything on there. I also tried my friend&#39;s chickpea soup which was good, but nothing extraordinary.

This location really does serve quality meats, and it surpassed my expectations! They had a ton of options to buy meat and spices at the front, and if I was a Chicago local, I would totally buy their meats to take home. If I do end up coming back to Chicago, Publican is next!"
publican-quality-meats-chicago,Jeffrey C.,skbZO4vHHHA-ejA_BUwKjg,"Silicon Valley, CA",1,1,1,552,30,ReV-xde0pUaao1sdGFQubg,5.0,2015-05-14,"Paul Kahan, purveyor of such fine establishments like Big Star, Avec, and The Publican, can do no wrong in my book. Thus, I was already destined to enjoy Publican Quality Meats (PQM, for short), Kahan&#39;s salumi-slash-sandwich shop and Publican spin-off.

The closest proxy to PQM is Cochon Butcher in New Orleans, an ungodly good salumi-slash-sandwich shop that specializes in all things cured between two delicious slices of carb. Cochon Butcher is better than PQM, but I can&#39;t hardly think of another place I&#39;ve liked better than the Butcher. In other words, putting PQM in a second-tier isn&#39;t an indictment.

My one issue with PQM is what appears to be a lack of communication between the two halves. PQM&#39;s sandwiches don&#39;t seem to take full advantage of the delightful charcuterie available to them. In fact, PQM&#39;s most well-known sandwich, the &#34;Return of the Gyro,&#34; stuffs its pita with braised pork belly, something more associated with Publican proper rather than PQM. Again, I&#39;m not hating. This wrap is damn good, ranking amongst the best &#34;sandwiches&#34; I&#39;ve had in Chicago.

The remainder of its menu is highly rotational, and maybe I just keep coming at the wrong times, but I&#39;d love to see a muffaletta, a pastrami on rye, an Italian grinder, anything that&#39;s just simple meat, cheese, bread, and a couple condiments. Sure, a chicken parm sounds darn good, but that&#39;s not why I&#39;m drooling puddles staring at your meat case, PQM.

OK, mini-rant over. Everything else about PQM is fantastic. It&#39;s a little jarring first walking in, inundated with meat cases with hefty price tags. Here&#39;s the tips. If you&#39;re getting a sandwich or prepared foods to go, go to the middle cashier directly. If you&#39;re picking out sliced meats, head left. If you plan to sit and dine, head right (or to the far end, depending on the door you&#39;ve entered). Once that moment of zen has passed, you&#39;ll feel more relaxed.

For salumi orderers, there&#39;s plenty to choose from, but try to pick the stuff (labeled with PQM) smoked in-house. PQM has variants of just about everything under the sun, and I&#39;ve never been disappointed by anything I&#39;ve taken home. For restaurant-goers, somebody should get the Return of the Gyro, but from there I leave it to you. Like I said, my preference would be to get something with meat available at the butcher, but that&#39;s just me. Whatever you get, it will not suck."

The service was prime, cute butcher with prompt service who gave the life story of the charcuterie in house, got half a lb of skirt steak and a sample of blood mortadella from the meat counter. I would recommend the mortadella, it was such a yummy balance of zestyness and savory! Also got a piece of foie, from the freezer, looking forward to it.

The register clerk was super helpful as well, I ended up getting a chicken parm sandwich, but that was just ok. The roll had a nice chew but the chicken was kinda soggy, I liked the flavour of the sauce but the cheese was kinda uneven.

I would go back to try another sandwich though, and to cop more of them meatssssss!"

The little restaurant is super cute, with a modern homey feel. There&#39;s community style seating which I loath. Half the time the people I&#39;m next to are talking so loud it starts to sound like pigs squealing it&#39;s that annoying. However, I won&#39;t let that take away from the whole experience, it was that good. 

My boyfriend and I decided to split Gerry&#39;s Adobo Sausage, and the Cold Charcuterie plate. I will never forgot how f&#39;ing delicious my first bites were of everything we ordered. 

The adobo sausage came on a lobster bun, some pickled cauliflower on the side. The sausage wasn&#39;t overpowering, it was a perfect balance with the bun and toppings. Intense flavors, but none were competing. 

Of the charcuterie, all 5 were phenomenal, but the lamb roulette, and pate were to die for. I could have eaten it all without a bread vehicle, just meat all in my mouth. 

I wish I remembered what our servers name was because she was amazing. She was friendly, quick, and helpful with the menu. Our waters were always topped off by the busboys. Everyone working there seemed to really enjoy it, that&#39;s always great to see. 

I also have to mention the bathrooms were in the basement, that usually creeps me out. These were not at all creepy. Bright, modern, and clean. Bonus, you see the kitchen at work downstairs, super cool.

Whenever I make a trip to Chicago again I will always make a stop here."

I got the Big Dipper sandwitch and it a ginger beer. They Sammy was very flavorful and I liked the bread they used. I liked the ginger beer it was a brand I had never tried but it is one I would order again. The only downside was the sandwitch was a little small. The environment was really cool liked the deli/ open style seating. The staff is very friendly while still be professional.

I was truly in bliss when eating that sandwich amongst the noisy crowd in my office.

The Return of the Gyro (I could eat five of these in one sitting.)

They also sell Mexican Coke which is always a nice treat.

Cases full of whole dry-aged ribeyes, racks of venison, legs of lamb, slabs of porchetta and guanciale, oddities like beef bacon and duck prosciutto, the best damn smoked turkey and roast beef in the world, and every kind of sausage under the sun. If your mouth isn&#39;t watering yet, you don&#39;t belong in here!

As far as sandwiches go, I&#39;ve had the roast beef (kneel to zhoug), turkey (piri piri pavo) and the seriously kickass chicken parm. All excellent, to the point where I try my best to recreate those roast beef and turkey sandwiches at home. You can&#39;t go wrong with any of their meats or charcuterie, and the guys working the counter are really friendly and happy to accommodate whatever odd weights of meat you want. 

Side note: they also sell Avec dates and piquillo pepper sauce here ($1.50 apiece!) Definitely check out their fresh baked cookie selection as well...the $1 day old cookies are a steal.

To be more specific, I&#39;ve been there multiple times on burger nights and tried their burger and other chefs that had created the burgers. My wife also refers to their Reuben as one the best she&#39;s ever had. It had beef tongue in it which was doubtful at first but melted in your mouth.

We were visiting from Florida, and had done some research ahead of time for &#34;must-try&#34; places. This was on our list based on our research, and if we hadn&#39;t waited until the last day to try it, then we would have eaten here at least twice. 

I&#39;ll get the only complaint i had off my chest right away, the seating is limited - so when the line started to form at around 12:30pm, then the servers got a little more passive-agressive about getting rid of us, so they could turn the tables over. A little annoying, but not enough to outweigh the amazing food, so I&#39;ll give them a pass (Just try to show up outside of what you&#39;d expect to be rush hours, and you shouldn&#39;t experience this anyway). 

We shared a chicken parm sandwich, and a charcuterie plate, which by the way, comes with seasonally recommended items by the chef, or you can sub in different items you&#39;d like to try. 

The sandwich was ridiculously good, we only wish we had the space to try a gyro, and the pork belly too. 

The charcuterie was equally amazing - we actually didn&#39;t get to try as much as we wanted, so we stopped by the deli counter on the way out, and actually bought a few more nibbles for the road... Not that we left hungry by any means, but we have no way of knowing when we&#39;ll be back!

I wish there was somewhere as good as this closer to home. The staff are friendly, and will explain what things taste like / provide examples to help you understand before you buy. If you are foodies like us, be prepared to spend more and really try the things you heard about - they will be as good as you hoped they would, and you&#39;ll only leave disappointed if you don&#39;t try something!

We will absolutely be back here next time we visit Chicago. Our hosts had never been, so we felt like the cool kids recommending a place to them, in their own city that we know they will love."

I live only a 10-minute walk from this place and have just now gotten around to trying it for their famous brunch. We arrived on a Saturday morning around 11AM and there was plenty of space for us. Inside, they are a meat and bread shop that also offers some tables and wait staff for dining in. Outside, they very nice sidewalk seating, which is what we opted for. 

Their brunch menu is small and simple, about 4 or 5 offerings, some sweet and some savory. After contemplating, my boyfriend and I both opted for the Farmers Breakfast, which includes two Sunnyside up eggs, two pieces of bacon, house made breakfast sausage, homemade fresh bread, and amazing breakfast potatoes. This breakfast blew me away. It was simple, but all incredibly fresh and homemade. The house made sausage was a huge highlight, as were the breakfast potatoes that come with a spicy aoili. We really enjoyed the fresh bread served with the eggs as well. 

I was definitely impressed with the quality of the ingredients here, and I&#39;m excited to come back and use them as a meat and bread shop as well for cooking at home. Very fun to have this place in the neighborhood and I look forward to adding it as one of my go-to&#39;s!"

I sampled my friend&#39;s hot apple cider and man was it good. I regretted not getting a cup of my won.

Whether brunch, lunch, or burger night on Tuesdays in the summer it is consistently awesome.

Recently had the porchetta sandwich special for brunch. It was outstanding. Like honestly a borderline perfect sandwich.

Also went to the first burger night this spring. Shake Shack versus Green River. The Green river burger was awesome. It came with this excellent aoili. The entire flavor profile was on point.

Also, everyone that works here is usually extremely pleasant and it&#39;s really just a great joint.

One thing I will say is I wish they would sit incomplete parties, if three people are waiting for their fourth or two are waiting for the their third just let them sit down and order for that person. 

Also, they seemingly run out of glass and silverware every time I come here and have to reuse glasses if different beers are ordered or serve them in plastic cups.

FOOD
Vinny&#39;s Turkey (5 stars): Soft and juicy meat. Loved the tomatoes on it! 

Kale salad on the side (4 stars): garlicky, good dressing. 

Spicy pickle (4 stars): Yum.

Cowboy Cookie (3 stars): Couldn&#39;t taste all the yummy ingredients listed in it like pretzels and potato chips. The cookie was still good though but it needed to be softer. 

SERVICE 
All of the workers here were extremely nice! We had to catch a flight soon so they asked what we wanted to order before we sat down and by the time our seats opened up our food was ready! They really care about your experience here. 

ATMOSPHERE:
If I lived here I&#39;d probably buy all the meats, cheeses, pastas, and sauces here. It all looked and smelled so good! They have large long tables and basically sit everyone together.

The worst part is that the sauce made the bread completely soaked and soggy! By the time I got my food, the sandwich was lukewarm at best.

It&#39;s the purple stuff, bibb lettuce, avocado, pickled green tomatoes, aioli, sprouts 
and smoked cheddar on multigrain toast. Paired with an amazing marinated kale salad and it could be one of the best vegetarian lunches in town. Of course living up to it&#39;s name anything made with meat is pretty quality here too.

I haven&#39;t had anything here I didn&#39;t like. The pork belly gyro is awesome. We love their charcuterie and cheese boards too. Really fun selection of drinks, both alcoholic and not. There is a rotating specials menu that is worth taking advantage of. Lots of outside seating makes it a great pick on a sunny day."

I went several months ago for burger club. They have a nice burger on Tuesday nights.  The night we went last June was a contest between leghorn and PQMs burger.  I had the PQM burger and it was delicious.  

Apparently the burger is only on Tuesday nights which we found out yesterday.  They stay open until 9pm on Tuesdays and close at 6 M, W-S.  

I had the chicken parm sandwich with a side of potato salad and both were beyond what you&#39;d expect.  The potato salad was not creamy and mushy it was potatoes in an oily/herby mix.  I couldn&#39;t get enough.  The chicken parm was on a garlic toast baguette.  The cheese was amazing.  I have a feeling they made it.  

The store has milk, cheese, meats (obviously), burgers, sausages, and other cuts of meat you don&#39;t always see like pig cheeks and cowl. 

Two great experiences at PQM. Will be back."

The place is basically a deli with some tables and waiter service. We came here for a super early lunch -- I&#39;m talking 10AM --  almost a late 2nd breakfast. There was hardly anyone here and we got seated right away. That&#39;s a good thing, because I hear this place gets pretty packed around noon.

We shared the pork belly gyro and the Cocido (mixed meat pot) for two. Both of these were very flavorful and unique from anything we ever had. The bread which they serve with the Cocido is so damn fresh and seems like they baked it in house, though I&#39;m not sure about that part.

The atmosphere was really casual and, best of all, not pretentious at all. The waitress was very friendly and efficient. The food was delicious and had a &#34;home cooked&#34; feel to it.

If you come here, be sure to check out the downstairs kitchen. You can see the chefs grinding up meat and preparing sausages from scratch. They&#39;re extremely friendly and willing to explain what they&#39;re doing. So awesome!"

PARM #2 - Could have ran a marathon eating that thing. So delicious and surprisingly not to 
heavy.

RETURN OF THE GYRO - Usually I stick to Greek town for the real deal but this twist got me feeling some type of way.

We had Return Of The Gyro: with braised pork belly, raita, escalivada, pea shoots and calabrian chili vinaigrette on griddled flatbread, and Cocido: smoked chorizo, braised beef, blood sausage, chickpeas, potatoes, cabbage, carrots and mojo picon.

I love trying unique cuts of meat, and PQM does not disappoint...I mean, heart, liver, and snail sausage (yeah, you read that correctly), to name a few unusually delicious standouts.

You know that distinctive *smell* that most butcher shops have...yeah, not so pleasant, right? I think it is telling that PQM does not have that smell at all and the place is impeccably clean. Beyond that, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and more than willing to answer questions and give out samples. It makes the experience of going to the butcher less intimidating for a novice like me.

Besides the meat, I love their olive focaccia bread, which pleasantly coats your fingers and mouth with olive oil as you eat it. Of course, no review of PQM is complete without mentioning the sandwiches. Their menu changes periodically, but I love the Penelope Cruz which has lamb sausage. My favorite sandwich here, and dare I say, in the city (gasp!) is the Fish and Chips, which is an open face sandwich with smoked fish, greens, crispy chips, and a delicious creamy sauce. All the sandwiches come with a smoky potato salad and a pickle.

Hubs and I went for lunch sandwiches out on the terrace in the summer. Delicious, creative sandwiches, very fresh. 
Hubs and I also went for brunch on NYD. The menu and the portions were small, but it tasted very good, and in terms of dishes and ingredients (as well as pricing) it&#39;s definitely on the classier side for brunch, despite sitting in a deli. The $6 small orange juice felt a bit like a rip off, we&#39;d hoped for a fresh squeezed one, but I guess cold-pressed bottled brands are just very expensive while they can still ride the fad wave that they&#39;re on?

Second part is for groceries at the deli:
It can get quite busy on weekends, and thus pretty tight inside. You may have to wait a little for service as a result. We&#39;ve always gotten friendly service and good advice, and were offered to sample a cheese or two when trying to decide which one to go for. 

Ranking these three types of experiences, I&#39;d say this is best for lunch, second best for deli meats/cheeses, and third best for brunch."

The carrot salad may sound bland and average, but there was variety of carrots and brocolini. By far, it&#39;s one of my favorite salad. I also shared the pork belly wrap with my husband.

Bluegrass Bourbon Soy Sauce ($7.75) Micro brewed in small batches using only whole Kentucky grown non-GMO soybeans, soft red winter wheat and the purest limestone filtered Kentucky spring water.

1) I went by myself for breakfast and was promptly seated inside and then ignored for 15 minutes while they served 4 groups that came in after me.  I was the only black person there, but I&#39;m sure that my being ignored by their Becky server was totally random.  I got up and left.  We can imagine what kind of scene would have been caused if she ignored the old white dudes sitting next to me instead.

2) I shouldn&#39;t have but I tried to come back again today, with a white person this time, raising my odds of getting service.  I also had my 14 pound dog with me.  And their hostess gives me some nonsense about how the dogs can&#39;t be in the patio area and told me I&#39;d have to tie him to a random tree.  A couple of things: a) literally every west loop patio has dogs in it, many much larger than mine b) we have eaten at publicans patio within the past couple weeks with our dog and it was a no-issue.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/roli-roti-gourmet-rotisserie-san-francisco

There was a line - they said it would be 1/2 hours, it was about 15 minutes, and my friend got a bloody mary (see photo it had a sausage garnish!) to pass the time. It was big and good, came with a side pony of beer (Rickenbocker I think).

The tables are tight - just long tables to share. The chacuterie platter next to us was drool-worthy- but how much can two gals eat?  

We got the Porchetta sammy - served with chips, and the chicken Parm - That chicken parm sandwich will haunt my dreams, the roll was the stand out- almost like savory french toast...I would bet the mozzarella was made in house- it was creamy and rich.

DELISH! - 

Tip - if you are eyeing the desserts while waiting for your table. Order it immediately and don&#39;t  wait until after your meal. ON the way in there were about 6 or seven dessert selections, on the way out there were 2 - I missed getting a peanut butter oatmeal sandwich cookie that I had my eye on."

The flavors were uneventful, and the sandwich size represented two smaller sized pieces of bread only a few notches away from being the heel. 

I gave it two stars since I was eating with some of my closest friends that I never get to see, and I was able to finish my sandwich.

As soon as you walk in you will see why everyone loves this place.  You are greeted immediately by all the amazing cured meats, cheeses and fresh baked bread.  Bam! You had me right away.

So far I have been here for lunch and have enjoyed sandwiches accompanied by a fine brew from a local brewery.  I have to say that I am yet to be disappointed.  

The location is small and cozy, there is seating inside but it is communal seating so be prepared to rub elbows with strangers.  In all honesty, i don&#39;t mind it here.  Everyone is so focused on the delicious food, everyone is in their own world.  During the nicer seasons you can sit outside and enjoy lunch out there.

PQM has an excellent beer selection with rotating drafts, mostly local.  You also have various ginger beers and other soft drinks available.

The greatest thing about this place is that if you&#39;re there at the right time, you will see a big old pig roll through there ready to be butchered. They do all of the butchering on site in the basement.  Take a gander next time you&#39;re there and head to the washroom downstairs.

Today I had the pleasure of enjoying &#34;The Great Escape&#34; consisting of morcilla sausage (blood sausage) sliced, avocado crema, aji costeno, marinated onion and ezra feta on yogurt naan.  I accompanied it with marinated kale salad.  It was so amazing delicious.  I am a huge fan of their morcilla.  It is so flavorful tastes amazing.  The feta is a perfect pairing to the sausage.  I also picked up a nice pumpkin loaf to bring to Thanksgiving dinner.  I also had to try their house-made jerky, i picked up 3oz.  It is amazing, you can tell it is some top quality beef and is covered in amazing  spices.

If you have not been here yet, I highly recommend you get your butt over there! 

Do it!"

This was the last stop on my very ambitious Chicago foodie crawl weekend in mid-Sept.  Friend and I came here after brunch in order to squeeze in one last spot en route to the airport and take some goodies home to our beloved ones.  After a quick assessment at the deli, I choose 3 items-- a lamb salami (uncut), the house Italian coppa (sliced), and La Quercia&#39;s spallacia (sliced) which is a shoulder cut from an acorn-fed pig.

Hubby was incredibly happy with the spoils of my travels-- with some good bread, cheese, and wine the following weekend, he declared it the best Chicago souvenir EVER!

And since I needed to use the restroom downstairs, I got to peep into the full-on working butcher shop which was quite awesome to see!

My only caution (in case anyone else is in my situation of needing to get to the airport) is that the butchers are quite slow in slicing.  It took much longer than I expected given that it wasn&#39;t that busy as opposed to by the time we left when things were picking up.  I&#39;m not sure if it was because they were slicing meats to-order for sandwiches in between our orders, but it might be nicer to have separate areas/ functions for to-go vs. eat-in.

Next time I am in Chicago, I would love to eat-in, as their sandwiches and soups looked impressive, esp given the quality of meat I tried much much later at home :)"

Meatheads will love them but veggie folk will be thrilled as well. Amazing salads (side of kale is perfect) big and small...and their fish or meat platters are nothing short of phenomenal. Go downstairs to the bathroom as well to see how the sausage is made. That sounds weird but it&#39;s real.

One thing to note is that the menu changes a lot, in addition, there are events that take place here from time to time so you might want to call or check the menu online in advance. The menu isn&#39;t too big so picky eaters might be put off a bit. I also don&#39;t like the fact that the only egg options with the brunch plates are fried eggs- I&#39;m a poached egg kind of girl.

I waited in line patiently as it was packed and staff didn&#39;t look like they were organized. I figured its my turn in line and I&#39;m in front of the cashier and she ignores me while taking everyone else&#39;s orders. So I ask how long does it take if I just want a ciabatta. She finally realizes I&#39;m in front of her and says with a smile...let me get one more customer. Not even an attempt to go out of her way or be nice or just understand that I have a kid and just need a ciabatta. To be blunt..customer service sucks here if they do not know you or if you are not white. Plain and simple. And to think I see the owner on TV all the time and have always wanted to try his restaurants as I live in the west loop. As I always say...customer service can make you or brake you and it turned away a potential customer. Next time I want no hassle for bread I&#39;ll go to Mariano&#39;s.

When I arrived the friendly guy behind the glass recommended the DEEP FRIED Philly Cheesesteak. BEST DECISION I&#39;ve ever made! Meat, peppers, cheese and onion *drools* wrapped in a crispy deep fried tortilla. It comes with sour cream, fries and lettuce. The sour cream is perfect to cut through all the richness in that sandwhich. It also comes with lemonade and they have different flavours to pick from. The portion is huge I couldn&#39;t finish all the food by myself. Overall great concept, executed well. The only reason I didn&#39;t give this place 5 stars is because the fries suck I didn&#39;t even eat them and they could clean the place up a bit. Windex the widows and stuff. Other then that I love cheap eats and this is one of them. You can follow my food journey @britanysbites"

We saw Baba&#39;s closed at 11:30 so we headed here. Now this is definitely a place where your going for the food and not the ambience. First off there&#39;s no tables. I also think it adds character paying for your meal through the bullet proof glass, the police car parked in front, and the beautiful blue lights that adorn the neighborhood. Okay I&#39;ll stop...  :)

Now onto the food...reasonably priced! I ordered the gyro, but they were out so had to go with the chicken gyro combo instead. Pretty decent sandwich and I like the lemon pepper on the fries. My friend ordered the 10 piece wings. He said they were greasy, but delicious! My favorite part is you get to pick between like 10 flavors of lemonade to go with your combo meal (taste like a slushy) I chose the piña colada and OMG delicious!! If I am back out this way I wouldn&#39;t mind stopping in to try other food items. That Philly Cheese Steak is calling my name :)"

You gotta love the South Side right?

But guess what? The food makes it all worth it. I order their Philly Steak religiously. It&#39;s customizable and always cooked fresh. In fact, everything&#39;s cooked fresh because they cook it right in front of you. No guess work here, Baba&#39;s is legit. Their combos usually come with fries and a &#34;lemonade&#34; which is arguably more syrup than anything...but still pretty delicious if you aren&#39;t watching your insulin levels.

It came with fries and a choice of lemonade (I got the fruit punch) all for under $10! Now that&#39;s a deal! Fries weren&#39;t that good, the lemonade, just straight sugar and ice. 

The neighborhood ain&#39;t that great as you&#39;ll see the staff behind a bulletproof glass and only a rotating box that allows any transaction between the customer and them!

been here a few times already and ive ordered...

super mix philly - super mix is chicken and steak mixed together instead of the usually just chicken or steak philly.. it was good! probably one of my favorite phillys ive tried.. tons of meat and well seasoned! 

crispy mix - it&#39;s similar to the super mix philly.. well it&#39;s actually exactly the same as the super mix philly except the crispy mix doesnt use a bun.. the crispy is wrapped and deep fried.. almost like a pizza puff but a lot bigger! again.. it was pretty good and i liked it but however i do prefer the original super mix philly over this..

wings - i always order my wings fried hard with lemon pepper and mild sauce! the wings is a bit small.. it was just alright.. didnt really like their mild sauce .. 

gyro cheese burger - i feel the burger patty needs more seasoning on it.. other then that.. it was decent..

i also had the strawberry lemonade and green apple lemonade .. thought it was just ok.. its really sweet.."

I am forever on a journey to find delicious halal cuisine..I can not believe that the entire menu is halal! This is music to my ears! It is so odd to tell people that I have never had am authentic roast beef sandwich, lol..but dangggg! I asked the owner where they purchase the meat and he told me and he didn&#39;t take it personal. Several times shop owners take such offense to you asking them about he validity of the halal meat!

Environment - Very cute little shop that is full of students! It is packed with assortments of tea, beverages, a huge menu (beef, chicken, turkey, and fish), dessert, and they also serve gelato! This shop also has a PRINTER! (If you have or are in school at the moment, you know the importance of a working printer!) That is deff a added bonus and what a great way to bring back more customers? Awesome!

Food - I had the Roast Beef Artichoke Sandwich which had massive amounts of roast beef, lettuce, tomatoes, artichokes, dipped in asian dressing and cheddar cheese! This was just delicious! The bread was firm for the purpose of the sandwich, but soft to the last bite! I paired this with Pomegranate Ginger Ale! I can not wait to return to this little place! The price was great..you will leave satisfied!

I came here just for a meeting so I didn&#39;t really have any food but I did have a Tea Latte&#39; which I had never had before it was okay and it was reasonable in price.  

There was a steady stream of people that came through the door and many of them the man behind the counter seemed to know.

It had such a welcoming feel and even as my Pastor and I prayed after our meeting as we sat at the table no one in the Café seemed put off or as if they were surprised in fact they were smiling.  That was the Cherry on the top of this visit.

But, don&#39;t tell anyone because we have to keep it that way.  It was also a setting in one episode of the reality show Chicagoland (on Netflix). The front seats offer a nice perspective of the cafe and passerby&#39;s on the sidewalk.

Only drawback - I order drinks with soy milk because of a lactose intolerance and on several occasions I&#39;ve gotten cow milk.

Some of the best vegan sandwiches ever. Fast delivery. The soy-based cream sauce is THE shit."

It&#39;s part coffee shop, part gelateria, and part restaurant that delivers! They do everything.. And for the most part they do it well.  The food options vary from the boring (grilled chicken salad) to unique international (I had some middle eastern chicken sandwich that was AMAZING). The gelato is pretty good as well. So..if you need a place to chill AND eat something on 53rd that&#39;s not deep fried, smothered, or just plain unhealthy....this is a good option."

I recommend eating there so you can get it delivered to you fresh after preparation as (especially the vegetarian/vegan ones) some of the sandwiches get a bit sloppy quickly with the dressings and such soaking into the bread. I, personally, love their eggplant sandwiches. They are quite large and very filling. No real options for sides for those who want some fries or something with their order, but you can get some chips. 

If you&#39;re in the mood for gelato... oh man! They have some great, original flavor options. I tried a scoop of basil with a scoop of ricotta - which had a great cheesecake taste to it when combined. The server just kept providing me sample after sample with various combos to see what I might like. So many yummy options - I could hardly decide."

I like the Eggplant Meatball, as well as their &#34;Café 53 Sandwich&#34; - which is a simple bagel with egg whites, covered in delicious Turkish olive oil, and sprinkled with mint. 

One note for those used to going to Starbucks... Café 53 does not have sugar-free syrup and a few other fancy things like that.

I stopped into this cafe, which is around the corner from my rental unit, to get a breakfast sandwich and a drink while waiting to meet with a perspective tenant.  While placing my order I was unsure of the options available for a breakfast meal, being that it was my first time in this establishment,  upon questioning the manager about any available options or combos he look at me as if I was speaking a foriegn language.  Despite the rude service I placed my order and patiently waited with the two women who ordered before me as a number of other customers were processed and served.   To make what is obviously a long story short, the manager either forgot my order or gave it to someone else then gave me some lame excuse stating that some items take longer than others to prepare. He soon doubled down and told the ladies who ordered before the same thing after they questioned if there order was ready. Now maybe our experience was due to the fact that we were new customers however we all also happened to be of a different race than the customers who were immediately severed after ordering after us.  Regardless of the reasons for this bad customer experience I will never spend another dime in this location, barring a change in management/ownership and will encourage all my friends and family members to do the same."

At this point we had only been there for 10 minutes. Soon after I closed the door to avoid getting rained on, the woman working came over and propped the door back open even after we explained to her that we were getting wet. She then snidely asked us if we had ordered anything yet. We had literally been there for 10 minutes and were going to order shortly thereafter.

Had a iced vanilla latte &amp; it was made perfectly. My only major complaint was there was no outdoor seating, even when lots of other restaurants, cafes, have outdoor seating on 53rd street. If they opened up some seating outdoors it would have jumped to 4 stars."

I used to stop by every morning and order a hot scone until I gained a few pounds and decided to stop. But after learning a little discipline I would go there on the weekends and treat myself to a scone and coffee and a hummus &amp; falafel sandwich. In the summertime I would read outside on the outdoor patio. It is a beautiful little spot with overhanging trees and sunlight trickling through. Most importantly, it is quiet, and conducive to reading. I miss this cafe dearly and haven&#39;t been able to find one like it on the north side."

What impressed me was the vast selection of drinks and food items. Both times I came, I just ordered tea, but my friends who came with me the first time loved their seasonal pumpkin and peppermint lattes and vegetarian sandwiches. They have these &#34;brownie balls&#34; that I think are totally emblematic of America&#39;s culinary ingenuity. All the sweets and baked goods in the case looked delicious, and they even have gluten-free items.

This is a good place to study. Like Starbucks, you could bring your laptop and copy of Plato or The Iliad here and chug away at your work for a few hours, if you wanted a change of scenery from the libraries on campus.

Service is friendly, too. In fact, you can request a card that you give to the cashier guy every time you buy a drink; on the tenth visit, your drink is free.

It&#39;s not as if the place was all that busy.  Also, the panini took a very long time to cook--which would seem to indicate that they had not turned on the panini maker (which you&#39;d think they would have by 11:30AM).  Another customer looked at foods in the display cabinet several times, but it took a third visit to the area until someone asked if they could help her.

It&#39;s impossible to carry on a good conversation or have any sort of meeting, because of the music situation.  Everyone I know who comes here brings ear plugs ...

Start with the cheese balls for an app, sweeter and lighter than your average crab rangoon. Then get the jalapeño spicy tuna cheese. I know cream cheese in sushi is so Americanized, but that&#39;s because it&#39;s delicious :)

The white ocean roll is great, and you can&#39;t go wrong with the sashimi. So fresh! I&#39;ve yet to try the ramen but I&#39;ll be back next week to give it a shot.

Kameya has some of the best nigiri pieces in the city. The salmon toro and unagi are delicious and very fresh. The rolls are also very good - Sushi Paradise is a favorite. Definitely ask about the ramen too - the Kameya Ramen with BBQ pork belly is outstanding! And they now serve ramen all day. Some of the sushi pieces may cost slightly on the higher end but that is because the quality and freshness of the fish is that high.

we ordered the 911 salmon roll as we were curious to see what this 911 sauce is, but it is pretty much just like sriracha sauce

the house special roll and the ninja turtle roll is nothing special, ingredients are fresh, flavor is nothing exceptional

the ramen is such small portion, but we loved the broth!! and i love how they have a lot of different veggie in it, healthy!

I found interesting that they had this 10$ ramen &#34;appetizers&#34; which are way larger than an appetizer size. 

The plating is really cute. The portions overall are not very big, they are quite small actually but they are nicely plated and the fish tastes good! 

The drinks list is perhaps the worst thing. I tried a white wine which was really bad... I felt it was a cheap 5$ store wine... and I still paid a glass 9$. I think that for the caliber of this restaurant it would be better if it was BYOB.

The decor is very minimal and inviting.  The service is friendly and warm, by a local family that lives in the neighborhood.  I&#39;ve gone to Kameya 5 times now and totally love it! 

For starters, definitely try the Kameya balls.  They&#39;re these lightly sautéed cheese balls filled with cream cheese (check the picture). They&#39;re soooo amazing.  Definitely try the Tuna Tartare Tower.  The bread sticks and the sauce it&#39;s served with is absolutely fantastic~ I always ask for an additional side of the sauce to mix into my ramen.  


Everytime I&#39;ve eaten here it&#39;s to get ramen.  The seafood ramen is to die for, it&#39;s $17 bucks and literally worth every penny.  It&#39;s jam packed with clams, oysters, plenty of shrimp and even a generous cut of some very tender salmon.  

Some key notes:
**If you&#39;re going on a weekend, definitely make reservations.
**Kameya ramen is miso based, which makes it light by nature.

We went on a Saturday at 6 and called for a reservation. I would definitely call ahead since there are only about 6-7 tables. The spot definitely seemed family owned and the two servers seemed to be Korean moms, whom were very nice.

It states that they are a Japanese and Korean fusion restaurant, but it&#39;s more like they offer Japanese and Korean food (nothing fusion between the two cuisines).  The restaurant is extremely small with only about 6 tables, so I would highly recommend making a reservation.

For food, we decided to order a bunch of different items to share:

Tuna-Tar Tar Tower: spicy tuna, masago, and avocado served with flour chips and sweet chichim sauce.  This was one of the best tuna tartare I have eaten in a while.  It had the right amount of spiciness, but what put it over the top were the homemade flour chips.  The chips were light and airy, but still really crispy.

Gyoza - Japanese style pork and vegetable dumpling.  These dumplings were small, but still full of flavor.  The exterior of the dumplings were fried perfectly to give it a slight crisp, but the interior was still soft and chewy. 

Kameya Ramen - bbq pork and vegetables with Japanese style noodles.  If you are looking for authentic Japanese ramen, this is not the dish for you.  Japanese ramen is usually hearty and full of flavor; this ramen was light and &#34;healthy&#34; tasting.  This is not saying this was a bad dish.  I appreciated this ramen for what it was: light taste, lean pork, and not so oily broth.

Beef Bibimbob - beef, rice and vegetables with hmaya soy dressing and spicy sauce.  The flavors of this dish worked really well with each other, but I thought the rice was a tad bit mushy for my liking.  Especially after I put the sauce on, I felt like I was eating wet rice which in my culture is a huge no no.

We ordered three different makis to share: orange moon (unagi, tempera, avocado, and cucumber topped with salmon, green tobiko, wasabi mayo, and unagi sauce), salmon avocado (salmon, cucumber, avocado, and mayo topped with masago), and Godzilla (cream cheese, unagi, shrimp, cucumber, and avocado with tuna, wasabi mayo, and unagi sauce on top).  These were probably one of the worst rolls I have ever eaten.  Yes, even worse than buffet style makis.  The fish in each roll were extremely salty that it overpowered the whole roll.  What were they trying to mask with the heavy hand of salt?  Maybe the fish wasn&#39;t fresh.

Overall, the food was split.  We enjoyed the appetizers and the ramen, but everything else was a huge disappointment.  The service wasn&#39;t extremely on par either.  They were nice, but not really attentive.  I don&#39;t really recommend you to come here unless you want to only snack on appetizers and have mediocre service.  Also, since the place is so small, everything felt cramp and you can hear conversations from other tables."

That tuna tartare tower is still my favorite thing here. And really delicious each time.

But this is probably the worst bibimbop I&#39;ve had in Chicago... and for like 2x the price of literally every other Korean place around town. Normally, bibimbop has a variety of vegetables, each seasoned and maybe cooked to create a harmony of flavors and textures when everything is mixed together. At Kameya, none of their vegetables have flavor, and their proteins are always dry. Maybe you&#39;re supposed to drown it in sauce.

Their sushi is pretty fresh. The rolls are really tiny. I have gotten the bulgogi a few times since then too, and it&#39;s the same problems every time (see previous review). At last they&#39;re consistent.

Friends of LP, I swear there&#39;s better Korean/Japanese food in this city :("

My first time here was with my husband and couple of friends. We had a great time there. Service was great and everything we ordered were so good. No disappointment at all. 

Second time I called for to go and wanted to bring it over to my cousin&#39;s house. I ordered a beef ramen, pork ramen, bibimbap, cheesy balls, and 4 different rolls. With traffic going back, it took me about 30 mins to sit down and enjoy the meal. 

Unlike other ramen that I picked up from other restaurants before, kameya putted the broth and the noodle in the same container, when I got home, it was all saggy and mushy.... Just doesn&#39;t look nor taste good at all. 

Then comes to the bibimbap, it was so salty... And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that authentic... For $17 I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it at all... I&#39;ll rather go to Korean restaurant for better and cheaper bibimbap.  

Didn&#39;t have too much expectation on the cheesy balls since its fried and they put them in an air tight container, so they all got mushy and soft after I opened the box. Maybe they should consider changing the way they pack their to go food. 

Then the rolls... They were so sweet... The orange moon and dynamite were the same rolls I ordered during my first visit. But this time they were just gross, so much sauce on the bottom. In fact, I think those were some of the worst sushi rolls I tried in many years. 

Finally.... Sanitation... After eating that meal, my cousin, my sis and I all ended up having upset stomach and ended up going to the bathroom all night. 

I still give it two stars, just cuz I liked it so much during my first visit. Maybe they are only good for dine in. I&#39;ll never order to go from this again."

First, this place is extremely small! There are only 5-6 tables and You will basically sit back to back to people at the other table. Kinda suffocating. 
Second, the food was just ok. We had tuna tartar for appetizer. The tuna didn&#39;t taste fresh and the chips coming with it were extremely oily. The sushimi pieces didn&#39;t taste that fresh either and lacks variety. The red dragon roll was just an average...
Third, the waitress was not friendly at all. There was a misunderstanding during ordering. So we didn&#39;t get the dish we wanted at first. That was ok, but the waitress&#39;s face turned really angry and  sounded blaming. That doesn&#39;t feel good. to be fair, the chef was friendly and redid our dish. However we would have felt more appreciated as customer if the waitress could responded in a more peaceful and friendly way at first."

I walked in here on an impromptu date with my future wife and I was in total sticker shock with the sushi prices.   $14-$17 for 8 piece roll?  Seriously?   No thanks.    

I begrudgingly went ahead with the dinner and I was seriously not impressed at all with the quality or quantity of these $15 rolls.  If you are going to charge $5-$6 more per roll than other places, the fish better be darn good.  Welp, Yelp, it wasn&#39;t.  I&#39;ve had the opportunity to enjoy sushi all over the world, and the fish here at Kameya is on par with the Walgreees on Michigan Ave.  The rolls weren&#39;t even that special - sort of the same old humdrum stuff you see all over the place.  Don&#39;t tell me a damn shrimp tempura roll should cost you $16 - that&#39;s just ridiculous.  Rolls are not special - I can&#39;t even understand how they justify the prices considering how small they were, they were so tiny!.  

I didn&#39;t try any of the other food options, just the sushi.  Dont come here for sushi, else save your pennies. I&#39;m honestly shocked by all the GREAT reviews of this place.  I was expecting to be blown away, but I came up limp.   I won&#39;t be back, that&#39;s for sure.

We spaced our food out, ordering one item at a time and everything came out perfect and quickly. We started with oysters paired with sake. Then the tuna tower, it was amazing and this is coming from someone who has tuna tar tar almost everywhere it&#39;s offered. We had hirofish in ponzui sauce, the fish was excellent! next was the spicy tuna salad. It has a great kick with amazing flavor and we paired that with pinot grigio. We also tried bulgogi whichj did not disappoint. The server and busser where nice, efficient and attentive. They overheard us discussing the cheese balls and gave us each one for free. By the time we were done we were so full and had to pass on their famous house made ice cream....They brought it anyway, FOR FREE!
I would suggest this place to anyone with a pallet for seafood and/or spicy flavors, or willing to think outside the box."

My friend and I tried the Bibimbap because the sign listed it as a top 25 must-try from Huffington Post, and it was superb.  I had mine with brown rice and tofu, and the sunny-side up egg on top made the dish even more delicious.  The serving size was plentiful.  The dish was $18 but worth it, in my opinion.  The restaurant is a little small and can only seat maybe 30 people total, so it&#39;s cozy but still a fun atmosphere.  The serving staff was also friendly.

There are very few restaurants that create unique dishes that earn a spot on my cravings hitlist--the Tuna Tower is one of them. When the hankering comes it must be satiated. We&#39;ve never been disappointed with the rolls, and the bibimbop is tops!

Only a family-owned business is with this level of hospitality and care. After only a couple of visits, we were recognized and treated with a new saki on the menu. They have been known to giggle when I inevitably hit my head on one of the paper lamps, like old neighbors. I forgive them :)"

How weird...) But we decided to stay and try since it has 4.5 star reviews on Yelp.

Miso soup was OK. We got Galbi for appetizer, it was well seasoned but under cooked so it tasted really fatty and meat sticking to the bone. The sauce for Kameya Cheese Balls was good but the batter had no flavor. We also got the Salmon Paradais, which came with too much spicy mayo. The worst was the Spicy Salmon salad, which came last (?!). The lettuce looked like it came out of a bag, and the salmon tasted really fishy even with all the spicy mayo on it and made me feel like throwing up. We didn&#39;t eat the rest of the dish.

Maybe we came on a bad day. What&#39;s saving me from giving a one star is that the people working there were very nice. The lady took the salmon salad off our bill after we said we didn&#39;t like it, but sorry I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going back."

- The ambiance was lovely and the lighting was romantic.  +1 star.

- My mom came to dinner late and inconvenienced everyone.  It was somewhat annoying.  -1 star.

- The rolls and edamame we had for appetizers were delicious and satisfying. +1 star.

- When we were fighting with politeness over who was going to pay the bill, the waitress was confused and didn&#39;t know what to do.  -1 star.

Pork belly buns- moist bun, super tender and grilled meat and sweet sauce. Korean pickles adds a refreshing and tangy flavour, great idea. Verdict: would order again

Kameya ramen - soy, miso broth not too salty and overwhelming, same pork belly as the buns I think but just as good. Bamboo shoots were surprisingly soft. Only drawback was the hardboiled egg (-1 star) not up to the traditional ramen standard (the egg was just a typical hardboiled one). Noodles tasted standard but good. 

Homemade almond ice cream - definitely had a unique taste not found in store bought kinds, good balance of sweetness and creaminess. Change flavours daily! 

Service: exceeded expectations, friendly, made conversation with us as we waited for the food. Allowed the buns (normally a dish of 2) to be modified to 3 so we all got one. Regularly checked in to see if the food was okay. Offered complimentary Kim chi. 

Environment: very intimate and perfect for a date with Christmas lights on a dark ceiling (so perfect for 3 guys Lol). Small place though! Probably only fits about 15 people comfortably. 

Verdict: if you tried Wasabi already and want something new and a different kind of good, have a visit. Slightly on the pricier side but I believe it was worth it (20$ before tip)

It&#39;s a great find!

Kameya is such a charming little neighborhood joint. It&#39;s very small--only 6 or so tables--and is really better for couples than groups. Though, a group of 6 came in while we were there--without a reservation--and the hostess happily arranged tables so that they could be comfortable.

The atmosphere is almost--dare I say--romantic? Not usual for a sushi joint!

The service and food were great. The miso soup was really fresh and flavorful--didn&#39;t taste like the run-of-the-mill stuff you&#39;d expect at every Japanese restaurant.

We got a few rolls and some nigiri. All was fresh and delicious. I want to try the ramen next, as it sounded very good.

The only reason I&#39;m giving a 4 instead of a 5 is because I wish there was a little more variety on the menu. They had 12-15 rolls, but they almost all had salmon, tuna, shrimp, or crab. I would&#39;ve liked to have seen some other fish options, but maybe that&#39;ll come later.

Oh! And this was the cheapest sushi dinner we&#39;ve had in the city. Came in under $50 for 3 rolls, 4 pieces of nigiri, 2 miso soups, and an edamame. Not bad for the city.

Definitely would recommend this spot, especially if you&#39;re in the area."

I&#39;m vegetarian and the ramen came with lots of veggies which I really enjoy. Unfortunately, I did specifically ask for an egg, which for some reason wasn&#39;t brought with my ramen. I&#39;m willing to overlook this though becaue the staff was so friendly and even stayed open for us when we came 15 minutes before closing time. The restaurant isn&#39;t very large but it&#39;s cute. Great for a casual date or an outing with friends. Food was prepared quickly, although that could have been because we were the only ones in the restaurant and the staff likely wanted to go home. Although honestly they didn&#39;t act like it, they seemed happy to have us. The restaurant is nearby and I&#39;m likely to go again if I need ramen especially after 10 PM when other ramen restaurants are closed."

The sushi was good, but the ramen was...mediocre at best. I went here last night with my boyfriend and I was excited because I had heard that this place was really good. We split the dynamite roll and each ordered the Kameya ramen. We also ordered a bottle of Malbec wine. The sushi was actually pretty good and you could really taste the shrimp and crab that was in it. The wine was also pretty good and I felt like it was a decent price ($32 for a bottle). The ramen though...I don&#39;t know. It tasted smoky, but really plain. The broth was bland, and the veggies didn&#39;t add much flavor either. The pork wasn&#39;t bad, but not great either. The egg was good though and it was cooked perfectly. Other than that, the ramen was neither delicious or memorable.

The service was really good though and they were very kind.

Overall, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d come back for the ramen, but I&#39;d like to come back to try the buns and I&#39;d come back again for the sushi."

The restaurant is really small, almost claustrophobic, if that&#39;s not your thing then don&#39;t go! However, if you do decide to try it. The restaurant has a variety of sushi and sashimi choices which while I didn&#39;t try any, my friend said it was yummy.

The ramen was definitely only mediocre. The broth was a simple clear broth, not the usual creamy tonkotsu I prefer. There were a lot of noodles. The pork belly was smokey, but not flavored completely. Definitely a light-er tasting ramen. I don&#39;t think I would come all the way to Lincoln Park for it ever again, but if I were in the neighborhood, it&#39;s a great place on a cold night."

This is a family operation and they get to know you and your family. Daily specials are presented beautifully. Primarily Japanese but with a few Korean dishes thrown in. Fantastic ramen and bi bum bop. Tuna tower and fresh nigiri specials are great. Price point very reasonable. And service is lightening fast. Lots of little touches- Dishes and glasses come out cold. They have a few outdoor tables. Saw Grant Atchaz there the other day- I read that this is a favorite place chefs like to go on their day off. Highly recommend.

I stopped in to grab a quick dinner while waiting for an alderman debate to start across the street and was incredibly pleased.  Was about to get the pork belly ramen but asked the waitress what the most popular item was, and she said the beef ramen.  The beef was incredibly tender and flavorful and once the ramen was gone I played &#34;find the beef&#34; until I&#39;d extracted every single scrap left.  

So delicious it completely offset the shame of eating dinner alone on a Tuesday :-/"

I placed an order to go last night for my family and couldn&#39;t have been happier. Kameya is a great, tiny little sushi place. On busy nights, I can definitely see myself just getting something to go because the space only holds about 7-8 tables. Our order was done super quickly and the portion sizes were very reasonable. 

We ordered the 911 shrimp roll, the mango martini roll, the red moon roll, gyoza, and some of the best miso soup I&#39;ve ever had. We only ordered one soup for my sister and I was PISSED i missed out on one for myself. Won&#39;t make that same mistake and neither should you. Gyoza was also perfect and I&#39;d order it again. 

I loved the 911 shrimp but that shit is hot. I love spicy so that&#39;s fine, but it was hot even without wasabi. The red moon roll was good, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d order it again. The mango martini is sweet, but in a good way. A different take on sushi than I&#39;ve had but I appreciated the creativity. I saw a bunch of people with the tuna tartar special and it looked amazing. If I&#39;d know about it ahead of time, I&#39;d have gotten one of those too."

In all fairness, It was a busy night, we had reservations but we still had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table for 2. It took a bit for the food to come but as I said before it was delicious. 

The owner clearly needed the table and tried to take the food from us before we were done, twice. That&#39;s the reason for the 3 star rating. Bottom line, great food bad service."

Hands down BEST ramen I have EVER had. Oh myyy goodness. My friend and I got the Kameya Ramen and Beef Ramen, and they were both so delicious. The bbq pork in the Kameya Ramen was so creamy and buttery and the bulgogi in the beef ramen was so flavorful and tender. The soup was simply the best broth and was so flavorful, but not salty. It is around $15 for each bowl, and IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY because of its extremely high-quality and generous portion (the bowl is seriously huge). They also have a wide selection of other foods including special rolls, but we weren&#39;t able to try them. If you eat here, you must try the ramen!!"

This place wasn&#39;t far from our hotel and we like neighborhoody restaurants. After reading all the great reviews, I figured we couldn&#39;t go wrong. This place is cozy and small and had a nice vibe.

I got the Kameya Ramen and my husband ordered the Nabeyaki Udon. We both loved our soups. The pork in my ramen was perfect. It really hit the spot. On the menu, I noticed that my husband&#39;s udon was supposed to have chicken in it, but when it came out, it had tofu in it instead. I told him he should complain, but fortunately, he really likes tofu a lot. I think it&#39;s a misprint in the menu. They should fix that. I really wanted to say something, but my husband told me not to say anything because he was happy with his soup.

For dessert, we got almond and mango ice cream. They were both excellent, but I thought the almond was better. They were so so good!

I would definitely come back again the next time I&#39;m in Chicago. I want to try some sushi rolls and other dishes on their menu. Everything sounded good."

Tempura shrimp appetizer (2/5) - batter was not as crunchy as I like, a little oily, but the shrimp was good. The dipping sauce was a little watery and could have been more bold. 

Pork bbq ramen (~$11 &amp; 3/5) - really good broth, not too salty. Noodles and veggies had a good flavor and consistency. It&#39;s a pretty big portion. I&#39;m still not on the ramen bandwagon though. I might be over trying to figure out what all the hype is about. 

Bulgogi (~$13 &amp; 5/5) - yummmmmmmmmm. The flavor explodes in your mouth. All of the veggies are soaked in the sauce but is perfect with a spoonful of rice. Yum yum yum.

A little pricy. I&#39;d come back for the bulgogi but probably not the ramen. Service is friendly."

The reflection of the light on the surface of the soup almost blinded me. Ha just kidding. The presentation of it was great and made me want to start eating even before instagramming it. noodle was perfectly boiled. And it&#39;s a mild dish for people who do not enjoy spicy dishes. I am guessing the beef was grilled with some kind of sauce? But it was just delicious. I finished everything including the soup by the end. I also had some rolls along with the ramen. The portion was perfect and the taste kept up with my high expectation of rolls in general. Despite many dishes on the menu, every dish I&#39;ve had was overall good. The restaurant is cute because of its small size and neatness. I really liked the interior design. I totally recommend this place to go with another person due to its small size.

Get the tuna tower! It&#39;s amazing now I could eat the entire thing (which is large!) by myself!!

The cheese balls are like their take on crab Rangoon and they DO NOT disappoint!!!  There is actual crab in them and so fresh and yummy!!!

The shasimi platter was good but not outstanding. 

Kaymeya ramen was delish!! The pork belly had great flavor and the broth was delish!

911 shrimp tempura roll was great the kaymeya special spicy sauce was yummy!!!!

Everything from the texture of the noodles, to the light and clean-tasting but warming broth, to the charred smoky succulent slivers of pork belly is just spot on. It is a bit on the pricier side - about $13 for a bowl - but considering the quality of the dish and the portion size (it&#39;ll fill you up for sure) it&#39;s well worth the price. I say this cautiously, but this place serves up some of the best ramen I&#39;ve had.

But ramen is not all. The menu at Kameya boasts a fair selection of other dishes you can choose from. If you couldn&#39;t get enough pork belly from the signature ramen, there&#39;s always the pork buns - the closest we can get to Momofuku here I guess - which come with a crisp refreshing cucumber salad and a sweet and savory hoisin sauce. Absolutely delicious. 

Then there&#39;s the &#34;cheese balls&#34; which I suppose is their take on a crab rangoon, which is rich and sweet but umami at the same time with the creamy interior but crisp casing fried to perfection. But honestly, my favorite part of this dish is the citrus sauce they drizzle over it. I&#39;m still trying to figure out what it is - they simply call it &#34;french sauce&#34; - but it has notes of that honey citron tea you can get from Korean markets. Gotta figure out how to recreate it. 

If I had time to go over all of their menu items I would, but I will just say that I have never ordered anything that didn&#39;t taste delicious. My only complaint about this place is that it closes way too early. It would be the perfect place for a late-night ramen run with the GF. We can still hope though. 

 If you are in the area, stop by! A bowl of ramen is always what the doctor ordered."

We ordered the beef ramen along with 3 rolls between the two of us: the Dragon roll, the Red Moon, and the Italian Roll.  Everything was delicious and the sushi tasted fresh, but I hesitated to give it a 5 star  review because I wasn&#39;t blown away, so to speak. I will go back for sure, and may update my review again after we try some more rolls!! 

One note- I was primarily expecting to be blown away by the dragon roll, as it is usually a favorite of mine, and while it was good, it only had 5 (too large to fit in your mouth whole) pieces- two of which were GINORMOUS fried end pieces stuffed with cream cheese (see photo).  I only bring this up because we tend to go to sushi with another couple of friends, and this odd number (and weird end pieces) makes it tough to share without having to buy two expensive rolls that are the same...

Overall, still some good quality food.

P.s. The place is tiny, so make a reservation!"

So this whole place is pretty cramped, and the bathroom does not have heat, so for those who plan on spending a while in the bathroom, be forewarned especially in the bitter Chicago Winter.
Ordered the Kameya ramen, we basically came here because we wanted Ramen. There was a different ramen place we wanted to go to but we were already at the Warby Parker on W Arimitage and this place is only .9 mi away so we deicded to walk here and not lose our good parking spot. 
The ramen was slightly above average, but nothing jaw droppingly special. The broth was not spectacular, which as we all know, the broth is what sets ramen apart. No tempura or fish balls or anything. Just some seaweed, half of an egg and some grilled pork. The ramen was ok, nothing special either. 
The waiter was slightly rude, when we asked to have our check separated, she ask us to put our cards down and she will separate it for us. Which made it kind of hard to do if 1 person were to pay with cash and another with card. 
Bottom line, it&#39;s ok if you live closeby and want some sushi or ramne, though ironically everyone who dined at that restaurant during our stay ordered ramen, so I can&#39;t testify to how good their sushi is."

This is the best tuna tartare I have had in Chicago. Really fresh and packed with great flavor. I highly recommend it. 
This is a fairly new dining spot and I hope it sticks around. The owner couldn&#39;t be more sweeter. When i spoke what little Korean I know they were very receptive and kind.

We started the meal with spicy tuna and salmon avocado rolls as appetizer, and it was super fresh and tasty.  For my meal, I went with the nabeyaki udon, and my boyfriend had the beef ramen.  Both were excellent with complex flavors, but I preferred the udon because the ramen broth was over-salted.

The food was ready within 20 minutes and the hostess was helpful when I went to pick it up. The ramen came in a 64 oz. to go container which explains the hefty price of almost $18. I had to add hot sauce to cover the bland flavor but otherwise I would order the ramen again. The only bummer is the expensive price and large quantity. I would rather pay less for a smaller portion.

The service was meh but I was pretty impressed with the quality of food. I got matzo ball soup and it was really good. Tasted like home and not salty at all! I also got the blt club- super fresh, the turkey looked and tasted like real turkey vs cold cut and the bacon was not greasy at all. My brother got a soup as well and a gyro plate. Although the pieces were cut a bit too thick for his liking it was really good and not greasy either. I will for sure be back here for a weekday lunch"

Food: good diner food- hit the spot!  My son had the French toast and I had the eggs Benedict.  Wish I would have ordered the avocado benedict- next time.  I don&#39;t think the eggs were poached but the yolk was PERFECT.  Hard to get that nowadays with Benedict!  We ate everything on the plate.  Bonus they have alcohol.

Notwithstanding that I ordered a &#34;breakfast croissant&#34; the waitress turned to the cook and said &#34;she meant to order the breakfast croissant.&#34; Basically, she tried to make it seem as though it was my mistake and not hers.

We did neither of those things at Pittsfield Cafe :)

The chocolate chip Belgian waffle was delicious, and the bacon was super crispy (a little too crispy for my taste, but my boyfriend was loving it).  I do agree with the person who mentioned that it was a little off-putting to get little cups of Smuckers syrup, though... a mini pitcher thing of syrup at the table instead would have gone a long way.

This place is inside this super old office building, and I loved that they asked us if we wanted to sit &#34;inside&#34; or &#34;outside&#34;.  Inside meaning in the cafe itself, and outside meaning at a little bistro table in the foyer of the building, just outside the cafe but still very much indoors.  We ate &#34;outside&#34;, of course!

This was one of the biggest mistakes we&#39;ve made this year, and here&#39;s why:

The food.
My boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs, since it was one of their specials there. When the food arrived, I could see the look of disappointment in his eyes. There on his plate was no steak and eggs, but rather an extra large hamburger patty with a pile of mush on the side. I could see that he was dying a little inside with each bite. I tried a small piece of his &#34;steak&#34; and what I could taste was a blend of cardboard and water. I&#39;m surprised he was able to get through half of it.

I ordered the original benedict and it was a chefs recommendation plate. Not sure if the chef tastes the food before they decide to recommend it, but I recommend they should. After a while the hollendaise sauce got all gooey and hard to digest. The hash browns was also a pile of mush on the side. I asked for poached eggs. Not half poached and half boiled eggs. I was unable to get through much.

The service.
How do I describe the service? Imagine a sack of unpleasant-ness suffocating itself with its unpleasant attitude. Now imagine it getting run over and over again by an angry truck. The result? Our &#34;lovely&#34; waitress. Unfortunately I didn&#39;t bother remembering her name. She was nothing but horrible. Gave us attitude as we were just trying to order food. When we asked for the check, we had to wait roughly 20 minutes for god knows what. (There were only 3-4 tables left when we were trying to leave). When she did come with the check, it was just thrown at us. I&#39;ve never got bitch slapped in my life, but I imagine this is what it would feel like. Thank god we made it out of here.


TL;DR:
The food and service is garbage. If you want a cheap breakfast, you&#39;re better off with McDonald&#39;s served to you by a local hobo.

Thank you for reading."

Our waitress was great with a refreshing down to earth and funny personality, 

The bloody Mary is a meal in it self~ its friggin good. 

The santa fe burrito was delicious and reasonably price (thank god).

We looked at the menu for a couple minutes and decided on what to eat. We put the menus together (usual signal to waiters that we&#39;re ready). 

We waited for 3-4 minutes for someone to come to take our order but no one even acknowledged us after the water. We figured it might be busy so we cut them some slack. We made our rental car reservations while we waited. 

After finishing that, still nobody came to talk to us. I flagged down a waitress who told me that someone else would be helping us shortly. After another minute, I made eye contact with the manager, smiled, and told him that we were ready to order. He looked at me, SHOOK HIS HEAD, and turned away.

When I have enough time to make a car reservation and look up directions to Wrigleyville, that&#39;s much too long of a wait for someone to acknowledge our existence."

It was a little confusing to find until we realized it was in a hotel lobby. Actually they have tables set out in the foyer of the hotel, which we opted to sit at. So we only got a quick glance at the inside of the cafe. 

The food was really delicious. I got one corned beef skillet with scrambled eggs and another with eggs over-easy. I would recommend sticking with scrambled eggs - the yolk from the over-easy eggs kind of overpowered the taste of the corned beef. Didn&#39;t get any drinks, we were trying to recover from the night before. It wasn&#39;t too crowded so our food was served really fast and our waitress was really attentive.

This place was here way before Wildberry came to be.  I think it pretty much could kick Wildberry&#39;s ass.  The Pittsfield building this diner resides in is way cool.  Tons of character in the space, neat stuff to look at while you eat.

Breakfasts shine here, lunches are OK but I recommend breakie over lunch.  And, really the prices for the loop are excellent.  I recommend their breakfast burrito with fresh avocado slices on top, all of their skillets and omelets are good too.  I always ask for my hash brown crispy and they oblige.  Not sure about the pancakes since I&#39;ve never had them.  Decent coffee but if you are a coffee snob/hipster you won&#39;t think so.

Oh, and do a liquid breakfast just for fun and get a bloody.  Their version is great, accompanied by awesome and salty garnishes.  Have two or three and then text your boss and say you can&#39;t make it today because you are feeling a bit dizzy.  I dare you!"

We were seated quickly even though it was a rainy Saturday morning... then we had a wonderful brunch!!!
It started with a freshly squeezed orange juice, shortly followed by the 2-2-2 combo, the croissant breakfast sandwich and a huge stack of pancakes. Food was delicious, portions large enough for my huge appetite. I had a wonderful time there!

Nice little place and not overly crowded on a Saturday around 10. My girlfriend got the meat omelet and I got the steak skillet. Both were great and honestly half of it would have been filling enough.

We are long-time fans of Pancake House and we love it. 
Today we wanted to give a shot at something different. Headed to Wildberry, we had to find an alternative because of a 200+ minutes wait. 
This place is in an interesting location, but something is wrong in general. 
1) tables in the patio are cold now in December, just imagine in Jan/Feb
2) more important, all the 4 eggs of our benedicts were way too overcooked (hard): no good!!
3) hollandaise felt little too greasy
4) breakfast syrup for the pancakes is served cold 
5) pancakes are nothing special at all
6) French toast is too chewy
7) scrambled eggs for my baby were overcooked and resembled an omelette instead 

So, I can&#39;t understand the average of 4 full stars. 
I would have given it a 3 if it weren&#39;t for the overcooked eggs. 
Prices are good."

First trip was on a weekday and I sat at a small table in the back and my food came out quicker than anywhere I&#39;ve ever been.  Bacon, eggs and pancakes.  The fluffiest scrambled eggs I&#39;ve ever had anywhere.  Amazing.  

Second trip was on a Saturday morning.  Much busier.  They suggested the counter, but I asked for a table, so they then ushered me out into the hotter lobby (even though I saw small tables inside and knew I&#39;d be quick, since I was by myself).  I opted for the counter, but it&#39;s not comfortable (stools are too far from the counter or too low or something.  My back felt arched over the counter, but it was just breakfast, so I sucked it up).  My waitress was running around obviously overwhelmed, so I sat there, with another waitress standing right in front of me, for about 5-6 mins.  I heard her say to someone else &#34;I&#39;m bored, and when I&#39;m bored, I get tired...&#34; Yet I was not a foot from her.  Finally a busser asked if he could get me anything.  I said yes, a waitress and a menu.  (I got the bored one).  I opted for bacon, eggs and french toast this time.  Again, the scrambled eggs were amazing and so was the french toast.  Even better than the pancakes.

A hidden gem and I would definitely go back.  I just hope they figure out slightly better customer service and a better flow on a Saturday.  It didn&#39;t have to be a cluster.  That being said, I&#39;m still giving them 5 stars because of the food!"

Moving on to food, the menu is large, but I stick to their delicious steak tacos or one of the combo plates that gives you a little bit of everything from chile relleno, to a chicken enchilada (yum!) and a taco. Also on point? The queso fundido with chorizo. . . so. . . good.

The beans and rice were perfect, not too heavy on the seasoning on the rice which I like and no peas and carrots like you see at their places (gross).

Their burrito makes a good case for never, ever trying anything new, ever. ...not ever. While I&#39;m not committed to adopting that as a life philosophy, or to all of my culinary experiences, while I am at Tacos Garcias, that is the way it is. It&#39;s just too dang good, and it&#39;s something stupidly awesome like $4.50.  It&#39;s quite large, and available filled with a variety of tasty meats, though I stick to steak or chorizo. I don&#39;t want to butcher the other ingredients, but I believe it&#39;s beans, cheese, sour cream, lettuce and tomato.

That is literally the only thing I ever get. It is quite filling, and I just have never felt that I NEEDED anything else.

The only other things I can comment on are:

Horchata: 
Tasty recipe, served in a huge cup....but no refills. So for those keeping track at home, that&#39;s HAVE horchata, tastes great, give you a lot....but not an unlimited quantity. Overall, this is a plus.

Bottled Mexican Coke:
As someone mentioned below, they&#39;ve got the good stuff. Mexican coke, in glass, with real sugar. Even if you never go to Tacos Garcias, if you like coke, you should really keep an eye out for this. I love all coca cola, but the mexican variety is the best.

Chips and Salsa:
They give you free chips and salsa (normal). The chips are unremarkable, but they give you a variety of salsas (3 types, I think), and they&#39;re all really quite good.

The Decor:
When last I was there, everything was covered in some rubbery, sparkly material. Sort of &#34;napoleon dynamite&#34;-esque. I&#39;ll call that a plus.

The ambiance:
Slightly dim, slightly vintage feeling. I mainly created this category to chuckle about how there is an additional room adjacent to the main dining room that often has music. Sometimes they&#39;re playing mexican jams at a punishingly loud volume, that, for me, just makes me laugh pretty much the entire time.  Can&#39;t hate that! haha!"

Let&#39;s just say I feel at home and will probably be back weekly. They do dine-in, take-out, and have a ton of space inside- good for small or big groups. My server was very kind and my food was delicious. Delicious may be an understatement, actually. I got a chicken burrito and it was so big I made 2 meals out of it! It&#39;s also inexpensive for the quality. I&#39;ve never reviewed anything on Yelp until this place. It&#39;s that good."

Pretty crowded at 2 PM on a Saturday, and one critic said their guac was great. Ordered two guac tostadas and a horchata. (They have pina coladas and margs, but I wasn&#39;t in the mood.) Horchata was fab, not too cinnamon-y (gross) and not watery, but pure oatmeal-ish. Tostadas ended up being aguacate instead of guacamole, with side of rice and beans. I cleaned my plate and will fer sure be back to try the guac (hopefully)."

At around 12am we went home from Wrigleyville.  Lukes fiance fell asleep in the cab and he had to carry her inside.  Then he and I went to this little Mexican joint on the corner of Armitage and Kimball and bought two giant burritos and two coronas and played a couple games of pool.  It was a really good end to the night.  Funny as hell b/c we were drunk, I had to order in Spanish and ask for quarters and shit... we took Bailey (my Chocolate Lab)  in with us.  Horrible pool playing, I was calling everybody in the place &#34;Cabron&#34; (means buddy or friend to Mexicans... don&#39;t say it to Puerto Ricans (it has a totally different meaning)) and high 5ing.

The pico di gallo is the best salsa there, as you eat up it&#39;s nummy chunks the heat builds to a crazy crescendo!

Get the gordita, ton of food for very little; make sure it&#39;s steak though.  Otherwise, stick with the pork, it&#39;s the most consistently delicious.  If you wants something to stick to your stomach lining like a love struck gargantuan sloth from space, get the chorizo breakfast, the grease will become your best friend!

Rosa J. normally tries to refrain from going to a national or regional chain because she strongly upholds her &#34;dine local, shop local&#34; philosophy everyday of her life.  Nevertheless, she has noticed some great yelp reviews on many Meatheads locations and could not resist herself but to check it out what all that rave was about.  

I chose the location that is most convenient to where I work, in terms of public transportation.  Thus, the Roscoe Village location was selected for this study (sorry, don&#39;t want sound scientific, but couldn&#39;t help it with seven (7) years of science/criminal justice background on my belt).  

The service was very friendly, for a fast-food restaurant standard.  I had the Cajun sunrise burger, a regular-order of Cajun fries, and a fountain drink.  

Did I mention that they have the Coca-cola free-style pop machines?  Yes, they do!  

They seem to have free wifi as well, even though it was a bit slow.  But come on!  You&#39;re at a burger place, so please concentrate on eating your burger, children.  

The Cajun sunrise burger wasn&#39;t disappointing, but it wasn&#39;t that amazing like other yelpers have described in their reviews and pictures.  They have a fried egg (my absolute favorite topping in a burger), bacons, tomatoes, lettuce, and jalapeños.  Honestly, the three (3) bold-flavored toppings: fried egg, bacons and jalapeños make the entire burger lose the &#34;focus.&#34;  For some reason, I just couldn&#39;t taste the uniqueness of a gourmet burger and didn&#39;t have a wow-factor.  

My only suggestion is that if they fried the egg to be done as &#34;over-easy,&#34; it would help to hold the &#34;burger&#34; together instead becoming crumbly after a few bites.  

On the other hand, the Cajun fries were quite delicious.  The portion was generously large, and the seasoning was also on point.  

There were two (2) special unit CPD officers onsite and having a burger date with me.  I felt safe!  By the way, pay attention to where police officers are going to eat and follow along (DO NOT STALK THEM THOUGH...let them do what they are supposed to do).  They knew the local restaurants, and some are real foodies.  

Anyways, I still like this place and try something else next time."

And the eggnog milkshake, OMG. To die for.

First off, it&#39;s a regional counter service place. Knowing that, I wasn&#39;t expecting anything gourmet. The menu states that the meat is &#34;Certified Angus,&#34; some of their topping choices were interesting and when I read &#34;Cajun Fries,&#34; I was sold on going. I should have eaten someplace else.

It&#39;s VERY clean in there and they have the absolute coolest fountain drink system, but they seriously abused that poor Angus beef. I ordered mine with grilled mushrooms and Swiss cheese - my &#34;standard.&#34; I had to stop eating halfway into it - it was rather bland and the greasiness was SO overwhelming. I like to chew my burger - this was nearly &#34;chewing optional,&#34; that&#39;s how greasy it was. The fries were decent, but if you go, just get the plain. This is the 3rd place I&#39;ve been to in Chicago that has &#34;Cajun fries,&#34; and I&#39;m starting to think no one knows what Cajun means here. All they seem to do is just sprinkle cayenne pepper on fries. Cajun has a complex medley of flavors, not just one note. When I stood up to leave, I felt it hit my system so hard, I ended up only &#34;renting&#34; my lunch.

Overall, it&#39;s just too expensive for what it tastes like: a glorified McDonald&#39;s. I&#39;d only go back to play with their fountain drink system all... day... long. It&#39;s the PlayStation of drink systems!

A similar small-chain burger place with the same values of locally sourced, mindful food is Epic Burger - go there instead and for about the same price."

Out of all the restaurants that I have ever been to, Meatheads is the most generous with avocado portions.  Meatheads slathered on at least 4 thick slices of avocado- and that made my cheeseburger a 9 out of 10 (one cannot order a hamburger rare at this location.)

The french fry portions are large, they have jalapeño-ketchup, and hot sauce.  These additions help the french fries immensely.  Its not that the french fries are bad, but they do need a little nudge in the right direction.  Recommended: cheeseburger with many toppings."

As you may expect, Meatheads does something extremely well:  meat! I&#39;ve had everything from the beef to the chicken to the hot dog and have rarely been disappointed. The menu at Meatheads is similar to the menu at FiveGuys where you customize what you want on your burger but the difference (to me at least) is the ingredients used are of a higher quality. There isn&#39;t much more I can say of the fried chicken sandwich besides that it is my go-to place for a fast casual food. Finally, the &#34;New-England&#34; style hot dog isn&#39;t for everyone; while it does taste pretty good, I&#39;m going to stick with my Chicago Style Vienna Beef dogs.

Severely underrated are the fries, more specifically the fries with the Cajun seasoning. There are enough in one order to be split between two people and the Cajun seasoning adds a nice kick to what is already a great fry."

I visited here because I was attemping to visit Hot Doug&#39;s at lunchtime (bad plan) and saw the line down the block and around the corner.  Therefore, I had to think fast (my dad was hungry and I had promised him lunch).  

I remembered that there was a Meatheads nearby and we headed directly there.  I was happy to see that they had other options besides burgers, but I forgot that they were similar to Five Guys in the fact that they had HUGE double pattie burgers.  Oops!  I ordered a burger and fries for my dad and a grilled chicken sandwich for me.

I waited at a small counter for the food and it came relatively quickly.  They also came over with a tray of ketchup, mayo and mustard for me to choose in case I needed more condiments (nice touch) since the food was a to-go order.

I have to say that the food was tasty and fresh (though, I will say that the buns got pretty soggy quickly - perhaps since everything was so juicy - but on the chicken??).  The regular order or fries was too much for both of us, but they were nicely cooked with the right amount of soft inside and crunchy outside.  I also had a side of buffalo ranch which was delicious (not sure it&#39;s worth an extra 75 cents, but had to try it).

All in all, it was a good visit.  I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s quite as good as it&#39;s counterparts, but it is fast.  Extra points to the t-shirts that say &#39;girls can be meatheads, too&#39;.  

One thing that did slightly annoy me was that the girl ordering ahead of me clearly knew the cashier and they were just chatting while a line formed.  I think they could have taken this off-line so as to help the line move a bit quicker.  I am not one to say that talking isn&#39;t allowed, but it was the middle of a busy lunch hour and probably not the best time for that."

Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.

My family thinks they have the best burger in Chicago!  The fries are freshly made!  They also have 2 cool design your own Coke machines! 
The place is immaculately clean!! The menus easy to understand and they are also big supporters of local kids sports teams.

 I applaud the ownership for whatever they&#39;re doing for training! They are fast fresh food with great service! 

 They are also very family friendly! 

Another tip try the chicken strips!"

Judging by the umpteen moms and dads with numerous babes in arms, I get this is a popular family chain.  It&#39;s a short walk north from the intersection of Western and Belmont (for those of us public transiting it).

A friend tried a couple different hamburgers in the two visits we&#39;ve made so far, and liked them, though the patties are smashed a la Steak n Shake.  Ordering a double or a triple helps to make a rather paltry burger into a decently sized meal.

The same could almost be said for my chicken sandwich.  Without any additional ingredients, it would&#39;ve been just a grilled chicken breast on a bun.  So you&#39;ll want to order stuff like grilled onions, a slice of tomato, lettuce, sauerkraut (sauerkraut? yeah...don&#39;t judge).  They have a long list of stuff you can throw on sandwiches for free, and you can add cheese and a couple other things for a premium.

The fries are wonderful.  Cajun fries, regular fries, chili-cheese fries.  You get the idea.

Shakes.  Haven&#39;t tried them, but I imagine they&#39;re decent though this is no Steak n Shake.

Clean?  Oh, yeah.

Nice employees?  I saw lots of smiles, and someone came around and asked how we were doing and if there was anything they could get for us.  One employee even brought out different sauces for us to try.

Quick?  Very.  Ordering is easy, and our food came out in about five minutes.

Unlimited sodas?  You betcha.  There are two of those fancy Coke product self-serve machines--the kind with the video monitor and limitless Coke products and flavor additives.  Are there really people who want Ginger-tinged grape soda?  I guess so.

I really like this restaurant.  It&#39;s in a hard-to-notice spot in a strip mall (it&#39;s wrapped around the south end of the strip mall that can&#39;t be seen from the Mariano&#39;s parking lot) that&#39;s really upgraded itself over the years.  It&#39;s about a 10-minute walk south from Lane Tech High School."

I didn&#39;t want it to end! The fries are a million times better than 5 guys too. They aren&#39;t soggy or borderline burnt. They are very flavorful and crispy on the outside. I saw that they also have vanilla or chocolate shakes on the menu. I was too full to try that this time, but I would love to try one next time. The kids menu is great. A lot to choose from and the toy that comes with the meal is pretty cool. The cashier made sure other staff had our table ready, clean and with a high chair set up for our toddler.

Now, the food: Yesterday, I tried the Texas Ranch Burger and the Tenders. Both were pretty good. You can definitely tell that their meat is fresh. The Tenders were also great. 

Today, I wanted to see about the fish. (Fish Fridays). The fish and chips were really good. The fries were amazing too. 

There&#39;s a guy here. He has this long hair and he&#39;s amazingly funny. Seems like he loves his job a lot. I look forward to running into him the next time I&#39;m here.

Seriously, I consider myself to be an expert in the chicken finger area. This is very fortunate for me, because when it comes to burgers here, I always panic at all the different options and combinations I could make that I usually end up ordering one of the chef-inspired burger. That, or my brain would probably explode. The chef-inspired burgers are excellent though, and one day I will take an hour before I come here and plan to make my own creation, and it will be gloriously meaty and messy. This girl likes her toppings.

And then, wash all of that cow and/or chicken down with some fresh freestylin&#39; Diet Orange Coke from their machine (trust me, it&#39;s so bubbly and refreshing and delicious), and treat yourself to a milkshake too. The seasonal banana split I had last week was ridiculous. 

On top of all this (I know, right?), the staff are usually walking around and checking up to see how you&#39;re doing. Everyone has been very courteous and friendly. It&#39;s pretty rare to see this kind of attentive service at a quick-serve restaurant. And I kind of dig it - makes me feel like a chicken finger huffing princess."

Food: delish and based on their moto and values statement is Angus beef, grass fed Midwestern origin so it have to be good. In fact it was fresh and I can taste the freshness.

 Meatheads offers a variety of delicious Burger Options. I elected to go with the Cajun Sunrise. It was a 1/3 lb Burger covered with Pepper Jack, Jalapeno peppers and a Fried Egg. It may clogged my arteries and taken a few years off my life, but it was well worth it.

1. They have CHEESE fries (and chili cheese fries) and theirs do not require ringing out the grease before eating.
2. They have ketchupeno (made in chicago) if you haven&#39;t had real jalapeño ketchup be ready bc heinz will never be sufficient again.
3. Everyone is crazy NICE! Especially Chris the manager (?). Sweetest thing ever, he actually cares!
4. You can choose any type of protein like CHICKEN, veggie patties, chicken tenders, ect. But they dont stop there they also have a million toppings and house made sauces to personalize your burger/sandwich.
5. Their meat is 100% all natural and are truly made to order. 
6. It is less expensive than five guys and they have the same amazing soda machines. 
7. They support students and the militaryand we are beyond grateful! 
The only thing I&#39;m upset about is that we&#39;ve lived here the 3 years this location has been open and we just found out about it today.

You order as you walk in, take a number and then go have a seat. The burgers are large and you can get just about any topping (within reason) added for no extra charge. 
       Lets be honest its pretty easy to get a good burger quickly and on the cheap, in this fair city. However, Meatheads (at least at this locations) does a good job paying attention to the details that make a difference in the competitive semi fast food environment.  
      Firstly, the employees up front are very upbeat which is refreshing. A lot of time when you go to fast food places the employees seem somewhere between indifferent and border line suicidal, not the case with Meatheads. Also, the manager always comes around and checks on you. I&#39;ve never had any issue, but I get the feeling if I did, he would fix it and not have me fill out a complaint card or something. Lastly, despite the fact that there are a lot of kids here, the room is open enough, that a loud or crying child probably won&#39;t drive you crazy. Meathead is an excellent burger option or a good selection for a relatively inexpensive family meal."

Another fast-casual burger joint more in the image of Five Guys has popped up in Chicago.  When I try a place for the first time I usually go for what they&#39;re famous for, so I got their take on the classic burger - the Meathead. It was fine. Nothing great, kinda bland.  Wasn&#39;t too messy which I enjoyed.  I liked seeing the option of raw onions on the menu.  The cajun fries were pretty good, I would order those over the original ones.

I always enjoy places with futuristic soda machines, good work Meatheads.  Nice nod to the neighborhood with the schedule of high school football games on the wall.

I tried the chicken meathead with mushrooms + pepperjack.  It was a pretty standard, but good, grilled chx sandwich - juicy chx, adequate toppings, plain white bun.  We also ordered some of the cajun fries (with cheese sauce on the side) - I recommend that combo.  Loved the cheese sauce.

I think I am right because all you have to do is try one meal here and I will guarantee you that you will be hooked.

I try to switch up my burger when I eat here (the options seem to be endless). I have not had a bad burger or bad fries! However the coffee shake will ALWAYS be on my order! This is one outstanding accompaniment with any burger and fries combination that you could choose. The price you will pay for a delicious, filling, and satisfying meal is a very good value. I highly doubt that you will dissappointed"

Burger: A+
All the fixins you need, great quality beef, excellent bread, and fresh. 

Fries: B
The Cajun fries aren&#39;t really spicy at all, just seasoned.  Not bad, not amazing.

Shake: B
Although it says hand dipped, the taste reminded me more of McDonalds, and Stake N&#39;Shake puts together a much better milkshake.

Kids Meal: C
The $5.50 kids hot dog meal comes with a foot-long dog - great taste but x3 more than my kid could ever eat.  It&#39;s also $1 more to get milk instead of pop, so by the end I looked at the bill and my 3-year-olds meal was the same cost as mine.

So overall- great burgers and hot dogs.  I&#39;d pass on the shakes, and pricing adds up fast."

Their burgers are as good as Five Guys and their location is a lot more convenient. I had a cheeseburger with the works. Next time I will skip the cheese. I doubt I will miss it. 

What most impressed me however was their fries. The litmus test for great fries (and pizza and sake) is whether they are good cold. You can down some crappy fries as long as their hot and you douse them with enough ketchup. But, when lunch was over  and I noticed a handful of cold fries at the bottom of the bag. They were just as good as when they were fresh hot out of the fryer.

Customer service was outstanding. Service was fast and friendly. The restaurant was clean and inviting.

After taking a few bites of the cajun sunrise (sprinkled with hella hot jalapenos), my eyes were watering, and this mildly lactose intolerant girl was screaming for some milk.  So yeah, the jalapenos were at fault, not meatheads, but nonetheless, the burger was just meh.  The 1/3 lb burger consists of two thin patties - just squish &#39;em together and make it THICK!  Sure, there are a lot of toppings, but it felt like a McDonald&#39;s burger dressed up for Halloween - just a pretty costume, but nothing special inside.  On the plus side, cashiers and servers are super friendly.  Also, the regular sized fries are plentiful, and come with cajun seasoning if your tastebuds can handle it.

The server said, I wouldn&#39;t have let you order a second. Love that honesty and the fries were crispy and yummy. The hamburgers were delicious, but the name definitely made us wonder exactly what was on the menu.

But Meatheads is walking distance to my house.  I had to try it.

My wife and the boys have been there before.  The self-select drink machines drives my 5 year old mad.  He does a little dance when we are filling his drink.

I liked it.  Burgers were fresh, fries were fresh cut.  A nice alternative to those moments when you guiltily go through the drive-thru at McDonalds, hoping not to see someone you know, someone in better shape... Jogging past you as you pay for $25 worth of food there.

I got the 1/3 pound burger with the works and cheddar cheese.  It was nice and juicy.  The burger fell apart as I was trying to eat it.  My brother was really excited to see that they had fresh jalapeños as a topping.  I got an order of the cajun fries which was regular fries covered in season salt.

I love the décor.  Even though Meatheads is a chain they have nice touches to remind you that you are in Roscoe Village.

I also really liked the fries they serve. Go for the Cajun fries!!

They also serve other menu items, not just burgers. I am definitely going to try their chicken sandwich next time I visit. I only drank water on my visit, but i noticed that they had two Coca-cola freestyle machines where you can create like 100 different varieties of soft drink.

We also tried the Texas style ranch burger which was a great alternative.  We liked that they had pre-set burgers with fun combinations.

We also tried a side of cajun fries which are thin-cut and crispy with a side of cheese.  The cheese was alright, a bit watered down but I don&#39;t know if there are many cheese sauces I haven&#39;t loved.

It&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing, but the comparison is made more easily.  I would say that they beat Five Guys on the burger, especially on presentation and topping variety.  I wish they had taken a different direction with the fries, since the Cajun seasoning is very similar and the fries seemed less substantial.  The Freestyle Coke machine here was pretty fun and is a big reason why I would return.  I&#39;d also like to try the milkshakes next time.

A tip if you&#39;re coming here at lunch, you should probably avoid coming between 11:45am and 1:00pm since it&#39;s likely to be bombarded by Lane Tech students during the school year.  The interior is really nice otherwise with lots of room for seating, especially large groups.  Also, there are no open boxes of peanuts lying around for those worrying about that. :)

Update: I came in again, this time at 12:15pm Tuesday and the students had cleared out by that point.  I guess it&#39;s random on when they are busy, but the grand opening traffic has probably died down enough to not worry about what time to come in.

- Price for the amount you actually get - 2 specialty burgers, 1 Regular fry (the guy said you could split one btwn 2 people, not true if you are hungry!) and 2 sodas = $21!! The burger itself wasn&#39;t worth $8 for a fast food burger. 
- I&#39;m not a fan of those fancy new 100 different ways to drink your soda machines. They just make everything taste off. I got a regular coke and it had a fruity flavor.

(First thing to come out of my mouth after my Meatheads experience).

I love Meatheads. Great service--and quick. Custom Burgers made to order. Really, what more can you want?

I had a customized Meatheads burger--angus beef patty, ketchup, mustard, and mayo, lettuce, pickles, American cheese, and onions (I ordered my onions raw, but ended up with grilled--no biggie for me).  I did 1/3 pound (2 patties) as opposed to 1/2 (3 patties...that&#39;s just crazy talk).  This is my perfect burger. 

I split an order of REGULAR (regular feeds two--large feeds 4) cajun fries and cheese sauce with the hubs. The cajun fries were delicious and the cheese sauce was a little spicy--the combination was amazing. 

Did I mention that they have a Freestyle coke machine? SCORE! Cherry Vanilla Coke Zero with my burger? Heck yes. Usually I can only use a Freestyle machine at the theater on Western...I was practically in heaven. 

On another note, the place is incredibly clean and the bathrooms are very nice. Go to the bathroom--the sink faucet water &#34;pleasantly pours over your hands&#34;  (yep, that&#39;s a direct quote as well).

In summary, an awesome, wonderful, and super cute girl once said, &#34;If I didn&#39;t want to be fat all the time, I would eat here all the time.&#34;"

Plus, the lines at the Logan Square shop can get ridiculously long, while the Ravenswood shop has the perfect balance of busy, but a shorter wait time. 

Since white carbs are my favorite food group, it&#39;s no surprise that Bang Bang&#39;s infamous biscuits have landed on my list of top eats in Chicago. They are soft, buttery and melt-in-your-mouth levels of deliciousness! Plus, I love the rotating selection of flavored butters and seasonal jams that accompany the biscuits.

Bang Bang does offer a quality pie selection, but I admit that nothing I have had so far has jumped out at me or caught my attention the way their biscuits have. I think First Slice and Mama Hoosier&#39;s are equally as good - if not better in some areas - hence why I cannot give Bang Bang the full five stars. 

But the real star at Bang Bang are those biscuits. Dare I say the best in Chicago?"

What we ordered: 
Harvest Grits - The best way I can describe this is &#34;fall in a dish&#34;. Anything and everything that reminds you of fall you can experience with this.  highly recommend.

Avocado biscuit - meh! skip this. I actually enjoyed eating these separately.  I ended up separating the avocado and had the biscuits after asking for some jam and butter on the side. 

brisket biscuit - GET THIS! hubs&#39; order.  very tasty and he was happy with it.  He also stated that the pickle that it came with is was one of the best he&#39;s had. 

Service was excellent here.  You basically order, take a seat and they bring the food for you.  They were still very attentive even though they didn&#39;t have to be!  One of the waiters even made a list of recommended restaurants for us with the few days we had left."

Being a bang bang aficionado there is no question I had to come to a place with &#34;Bang Bang&#34; in their name and boy oh boy am I glad that I did (for those unaware of the glory that is a bang bang, I recommend Googling &#34;Louis CK bang bang&#34; for further education on the subject). I was hoping to go to their original location first since I prefer trying the first spot to open for an establishment before checking out additional locations, but I was running out of time in Chi and was within walking distance from here so this location had to do. Man oh man, it was so freaking good!

I walked in and was greeted by the smells of freshly baked biscuits and I already felt I was in store for something special. Their sausage biscuit with lavender blue berry jam, plus an added egg, was ridiculously good. You know those moments when you first taste something and it&#39;s just undeniably good. This was one of those moments. It brought smiles to my face with each bite. I would like to try their other biscuits which sound fantastic too, but I would have to get this one again first next time.

Unfortunately, I was not the biggest fan of their chocolate pecan pie, which sounded great. It was very moist, but way too sweet and molasses-y for my liking. Aside from that and in addition to the stupendous sausage biscuit, the staff was really nice and the space had a warm, funky, and inviting feel to it. Can&#39;t wait to come back next time I&#39;m in town!"

What I did enjoy-

-Very friendly staff that made a point of greeting everyone that walked in the shop.  We were even greeted with free samples upon arrival.
-Cute leather couch and fireplace in the middle of the café that gave it a &#34;homey feel&#34;.
-You do not have to bus your own table at the end.
-Biscuits were delicious...imagine a McDonalds breakfast biscuit only on a gourmet level.  The jelly and butter that accompanied it were very tasty.

Why I gave it only 3 stars-
-The menu was pretty small and I found the food to be pretty bland overall.
-The grits had no seasoning.  I found myself adding quite a few shakes of salt.
-I really cannot speak on the pie as I didn&#39;t try it.  There was no way for me to see the pies before ordering so I wasn&#39;t going to chance it."

We ordered the candy bacon and gravy. The gravy came in tin to-go container consisting of two biscuits with their gravy smothered in top and sausage sprinkled all around the biscuits. The candy bacon was good. Not too sweet either and it made the flavor of the bacon pop! The gravy was delicious as well combined with the biscuit and sausage.

First of all the decor is adorbs. Secondly the people who work there are also adorbs (hellooo hipsters). Most importantly their pie is delish, although on the sweet side. My friend and I shared a slice of the lemon chess pie with pistachio and the passion fruit. Passion fruit is BOMB guys, gotta get it! Definitely wanna go back and try their biscuits.

I have a few complaints though: why am I paying $5 to $6 for a sliver of pie? I mean it&#39;s good for my waste line but how can you deny people the joy of pie? Also, why are you closed at 4pm on the weekends? I want dessert after dinner, damn it!

Problem is, you can order a lot not realizing your eyes are too big for your stomach.  We fell victim of this circumstance during this run unfortunately.

Ordered the &#34;Smokin Chix&#34; and the &#34;fancy grits&#34;. Never realized blueberries could complement the cheesy concoction, but it was a nice marriage of salty and sweet. Add some hot sauce, and you have nirvana.

You can get just a biscuit with the regular stuff like jam/butter/honey or get one with more interesting toppings. The Hubs &amp; I each tried a different biscuit topping and loved them both.  Their biscuits are often described as being like pound-cake but not as sweet and I&#39;d say that is a good description but I&#39;d just go with HEAVENLY PERFECTION in biscuit form.  We also planned on sharing a piece of pie, and did, but lucky us we got a slice for free which was nice.  The lady who brought it over said it was because it was our first time there but I think it was a combo of that &amp; the fact that we had just walked many blocks in an absolute downpour thunderstorm to try them for breakfast.  Whatever the reason it was a much appreciated and promptly devoured slice of Key Lime Pie.

The only thing holding me back from giving them 5 stars is the communal seating.  Sorry, not a fan of that type of seating, especially when it&#39;s a place that is popular and often busy/crowded.  Yes, you can cram a few more bodies in with the communal seating but my misanthrope self doesn&#39;t want to get chummy with the other diners or listen in on whatever gossip/drama the gals next to us are discussing.

That&#39;s when I understood the divided yelp comments on this place. 

We had the biscuit w/ sausage and egg. It was easily enough for two regular appetites. The biscuit was very good and very dense. The sharp cheese on the sausage was a nice flavor hit, but all together it was surprisingly bland. Ditto on the &#34;not so fancy cheddar cheese grits&#34;. Even with a dousing of the supplied hot sauce, they were just okay. 

Then we bussed our table. 

Overall impression: solid, but not stand-out, food. And about 25% too pricey for what you receive. Nice neighborly ambiance."

There is more than a whiff of the deep South here. Biscuits and gravy are delicious. The gravy is the creamy kind you find on chicken fried steak and is said to be vegetarian. It has a peppery kick and is served over a soft biscuit, with a hard biscuit on the side. Cheesy grits are delicious. The grits have bite and substance and the cheese smooths the dish out. Rhubarb pie has icing, something I haven&#39;t seen before, but when it comes to desserts, pile it on. The crust is crispy and there is some tartness left in the pie from the rhubarb (but not a lot; it&#39;s very very sweet, almost too sweet).

Service is very friendly, the kind that calls you by name. The shop is small but has a number of nice features, like a sofa, fireplace, communal table, and a chandelier. It will be extremely cozy during the long Chicago winter. In the meantime, I am sure Bang Bang will make a splash, in Ravenswood or wherever it chooses to open a new location."

Imagine that goes on for awhile, also that I&#39;m chanting it triumphantly on my couch. Couch is long and blue. I&#39;m wearing some new jeans that have really energized me.

7:50 a.m. In bathtub. Boyfriend is creaking around, up earlier than usual. He pokes his head in. He says he has an idea. Me: Bang Bang Pie? Him: Well...Me: yes! 

Actually, he wants ME to go to Bang Bang, collect savory breakfast items (&#34;one savory AND one sweet.&#34;), and return. I get dressed. 

8 a.m. Small unrelated fight. I refuse to get breakfast out of principle.

8:10 a.m. We hug it out. 

8:30 a.m. Not unreasonable line at Bang Bang. Many baby carriages. The wind is colder than normal, colder than May. I relax outside, unconcerned by the line. Various neighborhood residents shuffle the strollers around, snap them closed. 

8:35 a.m. Inside Bang Bang. Unlike Over Easy, the atmosphere is surprisingly relaxed. Since Dolce closed, I missed the tin ceiling here and the subway tile to the ceiling. Even though there is a line, it is moving quickly and efficiently. This is not their first rodeo (or location.) Their staff is trained, friendly and efficient. The neighborhood has missed this café. We are happy to have a new coffee shop, excited it also has food, cautious it might all be taken away at any moment. Credit cards are being swiped with no complaints.

8:40 a.m. Taking in the menu, the food is a lot less portable then I had hoped. Other than the chicken pot pie, I don&#39;t see any vegetarian savory pies. I hope for more portable savory options in the future. But I&#39;m happy to see carry-out packing is on point: paper bags with handles, they have made it what seems to not be portable food very convenient and easy to transport.

8:45 a.m. Already ordering! the owner (or manager) is super friendly and relaxed, makes a point of introducing himself and asking if I live in the hood. I scooped a yogurt and granola from the fridge, don&#39;t miss this bonus material. Otherwise you&#39;ll notice the food is leaning on the heavier side, appropriate for the concept ...Got the fancy grits and chicken and biscuit to go. They have cleared out the space in an intelligent way to make room for waiting and foot traffic. One long farm table mostly occupied by families with many small children, addition to some traditional two tops and the fireplace lounge area. So glad they kept that. The only design decision I don&#39;t really agree with is building a wood facade up to the ceiling around the fireplace. A lot of money for no good reason, covering up the beautiful brick chimney. 

8:47 a.m. Self-serve coffee? Is this heaven? Also love that they have one huge thing of whole milk. They even have a little carafe of almond milk, acknowledging whatever that means for you. 

9 a.m. Eating at home, the grits are great - substantial in portion size, I would get some extra hot sauce to go next time, it&#39;s delicious! the collard greens are lovely but I could&#39;ve used a few more veggies. I love poached eggs so I&#39;m glad that is the standard option here. I didn&#39;t try the chicken and biscuits so I can&#39;t speak to that, but I love pimento cheese. 

9:25 a.m. Excited to try bang bang again, next time I&#39;m just going to go for the classic biscuit and jam, only three dollars, and maybe supplement with an egg.

Service was fine but the pie and biscuits were just not that great for the price.  There is so much hype surrounding BBP that I guess I had higher expectations.

I&#39;ve lived in Chicago for two years, but had never heard of Bang Bang Pie &amp; Biscuits. My sister (visiting from NC) and I came in after reading about this place&#39;s s&#39;mores pie on Buzzfeed. Go figure! We had a great experience.

When we came in, we got a good look at the super simple menu, were greeted and bantered with by the fun cashier, and we got to set up our own little table and chairs area near the self-serve water/silverware station.

Food was awesome. Biscuits were heavy and big, like a buttery, melty pound cake consistency but less sweet. Strawberry jam (my favorite!) was in season. I had the candied bacon too which was pretty great. I would&#39;ve liked it crispier, but it was my first time having candied bacon, so I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s ever served that way.

The pie was every bit as good as Buzzfeed said it would be. My sister, a known chocoholic, got the s&#39;mores, and I got the tart, creamy key lime. Both were smash hits for us.

The service staff seems knowledgeable and very friendly.  The food that was ordered. Which consisted of a wedge and biscuit and a gravy and biscuit we&#39;re good. Although the amount of lettuce could not be considered a wedge. It was more like a one by 4 inch section of a head of lettuce. It did taste good. Just didn&#39;t feel like the value for the money. My dining companion ordered the biscuits and gravy. Which was tasty, although a little bit over spiced with the pepper and I&#39;m guessing the worlds smallest egg on top.

The orange juice was fresh. The black flavored iced tea was good although a tad bitter. 

As for the space. It&#39;s a very charming and very hipster farm concept. The large communal table although very cute. Honestly does not utilize the amount of space they have to offer for people to sit down and enjoy their product . People with laptops , papers. People saving spaces. Another problem with the lack of seating is no fault of the restaurant , but , with the way you order and then go sit down to have your food brought to you. The problem that was happening was that one person would arrive early from their party. Order a drink. Then go sit down at an open seat. And hold the table space until their friends got there to get in line and order what they wanted. The only problem with this is people that were ahead of them in line their food was coming out and they had nowhere to sit. I only noticed it happen twice. And both parties seemed only slightly miffed.

So overall. For me three stars. If I lived in the neighborhood. Didn&#39;t have to wait 25 minutes just to order. And I could find a seat when I came in. I probably wouldn&#39;t give it a higher rating.  The food was good. Nothing to write up in a paper about. Just honest good food

I may give it another shot during the week. When the weekend brunch crowd is not overwhelming the restaurant"

The shop is very cute, and the staff was super friendly and helpful each time I visited, but in my experience so far, the food has been... not good. Not good at all.

Over the last month I have tried 4 items: 2 chicken pot pies, a slice of peach pie, and a slice of orange dreamsicle pie. The first pot pie was truly bad. It was smaller than I had expected for $9, the chicken filling was almost pure white -- no flavor whatsoever -- and there were hardly any veggie bits to help mitigate. I thought the chicken was wildly overcooked. The crust was fine.

The second pot pie (I assumed the first was a fluke, that is how bad it was) was marginally better. The filling had a bit of color this time, more veggies, and even a hint of some type of herby seasoning. It tasted like a completely different recipe. The crust was fine again, but man does not live on crust alone.

There will be no third pot pie :( and I am legitimately sad about this because two of my greatest joys in life are pot pies and spending way too much money on things.

The sweet pies were both too sugary, and lacking the kind of deep or complex flavor I would expect for the price point. Next time I will just eat a poptart.

I have not tried the biscuits or the coffee, and I doubt I will any time soon."

You have to wait in line outside to order at the counter, but they bring the food to your table. Lots of options of different biscuits with toppings and pies. I have lots of food allergies, so I went the simple route of a biscuit and a piece of the milk chocolate pie. Both were delicious and well worth the wait. I had wanted scrambled eggs with mine, but they only have one type of egg (can&#39;t remember offhand, sorry)!  I&#39;d say that was the biggest downfall. You can eat inside or outside. The outdoors area is much nicer and has a ton of space...as long as you don&#39;t mind eating in benches. But it&#39;s rustic and fun and definitely worth it to try.

Their biscuits is soft and moist unlike any other biscuit I&#39;ve ever had. Almost like a cake but much more body to it. 

I had the hot chix biscuit sandwich- spicy full of mexican spice flare. Pickles added a nice balance with acidity sweetness, and mouthy lubrication to the biscuit and chicken.

For dessert I got a slice of their rhubarb pie. Delicate flakey pie crust with a rhubarb filling that had a preserve consistency to it. If it got served to me without knowing what it was I would have said that this was the best peach cobbler I&#39;ve ever eaten. 

Definitely worth stopping in for a quick bite."

Though I&#39;d heard great things about the original location, I never made the trip to Logan Square.  As a dedicated pie fiend, I couldn&#39;t wait to check out the Damen location.  

One evening, getting off the bus with two bags of Trader Joe&#39;s provisions, I couldn&#39;t wait to get home, but then I saw Bang Bang was open.  Of course, I trotted right over.  It happened to be the opening day, and the owner graciously greeted me.  

On this glorious morning, I ventured across the park to finally try their famous biscuits.  Though the place was bustling, the service was off the charts.  Though there were two people ahead of me, the line moved quickly, yet without feeling rushed.  The owner was at the register, and I was stunned that he remembered my name.  I placed my order - two slices of pie, biscuit, coffee - and my order was ready before i&#39;d finished filling my coffee.  The biscuit was even better than reported.  I particularly appreciated the little cups of butter and fresh seasonal jam - not little pats like at a diner, but more than enough for my large biscuit.  The coffee is the best in the neighborhood.  I could easily head to Bang Bang just for a java fix.  In fact, I see a new weekend morning routine!"

The new location in Ravenswood is next door to Over Easy. They have more interior space than the Logan Square location, but I don&#39;t think that they have the cute garden set up. However, there are some two tops at the front looking out onto Damen, a cozy couch and chairs in front of a fireplace, a communal table and then bar style seating towards the back.

I was there at 11:30 am on a Saturday, there was a line to the door (6 people in front of me), but I got through the line and left with pie in hand in under 10 minutes. Their menu of pies is slightly different than the Logan Square location, but that&#39;s not a bad thing, check the website and see what kind of pie you want and go to the location that soothes your pie craving. 

Since I live in Uptown, I am thrilled that there is a location much closer to me so I don&#39;t have to deal with California traffic to get my pie on."

Sadly after coming here I know this isn&#39;t going to be one of my regular spots.

The thing that killed it for me is how little value you get for what they charge. 

I ordered their hot chix sandwich and gladly paid nearly $10 for it because I&#39;ve paid as much for other awesome chicken sandwiches before (the roost &amp; honey butter fried chicken) and have been satisfied. I was expecting the same here, but when my sandwich came out I was seriously shocked at how small it was. The piece of chicken was the size of two chicken nuggets put together. Yeah the ingredients are high quality and it had flavor but I finished the chicken in two bites and was pretty much left with half the biscuit. 

I also had the grits and you would have to be crazy to think that&#39;s worth $8. 

The pie is great, I&#39;ll give them that, and I may come back for that even at $5 a slice but you couldn&#39;t force me to $10 on a sandwich that small again."

I just came back from European trip and saw this opened across the street. I like desserts and decide to give a try. After paying almost 6 dollar after tax for a pie of key lime pie, my first bite makes me wanna spit it out. It&#39;s very very very sweet. But I guess that&#39;s just how American desserts are.I don&#39;t want to be mean but after having all kinds of desserts in Asia and Europe. Nowhere else makes desserts as sweet as in America and this pie is even at the top of American dessert sweetness level. 

Price. This is definitely overpriced. People are just overpaying for the hipster atmosphere. 5-6 dollar a piece? This is what I pay for world class pastries. In Paris, a piece from top pastry shops is about 5-6 euros, which given exchange right now, it almost the same as 5-6 dollars. If you don&#39;t know Pierre Herme and Sadaharu Aoki, google them. That&#39;s how I want exchange  my 6 dollar for."

We got a slice of their key lime pie  to go for later in the day and all I have to say is WOW! I&#39;m not a huge fan of key lime pie so I usually only take a bite of my boyfriends, but this time I was upset I didn&#39;t get my own slice. It was REALLY good. He loves key lime pie and orders it from anywhere that has it and he couldn&#39;t believe how good it was from bang bang.

We wish the food had been as good as the warm, friendly welcome we received from the lovely young woman at the counter. Since we don&#39;t eat meat we were happy to discover the non-meat options. We were very disappointed with the biscuits and veg gravy, both overly salted and gravy extremely spicy. I was so looking forward to a light, fluffy biscuit. It was dense, almost gummy, overly rich and fatty and very salty! We also shared a yogurt parfait which was very good with their homemade vegan granola, but it was just glopped into a bowl so I&#39;m not sure how it qualified as a parfait. My husband liked his coffee and my iced tea with lavender lemonade was delicious but I was disappointed that it was served in a plastic cup. 

Another thing that really bothered me was the lack of good ventilation! The whole place smelled of bacon and sausage fat. (I guess some people wouldn&#39;t have a problem with this.) I will have to return at another time to sample their pie. Hopefully it will be better than the biscuits! I may be a snob, but biscuits should be tender, just like a pie crust or why bother consuming the calories!

I liked the plain biscuit with the phenomenal strawberry jam best. The lemonade was very refreshing on a humid day. 

The fancy grits were not quite worth the price. I liked the sausage on the biscuit, but thought it was better just simply eaten with the homemade jam. 

The seating with a giant table in the middle and high bar stools are a little odd. Try to snag one of the little tables in the front if you can.

This establishment in Logan Square has become a staple beverage location for my fiancé and I. They have a smaedium (small + medium)  cocktail list that is not overbearing in ingredients or convoluted in verbiage that you either can&#39;t pronounce or have  no clue what that word means unless you research it on google for the next 15 minutes. 

My favorite drink is the &#39;Where there is Smoke&#39; which the most divine concoction of mezcal meets fire from the fresh Serrano chile slices with a more subtle citrus end note. 

My fiancé loves the &#39;Sierra Madre&#39; which is also a smokey sotal margarita drink that has a front end of a perfect tang from the lime and orange liqueur with a slight peppery finish. 


All the other drinks have yet to disappoint as well as this place. 


The guacamole which has the correct limited ingredient of lime,chile, red onion and cilantro. Also is served with a side of totopos (yes, the correct pronunciation for fried tortilla slices). 

We have also has the Asada, Cochinital Pibil and Puerco tacos.... Phenomenal!! All the tacos were no skimped on meat either. 


Simple. Delicious and authentic Mexican cuisine. 



Fun fact- they&#39;ll bring you more chips to scoop your leftover guacamole without having to ask for more

And all their corn tortillas are hand-pressed like your Mexican grandmother would in her kitchen.

The food has gone thru several transitions between executive chefs, so the food is a 3.5. Not bad, just not to the same level as their drinks. 

Perhaps my vision is blurred- figuratively, because their drink menu is that good. This by far is one of the most underrated drink selection in town.

My advise? Go for the drinks and appetizer s, and stumble on several hours after drinking to another spot to soak up the booze."

I particularly liked the tortilla soup, with its spicy complex flavors, and the puerco tacos, which were rich, smoky, and full of flavor, some of the best pork tacos in the city.  

The cocktails are still outstanding, particularly the Oaxacan Old Fashioned and Fast Friends, which is simply stellar, one of the best cocktails I&#39;ve had in past year.

If you are in a drinking mood, the cocktails will run up your bill, but if you just need tacos, carry out is a delicious option that is easy on the wallet."

We started off with ordering guacamole and a couple of salsa. The guac was great and very fresh. You could tell it was just made in house and not from those premade contraptions come other places follow. The salsas were pretty darn good as well.

It&#39;s hard to pick a favorite but the cocktails were a clear standout while we were there. If you like mezcal, do yourself a favor and order the &#34;where there&#39;s smoke&#34; drink as soon as you get it. I can&#39;t remember the last time I had such a good mezcal drink.

If I could change one think (and this is extremely nit-picky) I&#39;d ask to get larger water glasses. Small thing - I know- but the used being used resemble shot glasses more than actual table glasses for water. I think all of the people in my group must have refilled their glasses 15 or so times.

Either way, Masa Azul was amazing. I can&#39;t wait to go back!"

This lively spot tucked along a rather sparse stretch of Diversey Ave (between California and Sacramento) raises the bar for what is possible in the realm of Mexican-inspired drink and small-plate food (botanas). 

I can think of no conceivable reason why this place isn&#39;t getting 5-star reviews across the board, because few eateries sweat the details with the level of care, attention, and accessibility that Masa Azul brings to the table. And somehow, they do this while remaining rooted in good hospitality (always attentive without being fawning), and obvious love for the rich traditions of Mexican drink/cuisine. (My Puebla-born mamacita would approve, in other words.)

The cocktails are creative, nuanced, and served over proper blocks of ice. If you want to get schooled on mescal, tequila, sotol, bacanora, and raicilla (in all their bewilderingly well-crafted permutations), this is the place. Or, if you just want to saddle up for a palette-tickling variation on an old favorite like a margarita, cuba libre, or old-fashioned, prepare to be pleasantly surprised.

The food is equally well considered, often drizzled or garnished in colors that are as colorful as they are delicious. One favorite: the tostones (fried/flattened plantains), smeared with a fresh green salsa that pairs well with them and provides its own universe of delight.

As for the tacos, the tortillas are made in-house and come in pairs. After trying about half the selection available, I can say that some of them hooked me right away, and even the ones I didn&#39;t love completely were intriguing and carefully composed. An example of how brilliant this place is: the aguacate tacos feature batter-dipped, fried chunks of avocado. This is an obvious win for avocado-lovers everywhere.

Even after half a dozen visits, I still haven&#39;t properly delved into the rest of the menu.¿Huaraches, tortas, chilaquiles? Damn! But hey, sometimes you have to leave room to explore, right? Let&#39;s just say it&#39;s become one of my favorite special stops in the neighborhood (and my girlfriend&#39;s go-to place for a hot date with me, cheyaaaa).

(I should add that they are also happy to accommodate whatever food sensitivities you might have, so those with worries about spicy food should still find it welcoming. Just ask!)"

Tequila, mezcal and sotol. Desert plant from the agave family makes yummy cocktails. Of all the spirits that are out there, this agrees with me. I really enjoyed my drinks here and a good 10+ selection to choose from ranging  sweet-refreshing, smoky or spicy. 

Food is upscale mexican street food, like tortas and tacos. Most items are under $10, so not terribly pricey, but most portions are a bit small and things starts to add up fast when you&#39;re hungry.

I&#39;ve been here a number of times and previously it has always been great. On weeknights when it&#39;s not super busy you can chat with the bartenders who are super knowledgable and friendly, enjoy great food and service, have a tequila flight, and have a great time. I walked in last night (a Friday night) expecting to write a 5 star review.

Some things have changed here. The menu seemed entirely different. I heard they have a new chef. Our waitress was not excellent. I&#39;ll break it down - margaritas were awesome, salsa and chips were good, ceviche was ok, tacos were small but tasty. The menu is a little confusing. It&#39;s broken up into starters, tacos, and tortas en mas. It&#39;s not clear how much food you should order. One plate of 2x tacos is not enough, but a torta might be. 

Bottom line - I wish this place was as good last night as it has been in the past."

I&#39;ve been eating -- and drinking -- here for a couple years, and it&#39;s easily my most frequented fine-dining restaurant. 

I love Masa Azul because the food is delicious, unique, and affordable. I love Masa Azul because the staff is welcoming, attentive, and flexible. And I love Masa Azul because management hosts events that support charitable work in rural Mexico. But even if none of that were true, I would love Masa Azul simply because they host the best selection of agave and agave-related spirits for at least a 100-mile radius.

Plenty of places offer mezcal cocktails, sure. But the real way to drink mezcal -- and raicilla, bacanora, and sotol, and, yes, even tequila -- is neat, like a fine armagnac, cognac, or scotch. And, no, most places do not have the quality spirits that invite neat tastings. Masa has a wall worth sipping through, and the diversity of flavors derived from the varietals of agave represented on that wall are broader than those offered by any other spirits. So head in, drink up, and have your ride home planned before you&#39;re too far into the woods (desert?) to back out."

The cocktails here are unique &amp; amazing.  The food is always fabulous.   I am sooooo happy each time I walk in here and it&#39;s crowded.  Love their bar in the window and the rustic decor.
Here&#39;s a glimpse into our most recent visit...

Our group of four was both thirsty and hungry - so we did some damage here a couple of weeks ago.  

Botanas / Appetizers : we kicked the night off by indulging in the Sopitos, Esquites, Ceviche &amp; Guacamole.  The sopitos ($8) were warm, oozing with flavor and a really nice start to a fabulous meal.  The shrimp ceviche ($8) was incredibly fresh with a perfect amount of lime &amp; cilantro.  The Esquites ($5) - oh how I love thee!!!  Who would have known that corn could be so good?!?!  I could have eaten bowls of this and been completely content.  I really don&#39;t know how corn, cheese &amp; chili powder can be so amazing, but it is.  Really.  Take my word and order two.  Or more.  You won&#39;t regret it!

The tacos come two to an order for $5 - 6 per plate and they are loaded!  You will not mind paying $3 per taco here, I promise!  They were out of the Tinga, but I&#39;ve had it here before and it does not disappoint.  On this adventure, we stuffed ourselves until we couldn&#39;t breathe with the following taco fiesta (2 tacos per order!):

Tacos de Champignon $6  (ancho-roasted mushrooms, cilantro, queso) 
Tacos de Jalapeno Relleno $6 (loved the pickled carrot on these)
Tacos de Puerco $6 (braised pork shoulder with some yummy caramelized onion)
Tacos de Chorizo y Papas $5 (oh how I love chorizo)
Tacos de Cochinita Pibil $6 (braised pork with a nice habanero kick)

plus... we had to get the Chile Relleno.  The Chile Relleno was good, but not as fabulous as I remember when they used to serve it as a full entree.  They now serve it with Mexican rice, but they used to plate it with a different rice (white rice with cilantro, I think??) and I really loved it the old way.  So I wouldn&#39;t be sad if some time they decide to swap that rice out!

Dessert - we had the flan and a special dessert they had (something with blueberries).  Both were great.

Last, but certainly not least - the cocktails....WOW!

I&#39;m almost embarrassed to admit that my husband and another friend of ours each had 3 - count &#39;em - THREE Mezcal Last Words each.  Keep in mind, we were there a good couple of hours :)  

I LOVE the kick the serrano gives their &#39;Where there is smoke...&#39;.  After starting with that, I flipped to the Micheladas.  Despite how simple a beverage this is, there are not a lot of restaurants who make these right, in my humble opinion - but they definitely do here!  Ice cold, spicy and absolutely refreshing.  A perfect match to the fare on their menu.

We&#39;ve been here about a half dozen times and we&#39;ll be back dozens more.  Masa Azul is a solid choice for both drinks &amp; dinner!!"

For cocktails I tried the Heart of the Dead and the Where there is Smoke...Yum.  Completely different flavors, both so good.  If you like sweet drinks Heart of the Dead is perfect, and Where there is Smoke is indeed smoky, yet well-balanced.

The hubby and I split several items:  Esquites, Tostones, and several tacos (rajas, chorizo and papas, champignon).  Loved the esquites and the tacos.  The tostones were okay.  My husband&#39;s favorite was the chorizo and papas tacos, I haven&#39;t decided.

The waitress went above and beyond for us, the food and cocktails were delicious and the bill was more than reasonable for what we ordered. Going for tacos while expecting to have a pretty heavy night of drinking is always a good idea because tacos aren&#39;t too heavy and (a plus) cheap. 

Because of this experience, myself and two of the friends I had gone with before wanted to go out to Masa Azul again. But it was almost like we were in a completely different restaurant. A waitress we had had the worst &#34;I hate my job and don&#39;t want to be here&#34; attitude. We got sat in the back corner of the restaurant, which were the worst seats but we weren&#39;t going to complain. We waited 15 minutes before we even got a glass of WATER and then she ran off before we even got a chance to ask for an appetizer. So I flagged down another waitress, really losing my patience, and asked for guacamole and elote. I wouldn&#39;t have been so annoyed if the place was packed, but it&#39;s a very small restaurant with at least three waiters working and the seats weren&#39;t even full. 

The only time she came to us was to get our order after the other lady took our appetizer order and someone else brought it out to us. So we gave our order to our very unpleasant waitress. The food was ok. My friends were not very pleased with what they ordered and mine was just alright. Nothing like what we experienced the last time we came. 

When we were done, we sat patiently for our non-busy non-existent waitress. We were getting so mad at how long she was taking and how much neglect she had given us the whole night we were so close to just walking out of the restaurant. I flagged the other lady down AGAIN who had been very kind and then our waitress FINALLY brought the bill. We tipped her nothing and we don&#39;t plan on returning.

It&#39;s a shame because of the first experience we had but I am not willing to take the risk because of how poor the service was the second time around and the food being meh."

Drinks are on point!! Had the opportunity to sit at the bar last time I was there and was chatting with one of the bartenders there (Brian) and he was just so passionate about the drinks he makes. He talked about Mezcal and Whiskey with a great passion and truly recommended good drinks based on liquors I said I enjoyed. Sad thing is he mentioned he was leaving this restaurant at the end of the year which just means I have to come back and try the new bartender drinks!! According to some emails I received there will be new cocktails at the beginning of the year :D"

The food was very good. I had the house made guacamole and salsa with chips to start and the mushroom tacos as my dinner. The greatest part about this place was how accommodating they were. We had a group of 10 people, and our waitress was attentive and patient, and so nice. We even brought in our own chocolate cake with candles so that we could sing happy birthday. They whisked it back to the kitchen, cut it into slices, and served it to the table. Masa Azul is not very big, so make sure to secure a reservation. There were about 12 people standing around near the small bar in front, waiting for tables to open up. Street parking is fairly easy to find as well."

The drinks alone give this place 5 stars. We tried a total of 6 different cocktails and they were all so delicious. I especially love the spicier ones. Literally the best tequila cocktails! Recommend Heart of the Dead and From Dusk Til&#39; Dawn. So delicious!  We also ate chicken and vegetarian tacos, which were also delicious. The restaurant has a great ambiance with darker lighting. We had to wait for a table, which was fine since there were open bar seats and we were happy to have a yummy cocktail before sitting at our table. We will definitely be back!"

Masa Azul could be a case in point.

The food was just great, through and through.  Shrimp cocktail had flavorful chunks of shrimp and avocado in a flavorful, herby, gazpacho-like tomato broth.  Chile de arbol salsa was thick, deep, and spicy, with excellent extremely fresh chips.  Goat tacos and the pork in pineapple sauce were both flavorful, interesting, and satisfying.  And a roasted-mushroom huarache was the true standout.  There aren&#39;t a lot of vegetarian items on the menu, but I would take a vegeterian here just to eat these mushrooms.

But even better than the great food were the cocktails.  I have never had so many uniformly delicious and interesting things done with mezcal.  Mezcal cooked into wood chips, mezcal mixed with campari and hibiscus rimmed with habanero salt, mezcal with a mysteriously intense and unsweetened orange juice.  (The cocktails without mezcal were delicious too.)  Everything we tried -- the make-your-own-cocktail, the tropical cocktails, the flight of wood-aged cocktails -- was a knockout success.

I can&#39;t yet say it&#39;s better than the Violet Hour, which might win on sheer impeccable variety, but it&#39;s better than the best cocktails I&#39;ve had in almost any other city."

masa-azul-chicago,Erick N.,zH3dt6CdiHIvmfsDHcqTpA,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,260,4,EXJAvnAtdLYGVOZoyV5LEg,5.0,2015-02-22,"Masa Azul has become one of my favorite venues near my new residence. Such a friendly, neighborhood vibe. Came here for the first time as a solo diner while my wife was on a business trip and had so much fun I brought her in the next week - already been back a couple more times since, all in the span of a few weeks.

Masa Azul is not the place if you are looking for inexpensive Mexican food, giant burritos or Americanized ethnic cuisine. While the ambiance is laid back and comfortable the food is upscale, well executed cuisine. Portions are on the small side with the emphasis on quality over quantity. Expect to order multiple small plates of food (my wife and I have found that the two of us sharing six to seven dishes is optimal for a full meal). The ingredients are high end and the food well executed. 

While the food is among the better Mexican venues I have dined at in Chicago, what elevates Masa Azul even further is the people and the cocktail program. The owner (Jason) is often tending bar and is such a warm, down-to-Earth person; the staff we have met are also such genuine, friendly people. While the dining room looks beautiful, my wife and I have really enjoyed sitting up to the bar and chatting with Jason, the other bartenders as well as other patrons bellying up to he bar (Masa Azul really seems to attract a friendly bunch of fellow diners).

Jason&#39;s cocktail program is as good as most cocktail bars in Chicago. As one might expect , the emphasis is on tequila and mezcal based concoctions. The drinks are well balanced and utilize quality spirits; definitely an elevated cocktail program - in fact so good that it is worth coming in just for cocktails (though you&#39;d be wise ordering some bites too since the cuisine is so delicious and pairs well with the beverages). Expect upscale versions of classic tequila based drinks (i.e. margaritas) and riffs on other classic beverages (such as negronis, manhattans etc. subbing tequila or mezcal as the base spirit). Two of our four visits have been for full meals whereas two were mainly for the drinks and snacks (you can order from the full menu while seated at the bar). 

Food wise definitely order a couple different tacos; some of the best I have consumed. My favorite so far is the tinga (smoky chicken thighs) but I have sampled several across my visits and all have been fantastic. The esquites ( a sweet, savory, spicy and tangy corn based dish with cheese, garlic and chili) is our favorite appetizer and is amazing - so delicious, definitely a must order. The tortilla soup is also a great starter, especially on a chilly Chicago evening. For something a bit more hearty the flank steak torta hits the spot and the chilaquiles are also ridiculously good (I recommend adding chorizo to take it up even another notch). What is nice is so much of the cuisine is made from scratch, i.e. the tortillas - even the chips for the guacamole.The only dishes I have not been crazy about were the ceviche and the plantain tostones - not bad by any means, just not quite as dazzling as the other dishes. 

Beverage wise if you like some heat in your drink the China Poblana (featuring Ancho Reyes, Cynar and Mezcal Joven) is one of my top five favorite cocktails in the city. So amazing that I am craving one now! The Oaxacan Old Fashioned is my second favorite and if in the mood for something less boozy the Where there is smoke... (like a margarita but with a kick). Jason is also adept at creating some off menu beverages based on feedback you provide as to your preferences/aversions - and has been spot on when doing this. 

Very happy to have found this venue; as someone really appreciates Chicago&#39;s vast dining scene and loves trying new places, it is not easy to win me over as a regular, but this is a restaurant I plan on returning to frequently."

When we arrived, we were immediately seated in the only two top left open since the place was jumpin&#39;! 
I agree with others that the decor is minimal but I liked it and my boyfriend even commented that it was similar to the decor in our house, simple, sleek.  

After receiving the menu, which is tiny. ..  I was excited since typically, a small menu indicates to me that anything you choose will be awesome...  Unfortunately,  I learned that is not always the case.  We started with drinks, I had the explorador which was inventive and delicious and my boyfriend had the velador (sp?) It was essentially a $8+ shot, he said it wasn&#39;t bad but he also opted for a solid modelo negro on the next round. 

On to the food, let me preface this by saying that we&#39;re Latin food snobs, not only because we both mexican but also because we&#39;ve tried restaurants all around the world and still nothing compares to my favorite (hacienda y cocina- cabo san lucas).  

For appetizers we did the guac and salsa and they were both solid, chips were just how I like them, fresh and crispy. The salsa could have used a bit of spice since it had no heat but great flavor.  For entrees, I had the puerco and my boyfriend a chicken dish that he said was just ok, since the meat was layered over a soggy sope or plantain.   My pork was the larger disappointment.  Although cooked really well and super tender, the dish itself was one note, I could barely decipher the pork from the potatoes it was mixed with.   I think something as small as being served with fresh tortillas would have made a world of difference. 

 Alas, I like the overall vibe of the place and with so many other great reviews we will probably give it another shot since its very close to our house and the server said the menu is in constant rotation, which is a plus. Lastly, price is a bit on the high side.  While I don&#39;t have a problem paying for quality I think the portion sizes didn&#39;t warrant the prices. For two people each having two drinks, two entrees and chips, salsa and guacamole, our tab before tip was $80.00."

We had a reservation for 8pm and had to wait around 20 or 30 minutes for a table when we arrived at 8pm.  The tacos are tiny--the size of silver dollars.  They have braised meat or vegetables on top of very thick corn tortillas; some come with a minuscule sprinkle of cheese or pickled vegetables (carrots, red onion).  None of the components were very well seasoned, however.  If the tortilla contains no salt and your meat is under seasoned like it was last Saturday night, you&#39;re in for a bland meal like ours.  Even the pickled onions were unbalanced--they tasted just of vinegar, no sugar or spices that we could taste.  We tried the pork, chicken, steak, mushroom, and chile rellenos tacos.  The best of the bunch was the mushroom which actually had some flavor.  

The ceviche that my friends shared was also good, though served with two massive fried corn tortillas (about 2-3 times the size of the tacos), making the ceviche very awkward to eat, even when breaking the fried tortillas apart.  

Also, in addition to the food being mediocre, the music was very loud and it was crowded.  Usually that means the food is amazing but in this case, it just meant you&#39;re seated close enough to your neighbors at any nearby table to hear every bit of their conversation.  This is why I wager the music was blaring but it worked against them in our estimation of the restaurant.  

In the end we weren&#39;t mad enough to complain or send the tiny plates back.  We just won&#39;t come back, can&#39;t recommend it, and would go to just about any nearby Mexican restaurant instead next time we&#39;re in the mood for Mexican."

After a nice walk exploring Logan square we came back about 6:15pm.  There were a couple people already seated when we arrived.  I loved the dark lighting of the place.

The dishes here are perfect sizes to try different things and share with your party.   The staff was very attentive and recommended great dishes and drinks.  Everything was so good we ordered one more plate before we were finished.   I loved that even though we took our sweet time they didn&#39;t rush us to get out.

I am a huge fan of anything located a few blocks from my house and I wanted to make sure that I wasn&#39;t just viewing it through rose colored glasses.  After my second meal there, I can say with 100% certainty that this place kicks a lot of a$$.  We have gone there pretty early on Sundays so it hasn&#39;t been busy, but I&#39;ve heard that it buzzes on other nights.  THe dining room is small and intimate and the smells coming out of the kitchen are intoxicating.  The owner, Jason, has been skillfully handling the bar while the chef, Jonathan, has been crushing it in the kitchen  when we&#39;ve been there.  

We have been there twice and been impressed with the service.  One of these times was for my birthday dinner with a party of 9. On both occasions, they have been warm, friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient, which is a recipe for a great service experience.

They only serve tequila and mezcal here, so I thought I thought I would just be having margs.  I went to school in New Mexico so many years of drinking bad tequila have completely turned me off to any libation containing it, but they have made me a believer.  They have taken many classics and adapted them to tequila and mezcal and some of the flavors that they have created are stunning.  I recommend the Heart of the Dead or the Mexican FIring Squad for those who like their drinks a little sweeter or fruity.  For those who like a little more bite, try the Oaxacan Old Fashioned or the Latin Manhattan, but my best recommendation is to just tell Jason what you like and let him or his staff do their magic.  

The food...  oh lord, the food.  I feel that they make the best chilaquiles that I have had in the city.  They can be ordered with or without chorizo and they have the perfect amount of citrus to make them heavenly.  Aside from stating that everything on the menu is amazing, I can recommend the Huaraches.  Again, just toss out some flavors that you like and they can recommend something awesome.  ORDER THE CHURRO DONUT HOLES WITH THE LIGHTLY SPICY CHOCOLATE SAUCE.  Sweet baby Jesus...  I can&#39;t even talk about them.

Final verdict: another example of the burgeoning Logan Square culinary scene, one of the many reasons why I am happy to call it home.  The food will make you mmmmm and the bill won&#39;t make you cringe!"

My...I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s my boyfriend, and I decided to give it a shot last night.  We were seated easily, it&#39;s not a huge place but it&#39;s extremely loud.  The menu is fairly small but we ordered the guacamole right away, we were starving.
*side note - the only offer Mexican Coke, Sprite, and a lemon-lime concoction the bartender will make at your request should you want a non-alcoholic beverage.
The appetizer came and it was super fresh, not overly done as most restaurants tend to do with their guac, but it was missing something...

I ordered the Carnitas tacos and he ordered the Asada tacos and a torta (he was a lot hungrier than I).  We swapped tacos (they come two to an order) and dug in...

We both started with the same taco, the Asada, and while the meat itself was extremely tender, easy to bite into, it was missing something, too.  The taco itself had a ton of meat so we didn&#39;t feel like that was the missing link...the meat itself was just missing something.

Onto the Carnitas....the exact same review as the Asada.  A ton of meat but the pork was missing something.  We couldn&#39;t quite put our finger on it.

I was stuffed and he slowly nibbled on his Torta...which yielded the same review as the tacos.  It was ok but it was missing something.  We did sit and talk for quite a while after we were done eating, we weren&#39;t drinking, we just sat and talked and talked until we noticed we were one of two parties still in the restaurant.  No one tried to hurry us out, they simply refilled our waters when they noticed they were low and monitored from afar so we didn&#39;t feel like we were keeping them there...I would like to thank our server and the rest of those working for that...

Overall, this Masa Azul was ok.  The tacos are hefty, however, they seem to fall just a bit short.  We were initially looking to hit L&#39;Pastor but they&#39;re closed on Tuesdays and Masa Azul was a decent back-up but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be returning."

We ordered the Guacamole, Esquites and Tostones as apps. The Guacamole was pretty basic, not the greatest one I&#39;ve had but not bad either. The Esquites on the other hand were REMARKABLE, great combination of flavors too bad it was a small portion. The tostones were just alright.

We decided to do tacos all around, and ended up ordering several times because the tacos are so small. I ordered the Carne Asada and Baja Shrimp Tacos and they were amazing! It didn&#39;t matter that  they were so small because they were delicious. My friend ordered the Chilaquiles and she was not impressed, I tried them and they were not that great. She had to order herself an order of Baja Shrimp Tacos to make up for the chilaquiles. 

For dessert we had the chocoflan and it was delightful. The drinks were very well made, we had the Batanga, Michelada and Heart of the Dead, all delicious and strong.

SERVICE: Our server Ashley was great and attentive.  As it got busier, she did a great job considering the number of tables that had patrons.

AMBIANCE: As others have mentioned, it&#39;s a fairly intimate place and somewhat minimalistic.  Nothing to rave about but they do have some cool masks that, in retrospect, I wish I had gotten some pictures of.

FOOD: We ordered the guacamole to start.  It was just OK and I think it was overdone with lime but that may just be a personal preference.  I&#39;ve never been a big fan of lime on my food but it is considered a must in typical Mexican fare.  We ordered the Torta de Carne Asada as the main entree and this packed some major heat. My Irish/German fiancee could hardly finish half of hers.  I would recommend to the owners that they put some type of warning on the menu.  Personally, I thought it was just right but I handle spicy food."

I could not find the chicken wings and goat tacos that everyoone was raving about.  Aside from that the place itself is very well put together. I think it could use some more wall treatments as it was kind of bare but nice space. The bar is directly up front and I get a kick out of seeing the young lady mixing drinks since she&#39;s on key and makes it look like a production. 

As for the food I had the guacamole for starters. Very good and close to natural with nice avocado chunks and fresh chips.  I also had the scallops which were pan fried perfectly but combined with flavors that interested me. I know there were pineapples and a puree that seemed like it was squash but can&#39;t remember. The huarache de tinga was just alright to me. Just a fancy sounding taco. 

I feel like this place is very contemporary from serving size to presentation but I was glad to at least try it. I think one more visit and I wouldn&#39;t really have to come back after that.

If anything I have to go back for the ghost pepper salsa."

I won&#39;t give a walk through of the menu. do yourself a favor tho, avoid the tortilla soup; it&#39;s more a bowl of hot enchilada sauce (large bowl, little soup at that)

on this last (last) visit I ordered the torta de asada, a $12 sandwich. It&#39;s a large very basic sandwich of asada, tomatoes, avocado (maybe lettuce). it&#39;s by no means a bad torta, just that you can find better tasting tortas for $8 literally a block away. it&#39;s not clear why the menu is over priced. it certainly isn&#39;t for the service, I mean unless you value frigid interpersonal skills, a limited knowledge of the menu (apathy I&#39;m guessing), and for fuck-alls sake the inability to pronounce the menu. Example: the waitress told me they were not serving a particular dish that night. well, they were indeed serving that dish, she just didn&#39;t understand the name of the dish as it was pronounced correctly....uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh are you f*cking serious...

also, there&#39;s the aesthetic bit. I know this is picky and I&#39;m actually super down for an experience to be no more than paying for food and putting food in mouth, but if you&#39;re marketing yourself as a dimly lit dine-in/tequila bar with $$ menu....yeah there&#39;s more to the experience cuz that&#39;s why we&#39;re there! and not at L&#39;Patron (where we should have been haha)
the presentation of the dishes were amiss, take the large torta for example, it&#39;s placed on a large white dinner plate, when it should easily be in a basket (gastropub style) or cut in half and plated on an appropriate sized rectangular plate (dude we&#39;re talking about Mexican street food here) also they serve their food...with the stupidest steak knife I&#39;ve seen - it&#39;s completely stainless steel, with an exaggerated ergonomic grip, and it weighs considerably less than the dinner fork which itself is noticeable and annoying.  **i mentioned the tortilla soup earlier...it&#39;s served in a f*cking vat and in small portion. 

&#34;Masa Azul is like sex with that one Ex; tired, uninspired, and enjoyed begrudgingly&#34;

But you wooed me with your sophistication of tequilas and memorable foods creating you as a destination in my mind whether I am in this neck of the woods or not.

But let&#39;s reflect on where the romance began.  Was it when I pulled open your unassuming front door and found myself in a contemporary dining room . . .so unexpected for this stretch of Diversey?  The clean lines, comfortable seating area and wonderful servers (thanks Jen) just made me feel immediately comfortable and welcome.

The drink list was beckoning to me with names of drinks like &#34;Mexican Firing Squad&#34; and &#34; Latin Manhattan&#34; which had my dining partner and me saying yes to tequila in ways we had never thought we would!

And that food?  You had me at hello with your rich, fresh guacamole and ceviche served with crispy chips.  But when I tasted the sopitos de panza with that crispy pork belly ,my fate was sealed.

But you didn&#39;t stop your wooing there.  Oh no.  You went on with your tacos . . .letting me choose my fate from birria (one of my favs) to braised pork to the shrimp tacos which my dining companion still raves about!  

And then on to the entrees of grilled flatiron steak which was perfectly prepared to the chicken breast which came with some amazing mole and corn all combining to an amazing taste which is usually hard to say about mere chicken!!

Dinner for two with plenty of drinks ran about $120 which was perfect for the quality and quantity of food that we had.  And if you drive- there is street parking readily available.  And if you go in the Summer- check out their patio which is the perfect place to enjoy the delights of the food.

Yes . . I admit it.  I have fallen hard for this place.  But then again . .I am a girl who likes to be &#34;wooed&#34;.  And that is just what the food and service will do here."

The cocktails are all winners and the owner incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about tequila. Quiet music allows for lingering conversation. Clean bathrooms, clean bar, great for groups or romantic dates.

Sure you could go to any number of other Mexican restaurants in the area and get a pretty tasty meal at a fraction of the price. What you get at Maza Azul is an overall dining experience. You walk into a beautiful establishment, with fancy cocktails, inventive food and good looking patrons. 

They have tequila flights served in tall champagne glasses which sets this restaurant apart. Of the several flights to choose from, my favorite was the Ode to Enrique Fonseca. Of the cocktails, I read about the Pablo which was great but definitely a dessert drink. If I had a do over, I would have preferred the Gypsy and ordered the Pablo toward the end of the meal.

We ate family style and everything we had was fantastic but the stand outs were the scallops and the chilaquiles. I could eat the tempura avocado forever. My meat eating dinner dates preferred the goat over the pork shoulder tacos.

A nice place to bring a dinner date you are trying to impress or out of town friends/family."

My husband discovered it during an online search for Chicago&#39;s best guacamole, as it&#39;s become our latest food obsession.

When we walked in, I was immediately taken by the soft candlelight that illuminates the room just enough for you to see where you&#39;re going. The music playing in the background wasn&#39;t too loud but very cool.

Of course, we started with the guacamole, and I PROMISE IT&#39;S THE BEST WE&#39;VE HAD IN CHICAGO. A smoky kick, a hint of lime and amazingly chunky texture. I almost licked the bowl.

Also amazing: the pork shoulder tacos. The meat was fall-apart tender and flavorful.

Also amazing: the fried shrimp torta. The shrimp were plump and not overly-battered. The cheese on this sandwich packs a punch, and the avocado spread provides a perfect balance to the spiciness of the shrimp.

Warning: My husband ordered the carne asada torta, and while the meat looked perfectly cooked, he literally burned his lips off, it was that spicy. This sandwich is not for the faint of heart, so if you don&#39;t like spicy, order something else.

We will definitely return to Masa Azul as soon as we can, though I&#39;m hoping this review makes it harder and harder to get in! They deserve the business, no doubt about it."

The second time was for their lengthy tequila list, which meant I&#39;d have no trouble convincing my partner in crime to dine here. When the opportunity presented itself for a double date with some friends, one of whom is a sucker for good tequila, I didn&#39;t hesitate to suggest Masa Azul.

Picking a place that none of us has tried always makes me me a little nervous; my hesitation was quickly put at ease when I saw how packed the place was. You really don&#39;t want to try coming here without a reservation, there isn&#39;t much room to wait. We waited briefly for our table and used the time to figure out what drinks we&#39;d get. If I had one complaint about the overall experience it&#39;s that it gets loud; fortunately, we snagged a semi-secluded table, which helped buffer some of the noise.

We started out with a round of cocktails; I went with the Black Betty, my friend the Audrey Horne and the guys each got the You Don&#39;t See this Everyday flight. I liked both of the cocktails and was happy to trade with my friend who wasn&#39;t enamored with hers. For my second, I got the Heart of the Dead, which was the standout of the three. The guys were impressed with their flights and from what I tried, it was tasty and unusual - aptly named. Our server was very knowledgeable of the drink menu, laying down some serious info on the tequilas and recommending which order to consume the flight. She also helped steer them to a good palate-cleansing beer before they resumed their tequila consumption. Considering how lengthy the tequila menu is (longer than many wine lists), this is no small feat.

The food menu is small; divided into three sections - small plates, soup/salad, and entrees. My biggest complaint about many small plates places is that they put too much on the menu; here, the menu was well curated and executed perfectly. We started with the cochinita, baja shrimp, and birria tacos, the octopus tostada and the Mexican scotch egg. I tried the tostada and shrimp tacos, the latter being my favorite. The tostada was good, the arbol chile gave it the right amount of heat, but I felt the octopus flavor was a bit eclipsed by the avocado. I also tried the habanero salsa that accompanied the cochinita tacos; it was amazing how they were able to cut the heat and make it so flavorful. All in all, the starters won high praise.

For our entrees, the guys ordered the bistec with ancho potatoes and the ladies, the camarones with cotija grits. Again, these plates won rave reviews. The shrimp dish was excellent; nice heat from the chipotle peppers, great garlicky flavor from the pesto both balanced the rich, creaminess of the grits. Unexpectedly, the guys agreed the ancho potatoes were some of the best mashed potatoes they&#39;ve had. To cap it off we had the churros with a chile chocolate sauce; good, but a think the spice to sweetness was slightly out of balance - too much spice, in my opinion.

We left Masa Azul quite happy. Great drinks, great food, attentive and knowledgeable service made it an all-around win."

My husband loves tequila and we all love food. We made a reservation for 8 on a Saturday. I&#39;m glad we did- the place was packed! We were seated a little  after a reservation.The restaurant was packed and loud. This is not an intimate or romantic setting. Luckily we were able to sit in the back and the noise was a bit contained. 

We naturally started off with cocktails. I ordered the Audrey Horne and luckily for me, my friend liked it. I did not. It turns out I did not like the tequila/mezcal liquor that was in it. To be candid, I am not a huge tequila fan and their other selection is limiting (I had wine next). The others liked their drinks and were impressed at the depth and range of the tequila list. The waitress was knowledgable about the tequilas and was able to explain a lot of the details. I will note that service was a bit slow, but they were busy.

The food was fantastic. We started off with the small plates first. We ordered the shrimp, pork and goat tacos. They were all delicious- I liked the shrimp and the goat the best. The meat was so tender and juicy. The accompanying salsas were good- some heat but not overpowering.  We also got a Mexican scotch egg salad- it had nice chorizo around a soft boiled egg. It was different but delicious.

My friend and I also split the octopus tostada. It was my least favorite thing we ate and the only thing I wouldn&#39;t order again. It was not balanced at all.  My first bite was a chunk of chile arbol. I can&#39;t comment on the octopus itself because all I could taste was the chile. I may have had more chile because the other half seemed to be enjoyed.  

The entrees were a hit. My shrimp and grits entree was executed with perfection. The shrimp were cooked beautifully and marinated in a nice chipotle sauce. The grits were creamy and paired well. The boys got the steak - and boy was it good! Not only was the steak tender, but it had a nice marinade and was served with really good cheesy mashed potatoes. Yummy! It&#39;s a really good thing my husband didn&#39;t mind my wandering fork! 

Even though we were full, I had been eyeing the churro that the table next to us had. They looked so good that I was tempted to take their leftovers (resisted thankfully). The churro itself did not disappoint. Crispy outside with a warm soft inside that exploded with cinnamon. I loved it on its own. The spicy chocolate sauce was a good concept but it should have been sweeter with less of a kick. Overall, it was very good."

I really with the tacos were either a dollar more and came with 3 since they are small or were 1-2 dollars less so they reflected the size.
I also think that drinks here are quite expensive, in this kind of neighborhood there are great places like the whistler and scofflaw where you can get amazing cocktails for even less than they are charging here. The only drinks I can understand having such a high price are the sotol and bacanora drinks since they are rare.
At a table of four with two drinks per person our bill ended up being over 200 dollars which is quite a lot. The restaurant is a $$$ price range but is getting close to a $$$$ price range."

Unlike most gimmicky tequila bars, owner Jason is personally passionate and incredibly knowledgeable about agave spirits and takes great care to offer customers only the authentic products highly regarded by the traditional Mexican growers and distillers, and at very reasonable prices at that. None of the factory mass-produced stuff marketed by corporate America and Las Vegas clubs like Patron or Don Julio. The cocktails are also eminently drinkable and tasty.

Jason is also one of the friendliest guys ever, and will treat you like family no matter what. That is personally what keeps me going back over and over, and bringing all my friends. I had no knowledge of tequilas or mezcals before one of my Mexican friends took me to Masa Azul, and Jason got me hooked with incredible hospitality, staying into the wee hours of the night (totally beyond his duties) pouring me different types of tequilas and explaining each and every one of them and sharing personal stories.

Food is also great and totally affordable. They&#39;ve gone through a few different chefs over the years, but they consistently try to do food that stays true to its Mexican roots and retains traditional flavors but does something creative with them."

I had the Pablo cocktail, actually three of them throughout the course of the night.  It was that good!  Loved the natural flavor of the coconut, but wasn&#39;t too sweet which is how I prefer my cocktails.

We shared the guacamole, shrimp tacos, Huarache de Tinga, and Tostada de Pulpo.  Everything was great and I especially loved the spicy kick each dish had, but servings were smaller than I expected for the price point.

I also have to add that service was great.  I forgot who our waitress was, but she was awesome. I&#39;d love to come back here again, especially to hang with Pablo! :-)"

Alas, Chilapan had a private party happening which left us frantically searching for a new (late) dinner place to try.

Enter: Mas Azul.

We both kind of agreed on it, since we both looked up local reviews of Spanish or Tapas in the area via our android phones using the Yelp app. (Shameless plug, yes.)

I remembered a review which read &#34; try them all&#34;.  I remembered a friend told me, &#34;trying them all is pricey&#34;.  

My advice to you newbies.  Try them all and forget about the cost of it but know that the  cost will be somewhere in the neighborhood of $125 with drinks.  Bring hungry hippos, eager beavers or just willing-to-try-them-all friends.  Every offering on their current menu is worth it.  Every friggin&#39; last tapas offered including the veg ones are bangin&#39;!  Me thinks I have to do this visit again, maybe with a hot date and definitely with more (heavily poured) drinks.

As for the food....SO good. Here are the deets of what we had on their current menu, which seems to change pretty frequently:

Tostones - perfectly crunchy and chewy, complimented well by the aioli and mojo.
Coctel de Camaron - very good, may be a tad too sweet for some
Both Huarache options (chicken and mushroom) - delish!
Birria - solid dish, albeit a little messy

They aren&#39;t open for lunch, aren&#39;t open on Monday&#39;s, don&#39;t stay open very late, and don&#39;t open until 6pm each day.  I don&#39;t get it!  For someone like myself, with a very odd schedule, this makes it difficult for me to frequent... but if I can get through the doors, I&#39;m happy!

Regardless, the drinks are fantastic - they have an amazing selection of tequila and make creative use of it in their delightful cocktails.  If they were open later, I&#39;d come here for a nightcap or appetizer on my way home as often as possible.  The food is of a very high standard, especially for the price, and the decor is lovely.

My favorite thing on the menu is their avocado and green chile soup, which sounds strange, but is an amazing combination of flavors.  All of the seafood dishes are also very good, and I enjoy the tapas-style size of the dishes, so that you can share many dishes and get a full appreciation of the menu.

They also offer tequila flights, so that is another plus!   Finally, I&#39;m pretty sure this is a small business, and it&#39;s in a bit of an awkward location, so support this restaurant guys!"

I thought the place was cute and I love supporting my local restaurants in the area.  They were able to accommodate my large group which I appreciated. My friends and  I were looking forward to tasting the carne asada and the mezcal drinks.  Unfornately, they ran out of carne asada and a few of their drinks.  I don&#39;t understand how this could happen, I&#39;m sure the steak is one of the main sellers which is why I don&#39;t understand how this could happen. The appetizers where okay but I felt that the waitress was trying to make us order 2 of everything instead of one which is what we did, the same with the drink we ordered for the group. The restaurant is small but very cute, the only problem is that it&#39;s extremely loud. It was hard to carry a conversation. 

I thought the waitress was just okay, I don&#39;t know what her name was since she never mentioned it to us.  I asked her for cocktail recommendations and she just told us what the menu said but never recommended anything, she also mentioned the 2 drinks they ran out of. At one point my friend and I spoke to her at the same time and she raises her hand saying &#34;Aww, wait their is 2 of you talking at the same time&#34;, I&#39;m sure this could had been handled differently.  I also asked for salt for my carnitas tacos that were extremely greasy. She then brings me the salt in a small dipping plate and makes sure to tell the reason why it&#39;s in a small plate is because nobody ever asks for salt.  My friends and I just looked at her and when she left we said that was unnecessary and rude.  

I really wanted to like this place but due to these issues, I probably will not be coming back. I&#39;ve had better food and drinks in Logan Square to come back to this restaurant."

My friend and I started w/ the Pablo...and had 2 more each after that.  If you like coconut, you have to try the Pablo - it isn&#39;t too sweet or heavy.  A perfect drink.

We started with the guacamole which had a hint of lime and spice.  The portion is relatively small, but the guac is delicious and the tortilla chips are light and fresh tasting.  For our main entrees - we split two platos and each had a taco.  I had the pork taco (carnitas) since it was the only gluten free taco available.  The taco was a bit spicy, but in a great way.  We also split the Tostada de Pulpo and Huarache de Tinga.  The tostada had lots of avocados and baby octopus.  The octopus was cold, which was surprising, but overall the dish was good.  The huarache was really unique with pulled chicken thigh, cheese, and beans on top of a fresh corn-like pita (gluten free).  The dish was very flavorful and had a hint of spice.  I would highly recommend the Huarache.

None of the dishes are that large here, so I recommend splitting multiple dishes.  We felt like 1 taco + 1 entree + split app was a good amount of food for one person."

My wife and I stopped here around 9:30 for an impromptu date night. My wife was on a knee scooter at the time because she has a broken ankle. A guy working there, might be the owner, I don&#39;t know, saw us coming and helped open the door and get us inside. It&#39;s really dark in there which is fine, helps set the mood. Place wasn&#39;t very busy but it looked like everyone was enjoying themselves.

After reading other reviews we decided to get the guac. It was really tasty. Creamy and chunky.

They have a lot of fancy cocktails, a little pricey for me though. My wife had a margarita, that isnt&#39; your standard one. She loved it.

We ordered the special which was a chile relleno with chorizo. It came on a bed of rice. Excellent dish, we shared that.

Also ordered the Shrimp tacos, steak tacos and the pork tacos. They come 2 in an order. They aren&#39;t very big, but they are definitely upscale, like at Big Star. These tacos were really good, very fresh and the sauces and toppings complimented them well.

Great place for a date and we will definitely return. It&#39;s a little expensive and nicer than most Mexican places I&#39;ve been too, but that&#39;s ok. Great discovery."

This ain&#39;t your average Tex-Mex place trying to masquerade as authentic.  this is the real deal Mexican flavors done with a gourmet flair at a fantastic price.  I had the Sopitos made with pork belly and fried masa and it was exquisite. You can taste the passion and TLC that Chef Jonathan Zaragoza (previously of Birrieria Zaragoza) brings to his food.  Secret ingredient is love and it shows.

Combine that with owner Jason&#39;s encyclopedic knowledge of tequila and agave spirits and you have a place that makes fore both a great date night and a chill night out with friends.  Jason is one of the friendliest guys you&#39;ll ever meet and one of the most knowledgeable Tequila Sommeliers (Tequilier maybe?) around and is always ready to drop a quick lesson on Tequila 101 for those interested.

Everything from the decor to the service was exceptional.  If you appreciate true culinary craftsmanship paired with artisanal spirits this place is a must try."

Luckily, my wife went early on a Saturday, and we were seated promptly. 

The place is not huge, but not tiny either. It has around 20 tables plus seating at the bar. The tables near the wall are close to one another which I don&#39;t mind, but the wait staff should take note when walking in between tables, their back side is inches from the other table. which can be somewhat awkward. The place is decorated nicely, but lighting could be a bit brighter.  A little more light results in no issue reading the menus.

Enough about the decor i came here for the food. 

Regarding the food, Jonathan Z knocks it out of the park. This is not your typical Mexican food. Go somewhere else for a $3.50 steak burrito. The sopitos with the pork belly where awesome. Crispy sopes topped with pickled veggies and very flavorful pork belly can&#39;t be beat, unless you get 2 orders. 
I suggest getting the chilaquiles as an appetizer which can easily be shared by 2-3 people. 

While the $3.50 steak burrito client may squawk at 3 tacos for $9, I&#39;m telling you, these may be the best tacos i have ever tasted. We tried the pork, shrimp and avocado. You cannot go wrong with either. Nestled in the homemade tortilla each left me wondering how a taco can taste this good.  

I cannot wait to go back. You can tell Jonathan Z is creative and passionate about his product. At such a young age, I&#39;m excited to see where he goes.  

PS. Drinks are unique and the menu descriptions are spot on. The wait staff are friendly and knowledgeable."

Smoky tequila mixed with all sorts of fancy liqueurs, extracts, bitters, and peels... delightful. I tried a few. The black betty (per yelp&#39;s ravin reviews) was QUITE refreshing. It had a nice tart cherry bite to it, but was an easy drink and had a healthy dose of fine tequila involved. My favorite was that frothy, salty, toasty coconut TREAT. I would never have guessed that coconut + tequila + salty rim would have ever = amazing combo, but the salt was an incredible tie between the flavors of the tequila, and the sweet creaminess of the coconut.

... I mean, I could have been cocochugging those all day long.

The food was good. Not excellent, but very good. I had shrimp tacos, a favorite of mine, and the mushroom tacos. The shrimp tacos had a really nice garlicy/spicy sauce happening that really blended the flavors and cut the greasiness of the battered shrimp.  The mushroom taco was honestly, not my favorite, but I accidentally overdid it (bigtime) with the little sauce accompagnant. It had a bizarre and overpowering flavor that I might not have actually used had I had the foresight to try it before slathering it all over my taco... must&#39;ve been those coconut cocktails..

Overall I had a great time, I love the vibe, love the drinks, love the shrimp tacos."

So good!  I got a side of the republic sauce as other Yelp reviewers suggested and so glad I did.. It seems to be a mix of garlic sauce , pesto , an maybe a smoky chipotle sauce . So good !
My boss got the Tuna and loved it! Said it wAs the perfect tuna melt 
The smoothie was great.. Not too sweet - no added sugar

I went there a while ago to get a smoothie (The Republic--had a mix of greens and fruit and coconut water). The smoothie was ok but I felt great after drinking it...it&#39;s definitely healthy and fresh but not super sweet or thick in consistency.

The real star here was the salad I just got for takeout, the Fresh Market salad. The name definitely captures it, super fresh ingredients and I loved the combo of strawberries pecans and blue cheese! It&#39;s pretty big too, I had about half and am satisfied so I&#39;m saving the other half for tomorrow. 2 healthy meals for under $10? Sold"

1) lentil soup: soup made with green lentils was well seasoned, and overall decent. I&#39;ve had better ones though.
2) Cubano panini: well balanced, juicy and oh so delicious. Highly recommend it!
3) Republic Reuben: it was amazing, but felt a tad bit too salty. But you do get a lot of meat!
4) Bacon bacon panini: simple, and yummy.
All of this cost just under $30, i.e. under 10 bucks per person, so it&#39;s a good deal - we were pretty full at the end.

I was excited to give it a try as I love Panini&#39;s and they are located at a cute, clean location in Lincoln Park. The store was honestly spotless. I was greeted by the owner and quite possibly one of the friendliest people I&#39;ve met in my life. 

He walked me through the menu and also mentioned that you can make your own panini&#39;s. I was already sold on the Bacon Bacon, but literally all of them sounded amazing. He put my sandwich together and explained that everything is fresh and everything not used from the day before is not used. Seriously so awesome of them to do.

The best part is, you can honestly taste how fresh it is. Everything from the bread to the vegetables to the meat. It&#39;s all so fresh and SO delicious. I&#39;ve never had a sandwich this fresh and this tasty made by someone so friendly. I was honestly in awe. I will be coming back here frequently and bringing my friends as well!

Lastly,  I&#39;m beyond impressed with the prices. Their food is so good and so fresh they could totally charge way more than they are. I was full for hours and all for $10.50. A total steal! 

TIP: All of their sauces are HOMEMADE and so, SO good. Their Republic Sauce (off-menu) is a mixture of three different sauces and is honestly so out of this world I was even dipping my chips in it!"

We tried the Chicago Fire on multi-grain and the Cubano on white bread. Both sandwiches had great flavors and the bread was toasted nicely. The prices are decent too, at around $6.50- $7 a sandwich.

The only reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars is because on my second outing to this place the guy making our meal put his hand into the trash can to take out our bill and confirm our order, which would&#39;ve been okay unless he went back to making other peoples sandwiches without changing his gloves first!!! This was disappointing, but nonetheless I love the food, the service is great, nice patient people who care about your day, the kind of people who dont get annoyed when a sandwich naive soul like yours truly traipses in and take half an hour to decide what he would have to eat.

I went there and tried their Smoke salmon panini.   They have a choice of 3 breads, pretzel bread regular bread or multi grain.  I chose the multi grain bread w/smoked salmon, red onions, spinach, pesto &amp; garlic sauce on toasted multi grain bread.  They toast this to absolute perfection with just the right crunch.  It was absolutely fabulous.  Based on this one sandwich it&#39;s easy to see why this place has a 5 STAR rating on Yelp.  Their menu has 10 sandwiches &amp; 6 salads.  

Their food is reasonably priced.  The smoked salmon panini sandwich I ordered was absolutely delicious. It is very small restaurant that is very clean.  When I went in around 12:30 it wasn&#39;t very crowded.  The owner greeted me and took my order and I grabbed a seat and waited.  Every sandwich is made to order on the spot while the customer waits.  

I am very happy that I took the chance to check The Panini Republic out.  Their reviews on Yelp are justified.  This was probably one of the best sandwiches I ever had.  I will absolutely be back again and try some of their other panini&#39;s &amp; maybe a salad."

When putting in my online order, I specifically requested pretzel bread for both of the sandwiches on the order.  When it came, I was surprised to see that one sandwich had multigrain bread and the other had regular white bread.  It was very disappointing considering that one of the main reasons that I ordered from Panini Republic was due to the fact that you can have your sandwich on pretzel bread.

My order also seemed a little light on meat.  My sandwich was supposed to have pastrami and roasted chicken on it, but it seemed like I only got maybe a couple of slices of each on the entire 8-9&#34; hoagie.

Other than that, the taste was good and the price was reasonable, but I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ll be going out of my way to get food from here anytime soon."

I ordered delivery which was about 20 minutes late, no big deal.  Had a sandwich, sweet potato soup, and ordered some dessert, brownies and some pastry thing.  I got a call back from the restaurant shortly after ordering stating that they were out of the pastry and asked if I wanted another brownie or something, I told them no, just take it off the order.  Since I ordered online, the order was already paid for so this item was never refunded.  I guess I should have taken the offer of 
&#34;something else&#34;, but I just wanted the money back, too much to ask for unfortunately.  Now I didn&#39;t specifically instruct them to make sure they took it off, but that is something that should be done automatically.  If you don&#39;t have something, refund the cost, basic business. On to the food.

The sandwich was ok, nothing outstanding, on the light side as far as meat goes, but good flavor.  The soup was ok, decent flavor but nothing to write home about.  The real kicker was the gas station brownies they put in the bag with my order.  Full of preservatives and whatever else comes in those cellophane wrapped abominations that they sell at convenience stores.  I was truly appalled by this.  I thought, &#34;well maybe they&#39;re just f-in awesome, I&#39;ll rip it open and give it a try?&#34; I had to spit it out.  Disgusting, chemical laden pile made somewhere in New Jersey, shipped &#34;fresh&#34; to your local restaurant and rushed to your table.  What kind of locally owned restaurant offers brownies and then sells preserved trash from New Jersey?? Unheard of and embarrassing.  

So overall, the food was pretty good despite the small portions of meat, but the non-refunded item that they were out of and the gas station brownies they serve lose 1-2 stars in my book.  Based on the food, 3 stars, the experience + brownie brings them down to 1.5 to 2 stars total for me.  I won&#39;t be back and suggest that you take heed if your sweet tooth starts talking to you and you&#39;re tempted by the thought of a brownie.  Don&#39;t do it!"

When you first walk in you&#39;ll notice how clean and organized the restaurant is, how colorful and well laid out the menu and decor are, and how genuine the owner is. He&#39;s right there behind the counter with a smile on his face, asking you how your day is going and offering you suggestions on what to get. His friendly demeanor is infectious. You&#39;ll see all of his fresh ingredients and sauces that when put together, make a killer panini. All for 10 bucks or less.

My wife and I came in and split the Smoked Salmon. Pesto, garlic sauce, onion, tomato, and spinach on pretzel bread. The owner asked if we liked spicy things and we said duhh, so he gave us this ridiculous sauce that was part aoili, chutney, and siracha mayo (maybe?). Whatever it was it was amazing. You can really taste the freshness of the ingredients (smoked salmon was fresh AF) and more importantly, you can taste the care the owner puts in his craft. He really wants you to love your food, and we did. 

So listen up business owners. You want to know how to run a successful restaurant? Do what this guy is doing. Come in, see his enthusiasm, sell a great product for a great price, and let the rest take care of itself."

It&#39;s hard to pick a favorite however, if I had to it would probably be the Little Italy. I also frequent the El Cubano and the Chicago Fire.  My wife loves the Sweet Potato soup. The PR smoothie or the Green Juice is a great way to round out your meal...always hit the spot."

I am now here for a fourth time and I could not be more disgusted. 

-When I was walking in there was a guy outside the door in a panini republic tshirt smoking. Not only was I annoyed that I had to walk in his smoke cloud but I was really upset that my 21 month old niece had to. 

-No one else is in the place, he was inside seconds after but an initial greeting like the first time I had would have been nice. 

-He continues to walk behind the counter and not even attempt to wash his hands.  He did put plastic gloves on, but I had to bite my tongue just to not say anything to him. 

-On top of all of that he was rude, I could have done with out the attitude. At the end of everything his was talking about his horrible slammed day... I didn&#39;t need to know about your slammed day, mine was too and I never complain about it to my guests to explain my horrible customer service. 

Needless to say I am now very unexcited to eat my panini. Completely opposite from my drive there. I would have given 5 stars had it not been for this experience.. I really love their food. I&#39;ll have to update my post if my food ends up tasting like smoke."

You will never find a hot sandwich as satisfying as the ones they have. I&#39;m getting emotional with every bite.

I just tried this place for the first time and I&#39;m quite impressed! I read their reviews on Yelp before coming in, and by the looks of it, this place is pretty brand new. Well, for being new, they sure got things right the first time! I had an awesome dining experience here.

When I walked in, I was greeted by a super friendly, helpful guy. He told me everything they had to offer and explained the menu to me thoroughly. I went with the Bacon Bacon Panini on a pretzel bun. I&#39;ve never had a panini on a pretzel bun before. Let me tell you, before THIS place, I was missing out! The pretzel bun was delicious. He even mixed together some sauces to create a house/signature sauce for me to dip my sandwich in. I tried a sample of their sweet potato Mediterranean soup and it was great! 

I got a sandwich and drink for $9.73. Not bad for Lakeview! Everything was tasty and fresh. The place itself was fresh and clean. Almost looks like an Apple store with white being the main color. They were also playing Bob Marley while I was there, so bonus points for that! I could go on and on about this place and their awesome food and their amazing service. But you should just try it yourself. 

I&#39;ve definitely found my new go-to sandwich spot! It&#39;s just a few blocks from my apartment, too! Winning at LIFE right now."

I watched the place go up and I finally stopped in to try it today.  Ok, I would have tried it sooner, but I am so so so busy at work and traveling so much it&#39;s been impossible to really commit to going.  But I am a sucker for a good sandwich and have an even larger appreciation for paninis of late, so it was time to panini myself.  There are two options here: you can build a sandwich to your preference, or you can pick one of the sandwiches on the menu.  Previously, it was kind of a &#34;build-your-own-shop&#34;, but has since changed; we spoke to the guy at the counter who explained that the menu was derived statistically, based on the most common order combinations from patrons.  AMAZING!  A place that actually listens to and crafts a menu for its customers?  Right on!  

I went with the Little Italy, mainly because it had pesto and I could eat pesto anytime, anywhere.  A pretzel panini?  Yes please.  Have you ever had a panini on a pretzel roll?  If you haven&#39;t, you are missing out, people.  I loved how the panini press burned the pretzel and made it more crusty... kind of like an actual pretzel!  Combined with a bag of chips and a pop I was completely satisfied.

Savior.

And with Galway Bay downstairs, these people are going to bank.  

The proximity to my apartment is clutch and it&#39;s good enough to make regular appearances.  This way, I won&#39;t have to make shameful walks to 7-11 for late night food anymore."

Being vegetarian the only option for a sandwich is the Fresh Veggie which they don&#39;t really put a lot on. (You know how at Subway when you ask for black olives they give you like, 3? Yeah...think that.) And it&#39;s not like they don&#39;t have other veggies to add to the sandwich, since they have salads with carrots, cucumbers or beets, so why not allow for a &#34;build your own veggie&#34; sandwich. The sandwich was good but so thin since there was barely anything in it.

Also tried the lentil soup while there, which I have to admit, was amazing! I would go back just for the soup ($3.25) and hold off on the baby sandwich with a big price ($5.75, at which point I&#39;d rather just go to Potbelly for that price, also right down the street).

May come back at some point for more soup and to try a salad, but will stray way from the over-priced veggie sandwich."

Customer Service was warm and welcoming. Decided to try the Little Italy ($6.55). Waited only a handful of minutes. They used very fresh ingredients. Got my order to go. Asked me if I wanted the special house sauce on the side. I said yes. They put it in a little plastic container and I was on my way.

Came home and opened up my sandwich. Delicious. Fresh. Seasoning just right. Bread was very good and crisp and toasted to how a panini should be. The special house sauce was also very good. I actually regret not using it on the first half of my sandwich. It&#39;s creamy, seasoned, and a nice touch to any sandwich on the menu.

Is that a challenge?!?

I built my panini, picked my bread, then my sauce, then my meats, finally my veggies and cheese. As I watched it get transferred to the panini press, I also decided to order the &#34;Greens&#34; smoothie. Because this place is both new and new to me...had to go all out. 

He may have been right. This panini is delicious. Soft bread with a little crunch and of course, those fresh ingredients. 

But while we&#39;re on the subject of fresh, I have to give it up to the MVP, the smoothie. I&#39;ve craving a smoothie since my closest Jamba Juice closed. But I must tell you, this isn&#39;t a smoothie of the sugar in a cup variety. The sweetness of the apple and pineapple is mellowed out by the various veggies, spinach, celery, parsley, cucumber, with a ginger kick. I watched them make the smoothie itself and it&#39;s about as fresh as fresh can get! 

All I can say is that I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t bet money. Because a girl could indeed get addicted to such a place."

I&#39;ve been here 3 times now and I was not overly impressed either time.  Well, definitely not impressed enough to give it 5 Stars.  Jeez.  What is wrong with you people.  
Fake reviews perhaps? 
Who knows.

I have had the Republic Reuben, Little Italy, and the Chicago Fire.  The sandwiches are long but are very thin on...everything.  Thin on meat...thin on veggies.  You will probably still be a little hungry after eating it.  But that is fine I guess.  I respect restaurants that replace quantity for quality.  But that&#39;s the problem here.  The quality of the food isn&#39;t there either.  Everything just has a plasticky, rubbery texture to it.  It just doesn&#39;t feel good to be eating at all.  I&#39;d actually rather be eating at....here it comes....Potbelly.
Ouch."

the hot chocolate is pretty good too, it&#39;s not overly sweet like Mindy&#39;s ( i guess mindy&#39;s uses real chocolate so it&#39;s a bit too sweet), mostly due to not having real chocolate, but just chocolate powders, but we really liked the little donut hang at the side of the cup, makes it look so tasty"

From the amazing Instagram photos to the cute counter and attentive service - what&#39;s not to love, right?

Well, the hot chocolate and bombolinis just weren&#39;t quite up to par. Dry and cakey donuts just aren&#39;t cutting it for me, and while they come out hot and fresh, I don&#39;t think the fillings (mixed berry and salted caramel) are anything to go our of your way for. It was messy and gooey, and there&#39;s no sink to wash your hands anyway...

The hot chocolate, in particular the s&#39;mores hotter chocolate, was a disaster. This was partially my own fault, because I should have known that a lot of marshmallow fluff could only be excruciatingly sweet. It was overpriced, overkill, and really just not what you want when you want a hot chocolate. Does it make for a beautiful picture? Yes. Does it taste good? Not quite.

I will say, the breakfast sandwiches ($6) get the job done, but the sweets that this counter is known for? Major pass.

The last note I&#39;ll make it that because it&#39;s so close to the alley behind Bar Sienna, sitting outside often means taking in the scents of the back alley, aka the trash bins. Not much that they can do about it, but... tough."

It can be easily missed if you don&#39;t know the area, but it&#39;s a small window attached to the side of Bar Siena.  There are only two communal picnic-like tables, so it can be kind of hard to get a place to sit.

My friends and I ordered a half a dozen bombolone (an Italian filled doughnut) to share.  They are cooked to order, so it takes a while for your doughnuts to be ready.  But they are definitely worth the wait because the bombolone are warm, soft and fluffy when being served.  We really enjoyed the original and the peach filled (seasonal) one, but found the other doughnuts (salted caramel, peanut butter and jelly, and Nutella cream) to be either underwhelming or a tad too sweet.  

On another visit, I gave their pistachio gelato a try.  They used crushed pistachio throughout the gelato which gave it a nice crunch and amazing flavor.  I just didn&#39;t enjoy the texture of the gelato.  It was extremely soft and almost liquified.  Nothing I would expect a gelato to be.

I wouldn&#39;t run back to Bombobar since I only liked their original and seasonal doughnuts.  Also, a huge downside is where they are located.  They are next to the alley, so you can get an overwhelming smell of garbage.  This can hugely impact a person&#39;s experience."

So I had been stalking this breakfast sandwich on yelp for weeks...just waiting for the right opportunity. Today was THE day. Sky was clear, stomach was empty, on my way to work, so I make my mind up and quickly hang right at Green street! Alas! A parking spot! Parking isn&#39;t all that easy or great. More of a walk-up spot, but I digress.

I hop out and I&#39;m greeted by a very friendly guy at the counter. I order a coffee and the breakfast sandwich(9 bucks total). Coffee is pretty solid. So I wait a few minutes+ for my sandwich. It&#39;s ready. I grab and go. This is where things go left, As I&#39;m heading down Randolph I glance over at her(my sandwich) and what the!? No eggs!!! Arrrrghhh! So I double back, highly irritated mind you. The guy apologized and starts remaking my sandwich. He gives me a free bombolini for my trouble. Great. Thanks. More calories. But I&#39;ll take it because I don&#39;t like to see food go to waste. Shoutout to the guy who warned me that the caramel inside of my bombolini was about to runneth over unto my shoes.

So sandwich is finally ready and ohhhhh yeahhhh. This feels like the proper weight and girth my sandwich should be. So I finally make it to work, 20 mins later, and I riiiiip right into it! Oh. My. Word. All my frustrations melt away because this is probably one of the best breakfast sandwiches I have ever had in my life! It&#39;s hot egg with gooey cheese, layered with bacon and a sausage pattie w/ a special sauce. All stacked between a plain bombolini( donut like bread). 

So all in all, A 5min stop turned into a 20min stop. I ate more calories than I would have liked this morning. Darn you free caramel bombolini! But then again, I&#39;m at a place that fries dough, for breakfast...why am I interested in calories?? Anywho. Go. Eat. Enjoy. Just make sure they don&#39;t forget the egg on your sandwich!"

This review is for the dessert bombolonis. I was passing through the area on the way home and was craving something screen - I thought this was a really cute find on the side of Bar Siena and decided to treat myself to two bombos. I purchased one with vanilla bean custard and one with salted caramel.

The texture of the donut made me not a fan of the entire experience. Perhaps this is just how the dough is supposed to taste, but it was very dry and airy (not in a good way). I like my donuts yeasty and chewy. While hot and fresh, it took me a solid 3 bites before I hit the filling of the vanilla bean custard. There wasn&#39;t a lot of it and it was quite bland. I was hoping that the salted caramel donut would be better (as it was recommended by the server at the counter) but... there was no filling?? There was a small glop of caramel on the top of the bombo and that was it.

I am a little bit confused by the super positive reviews and I apologize if this is just how bombolinos are supposed to taste. But overall, it was a pretty disappointing dessert."

Vanilla custard. Salted caramel.

Of all the artisan doughnut shops there are in Chicago, BomboBar needs to be at the top of the list. There is no sit-down area unless you go to Bar Siena (I think that&#39;s the name of the bar/restaurant). The walk-up is still fine for getting bombolonis, gelato, and coffee, though.

I went to Bombobar to try the bombolinis and got the mixed berry and chocolate fudge. I don&#39;t think they were that special and certainly not worth $3 per. When I opened my mixed berry, half the berry filling had exploded to the outside (see picture). The problem with the bombolini&#39;s is that when you eat it hot after they just deep fried it, the doughnut tastes super oily. I literally felt oil on my tongue. When you eat it cold, it&#39;s not as oily but it doesn&#39;t taste as good. I also didn&#39;t care for all the sugar on top which basically just dropped all over the place. The fillings were pretty decent though. I preferred the chocolate fudge over the mixed berry. The chocolate fudge had a light but decadent taste to it while the mixed berry, weirdly enough, somehow tasted a bit like alcohol(?) and was just a bit too sweet.  

Overall, not a place where I would go out of my way to visit but perhaps if I was in west loop, it&#39;d be a nice small dessert after dinner."

What seems like a pop up shop, BomboBar has gelato and bombolonis. The nutella bomboloni is the bomb. The donut itself is light, airy and best of all, hot! They were very generous with the filling, so by the end I actually ended up leaving some of the filling on the side (a mix of nutella and some sort of cream). The gelato that my friends ordered were ok, nothing that stood out from other gelatos I&#39;ve had. One thing that would probably make it better is if they didn&#39;t melt on the spot (it was 70 degrees out, so not hot enough to explain the melting).

BomboBar to the rescue! This tiny little counter, complete with heaters in the winter, served up some hot, fresh, and filled Italian donuts that were just what we needed. They have about 8-10 filler options: salted caramel, PB&amp;J, maple, fudge, cream, etc. All were yummy.

Their gelato is also stellar. We had the caramelized coconut fudge and the coffee with chocolate crisps. Both were very, very good, but the former was probably the best gelato I&#39;ve ever eaten!

We also got a malted hot chocolate, served with marshmallow fluff and a disk of chocolate floating on the top.

My lemon was super sweet, had large chunks of ice, and had absolutely no tartness at all. One normally associates tartness with lemon italian ice. This was just a sugar bomb. And it felt like they just poured in some fake lemon syrup into it.

The watermelon was even worse. It tasted fake, not like how real watermelon tastes at all. Also, after she finished her ice, her lips were stained a bright fluorescent pink...

Really not worth $5 at all. Wouldn&#39;t even pay $1 for it.

The guy manning the counter was friendly but I would stay far far away from the overpriced fake Italian Ice."

The bombolonies are great, but I had a pretty disappointing experience.

I went on a Sunday afternoon to order a coffee and bomboloni. I ended up waiting about 15 minutes for the coffee and about 10 more minutes for the bomboloni. When I asked about the bomboloni since it didn&#39;t come out with my coffee, the lady behind the counter said that they ran out of donuts. Why would you let a customer order bombolonies if there was a shortage of donuts? Or why would you not give your customers a heads up about the wait, or even proactively let them know at some point during the 25-30-minute wait that there would be a wait? When I asked how much longer it would be, she said, &#34;I don&#39;t know. It depends on when they get here.&#34; And then she just walked away.

Just disappointed and frustrated with the lack of communication and service."

BomboBar is basically a small ordering counter attached to Bar Siena. If no one is at the counter, then you can ring a bell and someone will come to take your order. There is picnic table seating outdoors. On the menu are coffee drinks, gelato, and bombolonis. So far, I have tried a maple bomboloni, a latte, and a caramelized coconut fudge gelato. 

The bomboloni was big, oozing with maple filling, and delightfully warm. If you have a sweet tooth, you&#39;ll go nuts over it! It was almost too overwhelming for me because the sugary filling (which reminded me of frosting) was almost too plentiful. For some people, that may be a great problem to have! The sugary outside is so pleasing in texture and taste. 

The gelato was VERY good. So creamy and smooth. I would absolutely order the caramelized coconut fudge gelato in the future again. But, at the same time, I&#39;m super eager to try out other flavors, as well. The one scoop portion is very generous and I actually shared it (and still felt like I got enough). BomboBar will be the PERFECT stop during the hot summer months. Chicago is supposed to have a very hot summer this year and this will be the perfect antidote to that!"

My cousin and I came here for the first time to try their bombolini and gelato which were both okay. I would give the food 3 stars and the service 1 star hence 2 stars. 

When we walked up to the window no one welcomed us nor looked happy to see customers. I heard a girl say &#34;you take their orders&#34; and then when a guy came to the window he was completely monotoned and looked like we were bothering him. Very rude attitude. 

I don&#39;t think I would come back here."

Five minute wait tops.  I have the breakfast sandwich which is a plain bombolini (my iPhone auto correct keeps naming them bimbo bars lol).  The donut plain reminds me of a soft and pillowy fried dough (the kind from the east coast that you get at the fair).  Inside is egg, cheese, a sausage patty, thick sliced bacon, and I think maybe a spicy mayo?  It&#39;s warm, it&#39;s filling, and it hits the spot.  Next time I&#39;ll have the sweet versions and maybe add them to this review.  As I recall, it&#39;s priced right as well.  :)"

The bomboloni ($3 a piece) are basically stuffed sugared doughnuts.  The dough is list and rich, but does not feel deep fried. I tried the salted caramel, and it was rich and buttery. It also tasted great split among three people and after spending 4 hours shoved in the bottom of my purse. I was licking off the caramel sauce from the paper. The caramel stuffing was great- there was a lot so that it was more like eating a great dessert than a breakfast pastry.

Look forward to trying more flavors here."

I chose to try the mix berry filling. It was good, the filling was just very runny (just like liquified jam) and made it difficult and very messy to eat. The doughnut itself was very light and fluffy and had the perfect amount of sugar on it which is good. The &#39;original&#39; bomboloni is just the doughnut without the filling which I could imagine being pretty good but not worth it since its the same price with or without the filling.

Downside is that there is no indoor seating unless Bar Sienna has tables available during the cold winter months. They had heaters beside the tables outside but they weren&#39;t turned on and the tables were kind of dirty.

I also ordered an earl grey tea and the bottom of the cup was leaking so they gave me a brand new one opposed to just a new cup. That was nice. 

Good doughnut, but not good enough for me to go back for it. If you&#39;re in the area, then sure give it a try - but it&#39;s not worth travelling to get this doughnut. There&#39;s other great doughnut shops in the city."

The breakfast sandwich is why I&#39;m writing this. The picture didn&#39;t look great but I wanted breakfast. This thing came hot and fresh, the bread was crisp, came with sausage, eggs, cheese, AND bacon. It melts in your mouth and leaves your soul ready for anything.

The donuts were totally delicious.  Warm and fluffy with delicious, creamy fillings.  Growing up, I always preferred filled donuts, and these were right up my alley.

So my husband and I stopped by one night after work and ordered a bunch of food and all of it was good, not amazing, but nonetheless it was good cheap food. We wanted to check it out because they were featured on TLC for having the best sandwich in the country, the &#34;Mother-in-Law&#34; So if you YouTube this segment, you will see customers telling you this sandwich causes pain.... Helllllllo heartburn. I basically chugged a gallon of milk throughout the night trying to sleep. 

Mother-in-Law is a beast of a woman and a sandwich. Not my mother-in-law though, she is amazing. (Ha ha) 

So anyway, the customer service.... this wretched beast of a woman ordered $3 worth of food and left.... She returned about 15 minutes later complaining of cold stale fries and a flavorless Sierra Mist. The guy at the counter made every effort to appease the gal and she acted like he had personally shoved her grandmother down a flight of stairs. Seriously, she was LIVID that she had surely been purposely mistreated due to her race and this guy handled it like a champ! We watched in horror as she threw her fries at his cook and demanded to know if she would eat such disgusting things. You ordered a deep fried pizza puff and french fries, made a huge scene, scared pedestrians walking by, and threatened to call the police over this injustice....

I can&#39;t review this place without mentioning their beef, too.  Dipped beef with hot giardiniera became one of my most eaten foods (unfortunately) after discovering this place.  Throw in a nice 40 oz. of King Cobra from inside and you, sir, have a meal."

Double cheeseburger &amp; fries for $3.99 is hard to beat. And while it isn&#39;t exactly gourmet fare, it was right for the price.

Thumbs up to the customer service. Because it was my first time there, I had no idea where the &#34;dining room&#34; was or how to order. You have to give your order at the counter in the liquor store, pay, and then go around the corner and up the stairs to where the tables are. The woman at the counter was very nice and polite as she explained what I was supposed to do. And as a bonus, I met whom I assume is Johnny O himself, who was a very nice guy (and if I hadn&#39;t been in a hurry to get back to work, I woulda chatted with him some)."

My friends and I were in town for the Taste of Chicago and staying in the Pilsen area. While visiting the attached liquor store, another staff member mentioned that the restaurant next door was great and that the MIL had won several awards and had even been featured on TLC. He invited us back for breakfast or lunch the next day and we are all so glad that we took him up on that offer. After taking our orders, we began to converse with Johnny and learned that one of his staff members had family in the part of Kansas that we&#39;re from. He offered us complimentary fountain drinks since we ordered so much food. By the end of our dining experience we had developed such a relationship with Johnny that he gave us all menus signed with our names and a message of &#34;good luck, good health, and safe travels back to Kansas.&#34; As a foodie and lover of hole-in-the-wall gems, this place is at the top of my list for the food and hospitality."

I had chicken wings from here that were just okay and the fries that came with them were disgusting I don&#39;t know if they needed to change the oil but the oil taste was very strange. I also have a cup of soup from here that made me very sick and had me throwing up. I was sick all day long."

Cheese Fries - These were ok.

Fried Mushrooms - These were nice and cispy.

Mother in Law - I only had a little and thought it was ok, but not really my thing.

Chopped Steak Sandwich - I didn&#39;t have this, but I was surprised it looks like a hamburger.

Italian Beef - We got this with sweet/hot giardiniera. My cousin and BIL split this and they both thought it was pretty good.

Breaded Steak - I thought this was more tender than Rico&#39;s, but think it needed some sweet pepper or something to give it that extra kick.

Overall, everything was good and the prices are right. Glad they are open 24/7 and not too far from me."

I just moved in down the street and was looking for a cheap place to get some cheese fries and a dog.  I also had some homemade chicken nuggets.  These nuggets are not the kind where processed, ground up chicken is put into a meat-mold to look like a &#34;nugget&#34; like they do at McDonald&#39;s.  They&#39;re full chunks of chicken that are hand-breaded.  The owner, Johnny O, was in the restaurant and stopped to chat with me.  Just a genuine, awesome person...told me about the history of the neighborhood, about the process of unwittingly getting mentioned on various TV shows, etc.  Even the clerks in the convenience store portion were friendly when I got a pint of vodka to go!

This place is charming and I will definitely be a regular here.  Next time I&#39;ll have to try the infamous &#34;mother-in-law.&#34;"

As a liquor store it&#39;s pretty poor.  The booze is overpriced compared to CVS, especially if it&#39;s refrigerated (yes, they charge more for cold beer.)  But as a greasy food joint it&#39;s fantastic.  Cheeseburgers, dogs, fried shrimp, breaded steak - it&#39;s all there.  The best part is it&#39;s open 24 hours, so no matter how debaucherous your night has been, Johnny O&#39;s will be there for you.

Protip: call your order in ahead.  If you order $5 or more they give a free can of pop, $10 nets you 2 cans of pop.  I think if you call in orders over $15 they start throwing in free dogs too, but I&#39;m not entirely sure about that because when I&#39;m at the point that I&#39;m ordering $15+ worth of Johnny O&#39;s, I&#39;m definitely not going to remember that night.

Edit: They have discontinued their free pop deal.  Kind of bummed about this.  I gotta drop them down to 4 stars in the hope that they&#39;ll see this and reinstitute the policy."

The food is pretty good, but nothing out of the ordinary. They flaunt their Mother-In-Law tamale, but their real bragging right lies in their breakfast plates. Big portions of your favorite bacon, eggs, toast, etc. combo places, and they&#39;re not shy around the frier. 
What makes this place so cool though is the fact that they really do care about their customers. Every time I go in, they seem to remember me, and I always end up having long talks with the manager.

As a local i would like to Johnnie O&#39;s to see John and Sons (Alex and Pete) his sons (5 stars) as Alex&#39;s comedic short bits are that making stopping by for convenience(day store) and fun. Thankful to Johnnie O that there&#39;s a 24 hr place to grab hot dog special etc and early hours 7ish am til 10pm lotto tickets and conv store/beers/soda staples.  I&#39;ve read and heard reviews were talking about stand not Greek Islands Drake and Palmer House food nor their prices though JO and Sons and  Crew are quality good people and would be missed by many if they weren&#39;t around.  Support local Ma and Pa businesses as it keeps community stronger and their uniqueness is something franchises lack in character.

This place is definitely a great find and the greasy dive thing really works for them. They serve up the classics...chili, hot dogs, burgers, fries and steak sandwiches...they also serve tamales which it is very hard to find a tasty tamale this side of the border. And everything is DIRT CHEAP...so even if you don&#39;t like one thing its no big loss...you can go ahead and buy something else and it won&#39;t set you back too far. Located in Chicago&#39;s south side we have to travel a tiny bit to get there but it is worth EVERY mile we go. The mother in law sandwich is where it&#39;s at...and at 2 bucks and some change you just can&#39;t go wrong. I leave off the onions(I am not a fan) but the flavors with the chili and the tamale really please my taste buds. My sister got a double cheese burger and I had a bite and they are really juicy and the flavorful as well. But of course if you are going to go to Johnny O&#39;s you must get the mother in law. Other places serve it but it&#39;s not as good as Johnny O&#39;s. It&#39;s also a great local, mom and pop place so the atmosphere is friendly and cozy.

I normally stick to just sweet crepes, but decided to try a savory one today as well. 
My boyfriend and I split the Epic and the Nutella Banana Strawberry. 
The Epic was amazing!!! They load it up with prosciutto, tomatoes, and cheese. 
The Nutella Banana Strawberry was very good but a little too heavy for me. The piece I had was filled with lots of Nutella and Banana but not very much strawberry. My boyfriend said his piece had a lot of strawberries so maybe I just got unlucky.

After spending few minutes standing in front of the cashier, the guy told me to sit anywhere without smile or apology. He could say when I walked in. 

The venue was clean, but I hate the decor. Paper decoration made hideous. I would say let&#39;s get rid of them immediately. Pictures of Paris on the wall was decorated straight horizontal line. I think it&#39;ll be better to placed randomly. 

Also, I didn&#39;t like the dish wares. It was plastic and I could tell the silver ware was also cheap. Sad... 

One more problem this place is the bathroom. It&#39;s located on the back corner of their kitchen. I hope they are careful about hygiene and dusts when customers walk into their kitchen. 

My favorite crepe place is still Leonidas, but I may come back to try sweet crepes."

I stopped in around 10am on a Friday, received a friendly greeting and took a seat at the window. This is a perfect girly place to meet your friends or mom. 

There is a good mix of dessert and &#34;meal&#34; crepes that include meat and veggies. I ordered the ham, egg, and cheese and it came out within five minutes. 

The crepe was a mouthwatering blend of melty butter and cheese and just the right amount of thinly sliced ham to make it a meal while also not being too heavy. 

The restaurant played soft French music (an accordion, of course) in the background and the amazing smell of a cinnamon sugar crepe being made wafted through the air (I&#39;m going back for that one next). 

The only thing that wasn&#39;t great was the payment process. It wasn&#39;t clear whether a check would be brought to me or if I had to pay at the counter. Not a big deal though. 

Cute place, I&#39;d recommend to others."

 The best crepes I have ever tasted. 
I&#39;ve made my own crepes before and they are delicious but I get lazy sometimes to prepare the batter in general. Who needs to prepare the ingredients when you can just order from Creperie de Paris! 

My favorite items from the savory and sweet menu is the Le Club Crepe, and the Lemon Sugar Crepe. It&#39;s a must have and you shall not be disappointed; I guaranty it. 

Hopefully soon I will get to experience this crêperie&#39;s phenomenal customer service.

I have dined here twice its opening a few months back, and I am saddened to say this spot does not live up to its name.
Hailing itself as a Crêperie &#34;of Paris&#34;, I expected this spot to be authentic, classic, and credible. Instead, it is a tackily orange and hot-pink decorated space, complete with a &#34;photo wall&#34; of black-and-white stock images of Paris (look out for the picture on the far right of the rather plain woman leaning against a fountain, smoking a cigarette- very on brand.)
I know, certainly, that decor cannot be the only thing critiqued in this Yelp review. Unfortunately, I have only had plain food experiences at this location. As someone who has lived in France and lists authentic crêpes as one of her favorite foods, I understand that I have very high expectations for my crêpe experiences. However, both times I have ordered food at Crêperie de Paris, my crêpes took too long and were cold upon being served to me. Certainly not worth the high prices and high expectations given by the restaurant name. It was fine, but if you tout your restaurant to be &#34;Parisian&#34; I highly expect you to live up to your name.
The one gentleman who was working both times I dined here was nice and polite so if kind wait staff is what you&#39;re looking for, this would be good for you. But, if you&#39;re searching for a reasonable and authentic French dining experience in Lincoln Park, I suggest you look elsewhere. Floriole and La Boulangerie are two exquisite French dining spots within a few blocks of Crêperie de Paris."

The decor is charming and cozy and fun. (I want to come back on a chilly day in winter because I&#39;m sure it will be wonderful).  We came for lunch.  I ordered the Vegetariano (tomato, mushroom, onion, avocado, and mozzarella).  It was superb.  Nice chunks of veggies, the cheese did not overpower and the crepe itself was light and fluffy.  Though not rolled up like a traditional crepe, I loved the way it was fanned out on the plate.  My friend had the chicken and pesto crepe and loved it.  He also had the sweet crepe with fruit and nutella.  LOTS of nutella, whipped cream, and fruit; so pretty he had to take a pic.  We both had mochas-tasty and love that they come in a glass mug.  The owner of the place couldn&#39;t have been nicer, coming by to check on us twice and everyone who worked there was extremely friendly.  Reading some of the less than glowing reviews on here I can only imagine that the people looking for the authentic Paris crepe have probably only ever been to Paris, Texas and the guy complaining about his Groupon sounds like a #1 Wrigleyville d-bag.

I don&#39;t understand why they give you plastic silverware that looks like real silverware. That is wasteful and cheap. Just provide us with real silverware and wash it. One use plastic silverware never biodegrades. Nothing plastic does. I highly doubt in a real French crepe shop that they would give plastic silverware. I looked at it when it was presented to me and picked it up expecting it to be heavy and metal but it only looks expensive. This gave me a bad impression that this place is polluting the earth without care of the future. There is also no recycling for plastics that I see in the establishment. Very sad.

I had their Epic Crepe and it was indeed very epic. Super delicious, and perfectly filling. I tried my friends Nutella Crepe and it was yummy too.

The only thing I didn&#39;t like was that the service was almost overly attentive. The man/owner checked in on us a lot, so much so that it got overwhelming and borderline annoying. HOWEVER, this might be because they were still new and wanted to get a feel for it. Who knows.

Passed by today, starving, and saw &#34;ham egg and cheese&#34; ..sold.

Now this crepe contained one slice of ham, one egg, a finger pinch of mozzarella, salt, and pepper. It was eerily the greatest thing ever, as simple as it was.

The ONLY reason I give four stars... my ham egg and cheese crepe was a solid 11.00$ after tax. 

....okay come on now. A POUND of reasonable deli ham can be bought for 3 to 4 bucks. A carton of eggs is like 4 and a bag of cheeese is about 3. Sor for around 12 bucks I could have had two weeks of the same crepe....

Still a fan. But I dont think it&#39;ll be a very often treat. I work at that particular location, of two, 3 days a week. That would be 33 dollars in a week if I chose breakfast there all three mornings, not including something to drink.

I will reiterate that it was, though, the high point of my day and it was freakin delicious. No complaints other than it seems to be out of my wallets league."

If you find a place at the bar, they&#39;ll take your food order, otherwise you have to stand in line to order and wait for them to bring it to your table. Not a big deal except it gets really crowded on weekends and difficult to move around.

Order your sandwich and sides at the counter and they&#39;ll give you a number to bring it out to you.  No table service here, but the bar is steps away from all the tables to get your refreshments.

I ended up going with the &#34;tenderizer&#34; that had chicken tenders within the grilled cheese and came with ranch on the side for dipping.  That, combined with tots and beer, I was in a food comma for the next couple hours.

The staff was super nice and the inside of the place is this bright orange color (almost like you were inside a huge hunk of cheese).  The walls are adorned with pretty playful murals and paintings.  I like how they recreated some art masterpieces but threw in some grilled cheeses - For example... dogs playing poker turned into dogs eating grilled cheese sandwiches.

We went late in the night and this place has a full bar... I really didn&#39;t know the price of the drinks as I had a few too many to not even look at the bill. The important thing to gain from my experience is tequila and Mac and cheese is a great combo!"

Tons of grilled cheese options. And a few sides and alcohol. The bread is too thick in my opinion but it tastes good. 

Definitely check this place out if you&#39;ve never been.

That&#39;s all I have to say about that.

However I feel obligated to leave a review of my most recent experience, which was not so good.

I frequented the Cheesie&#39;s stand at Lollapalooza, granted it was certainly crowded and the staff was no doubt overwhelmed. I ordered two tenderizers- which I have had several times in the past and enjoyed. However there was not more than two actual bites of chicken per sandwich, instead I was eating barbecue sauce and cheese. I found this to be pretty disappointing as this is not the Cheesie&#39;s experience I have grown to expect. Additionally the wait staff was a bit rude and not at all receptive to me when I pointed out the incredible lack of chicken. Must say I understand this was a high trafficked booth at at a music festival, but I think my days of stopping by Cheesie&#39;s have come to an end."

I ordered the Tenderizer which was super good but could have used more chicken, my friend ordered The Melt which I actually likes better than my sandwich. The cheese was delicious on both sandwiches. We also got the loaded tots. Tots could have been crispier but the chili they were under was pretty good. 

The servers were super nice, especially the greeter at the door. The other staff was really nice and courteous as well.
 
The place is pretty small, there&#39;s a bar area and then some tables. We found seats though. We came on a Friday evening. It&#39;s pretty loud, but we expected it. Looks like they have cool drink specials too. Overall will definitely be coming back here to try the other sandwiches!"

My friend from out of town heard about the grilled cheese at Cheesie&#39;s and wanted to check it out before leaving. We shared 1 sandwich and tater tots.  We decided to order the sandwich of the month. In between the bread was flank steak, mushrooms, onions, cheese (of course) and chipotle aioli for dipping. It kind of reminded me of a Philly cheesteak. Even though I only ate half the sandwich, I was very full. It was so delicious and satisfying. The cheese was gooey and the proportion of bread to filling was perfect. There is a location closer to me in Evanston so I will definitely have to go there and try more sandwiches!"

The amount of hilarious interactions I&#39;ve had here after 2 AM while extremely drunk is... actually very unhealthy. 

You never plan to go to Cheesie&#39;s, you just end up there. And when you end up there, the prospect of a grilled cheese is so beautiful, that when you get that sandwich (after what is, in reality, like 35 minutes on busy weekend nights), it is better than Alinea.

It is 4 stars because I once went there sober, which was a large mistake. Not because the food is bad, it&#39;s still a decent grilled cheese, with very fun and delicious assortments of toppings, but that&#39;s what it is -- it&#39;s decent. Not great. 

That being said, anyone who feels fun sometimes in their heart and considers themselves a drunk food connoisseur should definitely drop by."

FIrst and foremost let me preface this updated review and say that I still think this makes great drunk food. And by that I mean, because the nature of this food is very heavy on cheese, bread, grease, and calories, one very drunk person would not care too much of the pound you gain from the meals consumed here.

The UPDATE however has everything to do with service. After I left my review, I was sought out via Yelp from the General Manager of Cheesies : Sarah Jean AKA Momma Cheesie. She comped a meal for me. And even had them deliver it to my apartment. Gratis. That spoke VOLUMES to me. That the leadership of the Cheesies franchise is so personable and down to earth...its no wonder that their success has thrived. 

I made sure to try different items from the menu. I skipped the soup and opted for sweet potato fries. They were delicious when eaten with hot sauce! I ordered the Melt and also The Gladys. THE GLADYS IS AMAZING!! Its a chicken and waffles sandwich and unfortunately only offered in February. I think this is a huge mistake. I really think that they need to add this to their regular menu. I would probably eat here weekly if that were the case. 

Surprisingly this meal traveled well with delivery. Probably due to the awkward non-rush hour delivery time I ordered it, but it got here promptly and was still warm when I received the bag. 

THANK YOU SARAH JEAN!"

Came in tonight and to a basically empty restaurant and grabbed a table. No one bothered to acknowledge us for a good five minutes even though there were four people standing around joking talking eating and ignoring everyone who was there. Eventually the guy who I think was the supervisor came over to ask if we&#39;d been here because we were looking for a server or menu or anything.  We told him we were trying to see the menu across the restaurant.  And he said here you go order at the bar. So we figured out what we wanted at the bar while waiting on another table to get their order in. Meanwhile 4 people are standing around joking and laughing ignoring customers.  Someone came in to start their shift hollering and cursing. The manager just said well bartenders are crazy... So the guy came to take our order and acted like we were a bother to him. 

The food was the only reason for the extra star. When it comes to grilled cheese they make them quick and really good.

While eating though I was watching and saw the bartender sit down crack a beer and check his phone while before heading out. Everyone was eating behind the line and than going to take orders. Cursing galore from the bartender. And then I noticed the register on the other side and that a line was forming. No one behind the bar, no one at the register I look out the window and see the girl who was supposed to be at the register standing outside smoking looking in the window and watching the line build up. 

It felt like the bar was there to serve as a place for the bartenders to go to have fun rather than helping the customers enjoy their time. I would like to come back because I like the food for a quick easy bite to eat but they need to figure out what customer service is and figure out operations.  Felt like the basement of a frat house but even at a frat the people serving drinks are trying to get drinks to you as fast as possible."

If you ever have a reason to be near the Belmont el stop,  you MUST try Cheesie&#39;s. I have visited this location and bought from their food truck,  both equal quality.  As if grilled cheese isn&#39;t enough to put you in a happy place,  they add gluttonous extras like fries sour cream and bacon (The Frenchie) ,  or macaroni and cheese (The Mac).  The logical part of your brain will object but the comfort food seeking part of your brain will be in heaven, wrapped in a big warm cheesy hug. The space itself is eclectic and loud.   Seating is limited, but the bar is spacious. Yes a bar, this my friends is the secret to adulthood: grilled cheese and a beer to help forget the day you&#39;ve had. This IS your happy place 

*side note - The ordering process is kind of odd.  There&#39;s a counter to the left of everything to place your order then they bring it out to you.  It is not hidden or anything but as a newcomer it takes a minute to figure out the process."

I was underwhelmed by this place and the food!  You would think with everything that was on my sandwich especially the gooey cheese that my tastebuds would have been popping but that was not the case.

My chili was bland and the only way I was able to eat it was to go home and fix it up myself.

I also bought a side order of fries and I couldn&#39;t even eat them they were so cold and hard.

I should have complained about them while I was there but I was so over my food experience.

I know I was surprised when I came in it looked like someone had left their entire picked over meal on the table and they were not the only ones on the day that we went...But I didn&#39;t think much of it until I got my meal!

The only reason I gave this place 3 stars is because the guy behind the counter was so cool and made the more than dismal experience a little better!

I wouldn&#39;t go back even if I had a Groupon again for the food.

The people the atmosphere for a game and a couple of drinks for sure but definitely not the food!

However, today my boyfriend and I went to this Cheesie&#39;s location and had the worst experience yet. We were third in line when we walked in, and the cashier (Amber), took about 20 minutes to clean up a bunch of tables, and tend to the line with three whole people. The person at the beginning of the line was asking Amber about certain sandwiches and then Amber kept saying &#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; and upon the customer&#39;s last question, Amber stated &#34;it&#39;s only my second day here, okay?&#34; in the worst customer-service type of way possible. The same customer asked if Amber got training, and Amber said &#34;yeah,&#34; and the customer asked &#34;did you learn anything?&#34; and Amber said &#34;I only know what they told me.&#34; Well, in my opinion, I think asking questions for customers is a great way to learn, and show that you&#39;re at least pretending to care. Maybe that&#39;s just me. 
When it was finally out turn to order, the cashier walked away for several more minutes to clean more stuff, and by the time we ordered, there was a line nearly out the door. The cashier couldn&#39;t hear anything I was saying and kept yelling &#34;HUH?&#34; at me.
The food is generally good here, so I have to give it more than one star. But this experience was truly disappointing. Would recommend going to a different location until Amber learns respectful customer service techniques."

It should not take 30 mins to cook a grilled cheese sandwich. Let alone, for whomever, maybe the supervisor in this case to pull the cashier from taking orders because they&#39;re so backed up.  

Nope.  I&#39;m not really sure how this place stays in business.

There are so many things to say and feel about Cheesies.  But honestly, there is really only one thing I don&#39;t like and that is the atmosphere.  In truth, only part of the atmosphere.  And that&#39;s really just because I&#39;m getting older.  That thing is that this place feels like a relative low-quality college bar.  Not that that is bad, but it&#39;s not ideal for me.  Maybe a college sports bar where the clientele are broke kids is a better description of the vibe.  Thats fine, until you realize that this is nowhere near a university.  Okay, whatever, let&#39;s get to the good stuff.

And there is a lot to like here.  First and foremost is the food.  DO NOT come here if you are: 1) lactose intolerant, 2) on a low-fat diet, 3) fighting high cholesterol, or 4) on a diet.  What I mean is that this is serious comfort food.  Cheesy comfort food.  Yes, good comfort food.  I love cheese.  If you read my reviews, you know that.  You know it&#39;s one of my kryptonites (I won&#39;t tell you the others - you have to figure it out).  The frilled cheese here is good, and they have a ton of options.  Don&#39;t want one of their standards?  Customize it!  Awesome.  Add to that tatter tots and awesome dipping sauces, and you are a winner!

Almost as good, is the beer selection.  I came here once when Cheesies was having a Stone tap takeover.  What?  Yeah.  Awesome.  You can almost definitely find something you like here.  Yes, even my wife and I got good stuff, and our beer tastes couldn&#39;t be a lot more different.

The staff?  Well, they are generally good.  Some better than others.  Some will make sure you have fun and get what you want.  Others, well, they seem to think they work in that low-end college bar.  Nothing terrible for them, but definitely nothing great.

When my doctor will let me, and when I have enough cholesterol meds to let me take an extra pill, you&#39;ll find me at Cheesies."

Best be known that this is one of the best grilled cheeses I&#39;ve ever had! I know that it&#39;s a simple enough idea slapping cheese between two slices of bread and pressing &#39;em together, but man, something bout the ones here make me go cahhrazyyyyy.

You order at the cashier and get a number placard as you wait for your sandwich. On a Sunday evening, we waited about 15 minutes for our food to come out. The vibe inside is a bit divey yet modern, with plenty of booze a flowin. We were carded on the way in, so I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s only a night thing or not?

Anyway, I ordered the Melt ($8.99) and a side of tots. With a solid blend of American cheese, chicken, bacon, tomatoes, and 1000 island dressing, one bite into this heavenly sandwich will send you off! My stomach is growling just thinking about how good this really is!

Trust me- you can&#39;t go wrong with any of the sandwiches here. Next time I&#39;m up here in Belmont, I am definitely stopping by for another round!

We were seeing Colin Hay live at the Vic Theater, so as soon as we got off the train I started looking for a place to chill until the doors opened. Cheese is one of our favorite foods (with or without other foods -- it&#39;s basically awesome no matter what) and the place looked fun from the outside.

It was definitely fun on the inside, too, but so much fun that it was a very bad place to chill. In fact, we could barely hear each other over the music, which was at a dull roar when we entered and got louder every time a moody ballad came on (roughly every other song) as patrons rushed to the sound system to turn it up, and just about everyone in the bar belted along with Adele or Imagine Dragons or whomever else could not EVEN at that moment.

We finished our beers and went in search of food and drink somewhere we didn&#39;t feel quite as conspicuous due to our age and demeanor. I&#39;m sure those kids had a great night, and I wish them well, but it was just not our scene!"

Cheesie&#39;s. We came here one night as a part of our travels in Chicago, and what did I think? Pretty awesome. You think that grilled cheese is you know, some processed cheese on a hot pan and then served on some sandwich bread, nothing special right? Wrong. 

Walking in, it&#39;s well... a pub. Bar in the middle, with seats on the sides along with tables on elevated picnic seating style of arrangement. You probably won&#39;t see this place not busy on any day of the night, at least that&#39;s the vibe that I got when I came in here. It was packed. We had to basically claim a spot real quick that we shared with one of the bouncers who was eating before someone else took it. 

What did I order? 
The Tenderizer. Thoughts? Amazing. Should you get it? That depends on if you like spicy food. I mean, the spiciness wasn&#39;t quite overpowering, but it still had a kick. From what I remember it tasted on the edge of sort of a buffalo style of spiciness. Now, some of the other sandwiches I wanted to try as well, but after this one grilled cheese I was full. 

Final thoughts?
If you just think grilled cheese is just a boring easy to do yourself correctly, then hey I&#39;m not going to argue with you. However, if you&#39;re looking for a new type of grilled cheeses and a new twist, I think this place is definitely a place to try out. I think it would be a great place after a night of drinking as I would have came here if that happened. If you just moved to Chicago, try this place out because me visiting here just makes me think that if I did move to Chicago, this would definitely be on my spot as a default grub spot."

Texas toast buttered to fuck with cheese and some tomato basil dip the size of bird crap, except a lot more watery.  
In my early 20&#39;s I would have dug a place like this and may have stopped in for eats and drinks.  However, in my 30s, I&#39;m not as impressed.  
The space can get lively at night and I have to wonder why this neighborhood? I figure a place like this would be better suited for the Rush &amp; Division area. They&#39;d probably do lots in business over there since its a bar and sandwich shop.

The lively colors of the interior, booze on display and fresh smell of urinal cakes reminds me of Nola bars for some odd reason. Odd because, Bourbon street never smelled as nice."

Got the tenderizer with chicken fingers bacon, bbq, and ranch. Sandwich was under-cheesed, a few dried out pieces of chicken were thrown in the middle of the sandwich, and cheese wasn&#39;t melted all the way. (See first picture.) Was offered a free sandwich next time I came. 

Took them up on the offer today. The manager we met today was extremely awesome and took care of us very well. Customer service here = 5 stars. The sandwiches we got (ordered the same ones as last time) were absolutely filled with toppings and we actually got lots of cheese (see pictures 2 and 3). 

Taking off one star for our bad experience the first time. 

Taking off another star because the bread here isn&#39;t really buttered and it&#39;s not toasty. I don&#39;t know, to me, a grilled cheese sandwich is supposed to toasty and melty and cheesy. That&#39;s the only criteria for a grilled cheese, and it&#39;s whole the point &#34;grilled&#34; cheese. If you&#39;re offering extra toppings on it, that&#39;s cool, just don&#39;t skimp. And the sandwiches here aren&#39;t toasty or very melty, but the toppings are there, so that&#39;s good.

Thank you cheesie&#39;s for making it up to us!!!! 
Might come back."

If mac &#39;n cheese grilled cheeses don&#39;t trip your trigger, my fiance loves &#34;The Tradicion,&#34; which is a grilled cheese with chihuahua cheese, chorizo and jalapenos.

It was one of a few places open on 1/1, so we decided to stroll in. My mom had the Frenchie sandwich (currently #4 on the menu) and loved it. I had seasoned fries with red wine because it&#39;s my religion. 

The staff was so wonderful and attentive. The fries were fantastic and the ambience was really cozy. They even have really cool cheese-inspired images of classic movies on the wall. I&#39;m glad they opened up and I look forward to them becoming a regular haunt of mine every time I visit home.

I moved to Chicago on a Monday, and found that this restaurant was right next to the L stop near my house. I went, tired and starving after a day full of moving, driving a 16 ft uhaul through the tiny city streets, and dealing with the city clerks office. I ordered the sandwich of the month, buffalo chicken (which, coincidentally happens to be my favorite flavor of any food, ever), and it came with a side of ranch. 

Let me tell you. If I had a penis, I would put it in this sandwich. It was so good. The bread was perfectly toasted. My only complaint is that I needed more ranch but I was so busy devouring this practically-Jesus sandwich that I couldn&#39;t get up. 

I can&#39;t wait to go back."

My sister and I were first introduced to Cheesie&#39;s last year at Riot Fest, since they had the food truck there for the concert. I got a grilled cheese from there and it was amazing, and my sister was bitter that she hadn&#39;t chosen the same food truck. And then she got a Groupon for the brick and mortar store, so we stopped by one day before THIS year&#39;s Riot Fest. It&#39;s SO GOOD. 

Our Groupon was $20 for two sandwiches, two beers, and two soups. We both opted for pops instead of beers. There&#39;s a note here- get ice. The pop is DIY fountain, and the pop comes out warm. I learned this the hard way. 

My sister ordered the Frenchie, which is American cheese, Mozzarella cheese, cheddar cheese sauce, French fries, bacon, and chives served on sour dough bread ($7.49). It also comes with a dipping cup of sour cream. She absolutely loved it. She also got the French Onion soup, and recommends dipping the Frenchie in it for maximum awesomeness. I ordered the Tenderizer, which is cheddar cheese, mozzarella cheese, hot sauce, bacon, chicken tenders, and BBQ sauce served on Texas Toast ($8.99). This comes with a dipping cup of ranch. Good lord, y&#39;all. This sandwich is amazing. It sounds like it&#39;s too much, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s perfect sandwich size, and the flavors work together great. The cheese was all browned and coated the outside crust of the sandwich, and you got a little bit of everything in every bite, which I think is like the main goal of a sandwich. I also had ordered tomato soup, which wasn&#39;t anything special. It got eclipsed by such an amazing sandwich that it became rather souperfluous. *ba dum tsss* 

There&#39;s a bar and tvs. We were here for part of a football game and we loved that they turned the music on during commercials then quickly turned it off when the game came back on. I also love the cheesy orange paint job on the walls, and the proud display of a rainbow flag. Rock on, Cheesie&#39;s. This place is literally RIGHT across from the L stop at Belmont, so I will definitely be making quick stops here in the future. Plus, I think this place is open until like 5am, which is awesome. I will definitely be back."

There was a pretty decent line of people but the food comes out quick. This is 100% your guilty pleasure drunk food, and if you have any concern for your health you&#39;re probably kicking yourself for getting Cheesie&#39;s the next morning. My friend and I split a caprisi and the Mac. They came out super quick and steaming hot. The Mac was loaded with cheese and I think I liked it better although I literally shoved the thing down my throat in a few bites. The sandwiches are really big and filling, so one is enough. They made an extra ham and bacon sandwich on accident so we got that for free but I wasn&#39;t a fan of that one, too much meat for my taste.

My friend and I were able to order and sit right away on a Tuesday. We had a Groupon (2 sandwiches, 2 apps, and 2 domestic beers). I ordered the tenderizer and it was delicious. The guy said it was one of their must popular sandwich.

I would definitely skip the loaded tater tots. It comes with cheese and chili and they were awful. They get cold almost immediately.

Their grilled cheeses are fun combinations made with poor ingredients.  The bread, cheese, and other fillings are all mediocre on their own.  The sandwiches are not &#34;good.&#34;  Not culinary masterpieces.  Instead they put together some fun ingredients, slather it in butter, and serve it to drunk people.  Once you get past the immediate shock of &#34;chicken tenders on a grilled cheese.  How fun!&#34;  The sandwich is actually pretty bland if you&#39;re sober enough to taste it.  Get some real cheese, good bread, and other well seasoned food and I think this place would be fine.  

My other complaint is that its usually hard to find seating, especially with a group.  I understand this is a bar, but I want to sit down while eating my dinner.  The layout of the whole restaurant is bizarre and doesn&#39;t work well."

The restaurant is arranged as a sit-down pub with all of its menu items chalked behind the cashier.  The food came quickly and I ordered the chorizo grilled cheese sandwich with a side of chili.  The sandwich fit pretty heavy on my stomach and was very tasty. The chili, on the other hand, was very watery, mushy meat-ed and bland in taste. The chili really brought down my expectations for this place because I honestly preferred having a Wendy&#39;s style chili afterwards.

I can&#39;t explain to you how heavenly the first bite is, but I&#39;d say it&#39;s akin to sinking into a super warm and bubbly bath after a long day.  It combines my two childhood comfort foods, mac &amp; cheese and buttery grilled cheese sandwiches.  It&#39;s so soft, and gooey, and ugh... I want some now.  It comes with a little (and I mean LITTLE!) container of their tomato soup for dipping but I still order a full sized cup of it because it&#39;s never enough for me.

In the past I&#39;ve ordered the The Classic, which is classic and good.  I&#39;ve also tried the fried cheesecake bites, which weren&#39;t what I was expecting but I wasn&#39;t really sure what it was I was expecting to begin with.  It was still pretty good though.  

I&#39;ve never been here during the day so I don&#39;t know if the ambiance is any different but it is very loud at night, both in terms of the music and the crowd.

Shared the Mac and the Caprese, along with some tomato soup and fries. I was expecting tons of cheese oozing down the sides of perfectly toasty and buttery slices of bread, enough to fulfill all my cardiovascular risk factors for the next 5 years. While the thick pieces of bread were appreciably buttery and crispy, the filling of the sandwiches themselves was actually a little bit disappointing in terms of quantity. Maybe they were just having an off day, idk. As far as the tomato soup dipping sauce goes, it was also just alright; tasted quite good at first but after a few dips It became hard to finish an entire side of tomato soup on its own. The Pesto Mayo that came with the Caprese was pretty tasty though, which made up for the small amount of mozzarella on it.

The bad: Even with a short line, the wait for the food took awhile. Even to-go. When it&#39;s crowded, that&#39;s definitely a longer time. The fries were cold. Not a lot of space to stand and wait and always no tables.

cheesies-pub-and-grub-chicago,Lauren K.,5hbs6TwGyT2YQKeN3xef_A,"Lake Forest, IL",1,1,1,436,1,HNcSTdWrpZLmcQUd0iPjcQ,5.0,2015-06-09,"Attention all you dudes and dudettes, Cheesie&#39;s is going to steal your heart if you are in fact desperately infatuated with cheese, especially mac n&#39; cheese.  You&#39;ll be leaving, saying &#34;Kraft macaroni and cheese, who???&#34;  You will also never look at a grilled cheese quite in the same way.  I do understand that are some really super amazing and pretty original grilled cheese sandwiches out there, but this should definitely be in your top 5; that&#39;s not counting your home-made grilled cheeses which arguably, you will all say is &#34;the best&#34;.  

My request for cheese, please was adequately filled when me and my fiance had a full on mac n&#39; cheese kind of night.  Neither of us had been to Cheesie&#39;s before last night, but we knew that their mac n&#39; cheese balls were envy-worthy.  So, along with ordering the mac n&#39; cheese balls we also decided on the &#34;The Mac&#34; sandwich - a classic, it seems.  They had about 8 different sandwiches that looked intriguing, but I think that in this particular case, simpler was better.  I had absolutely no qualms about eating this much mac n&#39; cheese and I guarantee that once you taste these heavenly pieces of work you won&#39;t have any complaints about it either.  As I&#39;m writing this now, I&#39;m wishing that I had a mac n&#39; cheese ball in one hand with a sandwich in the other.  Dammit - my stomach is grumbling!  I will even go so far as to say that both the balls and the sandwich were orgasmic...I mean, seriously orgasmic.  The mac n&#39; cheese balls were fried to perfection and and the sandwich - don&#39;t even get me started.  Just stop.  Just stop.  It was so a-m-a-z-i-n-g.  And the sandwich came with this cute little dipper of tomato soup/sauce; honestly I wish we&#39;d gotten more dip, but oh well because the sandwich was super fly all by itself.    The more I&#39;m writing about how delicious the food was the more saddened I am by the fact that I don&#39;t have any more of it!!!  As soon as I work off all those calories from the balls and sandwich I&#39;ll be going back to add them back on.  IT IS SO GOOD.

Apart from the food, the environment is quite cool too.  For some reason, I think it is totally wickedly awesome that you can relax, eat a grilled cheese without any (well maybe, a little) guilt and have a beer at the bar.  They have a modest selection of beer , some of which I haven&#39;t seen in many bars before.  The bar sits in the middle of the restaurant while the stand to order your food sits off to the left side.  Tables surround the restaurant and it&#39;s all pretty cozy.  

My fiance and I arrived at Cheesie&#39;s near the end of the Blackhawks game so of course the restaurant was filled to the brim with screaming fans - which I&#39;m personally a fan of.  I love a great atmosphere where we are cheering for our home team and eating delicious food.  There&#39;s nothing better than that combination to unite a bunch of strangers!  It&#39;s a fun atmosphere and I think that you can easily enjoy yourself here whether it&#39;s crazy busy or very relaxed.  

Gather together now and say &#34;Cheeeese!&#34;"

I ordered delivery this past weekend and was extremely disappointed. The Mac and cheese bites were good, however, the rest of my order was horrible. The tenderizer I ordered was cold. The fries with cheese on the side was the worst part. I not only got what seemed like 7 fries. And that&#39;s not a joke. But I ordered cheese on the side and they did not even give me that. I contacted the customer service and they still have not responded to me. Very frustrated with them on this delivery."

A bar based around Good food, drinks, and certainly, Cheese. Most all sandwiches are cooked on Texas toast and smothered with butter and cheese. The sandwiches are stuffed with glorious items such as BBQ chicken tenders, tater tots, Mac n cheese and hot sauce. 

The sides are equality as good. Great cheese curds, and fried mac n cheese bites. Even the fries and perfect. 

The beer menu has 6-8 diverse draft selections and plenty of bottles. The bar can make some specialty cocktails but mostly
Just has the materials to make the basics.

Cheesies is open late and is one of the best places to go when you&#39;re out on a crazy night and you need a pound of cheesy heaven. Stop by to try to Napoleon, it&#39;s my personal favorite."

I saw a deal on grouoon and purchased it a couple weeks prior. 

Although it is stated NOWHERE on the grouoon, they decided to not accept it after midnight. Ok, great! Just screw me over without Vaseline. Even after talking to the manger to give them a chance to to make things right, no one cared. 
 
On top of this, there are security guards who think they are cops, asking me what was in my bags and trying to inspect my purse. Not understanding when this place took such a turn for the worse.

Keep these things in mind next time you purchase a groupon for this plac or decide to pass by. I won&#39;t be coming back."

I&#39;ve also been the the actual store on Belmont.  Very lively bar especially weeknights.  Pretty fast service.  The Mac is still my go-to, but the Frenchie is also good...I mean, who can say no to a sandwich stuffed with French fries, bacon, and chives that comes with a side of sour cream?

Much like the rest of the world I have a deep love for Mac &amp; Cheese and Grilled Cheese and having them in one sandwich was like I died and went to heaven. 

We ordered fried mac &amp; cheese bites, cheese curds and loaded tater tots for an appetizer. The mac &amp; bites were the best I&#39;ve ever had. Mostly when you order them else where you can tell they were frozen and put in a deep fryer, but these were out of this world. The cheese curds were good but they were made better by the tomato dipping sauce. 

For our entrée we ordered 3 sandwiches, The Mac, The Caprese and The Tenderizer. All 3 were simply amazing and gave me more ideas besides tomato and bacon to put in my grilled cheese for when I want to cook at home.

I&#39;m sad I don&#39;t live in Chicago because this would be my go to place when I get my cheesy craving. Also for all the food we got it was only 40 dollars! How amazing is that?! The perfect meal!"

Try the fried mac and cheese bites! I usually order the Caprese or the Frenchie. Both are incredible. Love the pesto mayo that comes with the Caprese. My boyfriend swears by the Tenderizer. I have a girlfriend who never strays from the Mac. They&#39;re all fantastic!

After the Cubs game and many cervezas later, we hopped on the Red Line and took it to Cheesie&#39;s to consume the much needed carb-a-licious Linner. I ordered the 4 cheese mac n&#39; cheese sandwich and added BACON. Yes, you read that right...bacon! Oh .... My.... God. Seriously, like....seriously! Sparks flew in my mouth. Life was seriously the best it could have been for the 10 minutes of my consumption. The taste was spot on. The cheese and bacon combination was deeeeeelish! I cannot tell you what a mouthgasm it was but just know, I&#39;d love to have that sandwich plus a lobster tail as my last meal on earth!

As for the sides -

Cheese curds: A+ as well. 

Sweet potato fries: BLEH. Much better elsewhere. 

Fried mac n cheese balls: Bleh. Average.

I remember when Cheesie&#39;s first opened up and my friends and I came here with a Groupon and pretty much tried every sandwich they had on the menu. The place back then was smaller. 

Over the few short years Cheesie&#39;s has become one of my favorite spots. Not just because I love grilled cheese almost as much as I love dogs, but also because of the late hours and awesome staff.

I&#39;ve been here with my family when I&#39;m as sober as a baby who just came into the world 45 seconds ago and when I&#39;ve been so drunk with my friends I swear the cheese goodness from my Cheesie sandwich is the only thing that kept my liver from sliding down to my feet from all the pressure of the booze.

Sandwich Recommendations:
-The Tenderizer (cheddar &amp; mozzarella cheese, hot sauce, bacon, fried chicken tenders and Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s BBQ sauce on Texas toast...served with a side ranch) is my go to sandwich. Standing ovation for this The Tenderizer!

-The Frenchie (American/mozzarella/cheddar cheese sauce, classic thick cut french fries, bacon and chives on sour dough bread. Served with a side of sour cream) is what I get when I want to switch it up some. You won&#39;t be disappointed with this sandwich.

Sides Recommendations
You can&#39;t go wrong with either the cheese curds or the fried pickles."

My wife loves grilled cheese.  Like it&#39;s almost a problem.  So of course when we last went to a Cubs game she insisted that we give this place a try.  It&#39;s easily in walking distance, but also nicely gets you away from the Wrigleyville crowds.  

I was very hesitant about ordering anything from the cheese-centric menu.  Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I love cheese.  I don&#39;t care for a sandwich full of cheese, nor do I like Texas toast.  Coming from Oklahoma, I know Texas Toast to be nearly an inch thick and loaded with butter.  

I ordered The Melt (chicken, bacon, cheese, tomato, thousand island, etc.) and my wife orered The Mac (cheese and mac and cheese).  I was very very impressed by this sandwich.  The Texas Toast was not overwhelming, though still qualified as Texas Toast.  There was an exceptional balance between meat, fillings, and cheese and the side flavored mayo was a nice touch.  My wife&#39;s sandwich was exactly as described and delicious if you are into that much pasta and cheese.  

Definitely worth a trip if you are in the area."

You go up to the buffet bar, specify what you want, and most of it is cooked to order (or was very recently cooked!).  Super old-school southern flavor.  Then you sit down at the table, and a waiter brings you all the drinks you want.  I was partial to the orange juice.

We went on a busy Saturday afternoon at about 330 &amp; there was a 40 minute wait. Well we saw plenty open tables so we couldn&#39;t understand why the wait, but ok WHATEVER. 

After 40mins we get seated. We got menus or the option of the buffet. I asked my server what they buffet offered, his reply was he doesnt know &amp; they items can change hourly. So I went to view the buffet food &amp; was VERY skeptical on ordering that. But reluctantly I got the buffet so I could try different items. I tasted the smothered pork chops, greens, yams, dressing, fried chicken, white rice. I also ordered catfish nuggets. Everything was very tasty. The yams weren&#39;t done enough. The catfish nuggets were nasty &amp; seemed like frozen fish not fresh fish. SMOTHERED CHOPS WERE DELICIOUS!!!! Fried chicken was good &amp; the food was being replenished quickly. The greens were just ok. 

The buffet costs $20 &amp; for $4 we took some food home too. I really liked that we could do that. I will definitely be back for more! The service we received was pretty good too. The only thing I think they need help with is that buffet line! Also the menu items are a little pricey too. A chitterling plate was $27!!! I can buy 2 buckets for that. Lolbvs"

I was disappointed. I ordered the turkey meatloaf dinner with yams and greens. The meatloaf was bland. It had absolutely no seasoning. The greens reminded me of the Glory greens that come in the can. The yams were hard, and the peach cobbler that my friend ordered was cold. It was like they made it the day before and stuck it in the fridge; in other words, it wasn&#39;t fresh.

My friend and I wanted to try their Southern lunch and we both left liking the food and loving the staff. You can either do their $14 buffet or order off their menu. My appetite in the morning is usually not as beastly as it is later in the day so I opted to just order my grub. 

I ordered the ham &amp; egg sandwich &amp; added some cheese for $8. It came on wheat bread and totally loaded with both ham and egg! So much protein was packed in, it was all falling out and made for a little side breakfast dish. Flavor was all good and the side portion of potatoes was yummy, too. For people who like peppers, it had chunks of red &amp; green throughout with some onion, too. Peppers and onions are two of my least favorite foods so for me, the taste was too overpowering. 

Those biscuits though! Pearl&#39;s Place starts everyone out with a couple of fresh, warm and delicious biscuits that you can smother butter or jam on. Oh yessssssh. Those were some tasty buns."

The food is absolutely amazing. I usually order the catfish, macaroni and cheese, sweet potatoes, and greens. It has never disappointed. When I do breakfast, I do have the buffet. Everything on there is delicious. Including the unlimited complimentary biscuits/cornbread that comes to your table. I&#39;ve done the breakfast buffet twice and the dinner buffet once. The other times I&#39;ve visited, I ordered from the menu. The owners of the restaurant are present in the day to day operation of the business. They come to your table for general conversation or just to ensure that your food is good and that the service is acceptable. Despite the times I&#39;ve heard about Pearl&#39;s having bad service, I have seriously had nothing but amazing customer service here. At one point, Deidre (who I&#39;m not 100% is even still there) was like my consistent server. Her and her colleagues always did a fantastic job working together to make sure that service was exceptional. Even in the one or two instances where something happened that made my experience less than amazing, I informed one of the owners and the situation was rectified immediately. I highly recommend Pearl&#39;s to anyone who is looking to enjoy good food.

At that time I didn&#39;t officially join Yelp.  

You know what?  I want to do Pearl&#39;s Place an honor this time because I want to recommend this place to my fellow yelpers.  If you want some southern food that can bless your body, mind, and soul in the city, my pick would be the Pearl&#39;s Place on Michigan and Pershing.  

After parking our vehicle at the Amber Inn (a partner business) parking lot, our journey to the best soul food in the city began.  

The entire place ran like a well-oiled machine.  We were taken care by Ms. Liz, who was one of the most professional, easy-going, and systematic servers we have ever met.  We forwent the lunch buffet ($13/person) and ordered a la carte instead.  

My shrimp and cheesy grits with bacons and green onions was soul-fulfilling!  I&#39;ve been craving for shrimp and grits (one of my favorite southern-food specialities) for quite some time.  The shrimps were cleaned thoroughly and de-tailed; there was a balanced amount of &#34;melt ability&#34; between cheese and grits.  I was so glad that I satiated my crave this afternoon.  

Hubby also had a quality catfish sandwich.  Liz kindly informed him that the Brussels sprouts weren&#39;t available, yet he could have a choice of another side.  Hubby then received a cup of rice with gravy.  By the way, their coleslaw and gravy were quite delicious as well.  

The adjacent patrons went with the lunch buffet option.  I would say it&#39;s worth the price if you come hungry.  One of the unique features at Pearl&#39;s Place is that the chefs behind the buffet bar serve each plate for you.  Trust me, every plate is filled to its full-capacity and will make you &#34;incapacitate&#34; (hopefully in a good way) after several plates from the buffet bar.  

I know some reviewers have mentioned the surroundings and the neighborhood itself.  Yes, it&#39;s a &#34;bare-looking&#34; neighborhood, but I feel fine walking on the streets from and to the train station (CTA Indiana Green line station is in a very close proximity) during day-time.  Nevertheless, free parking is more than sufficient at the Amber Inn lot.  

Come as you are!  Overall, we spent $20 (not including tax and tip) and our stomaches were &#34;soul-ly&#34; happy.  Give Pearl&#39;s a try, and let me know what you think."

    The fried chicken was greasy and the pork chops were tough and tasteless.  Everything else was mediocre.  I will not be returning anytime soon."

So because it&#39;s brunch time and 90 degrees outside I have a white t shirt on. They tried to make me put on a wrinkled shirt that clearly came from the thrift store. This would have almost been acceptable until I noticed a Caucasian woman sitting with a white shirt on that said Levi on it.

This was my 2nd time at Pearl&#39;s and it was even better than I remembered. The mac and cheese is slap yo mamma good and the collard greens are cooked to perfection. Sooo flavorful without any meat used to cook them. The guy who made my omelet put his foot in it! I got spinach in the omelet and sometimes that can be a bit overpowering. Not this time. He blended it perfectly with the other ingredients. Even the eggs themselves had great flavor. And then there were the biscuits. Those biscuits spoke to my soul. Get them with honey. It will make your life. 
The only thing that surpassed the food was the service. My waitress was awesome. She kept my glass full and brought me any and everything I&#39;d need in the blink of an eye.

She goes back to try again &amp; comes back to rudely tell me my card is declined. At this point I get nervous because I&#39;m thinking something is wrong with my card. I had to ask for the receipt again to pay with cash. Needless to say there was nothing wrong with my card. I checked with my bank &amp; I was able to use it after I left.

It includes soul food entrees with many of the sides you would expect at a soul food restaurant. This place has a home feel to it and the owners walk around to make sure everyone one is enjoying their meal. The good part about the dinner buffet is the fact that you can also get breakfast at the same time. The omelets and pancakes are made to order and the last makes sure they are made to perfection. The raspberry tea was decent as well. I will definitely continue to visit this place because it reminds me of the southern cooking in Alabama

Pearl&#39;s Place has very good grits, good biscuits, good soft scrambled eggs, an egg white option, very good coffee, and very good sweet potato pie with a somewhat tougher crust than my mother made. When you are seated you are given a cute oval very good not too sweet pan cornbread to share. The food offerings appear to be basic own home would food. The buffet had two kinds of greens, omelettes made to order, but was a steeper price at $13 than we wanted to pay not including beverages or all of the wonderful southern dessert options. The husband, in general, is opposed to cafeteria style serving as am I given my experience as a server whilst in undergrad! Something about obviously made ahead food is less appealing to us.

Jasmine G and Vonja give friendly, menu knowledgeable, customer-oriented service.  In general all staff are very helpful and hospitable.

Pearl&#39;s Place is undergoing a remodel whilst still in business.  The decor reflects the history of jazz, Bronzeville, and is interestingly eclectic and obviously the items on the walls come from a collection accumulated through the years. I will enjoy seeing what the remodel update brings, but I hope it includes a more aesthetically pleasing display of the artifacts on the walls today with perhaps an expansion of the collection with labels telling the history of each item! I&#39;ve taken the time to look at them and I like and enjoy them.

Pearl&#39;s Place provides good comfort soul food and breakfast in a shabby environment with excellent customer service. I recommend it if you are in the neighborhood, but until after the remodel is complete, cannot suggest making a special trip to try.

Free parking in lot shared with co-located hotel. No validation is required during the week."

Pearls offers lots of yummy foods like biscuits, fluffy pancakes and waffles, and crispy bacon. But the fried chicken is a clear winner - we went back to the breakfast buffet for 5 rounds and left a little chicken graveyard at the table. 

Also, I don&#39;t know if comments pertaining to poor service are still relevant (at least for brunch). We&#39;ve been twice and had great, courteous service both times!"

I suggest the windy city omlet (everything) if you don&#39;t like spice just tell them leave off the spicy foods. Then I got coffee. I am a very happy with the coffee!

One of the owners greeted us immediately, and took the time to answer questions about the food. He was really great, and even gave a little history leson about the restaurant. Bonus points that he honestly explained what was truly vegetarian and what might not be in the sides i.e. chicken broth.
I tried the yams which were soul food sweet compared to my home cooked ones, but an occasional decadent yam like that is a great treat!
I also tried the red beans and rice. Very flavorful, cooked to perfection with a tasty sprinkling of green onions.
Lastly, I ordered the fried green tomatoes which came with a spicy dipping sauce. Even after taking them home, these were the lightest tastiest best fried green tomatoes I&#39;ve EVER had. I can only imagine how good they would be fresh out of the kitchen!
Overall a really pleasant 1st trip to a place I&#39;ve driven by so many times. Glad I finally stopped to try it - next time I&#39;ll wear my Sunday best and eat in!"

We were not disappointed. We arrived late enough for breakfast buffet and early enough that the lunch buffet was fresh and hot. Best of both worlds. The food was amazing! Cook to order omelets and choice of toppings, check! We didn&#39;t want to fill up on breakfast so that we&#39;d have room for lunch. And boy did we need room. So many choices. All so very good. My absolute 5 star favorites were the candied yams and macaroni and cheese.  But seriously everything we sampled was to our satisfaction. My only gripe was that our waitress/service was a little slow; we had to ask for silverware, syrup and drink refills. Overall, the restaurant was clean (even though they were doing a little remodeling), the neighborhood was nice/safe and easy to locate. We would definitely go back.

 I believe this place does well with patrons who enjoy eating fried foods and fried chicken. I don&#39;t eat either so I would assume simplicity would be a no brainer.

I ate here about a year ago and the food was good, but tonight the food was cold, awkwardly seasoned, and mostly unavailable.  The buffet was without key soul food dishes when we arrived (no macaroni and cheese, fried chicken, jerk rib tips, black eyed peas etc). Also, there was only one woman who was serving food at the buffet (which is actually not a buffet, but an all-you-can eat cafeteria style station with slow service and old looking food). I had to ask the manager to send another person to assist with the serving because there was a line of 8 of us waiting for food without anyone to help us. After making several special requests with management and our waiter for the buffet to be restocked, the fried chicken was cold, the macaroni was watery with overlooked noodles, and the jerk rib tips were mushy and poorly seasoned. The server was polite and apologetic, however I suggest going down the street to Chicago&#39;s Home of Chicken and Waffles for consistent, fresh soul food."

The space itself is cute and cozy. There were fellow church goers dressed up and quite a few families. The place was packed and as a walk in we had a 20 to 30 minute wait. This isn&#39;t the type of place you go when your in a hurry. When we sat down we were given the best biscuits I have ever had. They were warm, buttery, and pretty much melt in your mouth. That had to have been my favorite part of brunch.

The service here was also good. For brunch I ordered Pearl&#39;s omelet which came with a side of hashbrowns and pancakes. The food in my opinion was just okay, but for the price point it was excellent. I would go back just for the biscuit, but plan on visiting again to try other items on the menu.

My most recent visit ended with my family and I leaving to go to another restaraunt due to their &#34;white t-shirt&#34; policy. A family member had on a quality v neck shirt and after waiting 15 minutes to be seated, we were informed he had to wear one of the house shirts or go change. We&#39;ve visited this place numerous times and he&#39;s worn similar shirts; actually he&#39;s worn this particular shirt and we&#39;ve not had any problems. When I explained to one of the owners that we&#39;ve been here before and he has worn similair shirts and been allowed to eat and his response was to raise his voice, cut me off in mid sentence and point to a sign. I am college degreed (multiple times over) so to point to a sign and speak in a terse manner to a guest is unacceptable.

When I asked for a table for 3, I was told my (3) year old son was not allowed to dine in due to the fact that he had on a white under armor shirt. The guy at the front told us they don&#39;t allow people to wear white shirts there. I thought that was ridiculous. Since that day, I have never been back!

We deemed this was pretty reasonable for a soul food cafe and the after-church crowd that was gathering.  We were seated within 30 minutes and had a choice of the buffet or entree.  The buffet line was long, so we decided to order.  The buffet had a price of about $20-25 which again is reasonable and you were asked to finish one plate before going back and getting another one.  We went with the entrees and ordered ox tails and neck bones and potatoes.  I&#39;ve had a taste for neckbones but it&#39;s not something my kids eat, so this was perfect.  We also ordered the vegetable sampler for $10 - which is really a sides sampler.  We wanted to sample a few different things.  We had mac and cheese, yams, greens and corn bread dressing.  The mac and cheese and yams were on point!  The greens and corn bread were great once we added hot sauce and gravy, respectively.  However, I like how the waitress put it: this didn&#39;t come out of your kitchen so it won&#39;t be seasoned to your likings.  We have to make it so it appeals to the vast majority.  We were so stuffed we couldn&#39;t order dessert.  Of course, we didn&#39;t finish everything we ordered.  We&#39;d definitely go back."

All I knew was that I wanted something authentic to Chicago and that tasted great. Well, I searched Yelp for some suggestions, and this place stuck out because it had Soul Food. Something that I have not had in a while so I decided to give this a try. When I arrived, the host was very friendly. 

Based on the looks on the inside of the restaurant, it looked like it used to be maybe a reception hall or a church, but they had it fixed up pretty nice. The buffet set-up was a little different than what I had expected because all of the food was covered and there were servers who served you the food. The servers were very polite and they did serve you generous portions of the food. That is always a plus! 

Now, for the part that you have been waiting for, the review of the food! The food was delicious!!! It had lots of flavor and really did taste like your grandmother from down south cooked the food! I had macaroni and cheese, neck bones, smothered pork chops, green beans, fried corn, and candied yams. These tasted phenomenal and I did not need to add or take away any seasoning. I even tried dessert. I had the lemon pound cake and it was the best lemon pound cake that I have ever had! 

The price for the food was very reasonable provided that you were going to eat your food in the restaurant. There is an additional fee of $5 if you plan on taking some food home with you. Also, there is a fee if you get more food than you can eat and have to throw it away. However, I can guarantee that you don&#39;t want to waste this food because it really is that delicious. You may want to just pay that extra fee in order to take it home with you! 

One more pointer......You can ask to sample a food item(s) before you commit to eating a regular portion of it. That is what I did and that&#39;s why I chose the dishes that I told you that were so delicious! I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant and bringing my family!"

I ordered the veggie omelet, grits and pancakes. The food was very basic, nothing out the ordinary at all. I was not impressed with the pancakes. They were very flat and dime sized, smaller than the size of a saucer. My grits were a little bit stiff and clumpy and I had to add quite a bit of salt to them for a decent taste.

Well, I&#39;m happy to say I was wrong dead wrong!!!  The waiter and I hate I can&#39;t remember his name was great!  He explained the menu and the buffet options with a smile on his face the entire time.  He also was very attentive without hovering!  That was a major plus!!!

When you get to your table they bring you a free homemade cornbread and yeast bread with a side of butter!  It was three of us and the two servings they gave us was more than enough!

Now, the food OMG it was so good and flavorful!!! I went for the lunch but after hearing about the breakfast buffet I can&#39;t wait to go back!!!

I have gone to other Soul Food Restaurants and leave thinking I could have just stayed home and cooked myself but this place although I could have stayed home and cooked myself; I was glad I didn&#39;t because they were the real deal.  The sweet potatoes, the chicken, the collard greens and the Mac n&#39; Cheese.  I swear I can taste it now, but I digress!  They also have a little salad bar and plenty more meats like turkey meatloaf, pork, turkey, and of a host of other veggies!  

Their buffet is a little different then other places; you do not touch the plates or the food!! You tell them what you want and they serve you!  I have to say at first I was like umm I think I know how to get my own food but when the waiter explained it was for health and safety reasons for the customers it did make me conjure up thoughts and times of people not washing their hands, sneezing, etc. at the traditional buffets that made a lot of sense.

You can go up as many times as you like but make sure when you are feeling stuffed don&#39;t head back up if you don&#39;t think you will finish your plate because they do have in writing that they can charge you for wasted food and/or have an extra charge if you want to bring your leftover homes.

The buffet also includes all you can drink but it is only one dessert per each buffet ordered!!! 

The prices of the buffet varies depending on if you go for breakfast, lunch, a weekday or weekend!!!  When I find out the correct amounts I will update my review!

They also have a regular menu but the buffet is the best value!"

I&#39;ve passed by this place numerous times over the past 10 YEARS and in my &#34;Bourgeoise&#34; attitude, I cast this place as an anchor for a low-budget hotel.  I almost changed my mind about the low-budget Motel thing after I was served my scrumptious food!!

I was here today celebrating the 22nd Anniversary Birthday of my BFF and College Roommate and we were not disappointed.  I wanted to pick a spot for Brunch that she could select from Breakfast Special to Lunch Savory and I hit it.  I&#39;m not sure how this place stays in business!  She had the Country Fried Steak w/ Grits, Eggs, AND Pancakes, and I wanted breakfast so I chose the Buffet Option.

First of all, I didn&#39;t realize that if you get the BUFFET, you can select from a personally made omelette, waffles, and pancakes [with the normal sides of grits, homemade potatoes, or rice], AND select from the &#34;Soul Food&#34; selection!!!!  I&#39;m in Heaven!!  I got a omelette with veggies, mini-waffles, and CHICKEN from the soul food section!  B&#39;day girl went for her fav - Country Fried Stead without gravy.

We didn&#39;t make reservations so being we had so many in our party, we had an hour long wait ahead of us. Was slightly frustrating, but it was VERY crowded so I kinda overlooked that. 
Once we were seated, the waitress was very attentive, informative, and personable without being an annoyance. The food was on point, and the ambiance of the joint paid homage to the great jazz and blues artists of the 40s, 50s, and 60s. Did i mention the parking was free? Which is a growing rarity in Chicago for restaurants. The cornbread had actual corn in it and was quite delicious I must say, and they serve breakfast all day which always gets extra points in my book. Location wasn&#39;t bad either, being about 2 blocks off the expressway.
My only real gripe was I felt the buffet was a little overpriced. $19 for all you can eat when the portions for the entrees that were off the menu were generous enough to fill you up anyway. For $18, I got an entree AND a dessert and walked outta there stuffed!!
The crowd and the wait was a bit annoying and long so I would suggest that you don&#39;t go there with small children or if you&#39;re in a rush, or if you&#39;re so hungry you have to eat immediately. 
Great spot to catch a bite with old friends or even for a first date."

The food was good and Mark (our server) was great .  We didn&#39;t know what to get so we did the buffet.  It feels like a soul food joint down south. We used &#34;NoWait&#34; (seating app) so we were seated within 5 minutes ... otherwise we would&#39;ve waited 30-45 minutes (it was a sunday afternoon). My only disappointment was the fried green tomatoes. They were breaded with Panko chips instead of your more traditional corn meal coating... they were ok but not what I expected after everything else being exactly what you&#39;d expect from a good soul food joint. The shrimp and grits were amazing. 

I&#39;d say it&#39;s a cool spot to check out. I&#39;ll definitely go back"

I had the Shrimp and grits which was delicious beyond measure.  It was absolutely a plate of Cheesy,  gooie goodness. I highly recommend that dish. They served hot cornbread that taste like it came out my gandma oven.

Waitress offered us a lunch Buffett at the price of $10 then we got to the register and they said it was $15. I spoke with the waitress and she had the worst attitude and said &#34;you know it&#39;s $14 right?&#34; And rolled her eyes. I could not believe how I was treated. Then I spoke with the manager who talked to me as if I was a child and did not care to resolve the issue as well. He acted as if I was wrong for believing the price the waitress told me. The other manager made a joke of the whole thing while the staff laughed in our faces at the register. They don&#39;t care about customer service at all. I will never go to the place again. The food was bland and the meat was dry. Definitely not worth the trip. Chicago home of chicken and waffles is way better and has excellent customer service.

The food was delicious, coffee was great and so were the servers. Pricing was fair for a flavorful buffet.

We went to Bill Winston&#39;s church which was awesome and made reservations for lunch, although I am not sure reservations were needed. If you make reservations they charge your card a $50 non-refundable deposit....so please show up. 
The exterior and neighborhood was not as bad as we thought from the reviews. When we arrived everyone was very friendly and showed us to our reserved table. Mark greeted us and had been in the restaurant business for 40 years. He was very attentive to our needs and kept our glasses full of water, although he did forget to get my tartar sauce for my cat fish nuggets. But when I reminded him, he was quick to accommodate.  We chose the buffet instead of the menu . Being from the south we really enjoyed the fried chicken. We were all dissapointed by the dressing as it seemed that either pickles or vinegar was spilled in it. The catfish nuggets were ok, the yams were very good. The cornbread with butter were great texture, even displaying real corn kernels, but there was something missing..probably a little salt, because it did not taste like cornbread. The jerk chicken was good and seasoned well. The collard greens did not taste like greens of the South but they were good. The corn was excellent! The turkey loaf was ok...something a as missing.
For desert we got the chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, peach cobbler, sweet potato pie and the caramel cake. Thumbs up on the chocolate cake and the sweet potato pie (which was not too rich). The caramel cake was not moist and was very granular and hard. The peach cobbler had an overwhelming almond taste. Mark did replace the caramel cake and cobbler with sweet potato. 
Overall, we loved the service, everyone was very attentive. Mark was very nice and provided good service. The food was half and half, some good, some not so good."

My spouse and I ended up at this restaurant by chance as another establishment we&#39;d chosen had a wait time of 45mins for a party of 2. Again the food was GREAT as well as our server (her name escapes me); not to mention the rest of our time there. It was so great, I began to reconsider the venue for a dinner I&#39;d host the next weekend for my grandmothers 80th birthday.

 Our current reservations were for an upscale restaurant in Tinley Park for a party of 15, however after my time here I felt my grandmother would appreciate the food here as a soul food connoisseur; most definitely a further drive from Three Oaks, MI but well worth it or so I thought. This place would not receive 5 stars from me with their current reservation policy. I&#39;ve patronized an extensive amount of restaurants nationally and internationally as a travel agent. To be told by the restaurant mgr. that we&#39;d have to pay everything up front for reservations without a private setting to say the least was absolutely absurd! I&#39;ve managed 3 restaurants (all 3 stars and above) and what IS customary is to have the table prepped 30-45mins before group arrival and then to release the seats with group absence 30 minutes after no arrival. I neglected to inform him that I was also a restaurant manager but being argumentative wouldn&#39;t have changed either mind at this point. 

I will say however, to not tell a client what you believe is customary with opinions of unvalidated grandeur because &#34;we have to be considerate of all of our guests&#34;, as he stated. To ask for nonrefundable money upfront sounds like the pitch at a burger joint, NOT at what I wanted to consider a 4 star place in a sketchy neighborhood; a hidden gem. I WILL be back but as a small party of 2-4. If my math serves me right, this establishment will miss out on an easy $325-350. Revisit your operations plan please. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only prospective client to find your policies ridiculous."

My dad and step mom were in town and wanted to have soul food after church on Sunday. Since it was Mother&#39;s Day I explained to them that it would be packed out, so they could expect to wait. My dad being the stickler that he is decides he wanted to wait the hour they&#39;d given him.. I was a little weary because I had only been there one other time and though I was impressed with the food, there was a snafu with the customer service. Anyway, we decided to wait and we were not disappointed. Despite the crowd and the remodeling, everything at the buffet was readily available. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable of the menu as well as very hospitable. The host/manager was personable and friendly. Overall it was a good experience and once we begin eating we soon forgot the hour long wait.  Me being a bread lover, I wish they gave you more of those rolls. I could buy a slew of them just to take home. Amazingly, ALL of the dishes were appetizing but my personal favorites were the Mac &amp; cheese, the sweet potatoes and the potato salad.

Valentine&#39;s day, party of 2 was  under 35 minutes wait time. The place could use a renovation and update, and the ambiance is no frills at all. However, we were satisfied with the service. We were seated and a host told us how the ordering worked when we asked. My fiance and I had the brunch buffet. However, at 2 p.m. we chose not to wait in the slow line for any breakfast because no one was there cooking it anyway. The breakfast set-up looked like it needed to be cleaned because it had spilled food strewn all other where it was supposed to be prepared. Anywho, the line for food was extra slow. Once I finally made my way to get served, I noticed that some of the bean side dishes were dried out (red beans, and blackeye peas). Good thing I didn&#39;t want any anyway, so  I passed on it. Immediately, they sent out a small serving of cornbread that me and my hubby shared. I did get 2 pieces of fried chicken, a small taste of jerk chicken and turkey, a smothered pork chop, dressing, greens, macaroni and cheese, fried corn, catfish nuggets, rib tips and candied yams. I loved the fried corn! The chicken was decent and seasoned but, one piece could&#39;ve been a little crispier. The catfish was ok, with a light crisp batter. I needed a little salt. The macaroni was decent with salt and pepper, nice and cheesey and browned on the top like I like it, you can taste the butter in it. The yams were good but, a tad too sweet for me but, good with nice flavoring. Greens were just ok, seasoned with sugar, which is not my personal preference. Rib tips, tasted baked with bbq sauce on top. Jerk chicken and turkey tasted baked too with a little jerk sauce, not really impressed. My pork chop was small and a little on the dry side with a thin gravy and no onions. The dressing was a real disappointment for me. I really was hoping it  would shine. It needed some help in the flavor department, it was bland. It needed sage, bell pepper, celery, salt, and onions and mine also had a crust that made it too hard to eat if I wanted to. Cornbread was, just ok. It has corn kernels in it but, I like mine a little sweeter. I left feeling full from fried chicken, macaroni, and fried corn. The buffet was $19, no drink or dessert included. They could use a better system of getting people served food faster. Food is cooked in smaller batches and you don&#39;t fix your own plate, it&#39;s kinda cafeteria style. A lot of food wasn&#39;t brought out that our server mentioned that was supposed to be there.They are a waste not, want not kind of establishment. Staff was friendly enough but, in general the place could use some improving in some areas. Free parking in the cheap motel next door that they share.

The food, not the venue, is clearly the draw at Pearl&#39;s Place. While the down-and-gritty Southern fare is honest, very delectable and reasonable, it is certainly in line with the all-American southern style of cooking. In 2014, Pearl&#39;s Place was voted one of the top 10 southern/soul-food restaurants in Chicago by Thrillist. The food is not an audacious departure from the usual Southern&#39;s judiciously sourced, self-righteously ethical ethos, but Pearl&#39;s Place feels as authentic as any venerable Dixieland food shack. Yee-haaww! We had some of dis....some uh dat and some more of this and dat! There were six of us from the Chicago Foodie Meet-Up group. Here is what we ordered, sampled and shared: (1) Smothered Short Ribs of Beef, (2) Smothered Fried Chicken (3) Smothered Baked Chicken, (4) Off-da-bone baked ham, (5) Wild fantail jumbo shrimp and (6) Farm-raised catfish. You can order their chicken three different ways: baked, fried or jerked.

They executed the smothered short ribs to perfection, which were succulent and beautifully charred. The meats were beautifully smoky and exceptionally tender with what we detected was a dry rub in copious black pepper. The baked chicken was just as succulent with a great caramel char around the edges delivering a smoky flavor. Sometimes restaurants focus more on the quality of meats or specialty fare, while the sides take a backseat, but this was not the case at Pearl&#39;s Place. In fact, the macaroni and cheese made with gobs of velvety cheese is like catnip for neo-rednecks, and 5-star worthy. The lush, creamy sauce clanged to the noodles and had some bite. Yow-zah, yow-zah! The superlative sides are the cheesy-cheddar grits topped off with jumbo fresh shrimp and crumbled real bacon, smothered cabbage, caramelized sweet yams and corn bread dressing with a classic buttery taste and an irresistibly emulsion of honey-butter. As we started eating, I began wondering if I would end up with more &#34;junk in my trunk&#34; than I had when I arrived. I plan to return for their breakfast buffet, and cannot wait to build upon the &#34;junk in my trunk!&#34;  ;D

We all agreed that the food is 4-star worthy, while the sides are awarded 5-stars! The cheesy grits and shrimp, corn bread dressing, macaroni and cheese are worth trying and are ethereal. Our favorite sides were (1) the corn bread dressing (2) the mac n cheese and (3) cheesy grits with shrimp. Pearl&#39;s offers breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets for a ridiculously low price. We decided to order off the menu. Buffet sharing is not allowed. The buffet changes daily. This is not your typical chicken and waffles joint. It has a very sparse, simple décor, and is not a pretentious restaurant.

I could swear (no, not the four letter word that starts with &#34;F&#34;) that the sides, short ribs, smothered fried chicken and catfish recipes might have been passed down from granny-kins to daughter. The fried chicken is simply brined, floured and fried and is very succulent with a perfectly extra-crispy and nearly greaseless crust. The fried catfish was also exceptional, and coated in an expertly seasoned layer of a light cornmeal (I think). Service was very friendly, ebullient, adequate, but incredibly lackadaisical. Four stars for service. Deprivation is the mother of Chicago restaurant hype, but Pearl&#39;s Place is not a restaurant for dare devil diners only. However, familiar comfort foods are represented, too, rescued from ubiquity with a fresh approach. 

Pearl&#39;s Place executes moist fatty Southern-style chicken, plus succulent, beautifully charred short ribs exquisitely. If sweets are your jam, save room for dessert! The cobblers are light, fluffy, bright and refreshing. Five people ordered desserts. We tried the Georgia peach and Michigan apple cobblers with an exceptionally flaky crust, but somewhat thick and dense edges. They are all house baked, not overly sweet, surprisingly delicate and delectable. We also ordered the lemon pound cake, &#34;guilt free&#34; chocolate layered cake, and banana bread pudding. Three people rated their desserts with 4-stars while the remaining two rated their desserts with 5-stars. The 5-star desserts were: Georgia peach cobbler, and Banana bread pudding. Some of the desserts are old-fashioned American staples that you can almost picture &#34;Dennis the Menace,&#34; with his silly grin and wide-blue eyes, swiping a slice of chocolate cake. Pearl&#39;s Place might look like a good place to get sloppy drunk, but the food here tells another story. Now, can I get an AMEN!!!"

The space is very large. It&#39;s a nice interior with some thoughtful decor. Both times I was there, there were just a handful of tables. The service was good both times. They walk you through the ordering process if you aren&#39;t familiar and both times, our server made recommendations based on the fact that I was there with people who had never been. 

The first time I went, there were two of us and we ordered a pound of snow crab, pound of headless shrimp, pound of crayfish and smaller portion of sausage. We thought that sounded like a ton of food, but we ate all of it in it&#39;s entirety. I did wish there was a bread or in this case, I probably should have ordered fries to soak up the delicious liquid that had accumulated in the bottom of the bag. For the two of us without drinks, we spent $60. In retrospect, for two people, you might be better off doing the combo.

The second time I was there was with a large group, including a toddler. It was a ton of fun for a group of people. I definitely recommend going with people you are very comfortable with. This isn&#39;t a blind-date kind of place. You need to be prepared to tear apart limbs, suck liquid out of a crayfish head, lick your fingers and leave smelling like you rolled in garlic. Sounds delicious, right?! It was. The food was vibrant. The flavors were bold with a kick. I crave it now. It&#39;s also a lot of fun to do something a little interactive and different for dinner. Both times I went, I left thinking about how scrumptious the food was and how much I can&#39;t wait to go back."

One of the worst experiences I&#39;ve had with a restaurant.  A sequence of things to go wrong 
1st, a lady from the restaurant called me which she could barely speak English, telling me that they didn&#39;t have the fresh crawfish that I ordered thru the app. They only had the frozen one that was $5 less by the pound. 2nd I asked her how I can be reimbursed my $5, she said she didn&#39;t know that I would have to call GrubHub then she said I would have to cancel the order.  In which I could not do thru the app. Alright whatever it&#39;s only $5 so I told her to proceed with the order. 3rd, We receive our order, the crawfish came too spicy to eat, dripping with oil- not what I ordered I asked for medium spice.

Btw...  He double charged my card, and I never received my food.  When I tried to call back, the phone was busy.  Wtf kind of restaurant is this???"

My. Life. And they have really really great prices. Truly affordable. And the restaurant is super clean. And the food was very fresh-tasting. And it was well-seasoned. I thoroughly loved this place.

We ordered combo #2(comes with curly fries also!) with all 3 seasonings at medium spice. We also got the garlic edamame which was mind blowing! Get it!

Place is very clean. Service was great and food came fast. No lines like Angry Crab. Probably because we were super early maybe at 6:30pm? Either way, ! I would&#39;ve given them 5 stars if the crayfishees were fresher. Had some that didn&#39;t taste too fresh off the boat. 

Would definitely go back again though!"

Came in here this weekend after a long day shopping Andersonville with my boyfriend. He&#39;s allergic to seafood, and it&#39;s my all time favorite--which you can imagine is a nightmare 9 times out of 10. 

The restaurant is much bigger than I imagined, but we came in pretty early(4:30ish?) so it wasn&#39;t overly crowded. Our server explained the whole menu and pointed out the items my boyfriend could choose from. Surprisingly there were more options for him than I expected. 

I tried snow crab legs and clams in the mixed seasoning at medium heat. Man oh man, was it yummy! Buttery, perfectly spiced seafood goodness. The one complaint if any is that the tables weren&#39;t wrapped with paper, so I felt like I made a huge mess after. Again, not a big thing, just something to keep in mind! My boyfriend had the garlic edamame, crazy wings, and Cajun fries and thoroughly enjoyed everything.

Could it be?! A seafood spot we can actually both enjoy?? YIPPIE, will definitely be returning soon."

I&#39;ve never been to Louisiana so I couldn&#39;t tell you but it was pretty good.  The staff is super nice since they just opened. I think the simplicity of their menu drives down the prices but keeps the quality pretty good.  

I&#39;m going to go back for more and update my review when I&#39;ve had a little bit more of the menu.   Bring friends lots of them.  From what I&#39;ve seen about Cajun eating it&#39;s about getting your hands dirty ( and they will ) and talking up a storm."

I just moved in with my boyfriend in Uptown, and we saw an ad for Crazy Crab #1 in the DNAInfo Chicago, Uptown periodical that gets delivered to our place, with a 10% off coupon.  We headed over for dinner last weekend, and was extremely surprised at how large the space was once we were inside.  We were seated promptly and provided waters and drinks (this place is NOT BYOB, but has a limited assortment of mostly domestics and some wines on the menu). 

We ordered the garlic edamame, two pounds of snow crab legs, one pound of head-on shrimp, and two corn cobs, all in the medium spiced mixture of their there sauces.  We also ordered two sides of white rice to soak it all up.  The food took a little bit to come out (although I was starving, so it probably just seemed longer to me), and the edamame we got first was REALLY good. Like SUPER garlicky and buttery and well seasoned. A great start to the meal. We got our seafood and rice shortly after, and overall the seafood quality was very good - the shrimp were fatty and the snow was nicely sized.  The sauce that they came in was really well flavored and pretty spicy (it builds up, don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn ya!).  Overall a really good and tasty meal.  They don&#39;t do the butchers paper on the table here, instead they serve a pail for shells and you get plates, which made it a little harder to eat since the snow crab legs completely took over the plate, but it&#39;s a small complaint.

Super excited that this is in my hood now - I will definitely be back again to devour more succulent seafood boil!"

The waitresses seemed inexperienced and/or new because whenever we asked them a question they were unsure and had to refer back to their manager. However they were nice and kept checking up on us to refill our waters. we mixed the Cajun and lemon sauces for all our seafood, which turned out pretty good. We ordered shrimp, king crab, and Dungeoness crab and it was delish. My only complaint would be that the fried seafood batter (fried oysters and fried squid) was too mushy."

The latest one, Crazy Crab #1, has landed in a hilariously-nondescript strip mall on the southwest corner of Lawrence and Clark, just behind an Italian-inspired cafe. It&#39;s so tucked away you&#39;re more likely to find it under a bed sheet. Only the squished-together font of the restaurant&#39;s sign makes it slightly noticeable. This is beyond &#34;blink-and-miss-it.&#34; Send out a search party, complete with bloodhounds, and you still might not find it. 

Odd thing, that. Because once you zone in on Crazy Crab #1 and walk through the front doors, you find a unique, Asian-Cajun-fusion that&#39;s really fun and inventive. And also damn good. 

It&#39;s also worth noting that the space is huge. Like, it could easily seat 100 without breaking a sweat. Given its facade, I&#39;d swear this damn thing&#39;s a TARDIS. 

Crazy Crab breaks down the menu by what&#39;s live and what&#39;s fresh. You have choices of everything from mussels and clams to lobster tails, head-on (or -off) shrimp and lots and lots of crab. Whole crabs. Soft shell crabs. Blue crab. Snow crab legs. It&#39;s Bubba Gump-esque, the crab love. 

Sides are plentiful -- a basket of fries comes out as an amuse bouche -- along with the typical boil fare of potatoes, sausage and corn. My girlfriend, who runs her own annual crawfish boil, groused about a lack of mushrooms, which suck up all the boil spices like a sponge and give people (even vegans, those poor saps) something tasty to snack on. And I would agree, but not for the boil spice. 

No, Crazy Crab #1&#39;s goodness comes from its three sauces offerings, potent-garlic-and-spice-filled concoctions that will make you want to bathe in them, licking your lips be damned. 

The sauces include a traditional-yet-perfect garlic butter and a well-balanced &#34;Crazy Cajun&#34; with just the right amount of cayenne and paprika. But it&#39;s the lemon pepper that outshines them all. Tangy and garlicky with a earthy kick of black pepper that just augments anything it touches. We ordered the lemon pepper for our clams, which came as part of Combination #1, a great introduction to the restaurant that also included crab legs and head-off shrimp, corn and potatoes. Each came in a separate bag, swimming in saucy goodness. After inhaling most of the clams, I started scooping out what remained of the lemon pepper sauce to ladle onto my seafood fried rice (chuck full of shrimp and mussels. A great side. Highly recommend).

And don&#39;t worry, the rest of the seafood is just as good. Perfectly cooked. Quick delivery. Ready to be cracked open and devoured. A roll of paper towels sits on every table for good measure. Don&#39;t be ashamed. Go to town. Revel in the mess. 

As typical with restaurants that rely on good word of mouth in lieu of foot traffic, the owner came out and asked us how our meal was. And if I wasn&#39;t basking in the wake of this meal, teeth still gnashing the last of the shrimp and potatoes, mouth coated in sauce like some sloppy vampire, I would have told him to take these sauces, bottle them open and start selling them. Online, at outdoor food markets, grocery stores -- I don&#39;t care. Then he could move from this spot and find a locale with decent signage."

The restaurant is very spacious and all the tables are neatly arranged and are equipped with the big buckets for shells, bibs, crab cracker tools, and a big roll of paper towels.  We decided to go with the first combo for $39.99.  It was definitely worth it and you get a lot for your money.  It&#39;s a great size for 2 people to share.  It came with Cajun fries, wings, and a bag filled with shrimp, crab legs, clams, corn, and potatoes lathered in the Cajun sauce.  Everything was delicious!

1. The seasonings were weak compared to the other places. I got all three flavors at medium spice level(2nd highest). I couldn&#39;t distinguish any of them and there was NO spice at all. The only thing I could taste was garlic. And maybe the recipe changed from when I had it because although another reviewer said it was salty, I found it to be disastrously under-seasoned.

2. The sausage they use is TERRIBLE for this application. Other places like Angry Crab and Lowcountry use a dense pre-cooked sausage that maintains it&#39;s integrity, but this place seem to use a raw Italian sausage style that water-logs and the casing turns into a rubber band that you have to peel off in order to make it edible.

3. I don&#39;t know what caused this, but I like to order head on shrimp because by the shell being  un-breached, the meat is a LOT more juicy and succulent compared to the headless shrimp which losses it&#39;s moisture during the cooking process. At Crazy Crab the heads were hanging off of the bodies as if they were cut before hand, making the meat more dry than expected. If you were the type to suck out the head juice, that would make this completely pointless.

4. They sent me an undercooked blue crab that was still cold in the middle. I didn&#39;t make a fuss about it because it was cheap and I didn&#39;t even know how to eat the damn thing but it&#39;s still was pretty weird.

I won&#39;t judge the fact that the drinks were limited to 3 products considering it was a soft opening, but it&#39;s important to note that this isn&#39;t a full blown creole/cajun place so don&#39;t expect the traditional offerings like beignets or cornbread, at this point it seems to be a stripped down seafood spot. It&#39;s cool to be in this neighborhood, but personally If I need a boil that bad I&#39;d much rather go to one of the other places in the city."

This is my first experience with eating seafood straight from the bag but the other people with us were from California and this Asian Cajun concept is big out West and they said that this restaurant was a lot better than some of the restaurants that they&#39;ve been to, which is a really good sign for this new restaurant. The portions are big and the flavors were so tasty. You definitely have to order the garlic edemame...you&#39;ll be licking your fingers after because it is so delicious. I had the snow crab legs &amp; crawfish and mixed all 3 flavors together...the sauces together were amazing...I took the bag home with me and plan on making garlic noodles for lunch tomorrow. This is a great addition to our Ravenswood neighborhood; definitely visit this place and then head over to Bella M Brianna next door after for Italian coffee and dessert!

Service &amp; Ambiance: 
Great service, food came out pretty fast. Ambiance is clean, casual, nautical themed decor. We went with 3 families with young children and a baby. Not too loud in there; my baby slept in her stroller next to our table. Can&#39;t wait for their bar/lounge to open with cocktails!"

Crazy Crab does have potential but I&#39;m going to wait at least two month before I return. 
The biggest problem was I was never sure who our server was, and the servers seemed to just walked around the dining room carrying food with blank looks on their faces as if they were not sure which table to bring the food.
I had the headless shrimp which were pretty good, a couple were on the &#34;tough&#34; side. Two of my table-mates had the same thing and said that they were all on the &#34;tough&#34; side. Someone in the kitchen was probably not paying attention to the timing as that&#39;s a sign of overcooking the shrimp. You really need to be careful with shrimp (as well as most seafood). The garlic edamame was very good.
The beer and wine lists are not very inspired. With the glut of local breweries out there to choose from, they could do a lot better than &#34;312&#34; as the only local representative. Then if you&#39;re a wine drinker, you have only a choice of red or white (one of each). There is also a small menu of mixed and soft drinks.
I want to like this place since it&#39;s in my neighborhood, and I enjoy this new low-country style of food. But of the four of us who dined there last week, I&#39;m the only who intends to return."

They chose the spicy sauce - medium. Shrimp were good, many of the mussels had detached from the shell and had to be fished out of the overly buttery sauce in the bag. Crab legs were fine but the only utensils available were the metal shell crackers, a fork and a red tool that was supposed to help get the meat but was difficult to use - and we had to ask for that. 
Third diner ordered green mussels and the 5oz lobster tail on the garlic sauce - medium spiciness. Mussels were tasty and large. Lobster was two small tails instead of one large 5oz tail - not as flavorful as expected. 
My meal - the crawfish - was a disappointment. I had no tool available other than my fingers to get the meat out of the claws and tail. The tails were small and very difficult to get the meat out. The one pound serving came with about 15 crawfish. I ate three and stopped because I was not able to get the meat - this after asking the server for a different tool and being given the red thing that looked like a staple remover with a handle. I ordered mine spicy - medium. As with our other meals - the ratio of butter to sauce was way too high. 
I brought home my uneaten crawfish meal for my college age son - who will eat anything - and even with the small metal forks we have at home he found that they were too much work for the effort. Ended up throwing out most of my meal. 
Two of us ordered a side of garlic pasta for $5.00. I swear it was Lipton Pasta-Roni that you can buy from Jewel for 75¢. 
Service was slow.  Our server disappeared at the end of our meal - we had to flag down someone else to get a bag for my meal and our check. 
If you are reading reviews - like we did - to decide if you will go. Please take a careful look at the 5 star reviews. At least four of them are from people who have been on Yelp for about three months before their review of Crazy Crab - and Crazy Crab is one of two reviews they have written.  I would have given CC two stars - for the mussels - but to have people write fake five star reviews to bump your rating is bad form. 
If you haven&#39;t guessed - unlike the 5 star reviewers - we will not go back."

Typically I don&#39;t like crab legs only because I don&#39;t like working so hard for my food.   I&#39;m a foodie, so I just wanted to try it as an experience. The Cajun seasonings are great.  Everything was pretty good (Crab Broil), except for the fried shrimp which were very mediocre.  Very nice staff and fast service."

The menu is small but robust with some standards and some intriguing options. We tried one standard Crab Cake Benedict and one intriguing Stinky French Toast.

The Crab Cake Benedict was delicious. The cakes were the perfect size and full of crab meat not filler. They were a nuce carrier for the eggs and holindaise. They were  accompanied by crispy bacon, toast and lyonnaise potatoes. The potatoes were OK not great, but rounded out the dish nicely.

I had a bite of the Stinky French Toast, and it was delicious. I prefer savory breakfast items and so I tend to avoid pancakes, french toast etc. This dish was really well balanced a bit more savory with a hint of sweet. The Stinky part was a mixture cheeses in the sauce between the layers of French Toast.  It was a really unusual and delightful combination.  I was happy to try. I really enjoyed my dish so maybe next time..."

Ordered: Flatbread pizza (forgot what kind), jack Daniels/sour

DRINKS: I ordered simple whiskey sours with jack Daniels and these were very, very strong. And consistently so. It wasn&#39;t like the bartender accidentally overpoured. Each one was as strong as the last. And very, very good.

FOOD: The flatbread came out hot and fast. And the crust was nice and crispy.

The food has never been a miss, the bread and spreads that come out are delicious, they give u cheese with the olive oil- they get it! Another all time favorite of ours that we typically share is the butternut squash raviolis- yuuuum! The meatballs are also really great a must try.

Ambiance first, it was lovely! I didn&#39;t realize how big the place is. 

Service was awesome! There were about 50+ people in our party and my glass was always re-filled without asking! 

The food was yummy! To start off, we dined on a couple of different salads; the Capri (tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and roasted peppers w/ a vinaigrette)and the Zia Pena (mixed greens, pears, tomato, walnuts w/ a honey mustard dressing). Both were tasty, but I just love a traditional Capri salad! Next, we had the bananas foster french toast...it came with ice cream and bacon...YUMMMM!!!! Definitely a favorite of mine...I mean, who doesn&#39;t want some ice cream with their breakfast?! :) We also had some potatoes, omelettes, etc. The french toast is what sticks out though!!! :)

Lovely outside patio with lovely lighting etc. Totally romantic.  Food was good. Not outta this world good but good. 
I had the seafood over linguine. This was tasty, the linguine a tiny bit softer than my expectations. I prefer a tender pasta with a bite to it.  The seafood variety was lovely with mussels, calamari, shrimp. Decent. 
Tasty desserts too: Tiramasu was good but the apple gallette (spelled wrong, sorry)  was absolutely delicious; flakey tender crust surrounding sliced baked apples with ice cream on top. Delicious and worth repeating. 

Service was fine. The server was training someone but he informed us immediately when he came to our table about it and asked if that was alright.  Of course it is.  They were attentive and sometimes too attentive but fine.  We were NOT rushed out, stayed for quite some time just talking and drinking our cocktails. 

The only annoyance to the restaurant were a few flies/gnats in the corner were we were seated. They were coming and going. My friend and I had to keep waving them off every 15-20 minutes or so. That was a pain. I swear it wasn&#39;t us as were were cleanly showered and smelled so fresh! :-)

I got the house specialty pasta the first time - the Rotolo - which was absolutely incredible. Two circles of tri-colored pasta wait sausage and this incredible house sauce which was the highlight of the dish. Susage, spinach, and a three cheese sauce. 
I&#39;d get it again in a heartbeat.

We also returned for brunch with some friends. I will say, the only negative thing, the service was pretty poor. Despite open tables, we weren&#39;t seated for a long time. I can appreciate trying to place people outside, but when there are plenty of open tables all around maybe just ask us if we&#39;d rather be seated sooner.

The entrance doors are enormous and they are very similar to fortress doors. They had to have been a foot thick and 10 feet tall! Zia&#39;s had a dark, cozy ambiance. It was almost too dark at times. We had to illuminate our phones in order to properly read the menu. 

I ordered a bottle of the Bricco Riella, which was their Moscato. I&#39;m not usually a wine drinker, but this wine was quite good. I tend to prefer sweet wine, and this Moscato did not disappoint.

The starter bread was warm and fresh, and they served homemade giardiniera, olive oil,  and Parmesan cheese to go with the bread. Our party had to be careful to not fill up on the bread! That always seems to be a challenge at an Italian restaurant. 

I ordered Bruschetta as an appetizer as I always do when at an Italian restaurant. It was satisfactory - warm toasted bread, tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. For my main course, I ordered the Vitello Caluzza, which included Veal, sun-dried tomatoes, peas, goat cheese, white wine and garlic angel hair. The veal was a little chewy and fatty. I was disappointed that the veal wasn&#39;t as tender as some of the other veal dishes I&#39;ve had in the past. Despite this, it was a good mixture and the dish was satisfactory. 

Our waiter was energetic and fun. I enjoyed his charismatic nature. He seemed rushed but that&#39;s expected on a Saturday night. He entered in one of the orders incorrectly, but quickly rectified the situation. He comped our dessert dishes. I got the chocolate pate and it was one of the richest desserts I&#39;ve ever had.

The atmosphere was gorgeous, and the waitstaff was very friendly and attentive. For the first half of the meal I kept thinking &#34;After this mimosa, I&#39;m going to switch to a bloody mary.&#34; Finally I had to get up for the bloody mary bar regardless of my glass level, because the waiters never let it get close to half-empty. Now that&#39;s a brunch-lover&#39;s dream.

Additionally, we brought a couple with a 9-month-old here, and we had no trouble accommodating the baby with a high-chair. The kitchen was also happy to send us a plate of scrambled eggs for him to &#34;eat&#34; (and by &#34;eat&#34; I mean delightedly squish with his hands and smoosh around the plate.

We were begging...for bread...for water...for Parmesan...for our appetizer...for our meal. The waiter (Joe) told us the restaurant was understaffed for the night. Ok Captain Obvious, but not a single employee in there was &#34;rushing&#34; around. The busboy would amble by and totally miss our water re-fill. We had to call him over. Three times. On one of those re-fills, he just skipped one of the diners. So two of us got more agua, the third had to hope he&#39;d wander by again!

Waited a half hour to place our order, another HOUR for food to arrive. That&#39;s crazy. The ladies restroom had four stalls with a single stall in working order. That&#39;s crazy. 

The food was piping hot, when it finally arrived, with average tastiness. That, plus Joe being well spoken, rates this place two stars.

They were great but I had the biggest food envy and had to get the breakfast pizza the next time I came. I highly suggest the breakfast pizza but nobody in my groups were unhappy with any items. 

But people let me tell you there is nothing better at this restaurant than the brunch drink special. It&#39;s 12 dollars for bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary&#39;s. That&#39;s right people this is not a drill. Bottomless anything in Chicago for that price is a sign from God to drink. But better than that you get to switch between the two! I always just want one bloody and then more mimosas than I can keep track of. And if you get Paris you will make sure that&#39;s what you get.

Sunday brunch review.  

Service - 3
Food - 4 
Ambiance/decor - 5

I specifically selected this place because my friend wanted to have unlimited Bloody Marys for brunch and I found this just for her.   Awww.  Well all that and she did not even get the Bloody Marys because it was a Bloody Mary &#34;make-it-yourself&#34; bar (but I did not find this odd as this is how I&#39;ve seen it done at most restaurants...so yeah...).  For $12, you can get unlimited mimosas or Bloody Marys.  Pretty sweet deal. 

They have complimentary parking which is nice and a very large patio (covered in snow currently)!  

Their menu is fairly basic but a unique item or too such as the breakfast pizza.  No pancakes on the regular menu but they did have a &#34;special&#34; butternut squash pancake with ice cream and berries.  Our group split this as a sweet treat and they were fantastic.  Nicely flavored, not too overpowering, with a little ice cream and berries.  Well done. 

My friend and I split the chicken/waffles and the Bananas Foster French Toast with bacon.  Both were good.  The chicken and waffles were a bit ordinary but fine.  The french toast was very good.  A little soggy but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s from the bananas and ice cream. 

The dining room is very large and is extra festive right now with really lovely holiday decorations.  Very inviting and interesting space, a bit rustic, a bit gothic, high ceilings, airy and open. 

Overall, a fine experience."

The bottomless bloody/mimosas situation is a bargain and a half. Seriously wonderful. And the brunch menu is pretty much fire. I have had the breakfast pizza and not regretted getting that. All other plates I have seen looked great and didn&#39;t disappoint. 
Beyond brunch I don&#39;t have much to say, besides the wait staff. We have had great waiters. Shout out to Paris. You da bomb. It&#39;s great when your server is down to have fun with you and friendly.

Well, one was my fiancee and the other three were our friends. But anyway, nothing says romantic like a big brunch and unlimited mimosas and bloodys, right? Well, we weren&#39;t the only one with that thought; the place was surprisingly packed despite it being V-Day and snow starting to hit.

It&#39;s not hard to see why - ZLV turned out to be a really beautiful space that, while only a few years old, felt like it could&#39;ve been around for decades with it&#39;s gigantic front door, high ceilings and great decor. The food was good; everyone&#39;s plates were huge and I was perfectly happy with my chicken and waffles, which I&#39;d recommend.

Of course, the real reason we were here was for the unlimited booze. You can jump between bloodys and mimosas at will, and the fixings for the bloody mary bar were good. You have cheese, cured meat, random veggies, and a small selection of spices and hot sauces. Putting it over the edge is the fact that they also have shrimp available. Though there was that woman who brought a plate up to the bar and just filled it up with shrimp and cheese...I mean, I get that it&#39;s unlimited, but that still felt kind of weird.

It&#39;s probably a good thing that I don&#39;t live any closer to ZLV, otherwise my fiancee would demand we come here every week and I&#39;d be one step closer to liver failure. As for the rest of my Valentine&#39;s Day, the girls got their nails done and we finished our day off with some pizza. Would spend V-Day day drinking again!"

Many of us ordered salads, pizzas and the special butternut squash ravioli (not one ravioli was left behind). They also had a great wine deal, bottle of house for $20. Three of us split a bottle of red and I do not regret it. I ate the carpaccio salad and split the burrata salad with one of the girls.

What&#39;s not to love here? Prosciutto-laden brunch items: awesome. Bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary&#39;s at $12 per person: also awesome. My heart belongs to the breakfast pizza with the over easy eggs on top, but I have been known to dabble in some prosciutto panini as well. Both items are phenomenal. Service has always been great (or, based on other reviews, maybe we were just too drunk to notice), the bartenders are fun to chat with, and the mimosa/Bloody Mary deal will have you calling an Uber home - and I mean that in the best way possible.

Abundant amounts of prosciutto and endless booze: what more could you possibly need?

#1: sat in the bar with a friend. Half price wine night, yes! Our server was a doll and super knowledgable about the menu. She was attentive and the food was delicious! Had a Caesar salad for starters, and the rigatoni Piedmontese as my entree. The entree is gargantuan--leftovers for days. All in all, a fun evening with good food. 

#2: sat in the bar with husband, son, and in-laws. Our server knew nothing about the menu, nor did he know what beers they served! He missed menu items that we ordered, including an entree with sauce requested on the side--the dinner came with sauce totally smothered and our diner was really disappointed. Unfortunately, this made for a tense evening with not-so-good food. 

I really like Zia&#39;s, and I&#39;m willing to try again, but the inconsistency is killer. Plus, what&#39;s up with the paid valet? Best part about pulling up to Zia&#39;s used to be the free valet parking. 

I&#39;ll be back, but I guess I have to just cross my fingers and hope for the best."

It seems like a good place to have a group meal and private events. My family has also had food catered from here and extended family seems to like their food. I just have never really been that big of a fan. One, because it&#39;s Italian food. Two, I&#39;ve had better.

Recently went and tried one of their special dishes - tilapia. 3 pieces which was good and served with basmati rice. I didn&#39;t care for the sauce though.

I think I&#39;ve only been here one or two other times and can&#39;t even remember what I had, it&#39;s that forgettable ha!"

Zia&#39;s has a great covered outdoor area which opens into the interior as well with huge collapsible walls. The waiter we had was very attentive and definitely knew the food and wine/beer menu well. 

For the food:

-As an appetizer we ordered the escargot and the short rib ravioli (I don&#39;t recall the Italian name). Both were tasty but not very large portions, glad we ordered two appetizers. That being said they do have unlimited fresh bread with olive oil, a vegetable medley and parmesan cheese. 

-For the entrée I ordered the sausage pasta dish (sorry I don&#39;t recall the name for this either) and it was tasty and a generous portion. I would definitely recommend ordering this dish! One friend ordered the steak and while it was good it is a smaller portion, which you know beforehand of course (8oz). The steak was cooked correctly and seasoned well. 

Overall a great experience. I would like to get back to try the brunch since so many reviews here have very positive things to say...and you can&#39;t go wrong with bottomless mimosas."

If you like wine, you&#39;ve got it.
If you like cocktails, no worries, there&#39;s a full bar.
If you like great pasta, you&#39;re in because they make some of it in house
If you like seafood, you won&#39;t be disappointed
If you like dessert, you&#39;ll live with their standard choices

I can&#39;t give it five stars only because when comparing it to other italian restaurants of its caliber, it misses the mark only by a centimeter with not much innovation.

If you like consistent food and drinks enveloped in a non-pretentious atmosphere, Zia&#39;s will take you there."

Food = 3.5 or 4
Bloody Mary bar = 4.5

We came here was brunch. This seems like a popular place for larger groups and party area. 

Service was great and helpful. I thought it was pretty cool to see a self service bloody mary bar. The bartender hands you the basic vodka and mix and you get to add in the Worchesire sauce, hot sauce (they have quite the variety) and pepper. And then you take a skewer to pick up any olives, ham, celery, coctail shrimp, or cheese to garnish your drink. 

I got to share and try the following:
-crab cake benedict - the crab cake was tasty
-Brennan eggs benedict - the spicy ham and spinach was good too.
-the flat bread pizza was okay...but I think it would do best to share as an appetizer. 

The poached eggs on the benedict was not too great. I am such an egg addict but this was a slight let down because I could taste the vinegar used to poach eggs."

We were told on the phone that if we were dining here and going to the cubs game that we could leave are car in the lot for free. It is even on their web site. When we arrive we were told that it would be $50.00 to park if we were dining and going to the game. The web site says that parking is free on cubs game days. When we questioned the manage he had an attatude and said I dont know why they would have told you that. Maybe if you looked at your web site you would know why it says free parking on Cubs game days. Not a good way to do business.

BIG MISTAKE. We walked in and the place was busy probably because the  $12 bottomless mimosas or bloody Mary&#39;s or Probably because the people won&#39;t mind to pay $5 for a parking space in their own parking lot!! But not us we drive far in found a parking space at the street. Looking the menu we notice was not much food to offer for lunch so as soon as our server approaches to us and ask if we wanted anything to drink and I said yes coffee and my bud ordered orange juice. Server turn around with a mad face. (Sorry if I&#39;m a runner and I can&#39;t drink alcohol the day before one of my long runs buddy) it took him around 10-15 min con tome back to the table with the non alcoholic drinks. He finally decide to take the order. Two stars for the food cause the food was actually pretty tasty but the server attitude is something probably they will need to work on. We watch him pass by us the whole time we were eating he never stop to asked if I need more coffee or water or anything else when he saw the plates were empty for around 10-15 min and never said anything we actually had to asked to the check to the hostess. For that the server approach to us and every time (the 3 times he stopped by the table) keep calling my bud &#34;BRO&#34;. Kind of annoying

Did I mention bottomless mimosas or bloody Mary&#39;s?! Yes folks they have a Bloody Mary bar. Breakfast pizzas! Lemon French toast! Oh yes, my friends and I will be returning again. 

Quick tip: this place is packed for Sunday brunch. Make a reservation and if you want to sit on the patio specify it with your reservation. It was a gorgeous day outside (finally Spring is here!). 

Everything is very reasonably priced. I think my friends and I walked away stuffed (and some a little drunk) for just $20-$25 each.

We started with a drink at the bar. The bartender wasn&#39;t the friendliest, but whatevs. We sat down and started to go hard on the bread with oil and cheese because we were so hungry.

We ordered a bunch of apps...grilled and fried calamari, the cheese board and a few other things I&#39;m sure I&#39;m forgetting about. Everything was really tasty. For entrees I split two things with my boss because I couldn&#39;t decide on one and she was looking at the same two items.

As someone in the service industry, who makes a living from tips, I can say it was horrible. The server made us feel stupid for asking questions, and guilty for staying and drinking our bottomless drinks. 

Not only did the waiter ignore us (pretty much the entire time)...the host (or whoever she was) asked us to get up from our table because they had reservations and we needed to leave. When we asked for a refill on our &#34;bottomless&#34; mimosas...the host lady came over again and said that we needed to leave/move. We just stated we were getting a refill and then moving to the bar. She then said well you should just go to the bar because there were still waiting for the table. She also made us feel stupid and talked down to us because we thought there was no time limit on this mimosa deal. 

With that said...we left because why would we want to stay where we&#39;re not wanted...DO NOT EVER GO HERE if you want to have fun and drink and not hate everyone who works there."

We got a couple bottles of the wine special (great wine for $20 a bottle), and shared the quail app as well as the pizza with the figs and I think pancetta? Both very good. For dinner I had the rigatoni with veal and pork ragout, husband had the pork served with polenta and broccolini. Phenomenal pasta, delicious pork.

They don&#39;t have your traditional brunch items or a buffet, but the food is different and good nonetheless. The decor is very pretty, and they have an outdoor seating area (there was a 30 minute wait to sit outside and not a lot of shade spots, so we sat inside). 

Their brunch items range from egg dishes to a breakfast pizza. I decided to go with one of the specials, which was a vegetarian version of eggs benedict (they used a tomato instead of a english muffin). It was very good, I was actually surprised at how good it was! My friend was not a fan of his breakfast pizza. However, they have $12 unlimited mimosas, so I guess that made up for it. Our server was very nice and came back around numerous times. Sometimes when they say &#34;unlimited&#34; anything it means as many times as the server comes around, which is 2.

Look no further than Zia&#39;s. They have the perfect combination to make your brunch a successful one - delicious food and a great deal for unlimited mimosas and/or an unlimited bloody mary bar ($10!).

-Breakfast pizza: thin and crispy crust, good amount of prosciutto and bacon, and topped off w/ 2 eggs. I definitely recommend this.
-Bloody mary bar: large assortment of hot sauces (sriracha, tabasco, tapatio, etc) and delicious garnishes (shrimp, salami, peppers, and blue-cheese stuffed olives just to name a few). I&#39;m not a math person, but I&#39;m pretty sure w/ all the offerings, you could make 237645 different combinations. Definitely one of the better bloody mary bars
-Other items at my table included the chicken and waffles, steak and eggs, omelette, and salad (I forget which one). There were no complaints about the food and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their dishes.

It gets crowded, so definitely make a reservation. 4 stars instead of 5 because our waitress was so hard to find when we were there. Yes, I know that we went on a busy day and we had a large party, and yes I know that she had other tables to tend to, but I feel like she could have done a better job checking in on us. We really had no idea where she was most of the day, and we had to flag down other servers whenever we needed something. Aside from that, I have no complaints.

The decor of the restaurant is super cool. The front doors are ginormous and makes you feel like you&#39;re entering a castle. It&#39;s a great spot for groups. There were twelve us and they had no problem taking a reservation and setting is up at a long row of high top tables. 

The mimosas were delish and our waitress was on point in regards to serving. Not once did we have to ask for another drink, because she had fresh glasses coming our way before we were even done with the ones we already had! Love it.

I enjoyed the panini on the brunch menu which had prosciutto and mozarella cheese along with some of the best potatoes I&#39;ve ever had. Very very good!

* bruschetta 
* lasagna 
* linguini pescatore
* rigatoni bolognese
* rigatoni with vodka sauce 
* rotolo

The waiter was in such a rush that he couldn&#39;t be bothered to explain the wine list or suggest what would be a good drink to go along with our food. At some point he came to ask how the food was, literally yelled it from two tables away and turned away before we could even tell him how horrible he was.

The lasagna was solid as usual but my wife&#39;s veal was dry and chewy; it felt like it had been in the fridge for a while before they finally decided to serve it.

We had a 7:30 reservation and at 8 pm the server comes out to tell us the kitchen is closing at 8 so we hurriedly put in our order. Why would you take a 7:30 reservation if the kitchen is closing in 30 min?

Some other customer came in for their 7:30 reservation, got a drink at the bar and when they were getting ready to be seated they told them the kitchen was closed. Really? Why didn&#39;t someone tell us when we made the reservation, when we walked in, or when we sat down at the table that the kitchen was closing soon? 

The server proceeded to emasculate our husbands during dinner asking one if they would like another Cosmo (he had a Manhattan) and turns to the other and said ma&#39;am, what would you like for dinner? He is bald and had a beard. While this might be slightly comical if we had already established a rapport, this was sadly not the case.

Ok tone poor tone. More on that later.

We sit at the table, two of us ordered drinks previously from the bar. The other two were thirsty. Waiter comes out, doesn&#39;t ask us about drinks or appetizers. Waiter said he didn&#39;t realize the other two people didn&#39;t have drinks. We order apps, then a bottle of wine. Food comes out. We begin eating, no wine still. Finally we remind the server and he gets it.

Kitchen was clearly rushed - burnt fish and dry chicken. But we also felt very rushed and pressures to leave simply because no one told us the kitchen closed at 8 when we booked a 7:30 reservation.

The worst was that toward the end of the meal (keep in mind we had a 7:30 pm arrival, check came out at 8:45 pm, left the restaurant by 9:05 pm) my friend went to the bathroom and overheard our server, the bus staff and others complaining about us being in the restaurant. They said, &#34;What the f--- are these people doing, it&#39;s f---ing Christmas Eve.&#34; Referring to us already getting ready to leave the restaurant. 

This is absolutely shameful service and clearly a communication breakdown between the management and front of house. Very unfortunate because the previous year the other couple we were with had a great time and had an even later reservation.

If someone would have told us at any point of contact (when we made the reservation, when we got a cocktail at the bar, when we checked in with the host, when the waiter first greeted us) that they were getting ready to close the kitchen we would have made appropriate arrangements--either coming in earlier or going someplace else.

Insults with dinner, along with poor service is always a recipe for disaster."

Toward the end of brunch maybe he did .... but the beginning saw nothing more than empty flute glasses, no refilled coffee, a shout out from Kevin in the middle of the dining room to ask if we were ok, and then me having to go up to the bar for mimosas because our server disappeared again..... to boot, the food was very mediocre this time around. The fried chicken and waffles were blah.... chicken wayyyyy too spicy, waffles cold, no extra syrup (until I asked for it) and when I asked for no bacon, maybe they could have offered a substitute. 

I get it - most people are going here for the  champagne unlimited mimosas for ten bucks... but when the food and service are bordering crap..... I&#39;d rather spend my money elsewhere."

Chocolate and hazelnuts galore, not to mention it&#39;s topped with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and came with 3 slices of bacon(my fave).

The questions were  all positives about the place. So I am here to tell both sides.
Our waitperson, Shannon, is a treasure for them. She is personable ( not overly) and seems to really enjoy her job ( and even if she doesn&#39;t, she doesn&#39;t show it!). She was great. The menu is limited, and not very interesting,,lasagne, spaghetti bolognese. I ordered a strangely sweet pizza ( a white pizza with chicken and artichoke). Surely they could find some more interesting choices in the realm of Italian cuisine Most of the food seems &#34;American Italian&#34;...and before you jump on me I am of Italian descent  ( Bolognese)and have spent a lot of time in Italy. The food is just &#34;OK&#34;
Definitely not a date place, or first date place ( fortunately, I was there with friends, not a date). It was early in the evening and only about half full , and they seated us back in a corner, right next to a wedding rehearsal dinner, with only a curtain between....We got every word of the speeches coming over their loudspeaker. Even when we left, there were other tables that would have been a better choice, had we known ( as they did) that there was a party. Also, annoying, but not the restaurants fault, more of a Lakeview thing , is that the were quite a large number of children . We had two screaming and jumping in the booth next to ours , the kind of behavior that wouldn&#39;t have been acceptable to my parents, at least. So if, you want a quiet night- don&#39;t go here, at least not until later in evening! The room is cavernous , and NOT designed to keep the noise down, There are far many better choices in the area, I am sorry to say, because, being in the neighborhood, I WANTED  to love it..."

I came here around 6pm with 2 friends and a baby. No wait and we could choose inside or outside. The patio was very lovely but we chose to sit inside. The indoor dining space behind the bar area is absolutely gorgeous. It feels like you&#39;re in Italy! (At least in my imagination of someone who&#39;s never been). 

We were able to get a high chair for my friend&#39;s baby and the waitress also gave him a kid friendly drink cup that he loved. I have complaints about the service. Our waitress was really nice and a sweet girl. 

I ordered the Escargot en Cocotte for an appetizer and the Rotolo for my entree. The escargot was fresh and buttery, but I couldn&#39;t taste the garlic and overall I felt lacked flavor. The Rotolo was beautiful but there was something in the ingredients that made it tart. Maybe one the cheeses? It almost had a sour taste. Maybe it was the tomatoes sauce. I don&#39;t know this is how is supposed to taste, but it was just ok for me. 

My friends ordered the Filetto al Formaggio and the Pollo Ripieno. I tried a bite of each and it was delicious! I wish I would&#39;ve ordered something else instead. I&#39;ll definitely be back to try another dish."

The place is full of people, offers an indulgent brunch menu, and boasts a $12 bottomless bloody Mary bar/mimosas deal. The inside is fairly dark, you&#39;ll likely need to yell to hear what people are saying, and the hits of yesteryear play the whole time. 

I ordered the banana nut French toast and subbed out the side of bacon for a side of fruit, which I think might have ended up costing me extra, but I never received an itemized receipt personally, so I don&#39;t know. I will say that this restaurant was extremely not vegetarian friendly, as not a single item on the menu is vegetarian without customization. Even still the food was amazing. My dish was banana bread made into French toast, topped with crème anglaise, chocolate sauce, and a scoop of hazelnut ice cream. Definitely not something I would get everyday as it was extremely heavy, but it was delicious. The side fruit salad was not nearly as good. It consisted mostly of underripe honeydew, cantaloupe, and pineapple, but the strawberries and blueberries were good.

The service on the other hand was terrible. Our server came up and forcefully asked everyone to show their ID&#39;s despite the fact that not everyone (myself included) was drinking. After being there for around 20 minutes she finally took our order. When the food came, some of the drinks had still not been delivered to the table. When my friend asked about it, the server responded with &#34;Look, I have two tables outside and I can&#39;t be everywhere at once.&#34; When my other friends asked if they could have mimosas instead of bloody Mary&#39;s, our server said they would need to chug them before she could do anything as she couldn&#39;t have them &#34;double-fisting.&#34; We had to explain that they did not want the bloody Mary&#39;s at all, which she understood after a little convincing. She did not keep the mimosas filled thereafter, however. When the check came, she told us it could only be split four ways. We took the time to write out what items would be on each card, which she thanked us for, but told us she needed it according to seat numbers, and basically redid all of our work. 

Maybe it was an off day, but I think you could probably find better brunch in Chicago. The food was good, but overpriced and lacking in content for vegetarians. The service was also horrendous, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;d return."

They were not too busy as of yet. The waiter &#34;David&#34; was rude from the beginning. He didn&#39;t stand long enough ever at my table to hear what I ordered, wanted or needed. He didn&#39;t go over the specials and didn&#39;t over over the wine of the day. Instead he was curt, inattentive and snippy throughout the whole dinner experience. 

Our food was mediocre at best. The Seafood pasta.... it was spicy. I asked ahead of time for them not to make it such, as my son would not like it. When it came out...it was still spicy.  He didn&#39;t ask to replace it, when I complained. I had to pay and order for another meal for my son. 1 and half hour later we left unsatisfied and the best part???

When I shared my experience with the manager &#34;Ryan&#34; he gave an apology but David just came over to 5 mins later to back talk saying I never requested un-spicy. Nice. David, you have no idea what it means to be a server. 

I do not recommend this place at all. Its loud, the servers are rude, and the food is just expensive Olive Garden variety.

Its a pass"

It was out of this world. 

Unlimited bloody Mary&#39;s and mimosas for ten dollars during brunch were amazing. The bloody was made with zig zag mix which is the best imo. It also is a Bloody Mary bar which makes for an even better experience. This place is great for brunch and I will be back for sure. The people work hard to make sure you get enough drinks as well.

A couple paradigm-shifting experiences here on Sunday:

1. A place exists where one can consume 3 bloody mary&#39;s and 2 mimosa&#39;s for $10. This is not a drill. 
2. A menu-item described as &#34;Stinky French Toast&#34; can indeed be awesome. If you go to Zia&#39;s, try the Stinky French Toast. The portions here are absurd and everything is reasonably priced.

Finally - If you&#39;re the type that cares about these things, the clientele here is absolutely beautiful. 

I&#39;d like to visit again and try Lunch/Dinner and I plan to do so in the near future."

Our server was so very attentive to refill our drinks and the woman who may have been the manager would walk around and help and check-in as well. They weren&#39;t being super annoying with the check-ins (big pet peeve of mine) with constantly asking how we&#39;re doing - they let us have our conversation. But they did notice quickly that we had an extra person come in about 30 minutes after everyone (aka Me) and was checked on pretty quickly. I didn&#39;t feel rushed to leave either - big plus! Though that did mean it took a little while to flag down our waiter for the check in the end. Oops.

The salads are great, steak and eggs superb, chicken and waffles divine. Bloody Mary bar has some great little accoutrements... We watched them stuff their olives with blue cheese at the bar.

I returned to Zia&#39;s on the strength of my prior visit 16 months ago as well as on the ongoing 4.5-star aggregate rating it carries. 

Well, things change, don&#39;t they?

This time, expectations just weren&#39;t met, and my mind is made up it will be Angelina or elsewhere going forward. 

First of all, I found it strange on a weekend evening it was so dead. Secondly, the thin crowd wasn&#39;t what I&#39;d call cutting edge or trendy--not that there&#39;s anything wrong with that. I just found it odd compared to my prior visit and almost felt like I was in the burbs at the place with the bread sticks. Maybe my most recent visit to Summer House spoiled me? 

The food was just not up to par with my prior visit. To wit:

Bruschetta. Bland and needlessly overloaded with tomatoes such that over half of them inevitably fell off anyway. Remove two-thirds of the tomatoes and add some olive oil and maybe garlic, and you would be good to go.

Rosemary Potatoes. I&#39;m not sure, but I believe they deep fried these? Otherwise, I have no explanation as to how they were so infused with grease. Shocking.

Pasta entree. Again, bland. 

Chicken entree. The chicken itself was actually pretty good and the highlight of the evening. 

Polenta. Uh-uh. 

Complimentary bread. Glad I left my diamond rings at home because they would have been in harm&#39;s way on the table with this stuff. 

Service was still very good, but I&#39;m 80 percent about the food and 20 percent about the service. 

Arrivederci, Zia. We&#39;ll always have 16 months ago."

I love the front bar area that opens up onto the outdoor patio.  We generally belly up to the bar on a lazy Sunday evening, grab a bottle of wine and a couple appetizers / salads to share.  They always have a $20 white and red bottle special.  Nothing big name but always a decent red, especially for the price.  The Barbabietola beet salad is amazing, as well as the Burrata salad with grilled peaches. YUM!  They serve appetizer portions of the Roasted Butternut Squash and Beef Short Rib raviolis - both so good!  And great for sharing.  The only reason for 4 stars is inconsistent service.  Always nice, but can be incredibly slow...  Not that we are in a huge hurry but frustrating to wait 15 minutes to order sometimes!  Another nice perk was free valet, so you could park for a $5 tip.  Now they charge - which is why the parking lot is empty!  Still a great go-to spot."

But I sure was glad he lives in the neighborhood and knows what&#39;s good, as this place blew me away the other night with it&#39;s outstanding food, impeccable and friendly service and ambiance that was cozy and large all at the same time.  It had the feeling of an established restaurant even though it hasn&#39;t been open that long.

First the doors.  I thought I had landed in a giant&#39;s castle so large were the two front doors,  And their size is only equaled by the energy it takes to pull them open, but that is just part of the charm.

In the front is a large bar area that is warm and inviting and in the back is the actual restaurant although you can eat in either space.  They had just decorated for the holidays when I was there so there were lights twinkling, ornaments hanging and just an overall wonderful feeling to the place.

We were seated along the wall by the wine and immediately given warm bread with olive oil and freshly grated parmesan to dip it in as well as a pickled carrot dish as a complimentary starter.   I wish I could remember our server&#39;s name as this guy was great, taking such pride in what he did that I wanted him to pull up a chair and sit awhile with us.

The menu has such a wide range of Italian favorites, it&#39;s hard to choose.  And there are specials each day as well so put on those reading glasses, loosen your belt and get ready for an Italian feast. 

I opted for a house salad as a starter and their Bolognese sauce over pasta as my entrée.  My friend ordered two appetizers (I use that term loosely as they were huge and one could have sufficed and this is for a grown man)  He had the Eggplant parmesan and the pumpkin stuffed ravioli and both were delicious.

Our drinks were perfectly poured, our food came up piping hot and served with a smile and the price?  Super reasonable.

Loved this spot and can&#39;t wait to go back.  And I can only imagine how nice it will be to sit outside in the Summer months with a bottle of wine and some great conversation to wile away the time.

This stretch of Ashland doesn&#39;t get a lot of accolades.  But  it should now that Zia&#39;s is here.  I&#39;m just happy my friend lives nearby as it is definitely on the top of my &#34;go to list&#34; when in his neighborhood.  Check it out!"

And sometimes with many reviews you&#39;re just not sure what to expect. I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised with this place. It caters to all age groups, so it won&#39;t be the young, hip place you might think, but it&#39;s also not a crusty, antiquated establishment either.
The wine list is good/smart, and bottle prices are reasonable (much more economical than places in the loop or river north for example). The pizzas have a nice thin, almost cracker like crust which worked for me. Service was very attentive without being overbearing. Anxious to go back and try other things on the menu."

We didn&#39;t have to wait long to be seated, surprisingly. &amp; our server, Gwen, was awesome! I have nothing but great things to say about her. All in all, this place had great food and great service. We will definitely be coming back."

The only criticism I have is that it was so freaking cold in there and there was no light in there.  Also, it was busy, so it was a bit tough to get hold of our waitress.

If you&#39;re looking for a brunch to get drinking, Zia&#39;s is great. They&#39;re the reason I learned to love Bloody Marys. 

If you&#39;re looking for a brunch to do that and get food if you&#39;re a vegetarian... Yeah. I try to be as accommodating as possible, I really hate when vegetarians go into a place without checking the menu, without knowing what they&#39;re getting, and make a hassle to get vegetarian food. I try to accommodate. If a place has some options, that&#39;s fine, if a place has none, I dodge it.

For the most part prior, Zia&#39;s had at least options that were fine for vegetarian. The breakfast pizza with veggies instead of meat is fine, but I&#39;m allergic to eggs so I dodge that for the most part, and they had like waffles or some other usual breakfast item that came without meat. Never had a problem.

Until today. We show up, everything is like usual, and I check out the menu.. Low and behold, there&#39;s no other options outside of the pizza, not even on the special menu. Okay. Girl orders the pizza with veggies, I ask if I can get like waffles with fruit. They say its fine.

Pizza shows up with no veggies, no meat, and just eggs. I get three pieces of waffles and a cup of syrup, with nothing else on the plate period. No fruit, nothing. Thank god I ordered the side of potatoes which has been a staple of mine at Zia&#39;s.

Could have I ordered anything else and requested no meat? I&#39;ve done that, you can tell that the recipe is catered to that specific ingredient, which is understandable, that&#39;s how it works, and unfortunately, that means the order doesn&#39;t taste as good because it isn&#39;t mean to exist without the meat counterpart necessarily. A salad that&#39;s meant to have meat will not taste good without it, because the recipe is meant to have it, and in the case of Zia&#39;s, they don&#39;t do much to accommodate making an alternative. Honestly, I&#39;d be happy to have one brunch item that doesn&#39;t have eggs and doesn&#39;t have meat, and that&#39;s how it had been for over a year, but no longer."

Only a surprise because I had never heard of it before. I went for dinner arranged by a friend and was so happy with her choice. The atmosphere was really classy, dimly lit with quiet music playing in the background. It has kind of an old world Italian decor that turns out to be the perfect setting for a fantastic Italian meal. They have an extensive wine selection that happened to be half-off all bottles the Tuesday night that we went. I noticed on a display board that they offer really great specials on both drink and food for each night of the week. In addition to the wine, they also offer a full bar selection with an impressive beer selection on tap. The food menu offers just about anything Italian your heart could desire that definitely didn&#39;t disappoint. Our table ordered a wide array of options from the menu and after tasting how delicious my Rigatoni Bolognese was, I then proceeded to invite my fork to everyone else&#39;s dish to see if their&#39;s was as great as mine. They all were... from the Lasagna Classico, to the Meatball Salad, then on to the Cavolifiore. I could keep going, but I&#39;ll leave a little for you to discover!

Tucked away on Ashland away from the grind of other high end establishments in the gold coast, river north and west loop is this gem of a place.  

From the moment I walked in I was impressed.  The dark decor, the wood, the lighting was all amazing.  I was meeting a friend there and neither of us knew how...romantic it was going to be.  We both laughed it off and made it a point to say how we&#39;d be sure to bring our respective partners here, but in the future, the next time we want drinks we&#39;d better go somewhere else lest we appear to be carrying on an affair.  I digress.

We went on a Tuesday night and they had a bevy of drink specials.  The wine selection was pretty large and amazing.  The servers understood how to pair what wines with what foods.  

The food was awesome as well.  We did a bunch of appetizers and shared. We had the Ravioli Di Zucca, a butternut squash ravioli with a marscapone cream sauce topped with toasted hazelnuts, the  Spiedino D&#39;Carne, grilled beef tenderloin tips skewered with portobello mushrooms, roasted peppers, tomato, bleu cheese, and a barolo wine sauce, and the Bruschetta.  Each of those items were as amazing as they sound.  It&#39;s not the cheapest place but it won&#39;t break your bank either.

Things are tasty, but like my original post, lack an identity. It really messes with your ability to have a satisfying meal. The Urban Belly Ramen has a nice pork belly, but portions are small and lacking the variety of ingredients you find in most ramen bowls. The Phat Udon was tasty, but had three distinct portions - lemongrass chicken, pork belly, and a bulgogi-type meat; the three meats were so distinct in flavors that it was like eating three mini meals that didn&#39;t flow together. Also had the Phat Rice on a separate occasion and it has the exact same curry flavors as the lemongrass chicken of the Phat Udon. Now that I see they have the same name, that makes sense, but it was literally the same dish just on a bed of noodles instead of rice - it wasn&#39;t interesting to the palette. 

I wouldn&#39;t come back unless I had a desperate taste for Asian food (and I mean &#34;Asian&#34; food).  But then again, there&#39;s a lot of other Asian cuisine in the area to pick from."

I ordered the Phat noodles which are stir-fry udon noodles covered in lemongrass chicken, pork belly, and braised beef. The set up of the restaurant is very &#34;fast casual&#34;. You order at the counter and they bring it out to your table once it is ready. The service was totally fine and normal. The largest issue is that the texture on this was just wrong, the flavors were off. It was just... &#34;Meh, I&#39;ve experienced better&#34; in a nutshell. The second we lagged on a bite, the wait staff came by and tried to bus our table. This made sense, especially on opening day so it wasn&#39;t a huge deal. 
 
I made the mistake on my second trip of ordering the pork &amp; pineapple, which was wok fired rice with scrambled egg, pork belly, &amp; pineapple. The young lady behind the register actually came out to ask me about my meal and I told her, honestly, that it was not great. The flavors didn&#39;t work together and the texture wasn&#39;t great.

After looking through the photos, as well as looking on their website, I was excited to come and try the food. Unfortunately, fusion food tends to be a hit-or-miss, and this time it was a miss.

After walking into the restaurant, you go up to the counter to order. They will give you a number and you can seat yourself. They will bring the food out to you, and the food comes quite quickly.

We ordered the Phat Rice and the Urbanbelly Ramen, both which seemed the most popular. It was just okay. I feel like fusion foods have a hard time balancing authentic flavors with just enough fusion to make it different. In this case, I feel like the food fell a little too far on the fusion spectrum and just was okay. Also, both the ramen and the rice were spicy, and by the end of the meal, I couldn&#39;t taste anything other than that spicy kick. As someone who is not a fan of spicy foods, I just couldn&#39;t enjoy it. 

We also ordered a Passionfruit lemonade. i was super excited about this, but it was just okay. It tasted very strongly of passionfruit (syrup?), and not enough lemonade to it. It was also pretty pricey ($3) for not a lot. There was a lot of ice, and towards the end, it was just super watered down.

The restaurant itself is pretty cool and aesthetically pleasing. When you walk in from the main entrance, there is a wall with plants on your left. The decor is very industrial. The bad part is the lighting is pretty low throughout.

I probably wouldn&#39;t come back here. There are definitely better options to get this kind of food."

We stopped here because 1) I knew they had shrub cocktails 2) I love asian food. 

I was happy about the service, the shrub cocktail that was free refills (!), and how fast the food came out. The shrub was a coconut which is pretty inventive -- they also let you pair it with any liquor you want (gin, in my case). It feels like the quickness of Chipotle which is pretty nice. 

The food isn&#39;t bad. I ordered the wheat berry bowl. It just wasn&#39;t anything memorable. the flavors weren&#39;t super cohesive. 

If this place was not around other awesome options, I think it would be a better option. But, smack in the middle of Wicker Park -- probably not worth it unless you just wanted something really quick and easy."

We ordered SO much, because everything looked good and overall, this place has a lot of potential, but imo the food doesn&#39;t justify the prices.

Venue is fun and divey with communal tables. (Order first and then sit down)
Friend and I ordered the Sweet Potato dumplings, Ramen Jr, Asian Bolognese, and Phat Noodles (yes for just the two of us O.o)

Not a fan of the sweet potato dumplings which were unnecessarily oily.
Ramen Jr. was a nice sampling of their house ramen. Pork wasn&#39;t memorable, but the broth was fairly decent though my friend thought it was salty. 
Asian Bolognese... a disaster! I was expecting more of a Dan Dan noodle or a Zha Jiang Mian, but it came with an almost sour tomato sauce that did NOT work. I was sad that those beautiful udon noodles were covered in such a strange sauce and it was clear we both were not feeling this odd mix of flavors. The exciting concept failed in execution and leaves me wondering how Asian fusion could have bombed so badly.
Meanwhile, the Phat were our favorite! We happily chowed down on the stirfry udon noodles and enjoyed the hearty chunks of chicken, beef AND pork belly - wow, living up to its phat name. Only complaint is that it was ended up really oily halfway through the dish.

As I mentioned, the price tag on this meal was not worth the sup-bar dishes served at Urbanbelly. The food is in desperate need of some refinement and restraint in terms of oversalting and too much oil! With all the other options in Wicker Park who have it together, I won&#39;t be returning to Urbanbelly."

Yesterday was their &#39;Grand Opening&#39; though they&#39;ve been open for about a week or so. Upon walking in my friend and I were giving a little bag with some tea, coffee and coupons for Urbanbelly and Belly Shack. They had some sweet specials running yesterday, as well, which we took advantage of. I fell in love with Urbanbelly&#39;s signature ramen a couple months ago as it&#39;s strewn with slight spice, noodles, pork belly, mushrooms, an egg and pretty much everything nice. Typically it&#39;s a monstrous sized portion which takes me several meals to finish but yesterday they were serving up a Junior sized for just $5! My dreams had come true! I was able to indulge in this delicious ramen at a smaller portion that better suited me. Even in this junior kiddie size I&#39;m certain it will make 3 meals for me.

My friend ordered up the Phat Rice with has some egg in it, lemongrass chicken, a bit of pork belly, a bit of beef and just like the ramen - just a dash of spice. I absolutely loved this dish, as well!

Not often do you find a grand opening running as smooth as Urbanbelly&#39;s did yesterday, only a testament to Chef Bill Kim&#39;s well-oiled restaurant group machine in this city. Urbanbelly was packed to the brim but food was coming out smoothly &amp; quickly with friendly service. When I couldn&#39;t finish my ramen, they were quick to pack it up for me with a smile. I also saw them working away at cleaning up tables when someone left for the next group to sit down. And when we left - a friendly goodbye was bestowed upon us.

I was already a fan of Urbanbelly so knew what to expect going into this new location. However, with multiple locations, restaurants can sometimes fall off when it comes to the food or service. I&#39;m happy to say this spot lives up to it&#39;s older brother and am grateful to have an Urbanbelly in Wicker Park!"

The tables are mostly long tables that don&#39;t provide much privacy if you&#39;re only with one or two friends and the restaurant is busy. However, I really enjoyed the way the restaurant was designed as it was interesting. It was also clean, the food got out quickly, and the employees were nice. 

The reason why I didn&#39;t really enjoy the restaurant was solely because of the food. I got Phat Rice and Urbanbelly Ramen. Both seemed to mix different Asian tastes including Indian curry. I wasn&#39;t expecting that and while I enjoy all Asian foods including Indian curry, having it all mixed together wasn&#39;t enjoyable. I by no means hated the food, I just wouldn&#39;t go there on my own. However, if somebody I wanted to eat there really badly I would go along. 

In regards to the Ramen, there are definitely better places to get ramen. I do prefer more traditional ramen though, so do take that into consideration when deciding whether to go to Urbanbelly."

I&#39;ve gotten takeout from here once -- the dumplings are ok, a little pricey and nothing to write home about. The rice cake pad thai is not great. Points for creativity, I guess, but the portion size is ridiculously small for $13. There just wasn&#39;t enough rice cake for the amount of garlic/chive topping.

The second time I came here, it was only because they sent a $10 off coupon, so a friend and I dined on the nice little outside patio. I got the phat noodle, which was decent enough, as were the maple-glazed mini donuts. Definitely recommend those two items over the pad thai and dumplings.

Having not been to the West Loop location or its sister restaurant Belly Shack under the &#34;Western&#34; L, I had very little to expect other than I knew they had reasonably priced ramen, noodles, and rice dishes.

The Phat Rice and Pad Thai here are stellar. The Phat Rice included pork belly, lemongrass chicken, AND bibimbap beef. All great. The Pad Thai came with some rather non-traditional noodles and shrimp. I would certainly recommend both dishes.

Customer service was attentive and friendly, and the waiters were quick with the dishes and any requests we had.

A few days ago I checked out their &#34;Grand Opening&#34; on my way home from work. My friend and I heard about it online and decided to walk by. They had a bunch of specials on so it probably would&#39;ve been a great night to sample more of the menu. But we didin&#39;t.

Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I&#39;m sort of over all the ramen-esque shops that keep popping up around Wicker Park. So I didn&#39;t even look at the ramen options. But I did see dumplings so I ordered the beef and cheddar and the sweet potato ones for To-Go.

When I arrived home, I pounced. The sweet potato ones looked like little flying saucers and had so little filling. They weren&#39;t entirely flavorful. They also had spinach draped all over them. It was a weird presentation for take-out. The beef and cheddar ones are where it&#39;s at though. They looked like miniature pot pies and you could dip them in horseradish sauce (not too strong - just right). Those were good. I wish I could eat more of them right now.

My one issue is the pricing. Because I went during their &#34;Grand Opening&#34; (I heard it had been open for a least a week at that point), the dumplings were $5. Regular price is $6.95. You get 4 in an order. I&#39;m sorry, but $7 and some change for tax is just a little too much, especially for the tiny sweet potato ones. I probably won&#39;t come back.

The urbanbelly ramen was really good, and the broth had the perfect level of spicy to give it that extra kick. As for the pork belly, I wasn&#39;t the biggest fan just because of the amount of fat, but it was definitely flavorful.
The sweet potato &amp; maple dumplings were very sweet, but the faint hint of feta balanced it out perfectly. No complaints there!
As for the lemongrass chicken, the lemongrass flavor was very overpowering and was one of the only flavors in the dish.
Even though, I definitely can&#39;t wait to come back and try some of the other things on their menu."

I got the phat rice and she got the phat noodle.  The pork belly was really tasty and crispy and the chicken was delicious, although a little odd since it was sort of ground up?  The rice itself wasn&#39;t anything special and the beef was kind of eh.  The beef dumplings, however, were really good and had a very different flavor that I am used to.

For the price, everything could just be a little bit better.  For starters, it&#39;s super pricey for a counter service joint.  If I&#39;m spending $20+, it feels like I should get a little more ambiance than communal tables with uncomfortable stools.  And if the portions were huge, that would be one thing, but they really aren&#39;t.  In my group of three girls, 2/3 finished their whole portion, plus we shared 2 orders of dumplings.  I would venture to guess that a bigger guy would legitimately leave hungry.  As for the food, it was good but not amazing.

The ambience is pretty cool, with ordering at the front and long tables dispersed around the locale.  At the table, there are extra seasonings, bowls, and silverware.

Food-wise, we unfortunately disappointed!  Although their pork and cilantro dumplings were pretty good, the rest of our order (phat rice and phat noodles) left much to be expected.

The seasoning of both dishes were good, but the meat itself was either too fatty or too dry!  The noodles themselves were strongly curried and did not retain the original flavor of the dish well.  I think a vegetarian version of the dish could have held up pretty well... But alas

Glad we tried it out but...Will likely not return due to the disappointing dishes and rather elevated prices for what we got :/"

My boyfriend ordered the urban belly ramen. That was really tasteful. The broth had a kick of spicy which was great. The pork belly -personally- was good. Tasted like carnitas. My boyfriend wasn&#39;t a big fan of it because of the amount of fat it had. In it you&#39;re given about three big pieces of pork belly. 

Next the manger/owner (I&#39;m assuming) recommended is the Pad Thai. And Oh my god.! It was delicious. Would definitely come back for that dish alone. The mix of flavors were amazing! Shrimp, cucumber, peanuts, chive and more. Took a big bite of everything together and its like I needed a moments to analyze all the flavors. So good.

Well let me tell you, it is NOT noodles and dumplings like you are expecting. I ordered the pork &amp; cilantro dumplings to start. I love steamed dumplings but these were really watery and wet, and kept sliding around the plate every time I tried to cut them in half to dip into the soy balsamic sauce it came with. My next dish was the Phat-Noodle which I ordered per recommendation of the girl taking my order. This was an oily mess and the &#34;crispy&#34; pork belly was pretty much inedible and the braised beef was a little tougher than my liking for a noodle dish. Also, their prices are VERY high for the amount of food you are getting. 4 small dumplings for $7 and $13 for the Phat Noodle dish!

We started with the spiced edemame, and kimchi. We also had the feta and sweet potato dumplings which are really small, so order two orders for four adults. 
The kids all had breaded chicken and rice, the chicken was breaded and a bit hard, maybe would have been better in house

After trying this place out on Saturday evening it&#39;s safe to say WE WANT PENNY&#39;S BACK!

Overall the atmosphere was nice, there is a decent sized patio and a large indoor dining area. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the order/pay first and then take a number to your table format. It&#39;s hard to distinguish how large these portions are going to be and how much food you will need. It also didn&#39;t help that we kept feeling rushed by the cashier as he continuously asked if we knew what we wanted yet. The staff should have more patience considering they&#39;re new in the neighborhood.

We ended up ordering a side of the eggplant, the phat noodles and the lemongrass chicken. First off, if you don&#39;t like scallions you should make sure to address this beforehand because every dish arrived covered in them and it is not included in the description. The portion sizes were smaller than anticipated - certainly not sharing size unless you&#39;re getting a couple. Eggplant was satisfactory, it was cut into small pieces swimming in this soy/vinegar sauce. The lemongrass chicken had good flavors and I didn&#39;t notice the chicken being too dry like many places. The phat noodles,however, was a salt mine! Holy sh*t, I had to chug at least 3 glasses of water to eat this dish. My tongue felt like it was dipped in the dead sea and left out in the Mojave desert to dry. I would not suggest getting this unless you have a high tolerance for salt.

Ultimately, it wasn&#39;t a great value for what you get but I would be willing to go back and try the dumplings. They looked pretty good at the table next to us."

- Great tasting food
- Fast service
- Super friendly staff

CONS
- Communal seating
- Small portions
- No fountain drinks

So we tried the new Urbanbelly on Damen before their open house. With as busy as it was, it makes me wonder what it&#39;ll be like after their open house. I ordered the Pad Thai, an iced coffee and the mini donuts. The Pad Thai had these round, flat noodles in them, which I thought were fine, but one of the servers said people either love them or hate them. REALLY enjoyed the mini donuts. All the food came out quickly. And everyone working there was very friendly, from the woman who took our order at the counter to the people who brought out the food and cleared the plates. 

The cons? I&#39;m NOT a fan of communal seating. I like having a private conversation when I dine out, which becomes impossible when you&#39;ve got someone you don&#39;t know sitting right next to you. And not having fountain drinks is just a pet peeve of mine. I was also surprised how small the portion of Pad Thai was. But to be honest, these things seem to be typical for Chicago - tight seating space, no fountain drinks and small portion sizes.

I&#39;d go again - the food was great - but next time, I&#39;ll get takeout."

I was living abroad for the last 8 months and was thrilled to see a new Urban Belly on Damen! I ordered my two favorite tonight for delivery and I have to say they were both really bad. Not at all like I remembered and so beneath what they were that i don&#39;t think I&#39;ll order again. The phat rice was greasy, the meat is no longer served on the bone, the meat chunks that were in the rice were really fatty. I don&#39;t know what was going on with the mango soup, but it was equally disappointing. The broth had hardly any flavor and there was only a tiny chunk of mango. As if all of that wasn&#39;t bad enough they didn&#39;t include the ginger candies in my delivery bag!

Mind, Raymond&#39;s Tacos (I don&#39;t know if it is alternatively known as Raymond&#39;s Hamburgers hence the Yelp name?) is by no means healthy--they saturate their taco tortillas with oil, making for no-nonsense, greasy grub that hits the spot.

Been coming here for years since some family used to live in this hood. The food is good, the service is nice and the prices are unbeatable. 

Two things in the menu for me: burritos de asada y tacos de asada with american cheese. And if yes that is unusual and not as authentic as many would argue, it works for me. Chopped up steak and onions on two tortillas with a slice of melted american cheese in between, topped with lettuce and tomato. Weird? yes. Good? you bet.

Service always nice and chill. So don&#39;t expect them to bend backwards to serve you. Last time I was there waiter actually sat at the table with us to take the order. I thought that was super cool."

I was here with a friend today and we both got some tacos and double cheeseburgers. The taco shells were a tad on the greasy side, but the char grilled steak was perfection! The cheeseburgers were excellent as well.

This place tends to be a little too small for comfort - there&#39;s a counter and four booths. We were lucky that we managed to get a booth just as a customer was about to leave.

Service was good given the crowd size and the number of employees working.

The one critique I have is regarding their beverage sizes - there seems to only be one size if you get the lemonade, fruit punch, or horchata, which seems to be somewhere between a small and a medium. You will get thirsty, so plan on ordering more beverages as your meal progresses.

If you&#39;re in the neighborhood, definitely check this place out - but plan on getting your food to go on the weekends.

EDIT 2/22: I stopped by here and it was a busy Friday night for them... I had to wait more than fifteen minutes for my order (there were several large orders including one guy who ordered 20 tacos for &#39;taco night&#39;); still, they were efficient and moved as quickly as they could.

Was there a hashhouse hidden along this gray/black stretch near the Cook County Courthouse? 
Perhaps a greasy spoon could give me something I didn&#39;t have to look at, but could easily swallow to stay fortified.
Maybe...just maybe, there was a friendly tacqueria that would welcome this Spanish-language-challenged stranger in his time of need.
OK, this may sound like a bit much but when you fall down the rabbithole and begin a day on jury duty with no lunch in hand and undetermined hours in court ahead, you want food fast and fulfilling.
After a fruitless walkdown down California, I head east on Cermak. Two guys walk out of Raymond&#39;s. It couldn&#39;t hurt for me to walk in.
Great call. As I enter, I can hear the sizzle of chicken and steak strips coming from the grill behind the counter along with the words &#34;Kobe Bryant.&#34; It is the only English I hear for a minute. Smiling guys at the counter are getting that delicious sounding meat put into taco as I wait to order. The TV is on ESPN Deportes, but sports is a universal language, right. I order. No problem, of course. Everybody&#39;s bilingual but us native born gringos. 
I don&#39;t know if this is Raymond behind the counter making my pollo and al pastor tacos, but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me. He knows his requlars, possibly family, and in a second my food is ready to go.
Nice. I rationed those tacos over two days just in case. Raymond&#39;s came through at a time of need. I&#39;ll definitely be back to try the burgers."

If you made a New Year&#39;s resolution to eat healthy, these tacos will leave that resolution unconscious in an alley with its pants around its ankles and bleeding from its ass...they may be the most unhealthy thing on the planet. But they are ridiculously good! Plus, they have the ability to reach back thru time and erase past hangovers. Getting the cheese is a must! Putting a slice of pasteurized, processed, American cheese-like product on tacos might seem like a sacrilege to some, but they are the key to making the whole concoction work! They put the slice between the tortillas. This acts as a binding agent and holds everything in place. The only thing is, they put onions in with the meat. If you don&#39;t like onion, make sure to let them know when you order."

The inside is pretty small but they are still able to accommodate for many hungry guests. Upon being seated, we were instantly given hot warm towels to wipe our hands, which is a very authentic Japanese thing to do before eating. We ordered the Takoyaki and Oyster Shooters to start, the Zuke Sake and Truffle Tuna bites, the Miso Salmon Roll and lastly the Seared Salmon and Albacore Roll. 

The Takoyaki came in a small bowl with 4 pieces. I have had my share of Takoyaki in the Chicago area and this one has the best tasting batter. The batter was flavorful in itself and did not need to rely on the sauces and octopus pieces in side for flavor. With that being said, the octopus pieces were smaller than all the other places we have tried, where we could have eaten the whole order and still not have come across a piece of octopus. Still a great appetizer to try and share with the table!

The Oyster Shooters we had here were the best so far! The Oyster itself was so juicy and the shooter had such a delicious combination of flavors between sweet and salty. 

The Tuna Truffle was incredibly buttery and the texture was amazing! The fish just melted in our mouths and we were in heaven until the last swallow. 

The Zuke Sake was a sharp and refreshing bite in comparison to the Tuna Truffle. The pickle garnish on top have a great slightly crunchy texture. It served as a great palate refresher. The salmon was so fresh and we were back in heaven with each chew. 

The Miso Salmon Roll had generous pieces of salmon topped on each piece, and there was crunchy asparagus in the roll itself to give a nice crisp texture. This roll was a roller coaster or texture which we loved. 

The Seared Salmon and Albacore Roll had a delicious smoky flavor thanks to the torching of the fish on top and a bit on the sides of the rice. A piece of like was garnished on top of each piece so the smoky flavor paired with the sour was fantastic!

We really loved the food and will be back to try all of the other menu items!"

However, now I am looking for a new place to enjoy sushi and to take important clients/guests to. The place has downgraded considerably in the last 6 months. For example, a &#34;tuna microgreens&#34; roll no longer has microgreens in it; they have been replaced by onions. With a hefty price tag of $14 for a roll that is 1/3 onions, you are better off ordering two tuna avocado rolls at your local neighborhood joint. I was also given sauces which previous waitstaff said I could not have because they contained gluten. Step up your game, Sushi Dokku!

The Japanese Old Fashioned made with Japanese whisky is a MUST TRY if you are an old fashioned addict like me. It&#39;s probably one of the best Old Fashioned I&#39;ve tried in town. The Japanese whisky carries a woody, smokey taste which gives the cocktail a very deep flavor. 

We order three rows. The best one was the Spicy Miso. Tuna with arugula brings a fresh mix of flavor I&#39;ve hadn&#39;t tried before. The other two rows were average. I&#39;d say the rows were a bit pricy ($15-$17) for its worth.

I had really high hopes for Sushi Dokku.  I read several reviews and looked over the menu before trying it out last night with 4 other friends. 

We had a 5:15pm reservation (Chicago Restaurant Week + Saturday night?..makes it hard to get a later reservation).  The hostess was friendly enough when she got off the phone and addressed us (I was worried about bad service after reading the reviews).  We were seated in the corner booth.  It was extremely cold the entire night.  I noticed that one by one all of my friends and I started putting our coats back on.  

LOCATION
It might get hard to find parking, but they do offer valet.  You can even download the valet app. &amp; have the driver bring your car through the app.  It&#39;s located by Little Goat and a whole bunch of other hot restaurants.  Inside, it seemed very dark and minimalistic/trendy.  It was hard to see what our food looked like without taking a flash photo of it.  As I reached over and took a picture of all of my friends&#39; food, one of them jokingly thanked me for helping her see what she was eating.  

FOOD
I was really excited to try Sushi Dokky for 2 reasons: it is Chicago Restaurant Week and I really wanted to try their Tuna Truffle (I mean, seriously? I love raw fish and truffle, but the two together? I couldn&#39;t wait!).  Overall, they have fresh, beautifully presented dishes.  Some were better than others.
-Momotaro: Nigori Sake, Peach Nectar $11. This was really good. Light, refreshing, not too sweet. I refrained fro ordering another drink because nobody else ordered one.
-Gyu-negima: $11 Strip Steak, Green Onion, Garlic Soy Sauce. Very very salty! 
-Ramen: $15 Shoyu Miso Braised Pork Shoulder Broth, Star Anise, Spinach, Green Onion. Two of my friends split this and they both said it was very salty.
-Dragon: $15 Tempura Shrimp, Unagi, Avocado, Masago. Not bad. Not amazing. Just average.
-Fire: $17 Tempura Salmon, Avocado, Cucumber, Tobiko, Kaiware, Chili Mayo, Green Onion. This was my 2nd favorite roll.  I liked the sauce that it came with.
-Crispy Maguro: $13 Tuna, Red Onion, Fried Shallots, Maguro Flakes, Avocado, Togarashi Mayo. My favorite roll. I don&#39;t understand why it had to come out with a separate soy sauce dish...maybe to fill in some empty space?
-Tuna truffle: $11 Seared Big Eye Tuna,Truffle Sauce, Avocado. I was slightly disappointed with this one. It lacked flavor. They give you two generous portions of tuna with some truffle oil, but it wasn&#39;t very unique.  (Try the Tuna Truffle at Starfish Sushi in Lincolnshire instead!)

SERVICE
Our waitress, Aracely, was nice enough.  However, while talking to us, she leaned over and placed her hand on top of our water bottle. We were all slightly grossed out and taken aback, but nobody had the courage to ask for a new bottle in fear we might get our food spit on. My friends and I were talking the entire time, but I don&#39;t recall Aracely ever coming to ask if the food was ok. 

NOTES: 
-If you plan on coming during Chicago Restaurant Week, you might have to ask the waitress for the Chicago Restaurant Week menu.  We weren&#39;t given this menu until we asked.  Also, if someone orders from this menu, everyone else must order from it.  It&#39;s an &#34;All or None&#34; type of deal.  I must&#39;ve made a face when Aracely mentioned this because she stated, &#34;I don&#39;t make the rules.&#34;  
-If you bring a cake (we were celebrating 2 belated birthdays in our group), you will be charged $1.50 per person. Imagine coming with a large group.  I don&#39;t recall being forwarded about this charge.  

OVERALL
The food was pretty good overall.  The service was OK. I think you&#39;re really just paying for the location and vibe (which I can do without)."

Décor: Outside it looks like a regular place, but as soon as you reach for the big wooden door you are immediately sucked into a sushi restaurant vibe. This place isn&#39;t massive but it has a decent number of tables and some seats along the bar as well. Since it&#39;s a corner lot it gets plenty of natural light from the windows along the wall and everything is nicely taken care of and clean (including the super heavy chairs!). I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d recommend this place for a huge group; they could make it happen with enough notice but try to roll in no more than four deep if you don&#39;t have a reservation (they do take reservations, just NOT OpenTable).
Bathroom: unknown

Staff: The hostess was friendly and was very nice to squeeze us into a table for an hour and a half time slot (more than enough time for us). Our waitress was also very friendly and just the perfect amount of punctual. Also, our sushi came out relatively quickly (no huge wait).

Food: We kicked things off with a glass of champagne and then moved on to our standard starters: Edamame, Miso Soup, and Chicken Gyoza (all were good, but needed to be hotter temperature-wise - personal preference of course). We then moved onto the sushi: Dragon Roll (delicious!), Spicy Tuna (so tasty and SO FRESH!), Godzilla (yum, outstanding! our favorite roll of the meal), Ecuador (good, but the cilantro muted the taste of the other ingredients), Unagi nigiri (my favorite, so good), and Hamachi nigiri (good, but sliced a bit thin...).

Value: It&#39;s sushi, in the West Loop, so it&#39;s a bit pricey. However, nothing on the menu stands out as being &#34;over&#34; priced.

We had a great meal and already cannot wait to come back. This is our new favorite sushi place in West Loop and the city as a whole!"

We entered on a jam packed weekend night.  Waited, sat at the bar.  It was thoroughly entertaining watching these guys slice fish, sushi like ninjas.  Further, reach into a bubbling vat of grease to pull out whatever tempura was going- crazy men.

The food, the sushi itself was quite good.  The flavors were nice, but nothing blew my mind for the prices.  I will go back time and time again."

They allowed us to order off the menu, make up our own rolls! We love exploring the unknown so the flexibility is much appreciated!

Must get: truffle tuna nigiri! To die for good!

We made up our own roll of spicy salmon with avocado. They added sesame seeds to crust the rice. Such a great idea!

We also made up a second roll. Crab, spicy tuna, and eel. They made the most delicious roll ever! Crab meat wrapped on the inside with alternation spicy tuna chicks and grilled eel on top. 

Loved the experience!"

I showed up at 5:30 on a Thurs afternoon and it wasn&#39;t too packed. I got a seat at the bar and ordered a glass of rose&#39; which was really good. My girl showed up and met me at the bar so it was time for shit to get real in reference to ordering some goodies. There was a couple of regulars sitting on the other side of me letting me know what was good and what wasn&#39;t so that was helpful.

We got 8 oysters (4 each and what was on the happy hour menu) and the caviar which was very delicious. The Hot Daisy Roll (Albacore, spicy mayo, massage, cucumber, soy paper and lime) came highly recommended. Its reputation is well deserved as it was definitely the best roll we had. We also got the Dragon and the Tuna Microgreens rolls...very good as well. They have good sushi here...no doubt! The guy behind the bar, Kyle made us a special roll that was pretty good as well. The Chamomile Whiskey Sour drink was out of this world good...so good that we had 3 of them. 

I definitely recommend coming here for happy hour or dinner as its really a nice place with good food and good service!"

The basement was open which was pretty swanky. They had some cool decorations and nice bottles of japanese whiskey. My friend is vegetarian so a few limited options.  Here&#39;s what we order: 

// Snack Mix - $2 - This snack mix goes amazing with a beer or whiskey. It&#39;s a little bowl of assortment japanese snacks are yum yum all around. try each one and figure out which one you like the most! 

// Jagaimo - $4- This is a mashed potato mix, it has some good flavor but wouldn&#39;t order it again. They brought us out an extra one on purpose sooo Yay!

// Cucumber Sunomono - $6 - This cucumber sushi this is amazing. Definitely worth trying, its just cucumber cut up all special but the sauce on there is bomb. I would order this again, its refreshing and delicious.  

// Spicy Tuna - $10 - I ordered this and it was reallllyyyyy good. Makes me really want to come back and do a full on sushi meal. The spicy tuna was plentiful and spicy-iful! The rice was well prepared and had a good ratio of fish to rice. 

// Hakushu Whiskey - $25 - This whiskey is amazing but I dont think its worth 25$. I am pretty sure the entire bottle cost like 70$. oh well, didn&#39;t realize it was so expensive till after I ordered it 

The basement is a cool late night spot to eat and It is somewhat secluded. I would come back and I most likely will."

When I got there no one was standing outside in the alley so I just randomly found a door and went in. Thankfully it took me downstairs to Booze Box. The music was on point and the drinks were good. I would recommend the Momotaro. Very refreshing and not too sweet. My other friend raved about the Kurimi. There cocktails were all delicious! Loved the atmosphere.

For dinner appetizers, we started off with the usual: Edamame and Miso Soup, which uses White Miso, Tofu, Green Onion and Wakame

I know it&#39;s a little strange that we ordered mashed potatoes at a Japanese restaurant, but this is probably one of the best mashed potatoes I&#39;ve had: Jagaimo, which is Whipped Potatoes with Cucumber, Carrot, Egg &amp; Japanese Mayo. Pretty sure that Japanese mayo might have crack in it.

$1 oyster happy hour from 5-7pm: They have East and West Coast oysters. For me...it&#39;s West Coast all the way! They were these tiny little sweet morsels of delectable ocean-y goodness. Not too brine-y.

Oh, try the fried oysters too. It&#39;s deep fried in a light batter and some other good stuff. Just try it!

For those of you who know me, you know that I LOVE UNI!~ So, of course, I tried the Uni nigiri, which was phenomenal. I&#39;ve missed uni so much...

Here are the rolls in order of favs:

Hot Daisy Roll: Albacore · Masago · Spicy Mayo · Cucumber · Soy Paper · Lime
Ecaudor Roll: Maguro · Hamachi · Flying Fish Roe · Cilantro · Wasabi Mayo · Jalapeño
Northern California Roll: Fresh and Soft Shell Crab · Onion · Masago · Avocado
Now, for the fun! The bar downstairs is super duper dark, and exactly what you would want in a speak-easy. There are no signs about any sort of bar downstairs, so you really have to know about it. They offer some GREAT snacks that go with your drinks, and the service is awesome. The manager, Linda, really wants to ensure that everyone has a great experience...thanks for taking care of us so well, Linda!

We got a few of the specials -- Shot and Beer: Evan Williams whiskey and your choice of beer. We chose Kirin Lite to chase our whiskey. That always equals fun times!
I also tried their whiskey sour, which was nice and sour. I love sour!

Here are the bites in order of favs:

Pork belly -- this comes with a poached egg on top, so when you break that yolk. OMG food egg porn!!~ This dish is rather savory, so make sure you maybe order something pickled on the side.
Drowning Tako -- Octopus, vinegar, olive oil, lime, garlic, pickles. This dish comes out with each portion separately, so it&#39;s actually a perfect dish to enjoy with your drink.
Chicken Karaage: Japanese fried chicken, rosemary &amp; sage. This was very crispy but juicy on the inside. I think it might have had a little too much ginger for my taste. But for those of you who love ginger, go for it!
Okonomiyaki: Japanese pancake with cabbage, green onion, katsu sauce, and wasabi mayo. I like my pancakes pretty thin and crispy, and since this one wasn&#39;t as crispy as I would like, I would have to put this at the bottom of my list of favs. Altho the flavors were definitely there!"

The east coast oysters are larger and $1 each naked. Any additional dressing or having the oysters fried is $1 more per oyster. Our waitress was very knowledgable about the oysters and when she didn&#39;t know, she went to find out for us. Good experience, very relaxed, and not too crowded."

Prices are high, but it&#39;s located in restaurant row, so that&#39;s not shocking, Plus, the food has always been at least 4 star worthy. During my last visit, however, the service was disappointing enough that I may not return. I&#39;m not normally one to knock a restaurant down stars because of service, but the waitress was really rude! 

A group of four of us came in at 7:30pm for a reservation for my friend&#39;s birthday. They seated us right away, took our drink order...and then 20+ minutes passed. No drinks, nothing. Finally, we asked to order food and the waitress acted like we had asked her to strip down naked and dance for us. We all separately thought it was one of the more awkward moments we&#39;ve had with a waiter/waitress. Not to mention the fact that she acted shocked and appalled by a few of our orders (we ordered four maki rolls, a few appetizers, a fish entree, and a small soup...besides sharing the soup between the four of us, it wasn&#39;t that crazy of an order). The night continued, our food came, we ate, they took away our dishes, etc. By the end of the meal, we had all decided that service was a two at best. And then to top it all off, they charged us for my friend&#39;s birthday dessert!! Sure, her boyfriend had asked for something to be sent out for her birthday, but that&#39;s normal! If they don&#39;t allow complementary desserts for birthdays, they should have said something! To charge us for a birthday dessert, which we did not choose (and was honestly pretty mediocre), was absolutely unprofessional! 

I am typically very forgiving of bad service, but the audacity of the waitress to make us feel awkward and then to CHARGE US FOR THE BIRTHDAY DESSERT was pretty unforgiving. I&#39;m getting angry just thinking about it."

I have to say, the atmosphere is sexy, its dark, dim lit, has that intimate trendy feel to it so I definitely think it&#39;s great for a date night, however we sat by the windows where their long wooden booth is and I have to say that I felt like I was right on top of my neighbors which kinda isn&#39;t ideal in my opinion. I don&#39;t like to hear other people&#39;s convos since I&#39;m a little ADD so  it&#39;s hard for me to focus, especially when different kinds of sushi is being served.

We didn&#39;t have reservations on a Saturday night so I definitely recommend you make them, but you can always grab some sake at their cute bar. The service was good as the hostess was able to sit us by a window which I asked for and our server was pleasant throughout our meal. They do have happy hour oysters every day for like $1 and they were delicious and $2 with the fixings so that&#39;s as cheap as it gets and I definitely had some east and west coast ones. Now onto the sushi, the rolls in my opinion are very few and a little too much for me with their over the top ingredients. You can&#39;t go wrong with some spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls and I absolutely loved their dragon roll but for $16 it isn&#39;t cheap but definitely delicious. My hubby got some tuna roll that was also on the pricey side and it didn&#39;t have rice in it which I wish it said that since it left him hungry for a lot more. 

So overall, Sushi Dokku is eh, I can&#39;t see how it can compare to it&#39;s neighbors like Girl and the Goat and Au Cheval but I guess if you want a sexy night out with your girlfriend and you want some basic sushi in a trendy environment then you can check it out. But I wouldn&#39;t come here if I was so hungry, because you will end up spending a pretty penny and may leave a little hungry, or at least we did. Get the drinks though!"

Unagi nigiri - really really fresh unagi - prob our fave dish of this lunch.

Spicy tuna - a close second. We really liked the big cuts of tuna in this.

Dragon - really good pieces of shrimp. I always Order the dragon rolls.  Liked it but it was overshadowed by the other two rolls.

I got there early and sat at the bar. What I liked about this place from the moment I walked in was how intimate and tiny the space was. I spoke to a very friendly and helpful bartender, and she suggested the perfect cocktail based on my preference. 

Even with reservations we had to wait a bit for a table, which was fine because of how small the place is. The drinks and food didn&#39;t disappoint, and neither did the service. We started the meal with Udon, Vegetable Tempura, and Pork Gyoza. The Udon had the most delicate and delicious broth ever and I could eat bowls and bowls of it! The tempura and gyoza were good as well.

We ordered a variety of rolls and they even made specially vegetarian rolls for one of my friends. They came with special sauces as well, including a truffle sauce. We also ordered raw and fried oysters ($1 each!) and they were delicious. The fried oysters were overpowered by the presence of too much wasabi, but good nonetheless.  We ended the meal with fried green tea ice cream and an apple cake of some sort. I loved the ice cream -- it was not too sweet and a perfect way to end the meal.

I would recommend Sushi Dokku for a fantastic sushi/udon/oyster experience. I will definitely be back for more Udon!"

We called only like a week ahead of time!

The service here is super friendly. I love sitting at the sushi bar and chatting with the chefs. The rolls are great -- they&#39;ll even be happy to make you something by request that&#39;s not on the menu!

For those non-sushi lovers, there&#39;s also some other Japanese selections on the menu as well. 

Another highlight- this is one of the few Asian places I&#39;ve been to in the city that has made decent cocktails!"

Ever since then I wanted to go here. The first time I went here, there was a wait for two hours...so we ended up going to some other place. This time I made sure I reserve a table beforehand. 
Now the food- being a vegetarian, it&#39;s difficult to really enjoy a sushi place but sushi dokku lived up to my expectations. They had only four vegetarian sushi (don&#39;t remember the names)and I ordered all four of them. They were simply awesome. Omg, I really have no words to describe how good they were. It&#39;s definitely a plc to try :)
I&#39;m giving four stars n not five as the appetizers disappointed me...fewer vegetarian options n not worth ordering at all :/"

We received our food fairly quick, which is kind of worrisome at a sushi joint, however, it was very fresh and tasty. The presentation was phenomenal I must say! They even had a kids menu which is always a plus. The Miso Soup was the best I&#39;ve tasted in Chicago, by far, and it was the biggest bowl ever. I had the Fire role with fresh Salmon instead of Tempura Salmon and it was fantastic. My only complaint was our roles were extremely spicy and we ran out of water early on, having to go most of the dinner without water. But as I said, overall it was a happy experience!"

I stumbled across this place right when it opened at 5pm and sat down at the sushi bar. Wildly over priced nigiri and PRE CUT...... I watched the sushi &#34;chef&#34; pull the fish out of a container and stick it on my disgusting, hard, unflavorful sushi rice. All wrong. I feel like I was robbed, esp for the price I paid.

What made my experience worse was the chefs just standing there not doing anything. They just took their time, drinking whatever they were drinking and shooting the shit while I was sitting there starving.

I watched the guy make my micro greens sushi roll, set it down behind him...and there it sat...for 5 minutes. Finally the other chef cut it and served it to me. By that point I was fuming and the roll itself didn&#39;t even taste fresh at all. 

Do yourself a favor and avoid Sushi Dokku at all costs."

You come here for the Happy Hour!  M-F from 5pm till 7pm.

Oysters -- $1 with 4 kinds.  3 ways to enjoy them: 
(1) undressed with lemon only for the adventurous;
(2) dressed with soy, wasabi etc for the semi-adventurous; and
(3) dressed that is fried with scallions for the less adventurous.

Drinks/Cocktail -- well balanced with standard pricing of $12-13.

Venue -- clean, just right table spacing.  The best seat is the sushi bar (without the sushi fish staring at you).  A great view to inspire making sushi at home.

Service -- great and informative.  Quick clean ups.

1-star less because of a seemingly standardized menu.  Nothing stands out to me."

So sad when that closed down, but a few years later.....the same people behind Wabi opened up this amazing place. Had a phenomenal dinner here last night with our group of 6. Had a 7:30 reservation not in the actual restaurant, but in the speakeasy bar located downstairs (to enter you have to find the door hidden in the alley). The bar has about 8 tables for diners, &amp; we were seated right away in the big one in the back.
Sushi Dokku brought over some of our favorite rolls from Wabi&#39;s menu. These were (and also our favorites are) the hot daisy roll and the equador roll. We had tons of apps, favorites were the tuna tataki and hamachi. Besides those two rolls we had a couple more, some nigiri, and steak. Couldn&#39;t pass up on the sake, had a couple bottles- one is my absolute favorite sake called Red Snapper by Narutotai. Yes it&#39;s almost $100 but it&#39;s THE BEST! Finished the meal with vanilla, green tea &amp; passion fruit mochi. Gotta get the passion fruit- amazing. 
Overall, amazing sushi that you will pay a lot of $$$ on, but worth it."

My gf and I split everything: the hot sake carafe(s), edamame, hamachi cold starter, sea bass bites, fire roll and the hot daisy. The service was nice and not overwhelming. Food comes out pretty fast. Space is pretty dark and finely light.

I called because for some reason open table showed them completely booked but they put me down for a reservation easily same day, and when I showed up they sat me at a nice, large booth.

FYI, they have oysters happy hour 5-7PM, $1-2. I was too late but maybe you can check it out!

Strategically placed next to a primary pig joint it would have to be a standout. No fake crab here. The prices reflect quality ingredients and preparation.

Drinks
Whiskey and cider; great fall drinks, sweet &amp; tart
Bourbon Bomb; lemongrass syrup and basil
Wish I would have went with a sake concoction in hind sight

Apps
Mini filet; wasabi butter, whipped potatoes, mushrooms
This is a great warm up to prepare for fresh fish -- don&#39;t miss it

Rolls
Northern California; fresh crab really makes a difference
Fire Roll; nice and spicy with great sauce to boot

I would suggest getting a seat at the bar. Bench seating for two is a cool twist. Sit back and watch the chefs go to work and sip a drink. It&#39;s definitely entertaining to watch the detailed knife work. 

We waited about 30 mins on a Saturday night which isn&#39;t bad without a reservation. Friendly and attentive service. The small plates are worth the trip. They offer up unique dishes and nigiri bites that cannot be rivaled in the area."

It&#39;s like a blend of the very best best tuna nigiri and fanciest French fry you&#39;ll ever eat. I could have eaten 1,000 of &#39;em... if they weren&#39;t $9.50 for two. But it&#39;s absolutely a work of art and totally worth it. Basically my dream food. 

Get that. Get that and don&#39;t share it and savor every freaking moment of it. 

Also, they have a weekday happy hour that runs 5-7 with $1 oysters ($2 if you get them with the dressings). We went with a mixture of a dozen oysters, 4 different types of oysters, and then of those 4 we got 3 different types dressed and one plain. They weren&#39;t on par with GT Fish &amp; Oyster, but that&#39;s a tough measure. These were still damn good and much friendlier on the wallet. 

We came here on whim, without a reservation and were sat after a small limbo period where they told us we needed to be out before 8pm, which was 100% fine. The front podium staff wasn&#39;t the friendliest and when thanked they just went with the too cool method of ignoring me completely, but that&#39;s okay, I&#39;m used to it. Something about me just turns people stone cold. 

Inside was pretty swanky, ultra modern, and I was definitely expecting to see some $20+ rolls on the menu, but that wasn&#39;t the case. I think the priciest roll was $15 and very generously portioned. I was especially impressed with their spice levels - right on point for me. 

Their miso was meh. Not a ton of flavor but it was still only $3 and again, generously portioned. 

Event their drinks were mighty impressive, though my bourbon basil was by far the least favorite of the three we ordered. A tad too tart, sweet, sour... just too much at once. The Sakerita was light and airy and perhaps the least sweet margarita-type drink I&#39;ve ever had -- so good! The pineapple drink looked like pure puree, but had just a tinge of a booze in the taste and couldn&#39;t have been more perfect. Def a dangerous drink duo. 

Our server was fine. Not overly friendly, no smiles, but efficient and still worlds more welcoming than the front stand staff. 

I&#39;ll absolutely be back. Introducing everyone I know (who&#39;s worthy) to that Tuna Truffle."

Any restaurant with the name Sushi in their name is an instant turn off. The first thing that word brings to the mind is all the generic basic sushi places you see in the suburbs. One&#39;s that make the most basics of sushi with absolutely very little to absolutely no creativity and heart. I am happy to confirm Sushi Dokku is not one of those places. It is a good example of what great sushi can be. 

On my quest to find the best ramen in Chicago, my next stop was high-five sushi. Inside high-five looking downstairs were many people sitting on the steps with drink in hand looking like they were waiting to use the restroom at a crowded bar/club or a concert like venue. As I jumped and hopped across these lovely looking people I discovered a extremely cozy bar that serves ramen that seats a capacity of at most 15 to 20 people and was told by a lady the wait was an hour. Being as hungry as I was, even my most favorite food in the world was not worth a minute wait so I left and walked around the corner and looked up, there was Sushi Dokku in front of my eyes. I asked if they had ramen and they said YES! 

seared salmon roll = awesome. The layer of rice was perfectly thin and the masago was perfectly small, fresh and flavorful. the combination of all he ingredients was absolutely perfect.

ramen = awesome. Broth was perfectly flavored with a hint of sweetness. The pork shoulder was tender and carries a nice meaty flavor. This could have been the perfect ramen. The only things missing was maybe some bamboo shoots and a nice soft boild egg and a few slices of Berkshire Pork Belly.... droolz.

They have kizami which is excellent for nigiris and sashimi. Basic sushi places wouldn&#39;t have."

This was our 3rd visit to Sushi Dokku and everytime we have tried different cocktails, maki rolls, and desserts.

This visit we had the calamari appetizer and edemame. Calamari was cooked the perfection and virtually no excess oil on them, they also came with a delicious dipped sauce.

We split 4 rolls: Dragon, Northern California, Fire, and Smoked Salmon. They were all wonderful! My only issue with the rolls was that although the fire roll was said to be spicy I did not think it was at all.

I tried their seasonal Chili Mojito which had a chili infused gin, mint, and homemade sour. I highly recommend it if you are one who enjoys a nice bite with their meal.

For dessert we had the green tea cheesecake with brownie crust, espresso mochi, tirimasu mochi, lychee sorbet, and some sort of apple cake with a homemade caramel sauce and ginger ice cream. Their lychee sorbet was spot on. It was sweet and refreshing after such a saucy and delicious meal. The other desserts were almost just as delicious but my heart goes out to the lychee sorbet!

Wonderful experience and will be returning on our next trip to the big city!"

The Ecuador roll is incredible! Don&#39;t be intimidated by the jalapeño you can&#39;t feel it at all. Soooo gooood

The scallops and tofu are also delicious.

Never got to try the food because the customer service was pretty terrible. The place was crowded with about a projected 25 to 30 min wait. When the hostess took our name she suggested we go downstairs to their new bar area to wait. We said great we&#39;ll get drinks while we wait. Downstairs was darker and moody, with a DJ and people sitting at the bar, booths and standing along the walls. We stood at the bar for 25 mins waiting for the bar tender to acknowledge us, only for her to say &#34;one moment&#34; then serve more than one patron who clearly just walked up after we had been waiting.

When we finally got a drink - they didn&#39;t have my choice of liquor - the drink was weak and simply nasty. We went back upstairs to wait, only to see a new crop of people waiting and being sat at tables ahead of us. When we asked about our seating we were told we were next, but a different couple was sat instead of us. The hostess gave us an &#34;oh shit&#34; look then whispered to the other hostess. Needless to say after a total of 50 mins waiting, plus being overlooked at the bar and for seating, we left and went elsewhere. We won&#39;t be back...too many choices to put up with bad customer service."

Let&#39;s acknowledge that West Loop has an amazing roster of restaurants that offer unique and great dining experiences. Getting that out of the way - Sushi Dokku is a star player on said roster. 

Hidden off the menu (or at least I couldn&#39;t find it) the spicy tuna and spicy shrimp rolls are fantastic. Major thanks to the other useful reviews that referenced to it. They were so good that a friend who tagged along on the visit ordered a spicy tuna for himself after trying mine. The drink menu is pretty interesting and I went with the bourbon basil which had a nice twist thanks to the fresh basil leaf. Granted I only had one drink, I&#39;d like to say the drinks are made on point and are very strong 

The service here is a great but note that like every restaurant on the Randolph strip the seating availability fills up quick so plan accordingly. The real gem to this spot is the basement which is hidden off to the right when you walk in. The more relaxed atmosphere and groovy tunes make the dining experience all the more better. I highly recommend trying to get a seat down there if at all possible.

Sushi was delicious and drinks were cool, the menu (while on the smaller side) could certainly be grouped with places like Momotaro in the sense that you find unusual items.

Finally made it to the restaurant last weekend and the place was really full. Only had to wait about 30minutes to get a table and was excited to try it out. 

After getting sat we were greeted by our server who said she would be right back with waters. After she returned at least 5 minutes later we ordered two drinks. Those drinks which were actually pretty good took over 10 minutes to be delivered to us. This was repeated when we ordered a second round of drinks with our rolls. 

Not sure why the service from the bar was so slow but it definitely took away from the experience. The sushi was a little above average but nothing special. 

Overall, I would say this is a little above average sushi spot that has some service issues. The staff was at least apologetic to the slow service but that is definitely something to consider when choosing this restaurant."

Dressed oysters ($2) are much tastier.
Choice of rolls seemed pretty basic, but very fresh. Seared salmon roll was good, with a bit too much citrus.
Good takoyaki appetizer.

She was very accommodating, and we ended up getting a table about 10 minutes later.  

The menu is stuffed with delicious sounding hot and cold small plates, rolls, chefs choice nigiri, and standard sashimi/nigiri choices.  

In the end we chose the tuna poke special, a salmon collar (amazing), and two rolls.  

The fish was delicious and fresh in each dish, which is arguably most important, but the other components of each dish didn&#39;t add much--maybe even detracted from the full flavor experience.  
The avocado that came with the poke was cut about a day too soon and the sauces on the rolls overpowered the veggies and seafood inside.  

Nothing bad, just not as awesome as I was imagining while reading the menu."

Sat downstairs in what they call the &#39;booze box.&#39; There&#39;s a live DJ at 9:30 and I can see it getting more cozy and swanky as the night progresses, but for a 8pm dinner it was a little off so would suggest sitting upstairs if all you want is dinner and drinks.

Had the Tako Yaki (octopus dumplings) to start, which were delicious and then two rolls - the crunchy maguro and the Ecuador. The Ecuador was worth every penny- stuffed full with freshness.

Which is at least once a week. 

Up to a point, sushi is sushi is sushi. The fish is wonderfully fresh, and that&#39;s great, or it&#39;s not, and you never go back. Rolls can be nice, I suppose, but I tend to favor sashimi, nigiri, and other more flavorful (and less cream-cheese infested) options. Which, truth be told, are more or less the same across any good sushi restaurant.

All this to say-- not so with Sushi Dokku. Every single bite was an adventure of awesomeness. Among many, many other items, the one that sticks out is the yellowtail belly with jalapeno? Yes please. Check this place out."

It was absolutely mind blowing how delicious and creative the sushi rolls were.  

After a long day , I wanted to get sushi and a drink.  After seeing many positive Yelp reviews for Sushi Dokku I thought, &#34;why not, let&#39;s give it a whirl.&#34;  On the outside, it is an unassuming place on a busy and bustling street.  The inside is an intimate candlelight atmosphere.  

I started with a sake-tini cocktail which was the Japanese cousin of a dirty martini.  It was delicious and the ginger-stuffed olive was a lovely finishing touch.  

Onto the serious stuff! For appetizers we got the tempura and the agadashi tofu.  All of which were delicious and I found myself being &#34;that person&#34; and eating every last crumb.  For dinner, my husband and I shared a variety of rolls:  Ecuador, Northern California, Fire, and the seared salmon.  Needless to say we were hungry. 

Everything exceeded expectations.  From the quality of food, portion, to even the platter they were presented on, everything was delightful.  The Ecuador was by far the favorite and I don&#39;t plan on sharing it next time.  

If you&#39;re around, swing on in.  It won&#39;t disappoint.  I cannot wait to go back and I also plan on going for a happy hour too!"

In actuality none of us were stumbling, Candice was practically running, Ericka hobbling on her one workable foot and I&#39;d like to think I was walking a normal human being type of way. We came upon Sushi Dokku which is right next door to Girl &amp; A Goat. If I ever have to choose between sushi and anything else, I&#39;m going to pick raw fish. And in we went!

We were dressed in varying fashions and honestly I felt under dressed for such a classy establishment. It was kind of funny walking in because we got the hostess treatment you would expect when walking into a classy place. Indifferent, acted like we were wasting their time by inquiring about the wait/availability, and when we left they didn&#39;t acknowledge our departure. Even when super friendly Candice said bye, we got a zippo in return. I scolded Candice for being too friendly but it just can&#39;t be helped with that one! :P

I have to say that our waitress was super nice and sweet which was a nice change from the hostesses. They had some amazing oyster special that my buddies really enjoyed. Prices are a bit higher than other sushi joints but it&#39;s a bit more fancy and things are done a bit better here, thus justifying the prices.

The cocktails at Sushi Dokku were friggin amazing. Sake cocktails to be precise! After practicing the name like three times, I said the name of the one I got &#39;Sakerita&#39; wrong to the waitress. I brought shame on my entire family. I tried a couple of the other cocktails which were also very good but hands down liked mine the best. I really don&#39;t think you can go wrong with any of their sake offerings though. Sushi Dokku has some nice tables but you can also just chill out at the bar and grab some of these fabulous cocktails sans fishies.

Sushi Dokku doesn&#39;t play around with their spice. Spice is my kryptonite and I crumble under it&#39;s powers. I keep trying to order &amp; eat it more and more hoping I&#39;ll build up an immunity but let&#39;s look at this realistically, Superman never built up an immunity. It got him every time. In a hope to over come the green glow, I ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll which aside from the fresh fish has chili sauce, masago &amp; mayo. My mouth was on FIRE! What I did get of the flavors was delicious though, excellent spicy tuna roll and nothing knocked against the spot for their spice level. Just know when you get any of their spicy rolls here, they mean spicy! 

Best thing of the night - the Tuna Truffle. You read that right. Tuna. And truffle. Seared yellowfin tuna, truffle oil and avocado. And let it be known, it was some of the most beautiful knife work I&#39;ve ever seen on an avocado. Truly art on a plate and delicious in my belly. I&#39;ve never had anything quite like it and would go back to Sushi Dokku for these bites alone. There were 4 pieces. 3 of us. Who ate that last one?!"

Apps: Miso soup, seaweed salad, ginger salad, gomae and sashito peppers. All SO GOOD. The ginger dressing was delicious and the seaweed salad had a very interesting texture.

Sushi: Truffle tuna bite ---this BLEW everything out of the water. It is better than Union and Sunda&#39;s tuna truffle. So fresh and well balanced. 

Rolls: Godzilla, fire, hot daisy. Our favorite was the Hot Daisy and the Godzilla. The hot daisy is SERIOUSLY spicy. The fire is good, but we were taken aback that the salmon was cooked which was a bit disappointing.

So imagine my delight when some of the owners of the old Sushi Wabi and opened Sushi Dokku at the corner of Randolph and Green.

Located in what used to be an old &#34;greasy spoon&#34;, you will love the contemporary interior with the high ceiling, the large sushi bar, the small cocktail bar up front, and plenty of tables both inside and out.

I had made a reservation but somehow it had gotten misplaced.  But the hostess was great, saying that she would get us seated as soon as possible and she kept apologizing for the error.  Within 5 minutes of the time of our &#34;lost&#34; reservation, she came over and got us from the bar and had a perfect table for two located along the wall.

The menu is full of wonderful things- from raw oysters (we started with the west coast ones and they were terrific!) to miso soup and the expected edamame, plenty of rolls, nigiri and sashimi.  They also have a wide range of sakes and beers.

I asked if I could get some vegetables steamed and our server came back and said that they couldn&#39;t steam them but that they could boil some asparagus.  Works for me!

The veggies came up as the 2nd course and then the sushi followed.  The winner of the night was the &#34;Tuna Truffle&#34; which was two pieces of tuna over rice with avocado and truffle oil.  Yes it was $9.50 for two pieces but it was amazing!

They also were able to make us a plain tuna and avocado roll which wasn&#39;t on the menu but came perfectly made to the table.

I did think that the sashimi was a little skimpy.  They sell it in orders of 2 pieces each (about $8.00) but instead of the meaty &#34;chunks&#34; I expected, I got some thin slices.  Good tasting- but a bit on the light side.

If you drive- while there is a valet sign on Green Street- you will probably more readily find the valet on the Randolph side.  Valet will run you about $11.

All in all, this is now my favorite sushi place in the W. Loop."

Before they fixed the kinks with the fries (they cook them when you arrive now so they are not soggy), when they had another name (LEADBELLY), and when the owners were still taking care of customer service.

I like the burgers (Goodnight Irene, Black Betty, Old Time Religion are all some of our standbys). The fries are okay and I don&#39;t really care for the sugar cookie but it comes with the meal, so whatever, I&#39;ll eat it. 

What really has irked me in the last hand full of visits is the customer service. The kitchen seems to run smoothly but the front staff does not. 

I&#39;ve had rude individuals on the phone when I call. I&#39;ve had the store not even pick up the phone multiple times/days and had to have the Gladstone location call them to tell them to answer. 

I&#39;m an avid &#34;call ahead and fast pick-up&#34; kind of consumer. Therefore, there&#39;s expectations when I arrive that my food should be ready to go when specified. However, there have been times when the cook would just &#39;ding&#39; the bell for an order up and let my food and others just pile up while the usually understaffed (usually one girl) serves, manages register, manages phone, and expedites food. I blame the cook for not helping, I blame the server for not being more organized and attentive, and I blame the management for not properly staffing.

It&#39;s a decent burger, quite pricey, and the only thing there worth buying so I have to be in a lazy, non-grilling mood to go there.

Have tried shakes, nothing to write home about. Pricey, as well.

They do offer microbrew in bottled and tap format. However, with the way most bars have gone now, this isn&#39;t the only place you can find these beers/bottled sodas."
brgrbelly-chicago-3,Rob W.,Xk4CO2zXLjdr3l4y7eo9fg,"Oak Park, IL",1,1,0,141,151,4n0eq_96t8EnPoRTlDUEWA,4.0,2016-05-21,"Seems like everyone is trying to specialize in burgers nowadays. Cook a burger, add some cheese (usually) put it on a good quality bun, then figure out what kind of zany topping can be placed on it and determine something or someone you can remotely connect the topping with to name it. Rinse, lather, repeat.

BRGR Belly is one of those kind of places. The burger itself is good, but once it&#39;s consumed with everything that&#39;s piled on it, it&#39;s kind of hard to tell what one is eating. I had a &#34;Goodnight Irene&#34; which consisted of a &#34;crunchy&#34; crab cake atop the burger along with remoulade and pico de gallo. What that topping has in common with the Billboard top hit of 1952 (I believe?) I don&#39;t know. I do know that it came out rare and I had ordered it medium rare, but no big deal. Honestly if I was blindfolded, I&#39;m not sure I could have told anybody what I was eating. The fries were good and while I expected to detect a little more of a peppermint schnaaps taste to my spiked shake, it was still pretty good too. 

Service was prompt and with a great smile. Overall better than average, but given the growth of this food group subset, they&#39;re all becoming average as there aren&#39;t very many that stand out within the group anymore."

I purchased the Groupon which overall saved me like 5.00 for the Portage Park location. Be careful that you&#39;re paying close attention to which location you&#39;re buying it from. There is also another one in Jefferson Park and they will not accept your Groupon for the other location. 

Once we got there, I super enjoyed the ambiance and overall vibe. They were playing music videos from 90s to 70s genre. LOVED it. They have a huge huge selection of beers I mean hugeeee. You go up to order and you take a seat while they give you a number and bring you your food.

So I ordered the Black Betty medium which had bacon, bleu cheese, onion rings. It was cooked perfectly! The first couple bites were literally heaven! The combination of the cheese with the onion ring crunch was superb. However, when I got towards the end of the burger the bleu cheese just became overwhelming I mean there was just SO much of it. I would suggest to ask for it easy or on the side if they can. That&#39;s really my only complaint it got kind of soggy and just weird so I didn&#39;t finish the entire thing. The Parmesan garlic fries are a MUST! Perfectly crunchy full of flavor and everyone in the restaurant was also raving about the same fries. 

The customer service is amazing. Two women helped us throughout our whole dinner and they were super sweethearts and so so friendly. Because of this I&#39;m really going for the 5 rather than a 4 just because of the ending experience with the burger this made up for it. 

Parking can be a bit of a pain since it&#39;s down Irving but you can find some around the corner down the side streets/not permit parking."

I may be a very healthy eater.  I consume at least two (2) large apples a day for lunch so the doctor is definitely out my eyesight!  However, one of my guilty pleasures is to eat a burger, a very well-crafted burger, with some gourmet fries on the side.  By the way, can I get a bottle of &#34;Green River&#34; as well?  Thank you very much.  

Did that sound familiar to the pictures below?  It should because I ordered exactly that.  First of all, speak up to the gentleman behind the register on your &#34;pick of the day.&#34;  If your appetite allows, add that oily-yummy garlic Parmesan fry to complete the feast for the night.  

I chose &#34;House of the Rising Sun&#34; because there&#39;s a fried egg in it.  By the way, their patty is made out of beef and pork.  I know hubby&#39;s stomach doesn&#39;t befriend with Ms. Piggy, but he had no complaint with his &#34;Good Night Irene,&#34; with crab meat on top of the beefy-porky patty to create an extra crunch.  

The burgers appeared greasy at first sight.  I didn&#39;t think they were.  The meat was actually very moist.  I could tell that burgers offered at brgrbelly have a creative approach.  For adventurous eaters like yourself, or in this case, Rosa J., you&#39;re in luck.   

In terms of value vs. quality, most burger entrees are within $11-$12.  Hubby and I spent $33 and some change for two (2) burgers, one (1) order of garlic Parmesan fry, and two (2) bottles of soda.  Thus, don&#39;t equate burgers you have at Brgrbelly to whatever that yellow giant &#34;M&#34; fast food restaurant assembles across the street.  Cut those cheapo, synthetic-tasting burgers from these fast food restaurant chains five (5) days a month.  The money you&#39;ve saved from that junk will pay for a satisfying Brgrbelly burger.  

Their unlimited music videos on their dining room TVs were incredibly cool and amazing!  EMF&#39;s &#34;unbelievable&#34; was on.  And yes, this song is also on my Pandora playlist.

Since the dine-in spaces are limited, carry-out seems to be a popular option.  I personally will stick around for their music videos and bang my head with them like a rock star!"

My siblings and I all tried different burgers--the Black Betty (smoked bacon, bleu cheese, homemade fried onion straws, buffalo bleu sauce), the Old Time Religion (roasted tomato, goat cheese, arugula, truffle aioli), and the Gallows Pole (caramelized mushrooms and onions, smashed taters, swiss cheese, béarnaise sauce). No major complaints on any of them other than the fact that it was all just a little...too much. The Black Betty had great ingredients, but they were all super rich and I couldn&#39;t bring myself to finish it. It needed pickles, vinegar...something to cut through all that richness. The goat cheese on the Old Time Religion didn&#39;t really shine with the rest of the burger either. Same sort of problem with the Gallows Pole..none of the flavors particularly came through. I will say, though, that their buns are very good.

We all got the garlic and parmesan fries. Those were pretty good to start off, but half my fries were inedible since they were drenched in oil. No exaggeration here...there was a pool of oil and parmesan in my basket. Once again, the problem was being hit over the head with flavor and richness, but not in a good way. 

If I were to come again, I would go with a regular side of fries, and maybe a less flavor-bomb of a burger. All in all, the ingredients and flavor combinations are good, but I think they need some fine-tuning to really shine."

The House of the rising sun with garlic parm fries. Yes. Amazing. I loved the metal atmosphere but not too much where you are scared to eat that burger like nobodys business. The prices were not too shabby with the amount they give you, very reasonable. 

Ps. I saw this little wrapped thing and blew it off as extra wax paper, nope, its a cookie. A COOKIE!!! Heck yes!"

Extremely small space.  Far drive for us.  Parking is street.  Staff was nice.

Food was really mediocre and tasteless.  The best part about the burgers were the buns...which is kind of sad.  There wasnt much flavor.  We had the midnight special...and it was plain, boring.  The black betty was delicious but I think it was because of the pungent blue cheese helped out the very bland burg.  Fries were good, but not worth coming all the way out here.

It just didnt do anything for us.  Bums"

An employee approaches us and says &#34; you have  to order inside, we close at 10 and it is already 9:40 so you can place your order to go&#34;.

I had the &#34;Old Time Religion&#34; which is a delicious, high quality beef patty (I could taste it) on what was a soft, fresh, homemade bakery bun, with arugula, roasted tomatoes, goat cheese and truffle aoli. Wow. Talk about great ingredients and flavor combinations! The burger was so good -  the truffle aoili and goat cheese gave such a savory tone to it, while the peppery arugula and roasted tomatoes blended nicely and complimented these flavors! The bun was huge and I had some left, but again, I appreciated the fact that it was not your usual hamburger bun. 

I would like to eventually try other burgers on their menu, and even go in to experience the restaurant. For now, though, I am definitely a fan!!"

I bookmarked Leadbelly Burgers long ago when I read a list somewhere of Chicago&#39;s Best Burgers. So this year one of my resolutions is to go to all my bookmarked places. My friend wanted to go to Kuma&#39;s but we decided to come here since neither of us have been before. 

Leadbelly&#39;s is a top contender for top burger. I can&#39;t say it&#39;s the best because I haven&#39;t tried them all yet!!! We got the Black Betty and the Easy Rider and both were delicious. We also ordered the Parmesan Garlic fries. Those could&#39;ve been a bit more crisp but we did come on a very busy Saturday night so I won&#39;t dock a star. Although they were packed, the service was still good and we didn&#39;t feel rushed to leave. 

The bun really stood out to me. So buttery and slightly crispy. It made the burger even better. I loved the flavor profiles each burger had to offer. I am not at all a blue cheese fan but I do like it with beef. And the Black Betty was perfect. Not overwhelming but you could still taste it. On the Easy Rider I loved the homemade sriracha pickles, they should fry those up and make them a side! 

My friend loved the beer variety they had to offer and she was super excited to see one her favorites from Three Floyd&#39;s in the cooler. I loved the butter cookie as a little sweet treat after dinner. Even though we were stuffed we couldn&#39;t resist those cookies. 

I will definitely be back soon to try another burger. But I will probably come on a weekday to avoid a long wait for a table and my food. And I will also get some cookies to go!"

One of the better choices that one will find for what is out there these days... The meat is well chosen (fat to meat ratio) and ground nicely. The patty is fair in size, nicely seasoned or salted,  and properly cooked (all the important elements of a good burger patty are done right here). 

The options of pre-set burger condiments and cheese choices are great. Also, the bread was very good, very fresh, and was made in house.

The fries were fresh cut and were made excellent (twice cooked? = This is a good thing). The topping options for the fries were also nice choices. Although, the pork belly option didn&#39;t really have much pork belly with it but it was still very tasty. 

It&#39;s a well working business operation/concept. Simple  menu, and ones choice of beer. Followed by good customer service.

The meal comes with a cookie that was very tasty,  resembles school cookies from back in the day (the sugar butter cookie kind).


The only major disappointment, besides the tacky music idol theme (which is more of a turn off - good thing it&#39;s not named LEADBELLY anymore), is that of it not being BYOB! The business seems to be working with the selling of the beers that they offer so it doesn&#39;t seem likely that it will ever be BYOB but it definitely would be a better burger joint if it was. 

It would also be nice if the burger came with a side of fresh cut potato chips for like a dollar more and give the customer the option to upgrade the chips for a slight charge more. 

A plus+ on the hot sauce selections. 

They def know how to get people to easily run up the tab with the menu setup and beers but all and all there are so many overrated horrible burger restaurants and this IS NOT one of them. Again,  great burger! 

This is definitely going in the right direction if your looking for a good quality burger and excellent fries."

The burgers are made with both ground beef and pork, and the corn buns are baked day of.  If they run out, no more buns.

You pick your crazily-named burger.  It&#39;s similar to Kuma&#39;s, in that it is music themed and a burger joint.  But it&#39;s much calmer than Kuma&#39;s.  They show music videos and concerts in the place.  The fries are outstanding, lots of choices.  We usually get the pork belly fries.  The house made BBQ sauce is tangy and lightly spiced.  At the end, they give you a fresh baked cookie. 

Love this place!"

I had high expectations for Leadbelly and I&#39;m sorry to say but I was quite disappointed. I was looking forward to adding it to my &#34;Best Burgers in Chicago&#34; list, but it didn&#39;t make the cut. Darn. 

I ordered the &#39;Amazing Grace&#39; burger which was topped with smoked pork belly, crispy onion straws, homemade spicy sriracha pickles, and mustard BBQ. My friend ordered the, &#39;The Gallows Pole&#39; which was topped with swiss, onions and mushrooms. We also split the garlic and parmesan fries. One order of fries was enough for the both of us. It&#39;s a place where you order at the counter, you get a number, you seat yourself, and then they bring the food out to you. We found a nice spot out on their front patio. 

When the burger was brought out it LOOKED spectacular. However, the first bite was not magical like I had hoped...not at all whatsoever. The pork belly was too chewy and unfortunately I had to take it off because I couldn&#39;t bite through it while it was in the burger. I wish I had ordered a bacon burger instead. The burger meat was...different? First off it was not juicy at all, very dry, maybe it was more lean, but I know what lean ground beef tastes like that, and that is not it either. It tasted overcooked even though I saw it was pink bc I ordered it medium well so I&#39;m not sure what was going on there, but I didn&#39;t like it. The bun was just okay, I think it was a brioche type of bun, which my friend enjoyed more than I did. 

The HIGHLIGHT of the meal was the fries. I thought they were fantastic and I would come back just for the fries."

My mushroom burger (yes, I am lame for getting veggies but what do you expect) was amazing.  My friends ordered a garlic french fry side which was potent, but delicious.  The staff made some helpful suggestions which proved excellent.  The buns, made fresh daily, were really soft and light.  

Quite a few local / micro-brew options on hand in bottles.

Someone has a big jones for Kurt Cobain here, and that&#39;s alright. I guess he&#39;s associated with Leadbelly the blues artist by way of MTV Unplugged, ding ding, Final Jeopardy!

I ordered the Leadbelly original burger, and the house fries with sea salt and pepper. The burger was okay, NOT WOW, the Best, Jerry! Definitely just okay. The house fries were almost devoid of sea salt, and I would like to see a sweet potato fries option. 

The beer selection here is pretty amazing, and the service is really nice. They do have a small patio, and I did like that I saw people of all ages and all races enjoying this place. A unique burger place in a unique place, Portage Park."

This place is right around the corner from me so I&#39;ve been here 3 or 4 times now in the last 8 months or so. Each time getting a different burger. I&#39;m trying really Frickn hard to love this place. :( I cant! The burgers are not great. The bun has an almost garlicky taste that I do not love. The meat patty is thick as a mother brother but It&#39;s not melt in your mouth goodness like some of the others. The fries are solid but once you get half-way through their cup it&#39;s served in the fries get so small I can&#39;t dip them in my ketchup any more. My fingers have ketchup on them. Wahh! 

Leadbelly&#39;s is a wonderful establishment for the neighborhood and is very well run, soo I really do want to love this place.

I ordered a Leadbelly with jalepeno jack cheese and garlic parmesan fries. My friend ordered the chipotle fries and we shared both.

The burger was huge, but it wasn&#39;t awesome. The meat tasted overcooked and wasn&#39;t very juicy. The bun had a garlic-y smear on it, which I didn&#39;t care for too much. The sriracha pickles were great though. As for the fries, they had almost too much garlic on them. I liked the chipotle fries best, but it would be difficult to eat a whole basket of them. They were rich.

I bought the burger, fries, and a beer and the total came in just over $18. Not what I expected from what I thought was a burger joint.

As for atmosphere, I loved the posters and rocker vibe. There were quite a few tables inside, and there is a patio area. It looked like it was going to rain, or else we would have sat outside. It was rather loud inside though. They were playing what seemed to be a Dave Matthews Band live concert DVD. I thought maybe the volume level only bothered me, but I saw someone ask the cashier to turn the volume down, so I guess it wasn&#39;t. The cashier turned it down 2 levels. Still too loud.

I think I would try this place one more time, but if I didn&#39;t like the food again, I wouldn&#39;t be back for a third time."

Seeing as though the only thing I don&#39;t like is the small space I&#39;ll get right into this.  Huge fan of concise menus. Play to your strengths and that&#39;s what they do. The specialty burgers here are seasoned well and this summer I hope to run a train on their menu from the burgers to the fries to the spiked shakes. 

For starters I had the House of the Rising Sun that comes with a fried egg naturally. I guess my only beef would be that it didn&#39;t come topped with lettuce and tomato. No matter the specialty I feel all burgers should come with that. The sriacha pickles are damn good as well. I only got the regular house fries but I&#39;m sold on the pico and pork belly versions too. I see you summer. 

To make the visit that much more pleasant I was given a free drink by the lady at the register. And she was excited just because I was excited to be there for the first time haha. Service was on point and can get slow but I could tell the workers keep a close eye. 

The space is decorated pretty dope with rock memorabilia but again it&#39;s small. I don&#39;t like the feeling and act of battling and eyeing down tables with other patrons cause I promise you I will get to it first, nice guy or not.

Although I&#39;ve kind of given up eating meat, boy gave his head nod of approval. He said it was better than Kuma&#39;s and even better than Au Cheval. He got the Leadbelly burger with fried egg, onion strings and mayo. I myself had a mushroom Leadbelly burger. The garlic parmesean fries were a little too greasy, but it had a great taste. Plus, it came with a free butter cookie! I&#39;m not complaining, but perhaps let the customer know there&#39;s a nut in the cookie in case of peanut allergies?

So I went on a Saturday night with the groupon, and also my girlfriend. 
It was bad. I felt like they were punishing me for using a groupon and not paying full price. It took almost 45 minutes to get served a burger and fries. What got me mad though was that my girlfriend got served first, along with most of the tables in the restaurant, despite that I had ordered before any of them. They brought out my girlfriends burger (she ordered right after me) and I was waiting for mine. I saw them handing out food to people who had just sat down. So I went to the cashier and asked her to check on mine. Some woman taking a phone call heard me complaining and she told me to sit down and wait, that the restaurant is busy and I will get to eat whenever they get to my order. I thought this woman was extremely rude both with what she said and how she said it. She didn&#39;t even put down the phone to tell me this. 
Luckily a few minutes later a man came to my table and explained that he heard me talking with this lady. He had me give him my order and I could tell he went into the kitchen and had them make my order right away. This man, probably the owner or manager, was the ONLY one working who had any interest in solving my problem. I was about to leave and demand a refund when he talked to me, so kudos for fixing the problem before it became worse. 
Besides him being helpful, I had a terrible time. I think they rushed cooking my burger, because even though I ordered it cooked medium, it made me sick the next day. The reason I didn&#39;t send it back was because I was afraid it would take another 45 min to re cook. 
I saw the other employees rushing guests for sitting &#34;too long&#34; at the tables eating. This is extremely unprofessional and just wrong. They charge $9-11 for a burger, to make you wait almost an hour. For a burger that isn&#39;t all the way cooked. To be rushed out by the staff if you want to enjoy and take your time with the burger. 
All these negatives aside, the food does taste good. Everything from the bun and sauce and meat and bacon and even fries. 
I have to say if you do want to try brgrbelly there a few tips to enjoy it even more. 1) call first! The menu is online, so call ahead and avoid a terrible wait. 2) if possible, take the order to go. The sitting area is extremely small and overcrowded. When it is busy, the dining room borders on being a fire hazard. 
This is a complicated review, because the food was really good. I think I would give it a 5/5 just for the food.
BUT between all the problems with the wait, service, and value ($15 almost for burger and fries). I feel like these guys ruined a successful formula of great food, good theme, and in good neighborhood. Their service problems force a low score 
1/5"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here&#39;s the thing about Leadbelly; it&#39;s a great time. I was going to give them four stars because it&#39;s a bit out of the way, but hey, it&#39;s a double-edged sword.

One one hand, yes, it&#39;s off the beaten path from where i usually haunt. But on the other it&#39;s a diamond in the rough and you&#39;re probably not going to have to wait four hours to sit down. Ehhhem, Original Kumas.

They were busy enough that i didn&#39;t get suspicious, but not so busy that we couldn&#39;t sit down right away. 

Here&#39;s a pro tip: pre game with a cocktail next door at the Martini Bar. It&#39;s a weird Eastern-Euro vibe, where they blast electro music and don&#39;t pay for premium Spotify so you have to listen to commercials (don&#39;t ask me why, but it just feels right). No one was in the place. It was like being at a night club on a Monday afternoon even though it was night time. Our group-appropriately dubbed &#39;Meat Hunks&#39;-sat in one of their plush VIP booths and enjoyed a syrupy martini before heading in to devour burgers.

On to the burger. I had the Old Time Religion (good enough for me!). Holy shit. So good. It didn&#39;t fully sink in until this morning how much i loved this burger. And those fries. Mang. I had the blue cheese fries and washed em down with a couple craft beers from the folks at Three Floyds. 

The classic live Nirvana MTV Unplugged set played on the big screen completing the homey vibe. A great Meat Hunks outing. One of my favorite overall experiences.

Congrats, Leadbelly, you&#39;ve made it in to my top five Chicago burgers list. Perfectly cooked, medium rare. Great variety of topping styles. Cozy space. Friendly folks working there. Great bottle selection. Thoughtful rock-based theme done tastefully and not in your face. Makes me want to go back right now to try another.

You join the ranks of: 
1. Kuma&#39;s Motorhead
2. Owen &amp; Engine&#39;s burger (no add-ons)
3. The Harding Tavern&#39;s THT
4. LEADBELLY&#39;s Old Time Religion
5. Square Bar&#39;s Lobster tail and Brie Burger

This place never let&#39;s me down! The burgers are super fresh, the loaded fries are awesome! Not a huge fan of craft beer, but nice to have some to wash down the delicious food. I&#39;ve tried every burger here, Black Betty is my favorite, highly recommend for blue cheese lovers. 
They used to have a pizza-sized burger called the Titanic (24hr notice). This was great, but they got rid of it :("

It&#39;s a rock-themed burger joint that fires on all cylinders: friendly staff, great service, clean facility, and of course, exceptional food. 

We stopped in on a Sunday evening so it wasn&#39;t packed.  This is a place without pretension so you just step up to the counter, place your order, and they&#39;ll bring it to your table when it&#39;s ready.  We got three burgers, all of which were extremely good.  I&#39;m talking about the kind of good when you just close your eyes and go, &#34;mmm.&#34;

My girlfriend got the Old Time Religion - roasted tomato, goat cheese, arugula and truffle aioli.  Damn, so simple yet so good.  My sister and I went with sweeter options, opting for the Amazing Grace and the Easy Rider, respectively.  Both had excellent sauces and delicious homemade pickles.  These burgers are also constructed very well.  My girlfriend&#39;s in particular was so expertly built.  Even though the burgers my sister and I got were bigger, they weren&#39;t sloppy, and they held up well to the numerous bites we took. 

Of course, the number one thing you look for in a burger is how well it&#39;s cooked.  Here, we asked for medium rare, and we got medium rare.  The patties were so soft yet still had that good &#34;bite&#34; you like in a burger.  They really know how to cook here.  The burgers weren&#39;t the only delicious offerings at Leadbelly.  We ordered the chipotle fries, and Leadbelly even includes their delicious butter cookie in each order.

Our visit to Leadbelly was spur-of-the-moment, and we&#39;re so glad we decided to go.  Do yourself a favor and grab a bite at Leadbelly!"

The burger I had was so greasy - the fat/meat ratio was more fat than usual...so much that it should been called LARD ON A BUN.
The Bread it was in was so airy and light it tasted like the cheapest bread at Aldi&#39;s.
The fries are so soggy and oily - they taste like mashed baby food in fry form.

The only positive thing is their large beer selection."

But also a bit smaller.  Don&#39;t let some of these wide shots fool you.  There aren&#39;t that many tables available, so seating can be a bit tough with all the fans coming for some food around the same time.

But the burgers, well, they are definitely the star here.  Along with the fries.  It&#39;s definitely hard to find a good place for a burger that&#39;s cooked well.  Plus they have a variety of condiments available (an amazing array of mustards) that you are free to enjoy.  The buns are fresh made there, and also a great tasting part of the experience.

Soft drinks are yet another thing to experience here.  Designer drinks.  But, definitely, are far above the average Pepsi or Coke type products.

Outside of the crowd potential, definitely worth a visit again and again."

Aside from the food I love the inspirational quotes in the bathroom and the owner is very nice too. He came around to say enjoy our meal which I thought was a pleasant thing to do. The decor is hardcore music but I would still consider it a kid friendly place. Cons: The place is small so it can get crowded and the food takes a while since they make it all fresh. If it&#39;s winter don&#39;t sit by the door because it gets SO cold when people open it.

And the garlic parmesan fries.....if you have a cheat meal or cheat day in your world, this is worth every single part of it.  

Brgrbelly is for people who want a serious burger.  If you&#39;re looking for a Chili&#39;s type environment, probably not going to give you what you are looking for.

Looong overdue visit. Beautiful Sunday afternoon on sunny day in December.

No wait. We were thinking we might have the wrong place when we arrived around 1. Guess people were watchin the Bears lose their final game this season.

Lucky us. We stared at the overhead menu boards and each got a burger. Portobello or chicken cutlet are the other base options to go with the very tasty topping heavy burgers.
We got the first 2 on the left. Mine was with lots of crispy bacon and very tasty n crunchy homemade pickles. I went up and had to ask for more.

Good basket of plain fries, tho toppings abound to top the fries.

Good shake. Dang root beer really had me saying dang after my first sip. 

Lasty, to go, we got the Elis cheesecake filled beignets. Mostly to help in the fundraising effort by Leadbelly. These we at later at home, and feel that we did our part today by giving and eating these ridiculously genius donuts should get a mention in my review.

It was cooked perfectly (medium rare), the sauce (Bourbon bbq) was really good, the bread was amazing and they give you a little cookie too. The little fat kid in me was way too excited about that cookie. Which was yummy by the way. The boy ate all his food with a happy sigh at the end.

Counter service good, young lady polite and helpful, 6 tables and long window facing counter.  Food prepared correctly.  I&#39;m a 68 yo white broad so keep this in mind as your peruse my pros &amp; cons:

Pros:  street parking, fast service, menu on screens, love the metal serving trays and wire basket for fries; Black Betty is a tasty burger and sauce satisfactory, good and appropriate sized bun...tasty bleu cheese fries, but, see below, good onion straws; cookie a nice touch but brought back no memories for me!

Cons:  very loud heavy metal music (remember, I&#39;m old) w/1 wall of flat screens; rather chilly, another patron asked for heat to be turned up and it got better; my phone stuck to the counter (ewwww!); to-go containers are Styrofoam (that&#39;s an easy fix!)

General:  I ordered incorrectly being tempted by all the &#34;bleu&#34; options.  So much going on with the burger I really couldn&#39;t tell the quality of the meat.  Next time I&#39;ll try something plainer.  Same with the fries.  The buffalo bleu sauce that tops the order makes things turn squishy very quickly...I advise the sauce on the side.

I usually never rave over burgers, but this is one I say is a must try: super delicious, juicy, and tasty!!! Have been here a few times since moving in the neighborhood and always come out stuffed, but content. 

The one mistake I always make is ordering two fancy fry baskets. If you are with at least one other person and are trying the fries other than just the house fry...remember that it is like ordering a meal. I ordered the belly fries on my last visit and barely made a dent. Don&#39;t worry I wasn&#39;t that sad because they made some damn tasty leftovers.

Yes, the space is small so if you don&#39;t plan to go, like when they open, then don&#39;t be surprised to wait. The wait is worth it, but it&#39;s best to be prepped for it so don&#39;t go when you are super cranky and uber hungry. I wouldn&#39;t say the service is slow per say, it&#39;s just that the meals are made with love and it shows. I mean damn....even their shakes are tasty (and I&#39;m not a shake person)!

On my most recent visit I had the &#39;house of the rising sun&#39; and although a few years ago I thought an egg on a burger was unheard of, now I feel like it&#39;s a must. A must when you have an especially juicy burger with equally top notch bread to sop up that yolky goodness!"

The bun was the best part of the burger which is really sad.
I ordered my burger medium and I got it much closer to well done.
The meat was a weird texture and about an inch thick.
I did enjoy my toppings but overall the burger was Meh.

The fries I got were the parmesan and garlic and they were mushy.

My burger was red and cold inside. I don&#39;t like to complain (or give bad reviews..) but this was terrible. I went back to tell them in case there are other raw burgers. The response was &#34;We undercook them since they need to sit in the trays.&#34;

Meat should be cooked to the proper temperature and also kept at a high enough temperature to be safe. Neither of these happened for my lunch. 

I was offered a replacement burger, however it was cold as well. At least it looked cooked, even overcooked. I did not feel safe eating this one either.

My coworkers&#39; burgers seemed cooked enough, however they commented they were cold also. 

I do not think this business should cater/ offer Fooda services."

We went on a Saturday night and the place was packed, really highlighting how small the space is, and absolutely no one in the place was enjoying themselves. I scanned the room throughout our (2 hours?) time there, and you could not find smiles or laughter. Everyone was irritated, everyone was hungry and waiting, and if they were eating, they weren&#39;t absolved of all their moodiness and impatience by the food.   You are always in someones way, there is always someone waiting hovering over table or blocking the doorway, the walk-way, the line, the condiment bar, the bathroom.. Just CRAMPED in. And not in a charming way.  Whatever you do don&#39;t take a new date there on a busy night unless you want them to see the petty, irritable side of you that this place brings out. People were just complaining at every angle, in front of us, behind us, seated and waiting. 
There isn&#39;t anything &#39;stand out&#39; about the burgers themselves, and the fries are a soggy amateur disaster. I got the Parmesan Garlic fries, and I&#39;ve had better from Wing Stop take-out that has been smushed and sitting in a bag for an hour. Once home, 30 minutes in the toaster oven on Broil could not get the crispy. The temperature of their oil or their ratio of fries they are dumping is severely off. 
The burger cannot hold a match-stick to Owen &amp; Engine, Au Cheval, Kuma&#39;s Corner, Lockdown, or really any of Chicago&#39;s &#34;Best Burgers.&#34; 
It also doesn&#39;t score points to be a knock-off of a knock-off in the &#39;rock-burger&#39; genre. Enough. Find something new and different, we have seen the rock-themed burger joint a few times before, and if they&#39;re asking us to put Leadbelly in the graces of, or comparable to Kuma&#39;s Corner or Lockdown, it is simply not happening.
As I mentioned, yes it was crowded which means they are doing something right to attract a crowd.. perhaps mostly due to hyped and, in my opinion an un-deserved standing in Chicago burger rankings and publicity. If you take that away, you don&#39;t have much."

Which was 3 hours late. Next time the truck comes to me!  So we bailed on the truck idea and while enjoying a FFF draft at Fischman Tavern my wife hopped on Yelp and Leadbelly was the new destination.  We walked from Jefferson Park and arrived to a nice little restaurant with a serious burger menu and (IMO) an even more serious selection of bottled beers.  More Three Floyd&#39;s options then most liquor stores carry, some 5 Rabbit, cans of Rev, and a host of other good craft beers from outside Chicago to boot.

We shared the Easy Rider which was slathered in a thick-as-thieves coating of Bourbon BBQ sauce and topped with cheddar cheese, bacon, and Siracha pickles.  The homemade bun was peppered with white and black sesame seeds and it was a nice change NOT to see a pretzel bun for once (that trend is approaching over played).  I didn&#39;t realize until after consumption that the burger patty had ground pork belly in it as well, so that might be part of the secret, but this was the best burger I&#39;ve had in the city that I can recall.

Fries, which often are a big handful of afterthought, were served in a mini fryer basket and the hand-cut and double fried Chipotle fries we opted for were topped with what appeared to be their Midnight Special burger&#39;s ingredients including pico, chili cheese Fritos, and a creamy orange Chipotle sauce (which was also readily available on the table in bottle form).  A nice little addition was a butter cookie topped with pecans with both white and dark chocolate drizzled over.  Their &#39;Adult Shakes&#39; looked really good as we saw someone after us order one.  Next time.

It was way past lunch time and it appeared most everyone there already had their food so the wait was quite short, but I hardly noticed while we read through the food-related trivia cards on the table and watched some vintage video of Queen in concert on their plasma screen.  We briefly chatted with the owners and said we were definitely coming back again and that we expected not to be the only ones.  They have only been open a few months but if the food is this good next time then forget about it; I&#39;ll have even less of a reason to ever want to stand in line for hours to get into Kumas and have my ears blasted off with metal (as posted over the bar at the Empty Bottle: &#34;you&#39;re not too old; it IS too loud.&#34;)

After one visit I can find only one thing to complain about: the fact that they are not closer to home :)"

Belinda Carlisle of the GO Go&#39;s fame sang Heaven is a Place on Earth.

Leadbelly is as good as it gets, from the moment you enter this place with
all the great rock posters of the legends from the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s adorning
it&#39;s walls.
You see.. I was a teenager in the 70&#39;s and I loved my rock music and
leadbelly gave me back some of my best memories.

The interior of the restaurant holds about 6 tables and there is a counter
along the window where you can sit and look out onto Irving Park.
And.. with the warmer weather approaching they have some tables outside as well.
I ordered a burger named the &#34;Easy Rider&#34; which was this phenominal
burger consisting of smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, homemade pickles
and Bourbon Barbecue Sauce, all this on a pretzel roll.
Honestly.. had to be the best burger I have had in my lifetime!
It was perfection!
Okay folks, there&#39;s more to come because the Garlic Parmesan Fries
were tremendous as well.
And.. my chocolate shake and Leadbelly&#39;s Butter Cookies..pretty much 
to die for.

So.. I would like to Thank everyone at Leadbelly for such a great
dining experience, Thank You for my frequent diner card which will
entitle me to a free order of fries in 4 more visits.
You know I will be back.. and I will bring my peeps with me!
And.. to the Awesome Nicole.. It was great meeting you.. You Rock!
So.. do yourselves a favor and stop into Leadbelly&#39;s..
And.. stop into the ladies bathroom for there is a picture of Madonna
up on the wall ..(Her Like a Virgin Era)
Just another bonus.. Madonna on the bathroom wall!
God.. I Love You Leadbelly.."

Small clean interior with 6 tables but I prefer the small 6 table sidewalk patio.

Both of our burgers were good , attributed in large part due to the sauces and toppings, the burger seemed to be a little dense and bland. Homemade buns topped with white and black sesame seeds was a nice touch and definitely held up to all the sauce slop!

Amazing Grace burger with Carolina BBQ sauce, fried onions and pork belly was our favorite, the sauce was sweet and delicious.

The Easy Rider burger was messy with its thick red BBQ sauce but with two thin slices of bacon I&#39;m not sure the menu description of &#39;bacon, and more bacon&#39; is really accurate!

Polish fries were by far the best part of the entire meal, huge portion of extra crispy tater sticks smothered in melted cheese, kielbasa and sauerkraut. Blue Cheese fries were good, we loved the super spicy sauce on them but wished the blue cheese chunks were smaller. 

Its probably not near your house, but find a way to get there and check it out!"

The place can be easy to miss if you are whizzing by in your car on Irving Park Road west of Central Avenue.  The dining area is fairly small, so the etiquette of dining at Leadbelly is to order your food first and then you can be seated.  While waiting for your food you can look at the rock memorabilia on the walls, and watch a vintage Queen concert video (my friend swears that they were playing the same Queen video both times we dined there, and she might be right).  She also swears at the mirror in the ladies room, which is apparently situated too high for the average-height female to fully appreciate. 

Both times I ordered The Gallows Pole burger.  It is a sizeable and in-your-face stack with caramelized onions and mushrooms, smashed fries, swiss cheese and bearnaise sauce.  The hefty bun, with a buttery taste and topped with sesame, is tasty in its own right and holds together the beefy ensemble quite well.  Each order of fries is served in a cutesy deep fryer container.  I have had the Belly Fry, topped with chunks of pork belly, fried onion straws, and Carolina mustard sauce.  It sounds bizarre, but you can almost make a meal out of these fries.  The Garlic Parmesan fries are good too.  There are simpler burgers and fries too, which passed the taste test of our dining mate with less exotic tastes.  There are shakes (which can be spiked) and a pretty decent selection of craft beers to choose from.  Everyone also gets a butter cookie as a bonus treat.  While &#34;butter cookie&#34; sounds like one of those boring mass-produced cookies you get in a grocery store tin for 99 cents, Leadbelly&#39;s cookies are pretty decadently laced with drizzlings of white and milk chocolate along with pecans so they are more akin to pecan sandies. 

I was not sure if I was going to give Leadbelly 5 stars, but during my last visit I was getting full and wanted to save my last two-and-a-half bites of my burger along with a couple of fries to go.  The next morning I savored my two-and-a-half bite &#34;slider&#34; and fries, and wish I had a few more bites.  Now that&#39;s a good burger - so 5 stars it is for Leadbelly."

They offer an array of craft beers, shakes, loaded fries, and unique burgers.  When people say the dining area is small, it&#39;s SMALL!! It only offers counter seating and about six tables.  But for those warmer days, they open up their outside patio.

For food, I ordered the leadbelly burger (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, siracha pickles, and your choice of cheese) with a side of belly fries (pork belly, onion straws, and sweet mustard.)  Yea I wasn&#39;t feeling too adventurous with my burger this time, but I found the patty to be semi-overcooked.  They did not bother to ask how I would like my meat cooked, which most other burger places do.  Not all people like well done Leadbelly!!  Other than the semi-overcooked meat, everything about the burger was good.  Their homemade bun was delicious and the siracha pickles gave it an extra kick.  This made the burger alright I guess.  I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the belly fries even though other people raved about them.  I just thought the chunks of pork were too big for my liking.  Oh, did I mention they give you a butter cookie on the side with your burger.  Nice touch Leadbelly.

Overall, the burgers here were alright.  I just had better burgers in the Chicagoland area.  I would not go out of my way to eat here, but if I&#39;m in the area I might consider it.  I also feel like the seating area was too tight.  You have to snake your way through to your table and probably still bump into other people."

10/10    Butter Cookies


It all sounded so promising, name sounded interesting, read some great reviews, pictures made it look delish, music was appealing, but unfortunately

IT DIDN&#39;T LIVE UP TO THE HYPE........just MEH!!

Ordered the Easy Rider,which came with melted cheese, Bourbon (not really) BBQ sauce (tasted more like Open Pit!) and smoked (?) bacon, that had no flavor.  The meat seemed like it was frozen and then thawed, not very fresh tasting.  Maybe it was a LEAD burger, it certainly looked and tasted heavy and dry, completely devoid of any flavor!  Bun was okay, but not as good as I was expecting, even though it was homemade.  Glad I didn&#39;t order the fries, which I read on Yelp weren&#39;t that great anyways.  The whole thing came to almost $10 and that was w/o a drink.

The surprise though was my order came with a complimentary butter cookie, drizzled with chocolate. Those were delish! If ever I was in Portage Park again, I&#39;d order the cookies and skip everything else.

It&#39;s a small space, though, and they don&#39;t take reservations and it&#39;s hard to find seating. Parking is easy to find though. It&#39;s a nice place for hanging out but only with one other person since it&#39;s hard to find a spot to sit.

I&#39;m not usually a girl that goes to a restaurant and orders a &#34;burger&#34;, but when I do I expect that burger to be delicious. Leadbelly did not disappoint. The restaurant itself is pretty small and seating is limited. You order your food at the counter, take a number, and grab a seat. While you wait for your food you get to watch some awesome television (we were treated to live Queen and Nirvana DVDs). 
    The wait for the food was a tad bit long, but it didn&#39;t bother me too much. I got the Black Betty burger, my husband got the special burger &#34;Van the Man&#34;, and we split a Belly Fry. The burgers were cooked perfectly to order (medium). The blue cheese and thick bacon on my burger was so tasty. My husband enjoyed his burger, but thought it was a tad bit too salty with the corned beef. The winner of the night, however, was the Belly Fry. Do not be afraid of the mustard on fries. It is sweet and delicious! And the bits of pork in there were drool worthy. I will return just for the fries alone.

Went with a group, and consequently, got to try five different burgers including my own... each more delicious then the next. I dont know remember the specific names of the sandwiches, but the fairly small menu has pretty much proven everything to be delicious. The joint is small, but the portions are big. I do eat a lot, and I was overly content after my meal. Just as their array of burgers greatly varies, so does there craft selection... a nice thing to keep in mind. ALSO dont forget the parmesan fries!!! God I hope I dont get diabetes anytime soon. 

Deserves a 5 star because for what it is (a small little burger joint), it pulls it off insanely well with perfectly cooked and flavorful burgers, lots of beer, and delicious fries."

However for our friends event we each got one free drink with the smorgasbord of food. Rice was good, flavorful with tomato sauce. Chicken kebab and fried chicken nuggets were dried out and too peppery and salty. The empanadas had a thick crust and could be differentiated by slight differences in the crust design but were not labelled. The corn one was my favorite.

From the outside it looks very much like a sketchy dark black hole on the corner of a 6-way intersection. Good thing the inside was much better.  

Empanadas: 6 medium-sized empanadas for $13. My favorites: sweet beef, corn, and chicken and cheese. All three were superrrrrrr yummy to the point where I couldn&#39;t pick an absolute favorite. The spinach and cheese was the only one I didn&#39;t particularly like. 

Provolone cheese oven baked - Perfectly hot and melted when they bring it over. It&#39;s so tasty with the bread.

Marinated eggplant (served cold) - A very interesting dish that somehow reminded me of pickled Taiwanese cucumbers. It wasn&#39;t something I really enjoyed eating by itself but when you eat it with the bread, it totally changed my perspective. Better yet, put a layer of the provolone cheese on top of the bread, then put the eggplant on top of that. It&#39;s like a perfect little bite!  

I wish they brought more bread initially with the provolone and the eggplant because both were medium to large sized appetizers that really needed to have the bread on the side. Also, we were a party of 4 yet the bread was cut into slices of 3. Thankfully, we (awkwardly) asked for more bread several times and the waitresses were very accommodating. I don&#39;t believe we were charged extra either!

Drinks:  We each started off with a mojito of different flavors. My favorite was the pineapple juice followed by the mango puree. The La Negra smelled and tasted very berrylicious and the alcohol kicked in at the end of each sip. I personally would stay clear of the Mala vida - it was like drinking alcohol cough syrup and the El Vampiro - cool name but holy smokes I almost choked.  

All in all, it&#39;s quite the random place to spend an evening (note: it&#39;s also pretty empty in the immediate surrounding vicinity) but I had a wonderful time lounging around and catching up with friends."

We really, really tried to like this spot. We felt lost from the moment we walked in. It was dark as hell, and we didn&#39;t know if we were supposed to wait to be seated or seat ourselves. We just sat ourselves at a random table and a server came within a few minutes with a menu. 

We ordered the Vacio (flap steak) and Choripan (Argentine sandwich with sausage). I ordered the steak medium, but only 1/3 of it was cooked to order. The rest of it was rare. The mashed potatoes that came along with the steak had no flavor and was cold by the time it arrived. The Choripan was just plain sad and horrifically sub-par. We shined a light on the sausage and saw that it was still pink on the inside. The onions were practically raw and the bread was left untoasted and chewy. It only came with some chimichurri on the side which wouldn&#39;t have made the sandwich any better.

Maybe that&#39;s why it&#39;s so dark in here. So you wont notice all your food is undercooked. Neither of us finished our food and didn&#39;t even want to take it home. 3/4 of the sandwich was left uneaten and the server wasn&#39;t even bright enough to realize something was wrong to ask.

I founded few options but one was near my area so I decided to try after so many good reviews and so close of my house. I saw that on Tuesday night they were playing samba which I thought interesting.  When we walked in we had a great impression nice cozy bar area, kinda dark but nice. Me and my boy walked to the back part or restaurant and was also not that big but comfortable enough to accommodate a group. 

We ordered the famous mojito that everyone was talking about on yelp and also caipirinha and WOWWWW sooooo good def people were right totally worth it, glass was very big for the price. Then we ordered choripan (sausage) and milanesa (breaded beef) sandwiches and also very good. 

Samba music began and was like been in Brazil for those that have been there was so good to hear real/authentic Brazilian samba and bossa nova music. I&#39;m guessing for the way they moved some Brazilian  started dancing and was so awesome to see them dancing samba real style. I was totally in shock with this I was couldn&#39;t believe this place is so close of my house and never went before. For sure I will make this one for now on one of my favorite spot in Chicago."

The empanadas are a must try! I would recommend having them as an appetizer and highly recommend the ham &amp; cheese and the corn &amp; cheese. We also tried the beef which was good, though not much to it (just filled with ground beef and some onion). 

IMPORTANT: You get 6 empanadas and they are cooked where you can literally rip them in half - so if you only want to &#39;try&#39; one of the options you don&#39;t have to order 2. 

The mojitos are good, just slightly over priced ($10 each). I would have liked to order a few of priced around $7-8, but when you can get an IPA for $6...

Some of the best steak I&#39;ve had in Chicago. The Filet and the skirt steak are both incredible, as are the mashed potatoes and fries. It&#39;s well priced for a steak dinner, and a lot easier to get a table than at Tango Sur. Pretty dimly lit, and the few tables they have in the main room are pretty close together, but the food and helpful staff make up for it. (Plus it&#39;s sort of a romantic spot, so the dim lighting is expected.)

Pros - the mojitos and empanadas are delicious. Ample free parking nearby.
Cons - the other food we had was not good, espeically the mixta del mar - YUCK - defrosted seafood with olive oil and lemon.  Also, service was mediocre.

There are plenty of good places to get mojitos and empanadas in Chicago so you have to offer more than that to make me come back.  Disappointing."

The bar was dark and  very small in front but there is plenty of seating in the back area.The back area is really cute too. It would be great if they had like an open patio area that was more connected to the bar.

At one point my girlfriends and I ended up trying to dance on the smallest dance floor possible- it was awesome I felt like I was teleported to Latin America and just vibing out. But seriously the smallest dance floor possible like I literally could join the band drumming on the drums while dancing

They have live music there that night- it was a rotation between 2-3 bands. They were all very good but man was it loud! (Maybe, I am getting old lol).

Empandads were amazing- got an order of one of each kind. Each was just as good as the last.

The drinks were also fantastic!

I defiantly would love to come back but one thing I am not looking forward to would be the loud music.

Anyhoo the decor, and theme are appealing; Argentine gastro-pub, I like that. The interior is dim, but pleasant and the service was pretty friendly. Those were the good things.

The food was simply okay, no complaints but nothing that really impressed me either.

The music was absolutely atrocious though. House music blasting at such a high volume that I had to yell to talk to my friend sitting literally one foot away from me. I asked our waitress if she could turn it down and she said she could ask the DJ but that he most likely would not and she was right, he did not turn it down.... Keep in mind this was at 7 pm on a Wednesday. There were about six people inside all middle aged and all eating dinner, no one was dancing or at the bar.

We came on a Thursday night in a rather large group of around 16 people. The Dj was playing tango and salsa mixed with hip hop beats, Jamaican reggae and had a live performer playing the drums to the rhythms - that made the place extremely interesting to be at. The waitress was very sweet, and did her absolute best to accommodate us - by opening up the back room and adjusting everything to our liking. 

The wines were very good quality, and when everybody began to dance I knew I picked the right place. 

The range of diverse groups of people that come here is incredible. That same night we met a professional salsa dancer out for the night, an entire tango band, two reggae lovers from Jamaica, a rapper from the west coast and an aspiring writer. It was really fun and the atmosphere was unbeatable. 

We also came back on a Friday to a much smaller, more targeted crowd for salsa and bachata only. I&#39;d say Thursdays are the nights to go for a more mixed experience (in every meaning of that word) which Friday and Saturday nights will be more specific to a particular type of crowd."

Don&#39;t walk past N.  It is the perfect place for a girls night out or an intimate date night with your sig o.  There is a pretty good list of cocktails (around $9-$12) and even though the food list isn&#39;t that big, the taste certainly is.

I started off with La Passion: a passion fruit cocktail which was rum, passion fruit juice, and sugar.  I hadn&#39;t eaten in a while and I&#39;m kind of (read: totally) a lightweight so I was definitely feeling my drink about halfway through.  I wish I would have gotten another one, but my wallet was happy I decided against it.  I had a sip of my friend&#39;s mango mojito and it was super refreshing.  I&#39;d love to be sipping on that after strolling around the city on a hot summer day.

There were three of us at dinner and we were all eyeing pretty much the same things so we decided to split three dishes: 

Empanadas: Five stars.  So good!  The outside was nice and crispy while the inside was hot and delicious.  Our favorites were the corn and cheese and the spinach.  They came with an oil with herbs for drizzling/dipping.  Delicious!

Noqui (gnocchi): Four stars.  I love gnocchi.  A noodley dish made from potatoes and served with a creamy tomato sauce?  This is the kind of dish my dreams are made of.

Ravioli: Three stars.  The rav was okay.  Nothing great, but it wasn&#39;t bad.

Make sure when you visit N to get the empanadas and a cocktail!  My taste buds were all kinds of happy.  It&#39;s the perfect to place to begin or end your night!"

So, good job on that, I guess. Maybe they&#39;re going for some sort of super exclusive secret thing, who knows.

The bar seemed pretty typical for what I&#39;ve come to expect out of most bars in the city. Small, sort of crowded, weird seating, really dark, live music that seems cool at first but then just becomes obnoxious as you can&#39;t hear what anyone is saying, etc. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;d love to leave a more respectable Yelp review for this place as it feels really sort but Ñ to me just felt like every bar.

Their beer selection is decent, I guess. I was able to order a 5 Rabbit there which you can&#39;t find everywhere, and Delirium Tremens is also available. The mojitos they serve here are good, and come with enough citrus in them to fend off scurvy for months. At least parking nearby was easy."

My friends and I, a group of about 10, decided to venture in after a night out for dinner,  a few had been before and seemed to really enjoy it.  The entrance is a bit odd as one door leads to a tiny vestibule before another leads to the actual bar.  Upon our arrival many were already in full &#39;swing&#39; as they moved their way around the somewhat small &#39;dance&#39; area.

The bar is long enough to seat about 15 people comfortably and there were a few tables along the outer wall for others to sit.  Our group knew there was more, so we ventured past the somewhat interesting smelling bathrooms to the back room.  &#34;Wow! I can breath!&#34;.

The backroom was completely empty it too had tables along the outer walls and a few lounge like seats just as soon as you walked in.  We took over, and the dance area was plenty big for most of us to enjoy the non-stop Latin spins.

The drinks weren&#39;t too pricey about 10$ each for what we had (sorry don&#39;t remember most of the night, let alone what I was drinking) and the &#39;waitress&#39; was attentive and ready to help us &#39;enjoy our night&#39;.  Unfortunately, the backroom closes at 1, so our &#39;personal space&#39; was soon moved to the front, crowded and awkward dance area...  Didn&#39;t much matter, we still dance the night away."

The &#39;mar&#39;, which is a small appetizer of mixed seafood sautéed with olive oil was perfect. I ordered the breaded chicken, tho that one wasn&#39;t as fantastical to jump off a cliff to.

Only the front part of the restaurant was open on this particular night so we sat at the bar. The bartenders are friendly and quick. Should have known that this place is owned by the same people from Folklore because it is so damn dark in there. There were maybe 12 people in total there and the music was way too loud. I could barely hear my friend and were siting right next to each other.  Didn&#39;t get any food here as we just came for drinks but don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back to try it.

There is NO WAY I&#39;m not hungover. 
Not possible. 
But, I am not. 
Abundance of fresh limes save the day? 

Once I figure out why the world has given me this gift, I shall complete this review....

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

I&#39;ve concluded that the drinking gods granted me a freebie tolerance weekend...after careful reflection I really should&#39;ve enjoyed this a little more, but one never knows when the rug will be pulled out, and they will be found spinning around the room eating peanut butter sandwiches and regretting the rockstar attempt. 

Ok, so. Ñ (from Wikipedia):  Nobel Prize winner in literature Gabriel García Márquez expressed &#34;The &#39;Ñ&#39; is not an archaeological piece of junk, but just the opposite: a cultural leap of a Romance language that left the others behind in expressing with only one letter a sound that other languages continue to express with two.&#34;

So, fitting. 

For the first time in all of my Chicago nightlife endeavors...I felt...content? fascinated? at ease? expressive. excited. 

Drinks: Join my Fantasy Cocktail League, here&#39;s my draft lineup: La Negra, served in a martini glass...basically a blackberry, blueberry, rum-laden blend of buzz. Mmmmmm, limit one for me. Desire = 4. Follow-up, blackberry mojito. Truth, I&#39;m not even much of a mojito drinker, but this was a double tall glass of fairytale drunkness, complete with at least 1.5 fresh limes, squeezed...real blackberries. 

They must have a good produce hook-up, just saying. Magically fresh. 

Vibe: skews a bit older, thank God. Keep the youngins east, please. Dark, sultry, candlelight, wood floors, flickering fiery conversations, great music I&#39;ve never heard, but after aforementioned cocktailing, I think I can know it, love it, dance to it and forget how white I am for just a night....perhaps. Just overall...genuine, non-pretentious, hidden, somewhat secretive...(not so much anymore, but still)...and real people. 

Location: absolutely unassuming, typical &#34;diamond in the rough,&#34; a stone&#39;s throw from California/Belmont intersection (Avondale). Cabs are hard to come by, keep that Flash number in your phone, ours arrived moments after calling one in (+1 Flash). 

Sexy. It just is. As overused as that word is...it fits. A great after dinner cocktail spot...La Negra must be on your list, I implore you."

I always drove past wondering what was inside. 2 years ago I was on a late night stroll with my pooches and noticed people outside smoking. Then someone opened the door and I smelled something so delicious I had to get a closer look. So I walked up to the front of the building. Read the menu posted outside. Then I peek inside a little and see people dancing salsa and there was a live singer and band. This was like an Oasis in the desert. I took my dogs home, called up a friend and went there for dinner immediately. The food, the music, the ambience and the people were amazing in my book.

First off, you need a blind mans sick to get around because it is SO dark. I grabbed the candle plus my cell just to view the menu. Mind you, we were the only patrons there the whole night!  That was too weird. Then I had to change tables because they were so wobbly and my water kept spilling on each movement.  

I ordered La Negra and waited in anticipation for this wonderful martini. Um, to my surprise it was mostly juice with a fifth of liquor.  This was sooooo disappointing since this place is known for its drinks. 

We started off with the beef empanadas. I couldn&#39;t see what was in them so I was forced to use my sense of taste instead. They had boiled eggs in them which was so weird to me. I only had one since it was such a turn off.

I also ordered the beef milaneza which is the breaded steak.  This meat was thick wich is weird for milaneza which I&#39;ve always had it thin and crispy.  It was ok but definately needed some salt. I ordered a side of chimichuri sauce just to give it more ooommpfffff.   

The waitress was so nice which made me feel bad that I was writing this place off, that is why I decided to give it one more chance - but only for drinks!  Hopefully this time they give me liquor."

I read that the mojitos were fabulous which i found it to be mediocre at best. My boyfriend had a pineapple coconut drink that was actually really good. 

    We ordered the 5 empanadas with one of each kind....the corn cheese one is soooooo good....definitely get those the others were good and the sauce it comes with was also heavenly. I ordered the Lomito completo (where a fried egg and cheese is added) which is a sandwich...i thought it was ok..i have made better myself. My boyfriend had the &#34;Pescado&#34; which was Tilapia served with mashed potatoes and a tomato salad. Ok so it wasn&#39;t anything special...i found it odd that it said it came with salad and they brought a bowl of tomatoes. 

I like the decor, its a very hip trendy kinda place, dark lit by tea candles, which were blown out by the draft coming from the window behind me. Service was good but overall I think it is way over priced for the quality of food and location of the place. I mean our bill including tip  with two drinks two entrees and an app came to over 70 dollars! I did not feel i received the experience I should have for that price."

Girls wanted to do a night out so we headed here for dinner. Started off with I believe it was a blackberry mojito. Amazing! I highly recommend it. There was great music being mixed by a Dj while we were chatting and enjoying drinks. We ordered some sort of seafood appetizer, sort of like a seviche. It was seafood on a bed of greens. Also pretty amazing! 
All us girls split an eggplant dish and the tilapia. I cannot describe to you how great the food was, I was totally sold on this place after the food. 
While we ate a guy jumped on drums while the DJ spinned. They had such good taste in music, they played everything from The Roots, to Salsa, to Pharcyde, Reggae and Eryka Badu. We couldn&#39;t stop moving around in our seats dancing while we enjoyed this phenomenal dinner. 
The waitress was amazing! She was so adorable because by the time we got to our meals quite a few couples and girls were up dancing and she would dance up to our table to check if we were fine and bring us more drinks. I loved that even she couldn&#39;t sit still. &#34;Can you dance?&#34; must be one of the requirements on the job application lol. 
I&#39;m not sure what nights they have live music on but we got lucky on a Wednesday when we randomly stopped in. 
Beware, some legit dancers are in the house and you can tell they love this spot. They do not hold out on the Salsa moves. Impressive !"

Let me start with what I love..... 

Great Date place ((Book mark Now)) 

I love the mojitos. And that one male bartender on Wednesday who just rocks it out. You think you&#39;ll wait for ever but he&#39;s so fast and efficient he gets the job done. 

I&#39;ve been coming here for awhile now and I have to say the coconut and black berry mojito are my favorite. they usually add coconut creme or creme like substance but last night they didn&#39;t which made it taste like a regular mojito with the after taste of coconut. =( I switched to black berry and I was happy. 

Empandas are a must have. they&#39;re delicious. I esp love the beef empanada and that is hard for me to say because I truly live for my mothers!! 

The only mistake i made......was ordering ravioli in a Latin Fusion restaurant. This is why I&#39;m taking a star away. 
The marinara was very water and runny it wouldn&#39;t stick to the pasta. 
There were NO Latin influences to the filling of the ravioli or the marinara sauce itself (million dollar idea). 

I have to reference my mom, My Italian gf came to my house for pasta and was amazed by the Latin influence my mom had put into the pasta she clearly could see something was different then her mom&#39;s &#34;gravy.&#34; 

To top it off we waited a long time for it and some of the insides were cold. I think it was an off night ñ. 

We&#39;ll be back.....just not for ravioli."

If it wasn&#39;t for my GPS, I wouldn&#39;t be able to find it. The sign is too small and the the corner that its on is very dark.

My hubby and I went in on a week night around 6pm so they just opened. We were the only ones there. We started with empanadas and then I had the dos tiras (short ribs) and my hubby had the choripan. We really enjoyed the food...I mean once it came to our table.

I would&#39;ve given this place a 5 star but the the food took too long to come out and we were the only customers there. Maybe the cook was late...I dunno what it was but the wait time was not good. Great food though!"

Nice Miami/Latin feel to it! Great sexy atmosphere and music. This place draws a very diverse crowd. The DJ rocked the house! They have a back seating area if the front is filled and the bar is sort of small. I tried the Mojito &amp; Caipirinhas and they were both great. Around 11PM the place transformed from just a bar/ restaurant into a latin dance club, I mean people started burning up the floor and after we saw that, my friends and I joined in the festivities. I immediately thought this place was great! 

The staff was very friendly especially the people behind the bar. I dropped my hat at some point during the evening and I went crazy looking for it. I gave up and as a last resort asked the bartenders if they had seen it and he pulled it out and gave it to me. I thought that was really nice of him.

I will definately try this place again and again!"

We were  disappointed sorry to say. I guess in my mind I pictured something totally different. This place is small, but the day we decided to go it was before a big snow storm so it wasn&#39;t really crowded but the tables are really close to each other so even with the loud music (which I don&#39;t mind) you can still listen to your neighbors conversations. The decor is nice, it&#39;s very dim a little to dim I like  to  see  my food when I eat, and the waitress was very nice and attentive.  I had a mango picado for a drink which tasted nothing like mango and had some old limes in it which made it taste funny my wife had a mojito which she loved. The empanadas were very good the corn and cheese empanadas were  something different. I ordered beef short ribs and it came with two steaks  and talk about fat on these things, the first one I ate had about 30 percent fat 70 percent meat, the other was the other way around no lie 70 percent fat 30 percent meat. My wife had some steak I forgot the name of it with a side of mash potatoes nothing special. I figure most woman will like this place because they can get a few mojitos and dance the night out on the smallest dance floor ever. It&#39;s one of those you can  really like it or hate it spots.

We got here early, so the party hadn&#39;t yet started.  That was cool because that meant we could populate the back room and take over the couch seating.  As much as I liked chillaxin&#39; (I said it; what?) on some plush velour couches...the smell was a little gnarly.  I tried not to think about it, as I was having a good time but you better believe I made sure that no exposed skin or any part of my head touched any part of that couch.  I would not want to see them in the light of day.  PSA over.

The drinks are still strong, pure and cheap.  My entire party was amazed at how much you got for so little..and for how expertly crafted each was.  As hard as I tried, I could not escape my past as a Girl Drink Drunk.  Each cocktail I selected was served in a martini glass with some sort of trim.  My manly buddies looked on with resigned pity as they drank he-men drinks out of (what seemed like) 40 oz tumblers.  I didn&#39;t much care as I got a party on with my [name redacted for sake of salvaging any sort of love life].  It&#39;s my party and I&#39;ll drink what I please.  I did notice that, even, the waiters were like, &#34;Man...no.&#34;  The waiters!  They were mad cool.  They were very patient and helpful with a large bunch of folks and made sure to keep us air conditioned and liquored up at all times.  Spot on service.

Another victorious night at N (yes, I still can&#39;t put the ~ over the letter).  Next time, however, I&#39;ll opt for the wooden bench.  But, maybe not.  For all the eating I am doing, my @ss is still sorta bony.  I don&#39;t need to be in pain while I am getting a drink on."

I was sitting at a table with my back to the crowd and when I got up, Woah, ho, ho.  It was packed.  And there were so many hotties.  Too bad I had no make up on and looked like shit. Lesson learned.  

They also had a DJ set up at the bar, which I thought was pretty coola and he was jamming.  Playing mostly danceable upbeat, house tracks.  Couldn&#39;t ask for anything better.

Let me tell you, the first time my husband took me to ñ it was my birthday in 2006 and I was skeptical to say the least. The place looks preeeety shady from the outside. Once we were inside and we were tucked away at a cozy table listening and eventually dancing to some of the best live music in town, I was sold. 

The small plates are great, but I really like this place for the music, mojitos and the vibe. The beat of the music just gets inside of you and you can&#39;t help but dance.

I was there on a Tuesday (technically now Wednesday by the time I arrived) for their Brasilian party.

Saw the hottest body I witnessed in Chicago on a girl with white pants on (too many flat booties everywhere I went), which is always a nice way to spend an evening... except that girl I was there with didnt like Brazilian music, so we didnt stay very long.

I dont care to try this place on a mainstream type of night, but would definitely come back for any Salsa or Brazilian night."

True house heads will love what the DJs spin here: soulful vocal house, latin house, and even some old school. Throw in some good dancers, add a few mango mojitos to the mix, and you&#39;ve yourself a great start to a night of good times.

I&#39;ve been coming to Ñ for a few years and I recommend coming here late night on Saturdays. Lately, Sunday nights have been really great with Lego spinning an eclectic mix of Latin Jazz, Bossa Nova, Samba, Afro Rhythms, &amp; Brazilian/Latin House!

I HIGHLY recommend the empanadas and if you come early enough to get dinner, DO IT!

Gluttony is a sin, and sin is IN! So, just do what I do: point to the menu &amp; say, &#34;I&#39;ll take everything on this side&#34;, hang out &amp; drink like a camel after dinner, and dance like nobody is looking when the DJs begin to play!

Yesterday I asked to some friends to come to this place and I&#39;ve told them that how great it is, guess what I was wrong!... The place was empty (bad sign) gradually started to get filled, but the music was BAD, BAD and BAD... This was not a latin place, it was so ghetto... The DJ was horrible played 90% English music and in 3 hours 2 Salsa songs which by the way seemed that the small crowed felt like dancing more than the crap he was playing, RAP are u kidding me??? 

The food did not check it out, but drinks were great but EXPENSIVE!!! 

Overall: I won&#39;t go again, and won&#39;t recommend....

The music was a great Latin mix and the drinks are delicious, especially the Mango Mojitos, Caipairinhas, and another called La Negra. 

I would totally recommend it as a place to start or spend the whole evening. It can be intimate at a table for two, fun with a group (we had like 15 people show up for us), and more casual or  fun dancing. Helpful wait staff and a clean bar.

Things were pricey but not ridiculous; I got three nice mixed drinks for $23. No cover. Open, I believe, until 3am."

And so it is with ñ, a sexy Argentinian restaurant masquerading as a corner store. It could go unnoticed and is very unassuming. 
 
It  wasn&#39;t crowded, but loud and dark. I guess eating in the dark adds to the exotic allure of the place and it&#39;s crowd, but dag, can I get a flicker of light, please? On a hot, yet bearable saturday night, we opted for the patio which we had all to ourselves.

This is a great place for late night dining, as they&#39;re open until 2 a.m. We stopped in for late cocktails and dessert, and while I can&#39;t speak to how good the food is, the menu looked good. The desserts were stellar, especially the alfa jores, a layered Argentinian cookie w/chocolate, carmel and custard. Think the cookie version of a Napoleon.

The cocktails were superb--and I&#39;m not really even a drinker! I usually stay safe with a mojito everywhere I go. But ooooh, honey chile, that La Negra... the sweet aroma of La Negra had me bent--over the glass, that is. Smells and tastes like a liquid flower. 

There was a dj spinning house music saturday but I anticipate returning for dinner on either Tuesday when they have the live Samba music or Sunday when they have live Latin jazz or Tango. I&#39;ve been forewarned that it gets pretty packed and to come early."

Although they are a little pricey, they taste excellent.  We had empanadas for an app and they were excellent.  Our chicken kabobs were good, but not great.

Our main course was pretty solid.  Our group had ravioli, the filet, pechuga and the lomito.  I sampled everyones dishes and they were excellent.  My chicken was a tad dry, but still had excellent flavor.  I should have ordered the filet, but was stuffed from the drinks and appetizers we had.  Ravioli was so good.

I love a good Italian beef, and this one hit the spot.  Sometimes my husband and I play yelp roulette, we take turns picking a place simply based on our location and number of $$$ we&#39;re looking to spend.  This one was his choice but I have to say it was one of his best.   The beef was simple, super flavorful and dipped just the right amount.  Fries are crinkle cut, not typically my fave but these stayed crunchy all the way until we got home, 15 min ride.   Also, the cheese sauce with fries is a must, yes it&#39;s just a cheese sauce like any other but for some reason it was great with these extra crispy fries.  We got the 9inch beef and split it and it was a perfect amount for us and split a large fry.  The best part of all was our dinner was $12.55, we will be back and likely sooner than later!!"

From the first bite I was blown away by the delicious flavor of the beef. They season their beef perfectly,  not too overpowering nor too bland. The juice was definitely a perfect compliment to the flavorful beef. The meat was tender, yum. The giardinera was ok, the pieces lacked the crunch that goes along with the flavor, in my opinion.

While strolling around The Loop trying to decide on lunch I came across the Döner Men food truck and decided to give it a try - it was a fine lunch.

The truck itself will certainly catch your eye and the menu (large w/ big pictures and helpful descriptions) helps draw you in. The staff was... fine; not overly friendly but not bad at all.

I had the Döner Box and it was very tasty. It had chicken and lettuce and fries, tomatoes and onions and... I don&#39;t even know what else was in there but it was pretty tasty. In fact, the sauces help to add flavor but it&#39;s the ingredients that really make this thing.

The one issue I have, and I have this issue with almost every food truck, is that the prices do not seem to reflect the portion size you receive. The Döner Men truck is no stand out from the others: tasty food but small portion for the price. My lunch appetite is usually very sizable and that tends to keep me away from most food trucks. Every once in a while I give a new one a shot but, like my experience here, the visits are few and far between because the food is usually not insanely outstanding that I&#39;d want to double-down on the order. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be giving this truck another shot."

I got the Döner box just because it seemed like it was a good combination of everything they had to offer. I am still not really sure what I ate, but it was pretty good.  The truck seems to be fusion-y with German and Mediterranean like foods.  The Döner box had flavorful chicken kebob, fresh crisp lettuce, tomatoes, onions, delicious crispy fries, and homemade white and red sauce.  All on point and blends perfectly together.  Also, they lay the food in the box in a picture perfect manner (important for us asian food pic takers)

The portions and price are typical of what you would expect from a Chicago food truck.  It&#39;s about half the portion for the same price as Benjyehuda (reminds me of a box from there but cleaner and with less mushy vegetables).  The Döner box portion is actually a perfect size since Benjye bowls can be split into two meals. If they were the same price I would choose Donermen over that any day."

It is sad to say that what these guys offer is by no stretch even close to the German/Berlin original. 

While I understand that there is room for international interpretation of the food + americanization of certain foods, you shouldn&#39;t advertise to sell &#34;iconic German street food and cuisine&#34; especially the famous Curry Wurst that tasted nothing like the original.

Overall both the Döner and the Curry Wurst lacked the bold flavor and texture you will experience from the Original, while the Doner was bland and flavorless.

Back I am to the never ending search to find food close or similar to the taste of Berlin Germany as Dönermen did not deliver.

These guys are cool - no BS, tattoo bearing, down to earth and down to business cool. And now they are good with two items I frequent:
Döner kebab

Their version of the kebabs are a bit more planty than I usually go for, but its still a good kebab nonetheless - veggies like cherry tomatoes, Romaine lettuce, beets, with some chicken and tzatziki sauce. All excellent, crunchy and full of taste.

I initially went for the kebab but fell in love with the Döner Box, aka the Box. It does away of the wrap and gives you a bed of fries on the bottom. Yum! Had the Box since.

These guys have some soft drinks of which I never heard but are delicious: Dang! Butterscotch Root Beer and Cheerwine. Horrible for my diabetes, but hey, I&#39;ll choose a slightly shorter life span for an enjoyable life and tastes than a dull long life.

DönerMen food truck stops nearby 600 West Chicago Avenue, in the car park across the street on Larrabee Avenue from the so called Groupon building. Cash or cards can do. They serve 600 West and area at least once a week, occasionally more.

Mind the d20."

The sauce was a little salty, but still delicious. My plate was clean in a matter of minutes. I&#39;m already looking forward to trying the doner kebab. 

As a word to the wise, their potato salad is served cold. For whatever reason, the guy in front of me thought it ought to be served hot. When has ANYONE ever had hot potato salad? Anyway, without giving any attitude, the cashier immediately apologized and refunded the man. Overall the staff was great, and I really hope Doner Men comes to visit me again.

I ordered the Currywurst and I was so amazed at how delicious it was. I&#39;ve never had Currywurst before so I may not be the best judge but the wurst and curry sauce tasted like something I&#39;ve never tried before! The curry was sweet but not in a bad way.

I&#39;ve been searching for a Berlin döner for years here in the states. Living in Berlin for over 10 years may have spoiled me. The currywurst &amp; döners are nothing like the authentic food trucks in Berlin. So if you want authentic Berliner eats, it&#39;s not here. My döner was more pita &amp; lettuce than anything. It reminded me more of a Turkish Pizza than a Döner. The Curry Ketchup sauce was watered down &amp; lacked enough curry flavoring. It was a bummer. But the customer service was great!

I actually really liked their fries, which probably isn&#39;t the staple here but they were good. The chicken was spit roasted and probably some of the best chicken I&#39;ve ever had (as good as chicken can get I suppose not deep fat fried LOL). Both the sauces were awesome and super flavorful!

Large pieces of flavorful chicken, hand-cut crispy fries, bright fresh salad with a light dressing. The biggest surprise was the goat cheese tzatziki sauce.

I tried the Doenermen food stand  at the Christkindlmarkt. I am sorry to say I was a bit disappointed. I was expecting the real thing. 

First, they only have the option of durum doener which looks like a burrito. I don&#39;t mind it, but personally, I enjoy the doener that comes in the flatbread. 

The meat isn&#39;t the rotating meat thingy you see at doener shops. I&#39;m not sure how it was cooked. 

One positive was the sauce, they got that right. 

Overall, it just wasn&#39;t the authentic German doener I was expecting based on the advertisement.

IMHO, the closest thing to German doener in Chicago can be found at SP Kebab in Rogers Park. 

It&#39;s not perfect, but closer to the real thing.

We checked with the host, and she tried telling us that we never checked in or let her know our party had arrived! We assured her we did, but it didn&#39;t seem to matter much, so we waited some more...this time with a buzzer. Now it&#39;s 8:25 so I followed up again and the other host actually told us that our table was still sitting, but another opened up that she thought they were giving to ANOTHER PARTY! I asked her if they too had been waiting since 8pm, and she mentioned they had an 8:30 reservation. BAD SERVICE ALERT! finally a manager came over and quickly got us a table.

Looking past the initial service, our food was wonderful. For appetizers we shared the ropa Vieja, guac, and charcuterie board. The ropa vieja was truly amazing, highly recommend!

Was celebrating a bday dinner.  The ambiance is fun and very colorful and eclectic.  One downfall to all that is the noise, it&#39;s quite noisy and the musics a bit loud to carry on a conversation, but it&#39;s fun nonetheless.  Drinks were good and mine was strong which is always a bonus.  Started off with the octopus and the coconut shrimp.  Octopus I would never order again, it was slimy and just was not to my liking.  The coconut shrimp was great.  Great crust on it, not overly cooked, great chutney and sauces on it, was delicious.   I ended up with the snapper which was delicious that came on a bed of baby carrots and fingerling potatoes and he had the short rib which was braised beautifully and just melted.  Not a big red meat eater, but that tasted great to me.  That came on a bed of either risotto or grits which were super rich.  We ordered the brussel sprouts which were outstanding with this unbelievable corn with it and also the plantains which again were amazing...salivating writing this portion of the review.  We ended the night with 2 desserts, some apple crumbling pie a la mode which was good, but then we got the cigar mousse dish and that disappointed a bit.  It came out in a box that was steaming to mimic smoke coming out of a cigar, and it tasted smokey and all, aesthetically it was fun to see, but the taste wasn&#39;t all there. 

I would definitely recommend for something different, food&#39;s diverse enough to cater too vegans to meat eaters with a twist on latin food."

Came here with some friends for a bday dinner.. We got sat in the very back of the restaurant like we had the plague ..our server was nice but scarce and we had a bunch of fruit flies harassing us all night .. 

Let me start off by saying, I felt like we payed fine dining prices for carne asada plates.. 
 
Appetizers: 
we ordered the Ropa Vieja (the highlight of the night) small crispy tacos with tender shredded beef. Delish. The ceviche mixto.. 3-4 small samples of ceviche... $25 for literally samples (PASS ON THIS) And an order of the calamari was good, and crunchy.
Dinner: I ordered the Arrachera which was tasty, tender and a decent size, but literally a big chunk of carne asada, Definitely not worth the $30 price .. My boyfriend ordered the Vaca Frita, which was also good, with a side of black beans and white rice .. Tasty.. But again, not worth the price .. 

Overall, we enjoyed our dinner, but service sucked .. We waited 15-20 min per server visit, waited another 20 min to get our check.. and server gave us a hard time about splitting .. It was well over $500 dinner, and again.. We waited another 20 min for the server to return our checks.

The only reason I can&#39;t give this place 5 stars is because there was something missing a bit in terms of the atmosphere, which may not be Carnivale&#39;s fault; it may have been our conference booking out the entire restaurant and not being able to fill it up.

Thanks to Yelp, I practically knew the menu by heart. Even after seeing the vibrant, Latin inspired pictures, I was overly impressed with the up close and personal vibrancy this restaurant offered. It was beautiful. The server was very knowledgeable, professional and polite, but interestingly insisted the most expensive items on the menu were the &#34;must-try&#39;s.&#34;  After trying the recommended almost $30 cocktail, and it was underwhelming, I decided to stick to the Yelp recommendations. 
We had the ropa veja appetizer, which was delicious and so tender, it practically melted in your mouth. I had the arrachera, which was amazing. The chimichurri sauce was great. My husband had lamb chops me which I think were seasonal, but they were DELICIOUS!!!! I will definitely return."

Staff is very friendly and attentive. Atmosphere is mind blowing. Prices are fair- we went for brunch and everything was 10$-20$. Had the bloody mary bar (14$) I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the mix but was cool set up. Shared the bacon wrapped dates (were standard). I had the brisket skillet (14.5$ and excellent) my boyfriend had the Benedict eggs (14$ and good). We ordered two cocktails that were the coffee press I believe and they were a nice after dinner drink. Would return just would try dinner. Staff is attentive and friendly and the lady who worked Halloween brunch who is manager is wonderful-so kind and helpful!
carnivale-chicago-2,Sarah S.,QnIrewrXxFnssw_gG1gF-Q,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,3529,24,ADuNUsXjTaY6pVpjcxdKhg,3.0,2016-08-09,"My boyfriend has been eyeing this place for ages from the highway and always commenting on how he wondered what it was like inside &amp; wanted to try it out. For his birthday, I booked us a dinner there and we tried it up! 

Upon walking in you&#39;re met with bright colors everywhere and insanely loud music. There was a live band and dancers right by the hosting stand. It was fun to see the dancers but that music was ear piercing and we couldn&#39;t communicate at all while waiting for our table. We hoped hard that we weren&#39;t seated anywhere near the band and thankfully we weren&#39;t. The atmosphere here is loud &amp; vibrant and on a Friday night, I counted 6 bachelorette parties...and I have a feeling more were lurking.

I have a small obsession with cheese plates so had my eye on the platter to start off with. It was a very solid plate with three cheeses, grapes and honey. Those three ingredients are a winning combination for me. Three cheeses were included - a bleu cheese, harder cheese not sure what it was, and a butter like cheese. All were good, loved them all and couldn&#39;t stop eating this $16 starter. The Ropa Vieja seemed really strange to me. Well...I should say didn&#39;t sound appetizing to me because the name means Old Clothes in Spanish...so....not too sure why they call it this but it&#39;s supposedly one of their most popular appetizer items. For $13, you get 5 braised brisket tacos in hard shells topped with plantains, malanga, aji amarillo aioli and queso fresco. I liked this dish, didn&#39;t love it. I did love the Tacos de Pescado (ie tempura cod fish tacos) for $12. These 3 little guys were topped with a vigorón slaw and chipotle aioli making them just delicious, albiet slightly soggy from the toppings.

Side note: Valet parking is $7 + tip but if you aren&#39;t late like us, I&#39;m sure you could find a parking spot with a little hunting. 

Pro-Tip: Lighting sucks for food pron...sorry but it just ain&#39;t gonna happen here.

Maybe I expect too much but I noted it was his birthday on our reservation, they even asked about it and we still had to wait 20 minutes past our reservation, were seated between two big drunk bachelorette parties, no one said happy bday and they didn&#39;t do anything special like a dessert or anything for him. Lame. Service was fine and attentive though nothing extraordinary.

Very loud atmosphere and not quite my scene but for those in college, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a ton of fun to be here! Service is fine though nothing wonderful, food is pricey but overall very good. Will I come back? Sure --- though only if others would like to. I&#39;m happy I can finally point at Carnivale from the highway and claim I&#39;ve dined there after millions of years of passing it."

Food:

We had the empanadas, tacos and the ceviche. The empanadas and the tacos were great and definitely the star. A great start that quickly dwindled.  The ceviche was nothing special with lack of flavor. For the main course we had the salmon and the arracherra. The salmon was good nothing special. The arracherra was great and probably the best choice. The drinks were ok but over priced. Had the strawberry thyme which was ok. We also flies all over our table that we couldn&#39;t figure out where they were coming from. 

Service:

Our waiter would take at least 20 minutes each time he would walk away. We sat there waiting for him than him waiting on us. Our meal could have been an hour but because of his lack of customer service it took 2 hours. He wouldn&#39;t split the bill either and had to do the math for him to split the bill. 

Overall, I wouldn&#39;t recommend to come eat here. There are better options in Chicago with better service and better food."
carnivale-chicago-2,Larry C.,SQQ2WKFVpTdh7qQm3CGbkA,"Wheeling, IL",0,1,0,0,223,e6RygvDC1FLT1ZFymgXd3Q,5.0,2016-10-17,"I am a foodie of the first order.  I enjoy all different cuisines and especially like to be treated like a guest at the restaurants I attend.  This is a top flight selection for anytime you want to have a great meal that is not your typical fish/steak dinner routine.  Last night I took my girlfriend there for dinner for her birthday.  I had been there once before, and really enjoyed it last time

This time exceeded even my lofty expectations.  The atmosphere is exciting.  Colorful, bright, very high ceilings.  Happy servers and attendees.  It&#39;s just a great place.  The menu is a south american fusion menu.  Lots of meat, some fish and veggie options.  I am a ceviche lover, and the tuna Ceviche was glorious.  (My girlfriend&#39;s first taste of Ceviche, and she loved it.)  Fresh, sushi grade tuna, with a wonderful tangy sauce, served on a tostada.  Perfect.  

For me, the presentation is nearly as important as the flavors, and every dish looked just perfect, and so appetizing, that we couldn&#39;t wait to dive in.  As an additional starter, we ordered their beet salad.  I will admit that I&#39;m not a great fan of beets, but there was an herbal goat cheese accompaniment with it, and a light dressing that made it delish.  Certainly something I would order again (surprise!!).  

Our waiter was Jorge, a wonderfully friendly helpful guy who happened to be the sommelier as well.  Since I&#39;m a wino (a more friendly term for me than oenophile) he was wonderful in helping us find the right wine.  As I balked at a Melbac blend for the veggie and fish we were going to eat, he came up with a Pinot Nior that was not on the list that was an exceptional choice.  Bravo, Jorge.

Our entree selections consisted of their Yucatan Salmon and the Vegetarian Tacu Tacu.  I could spend an hour writing my praises of these dishes.  They were done perfectly, and with the Tacu Tacu, I&#39;m going to swear that I didn&#39;t miss the meat.  

What are you looking for in a dinner?  Pleasing to the eye, flavors that are nuanced, innovative and surprising to the palate, variety on the plate to add something new to each bite, sufficient volume to satisfy your appetite.  Yup, that&#39;s what we got.  Each dish had a surprisingly bright sauce that just exploded in your mouth with the food.  The salmon was done perfectly, moist, tasty, and fork tender.  The rice and lentil base of the Tacu Tacu was crunchy and tender at the same time, with fingerling potatoes, and purple and orange carrots..  The pea curry sauce lit up my taste buds and brought a smile to my face so broad that my girlfriend looked at me and said, &#34;What?&#34;  

The dinner was wonderful.  Absolutely.

For dessert, we had the Chocolate Dome with White and Dark Chocolate Mousse.  My girlfriend isn&#39;t a fan of white chocolate, but I convinced her that if the Chef, who had made every dish so wonderful up to that point, decided that this white chocolate mousse was up to his standards, who were we to argue?  So that&#39;s what we got.  The dark chocolate dome was probably 6 inches high, and Jorge slowly poured a hot chocolate sauce over the center of it, melting the dome, and causing it to crumble in to reveal the twin mousses (or is that mice?) in the center with the strawberry sorbet.  The white chocolate mousse didn&#39;t disappoint.  

As we savored the dessert and the remaining wine in our glasses, my Park Chicago meter expired at the end of the shortest two hours I have EVER spent.  I added another half hour, and we continued.  

It was a truly delightful evening, delicious food in a wonderfully bright and entertaining environment, with a great waiter and sommelier that made the evening perfect.  This is now our new favorite restaurant in the city.  Jorge, we will be seeing you again soon.  Find me a great bottle of wine to go with our next meal."

I love the dim lighting and bright colours. You honestly feel like you&#39;ve been transported somewhere els when you walk into the restaurant. Perfect for a date or ladies night. It would also make an amazing night club. 

The service was great I don&#39;t have any complaints. They were very professional, organized and prompt. There was no personal touch or wow factor to push it over the edge. 

The food was good and beautifully presented. Again the food didn&#39;t wow me or make me think days later I&#39;m craving that amazing xyz from carnivale. However, the drinks were strong (which is always good) after my second I was feeling a buzz which is rare. I also like that they offer caramel popcorn topped with cotton candy for birthdays. Thats a fun treat to share. The sugar used to make the caramel to coat the popcorn was burnt and I could taste the bitterness in the caramel but overall it was still a good experience.

I would definitely come back here. They have an extensive drink selection and cool desserts so I&#39;ll be back to try some more. I&#39;ve posted some pics and videos on ig @britanysbites"

Everything&#39;s basically the same as I remember it.  The vibe, decor, etc.

But the food was actually really good...who knew?!?!  I don&#39;t even remembering liking it this much back 10years ago!

The Chicago food scene is so good that this was the least favourite place I went during my trip!! The bar is set very high.

I had the ceviche sampler and salad ... My colleagues had everything from the chicken to the steak.  I would say the flavours were good but nothing terribly memorable.  The portions were very generous and perhaps that&#39;s part of the draw.  My office mates likes the sangrias and ordered a few of them.

The one drawback compared to the other Chicago restaurants was the unknowledgeable staff... A few staff members had zero clue what was the dish on the menu.  It was very surprising.  Also, our main server seemed so artificially robotic.  He wasn&#39;t rude but it seemed so rehearsed and disinterested.  

Overall crazy environment with decent food that won&#39;t break the bank.  Would I return... No.  Far too many interesting and better restaurants!"

My friend and I were sitting at the lounge  area by the entrance right across the bar. I love all the unique and comfy seating they provided. Very cozy and welcoming. The cocktails were amazing. We ordered a couple cocktails/martini and they were crazy good. I have a bad memory with names of  food/drinks I ordered, lol sorry, please see my picture and show it to the server, It&#39;s a magenta color with a mango puree in it, I highly recommended this drink.

The service was polite and was just perfect with some great food and drink suggestions. We ordered only one appetizer, grilled octopus and it was something to die for.

However there is a spacious bar at the front while walking in. The first room is grand and has interesting decorative items on display all around as well. I&#39;m sure other yelpers have provided photos for such research to enjoy. The menu is decent in terms of selection. The food is great. My meal consisted of the Summer Shrimp and Peruvian Ceviche. Not the standard entrée but I was able to try that for the price of an entrée. I nonetheless could not finish the meal. We had an appetizer which was a bit messy but still great to taste.

This place is cool and hip... spilling and sprawling all over the place with cute nooks and crannies... the ambiance and service is nice. I liked that it has multiple rooms and levels, with different vibes for each area. It was fun exploring, even.

FOOD
Decent but over-priced for sure, the Paella I ordered was so-so at best, I am not a fan of risotto mushy oatmeally rice... I prefer the kind that is more Spanish or whatever which is more stir-fried in consistency, and at $30, should have been way more tasty... the seafood in it was MEH as well.

The Guac and chips were great except they were not complimentary. I quickly picked the Ceviche, steak, and cheese cake from the prefixed menu. Ceviche was again very interesting. Have diced apple and shorbet on the top. Pretty soup. Fish tasted good. The whole combination was prety unique.

Steak with rice and bean was awesome. Steak was cooking for a long time so it was very tendor. I didn&#39;t even need a knife to cut it. Love this one.

Cheese cake was nicely presented with a decent portion. It was just a bit too sweet for me.So I saved some for my afternoon coffee.

Anywho, our server was really nice. He was attentive and actually acted as a &#34;guide&#34; for us while we went upstairs and all around the other sections carnivale. He was very knowledgeable about the menu too. We got the mango mojitos to start, and they were delicious! It wasn&#39;t overly sweet, but you can taste the mango flavor. We ordered a guacamole to start, and it was good. The chips it came with aren&#39;t too oily or salty. I got two appetizers for my meal: the ropa vieja and the mixto ceviche. Both were excellent. The ropa vieja was tender and juicy. The ceviche seemed really fresh. My friend got the tacu tacu, and she really liked it. The curry gave the dish a small hint of coconut, and that really made the dish tasty.

We were wayyy too full to get dessert, but the cotton candy one looked awesome.

My very good friend brought me here for my birthday, and I was so impressed by the decor, the food, and the service. I also love their location in the West Loop. 

Carnivale is a colorful, festive restaurant and boasts Latin inspired dishes by chef Rodolfo Cuadros, with South American, Southeast Asian, European, and Caribbean influences. 

The Ropa Vieja (braised brisket, sweet plantain, malanga, aji amarillo aioli, queso fresco) is easily in the top five best foods I have ever eaten. 

The Arrachera was delicious, the Arroz Con Mariscos was generous and served with a full head-on prawn. 

The Espresso Tres Leches was excellent, and organic cotton candy fun and very yummy. I haven&#39;t had cotton candy since I was a kid! 

We were there before the holidays so the entire restaurant was decorated with a fun and festive mix of Christmas trees and ornaments. 

Definitely a favorite restaurant of mine."

The food was just OK - we had the lamb shank, a couple of apps and the guacamole was good. Good drink selection and maybe we would have been better off with the braised ribs, shrimp or scallops.

We had a reservation at 8.30, but we went there early. As soon as walked in , we were greeted and seated right away at the bar. I had a mojito; the bar tender made it effortlessly and it was super delicious. 

After that we moved into the grand hall. It resembled the building in Cuba, colorful interior with plants and Latin music at the background. The waiters we&#39;re extremely nice and even remembered that I requested water without ice when they refilled.

We group of six ordered bunch of appetizers to share. The Calamari stood out. Tuna Ceviche was Ok, again tuna is not a good choice for ceviche. We all had different mains. I ordered the Latin version of the paella. It was Ok. The rice was done right, however it lacked the flavor. Shrimps were smaller, would have been nicer if they have used jumbo shrimp. May be its different from the spanish version, it didn&#39;t have the socarrat. 

Oh the desert menu was good and their take on the tiramisu was really good. Also they have a decent selections of wine.

If you feel fancy and wanna check out something that&#39;s not mainstream American check this out. I would definitely visit again."

I&#39;ve been driving by it for years and always wanted to check it out. We had an 8:45 reservation and were given a pager upon arrival. The hostess skirted around the question when I asked how long we&#39;d have to wait; luckily it ended up being only about 10 minutes. We were greeted a few minutes after being seated by a very friendly waitress who provided food recommendations and was helpful (service is not the problem here). We started with mojitos and margaritas which the group agreed were underwhelming. The appetizers, coconut shrimp and an order of guac and chips, came out promptly. They were DELICIOUS so we were ready to be blown away by our entrees. Unfortunately the entire table was disappointed in our main courses; we could have gone to a cheap Mexican restaurant for better-tasting food and paid way less. The vaca frita was beyond dry despite being &#34;known for its juiciness&#34;. The lamb was undercooked and practically inedible according to our guests. So next we were ready for dessert. We have a birthday in our group so they brought out the cotton candy - amazing. That was by far the group favorite. We also ordered the chocolate dome. It looked delicious and was presented well. When they bring it out, they pour chocolate sauce on it and the dome melts down to a small portion. The chocolate part of it tasted great but the strawberry sorbet side was left untouched by the group after one bite. We also ordered the Cuban cigar which was my personal favorite. It is presented in a steaming cigar box which gave it the perfect amount of smoked flavor. Overall, I&#39;d say the ambiance and service are great.

Ok back to my review. The decor was festive and fun with a lot of cool furniture. The staff was mostly smiley and engaging. The food....? Delicious! There was a buffet of freshly prepared Mexican cuisine and the guests were tearing that stuff up! Jicama, mango and cucumber salad with a spicy kick....check! Delicious black beans and rice.....check! Plantains that were so flavorful and prepared just right.....check! That chicken though. Wow. I&#39;m not sure what the sauce was, but I can tell you that it wasn&#39;t overpowering or too much anything. So tender and delicious. The steak was equally delish. There was a bowl with a humongous mound of guacamole....I went so hard on that stuff. Ridiculous. And of course, fresh, warmed tortillas, and chips and salsa rounded out the meal. 

I had a margarita as well and it was good. Nothing spectacular but the service made it all worth it. Next time I&#39;ll have to try the flan.....I thought I read someplace that they have a decent one."

Before coming to Chicago I was searching for a restaurant for my birthday and came across Carnivale. The pictures were intriguing and although it had mixed reviews I wanted to give it a shot, and boy am I glad I did!!!!!!!!

We made reservations and arrived around 9 walking into the most colorful vibrant Latin ambience. We still had to wait 20 minutes for a table to open which wasn&#39;t bad considering it was a Saturday night. After being seated we were promptly greeted by our wonderful entertaining waiter whose name I wish I could remember (Brandon maybe?). My order consisted of the Senator&#39;s chicken and for desert I had the chocolate dome, and of course the free cotton candy with caramel popcorn for being the birthday princess. One bite of the food and I fell more in love than I already was. I couldn&#39;t tell you what it was other than you have to try it to know. My friend also was in love with her food choice (I don&#39;t remember, sorry) after her first bite.

This place is so different from any other restaurants I have gone to and would recommend it a million times to anyone asking for a good place to celebrate something. Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll convince my future husband to have our wedding here :)"

I like the ambiance the most. It&#39;s called Carnivale for a reason. Staff is friendly and I had a good experience here for an anniversary dinner. Don&#39;t be scared to dress up or dress down-it&#39;s really for any occasion like a night out with the girls or a fancy date.

Only downside I had was my waitress was no where near a Sommelier. I asked what wines she recommended and it was like she gave me the basics:
&#34;We have a good merlot, or or a pinot or a cab-&#34; noooo really?! Def expected a little more than the Trader Joe basics.

Another downside? Depending on where you sit, you can be buried in the back corner arm and arm to the table next to you. I didn&#39;t have a good time with the obnoxious pretentious millennials next to me-I tried to tune them out trust me when I say it was next to impossible. Moral of story? Ask for a booth.

Overall, the food was excellent. Steak is really good and cooked the way you ask. We had the empanadas and they were pretty good too. Downside? The price -vs- portions but I say it&#39;s worth it once in a blue moon. I haven&#39;t been here in over a year already-It&#39;s literal when I say once in a blue moon."

I made a reservation for Sunday brunch here through open table and it turned out to be exactly what I wanted out of a restaurant called &#34;Carnivale&#34;. Everything about the restaurant is colorful, exciting, and over the top (like a Carnival lol). There was live music, they have a blood mary bar, and they offer several different mimosa packages. I forgot which package we picked exactly, but we had table side service and an assortment of juices to choose from. 

I had the Fried Egg Sandwich, a couple mimosas, the Cotton Candy Martini, and a cocktail called Buenas Noches, if I remember correctly. My food was great and the cocktails were even better. The Cotton Candy Martini comes in a really pretty glass and is nowhere near as sweet as you would think. We also ordered calamari and the chips and guac to start. 

We came with a party of 6, I changed the size of the reservation approximately 300 times, and our entire party didn&#39;t arrive promptly, but they were still accommodating. Can&#39;t wait to return for dinner :)"

When you walk in, all the colors and festivity take over and the atmosphere is very fun, if not a bit dark. We were seated in the main dining room and the waiter was very attentive and friendly, offering suggestions and answering any questions. My friend ordered the cotton candy cocktail, which was very sweet tasting but the presentation was cool. I got the sangria and really enjoyed it.

For food, I got the amish chicken and it was pretty good - at least, I devoured it. My friend got the ropa vieja and that had me regretting my entree choice after I tried a bite. I also think we were supposed to have bread as it looked like all the other tables did. Overall, good food, and good service and I&#39;m glad I tried it, although I probably won&#39;t be a regular here."

It&#39;s a trip to Cuba, Brazil , Costa Rica and Chile without leaving the city of Chicago! Festive and whimsical decorations make the ambience    Muy divertido!

Main courses - seafood (mariscos) , scallops and skirt steak - blew our minds and made our taste buds do the rhumba!

The desserts are amazing the chocolate mousse and cotton candy with Carmelized popcorn is not only festive it brings you back to a simpler time as a child celebrating all things sugary and sweet! 

The highlights though we&#39;re the cotton candy martinis , the chocolate mousse cake , the scallops , ropa vieja tacos and arroz mariscos.  Sabor de hispanoamerica fabulosa!"

It&#39;s massive, extremely flamboyant and fun and actually maintains an authentic feel. The colors, furniture, pictures and sheer size of this place are all worth experiencing on their own, and although you are one of many people in many rooms being served, you won&#39;t feel neglected, and their kitchen moves at a good pace. 

We went for Chef&#39;s week and therefore had the prefix menu: Lobster Empanada, Mariscada (saffron rice with clams, mussels, a lobster tail and claw and whitefish), Short Rib a la Brasa, and Rhubarb Tart. Although these aren&#39;t standard dishes, the two entrees have close relatives on the normal menu, and the tart may be in the seasonal pie rotation.

First, every dish was cleverly conceived, the foods were very fresh, cooked perfectly, and covered in delicious sauces and spices. If possible, the lobster empanada should absolutely join their all-star lineup of standard menu items. The Mariscada had a piece of whitefish that I&#39;m assuming was bred and raised in a tank of butter. My boyfriend, whose a picky, East Coast-born seafood snob, was surprised by how well the lobster, clams and mussels were all prepared. Although I don&#39;t care much for rice, I was even impressed by the saffron rice. The braised short ribs were everything you could ever want in this great cut of meat, the accompanying charred vegetables and leak puree were worth ordering by themselves, and the Rhubarb tart filling in the dessert was both delicious to a sugar addict (me), and one apathetic to its allure (my boyfriend).   

Besides the Caesar salad (boring) I desperately want to try every single thing on their menu. I&#39;ll be back...a lot."

We got the cotton candy martini &amp; coconut mojito. The grapefruit &amp; lime with the cotton candy was a nice mix. The food however was mediocre.  We ordered the summer shrimp ceviche &amp; coconut shrimp. Both were good but not great.  We also ordered the Arrachera skirt steak..it came highly recommended by waiter but sauce was overpowering and entre was just okay. Service was also slow and erratic.

I started with the ropa vieja appetizer which was delicious. For my entrée I had the Paella, but they changed the type of rice they use so I guess it&#39;s called something else now because of that change. For dessert I had the chocolate dome cake. It was fun watching the chocolate sauce melt the dome and coat the dessert that was inside it (2 types of mousse, and sorbet). Overall,  I had a pretty good experience and I can&#39;t wait to go back for more ropa viejas and dessert!"

From the moment you walk in, you can feel the energy and life coming from the vibrant colors, intriguing paintings, and music. The music&#39;s volume wasn&#39;t too overpowering so you can still talk to each other without yelling. 

Our waiter was very attentive and extensive with the menu. He went out of his way to make sure that we received exactly what we wanted. Despite the busyness of the night, he was friendly and on point. 

However the food wasn&#39;t as amazing as the place itself. It&#39;s pretty much average if you&#39;ve been to awesome hole in the wall places. I ordered the arrecherra and enjoyed it. Everything was cooked right. The ceviche was yummy too. But not out of this world amazing. 

A good place for a date! If there&#39;s ever moments of awkward silence, at least you can enjoy the music and decor."

Initially when we walked in, we were somewhat skeptical because the place was pretty empty. But I think maybe because it was a Monday evening and people had to work the next day, plus it wasn&#39;t an event night. 

However, once we were greeted by our server, Antonio, and started getting our food, we now have no reservations about our love for this place! We ordered a Ropa Vieja for an appetizer, which was these really good brisket mini tacos. Definitely teased our appetites because we were so excited waiting for our main courses. I ordered a paella and my boyfriend ordered the short rib steak, though we both kind of shared the entrees. Both were really delicious, and I would definitely go back again. I&#39;m big on paella having that crust at the bottom, and this one definitely had it. Neither of us ordered alcohol that night just because we weren&#39;t feeling it, but the tables around us all had really fun looking drinks!

At the end of our meal, I really wanted the organic cotton candy since I saw a lot of others with it at their table. Antonio (our server) hooked us up and gave it to us on the house since we were first timers! Such a nice gesture :) Anyway, I was extremely pleased with my first experience with Carnivale, and I&#39;ll definitely try heading back on one of their event nights!"

Place is also so beautiful and huge! You will never know unless you come inside. I used to drive by it so many times and think like its some awful place as I don&#39;t like the way it looks outside, but my friend talked me into going there! Omg, ever since I can&#39;t be grateful enough! I probably would work a little more on the drink menu, as I was not impressed by it ( I am a bartender though) but foooooooood!!!! DAAAAAMN !!!

To make your experience priceless with 100% certainty do this :
Ask for Horacio, a bold guy, he is a bartender who works the lounge as well. The best service I have ever gotten there. Also you can never go wrong with empanadas, mushrooms ( I ate there more mushrooms than during my all lifetime), and skirt steak ! With a glass of Malbec ( I think it&#39;s called Decado) you will have an experience you are craving for. 
Desert : cotton candy, chocolate dome or tres leches. 


Did I mention don&#39;t forget to dress up, as much as you want, and you will still fit perfectly fine! This place is the BOMB!!!! 

Thank you soooooooo much !"

We entered Carnivale and the person we thought was the host came over and said there was a private party.... except that the restaurant seemed open.  We later determined that this person was the coat check attendee who was really really intent on taking coats.

The restaurant was totally open (no party to be seen in the bar area), so we sat at the bar and were quickly greeted.  We ordered a few glasses of wine and some snacks.  The snacks didn&#39;t come out quite right, but they did comp us some guacamole (the mystery item that appeared).  The guacamole and calamari were tasty.

Service was friendly, but a little slow, considering we were sitting at the bar.  However, we weren&#39;t in a hurry, so it worked out ok.

Decent spot with pretty good food.  The atmosphere is more &#39;friends outing&#39; than date night, but good for a night out with friends."

I did go there once before many years ago but we ate outside as it was summertime and didn&#39;t really get to appreciate the full magnitude of what I consider to be one of my favorite dining experiences. 

First of all I want to start by saying if you have never been to Carnivale you need to experience it.  Carnivale in every way is a first class experience.  Everything from the restaurant ambiance, to the food and service is stellar.  

Carnival is located on Fulton street right off of the Kennedy expressway in a building that looks like a converted warehouse.  The outside has large colored letters with the name of the restaurant that can be seen from the expressway.  There is a smaller building on the side that was an add on to the main building that serves as an entrance.  As you enter Carnivale you go upstairs into a hall your eyes are drawn to the black and white striping on the ceiling.  The corridor is lined with wood paneling and artwork.  As you turn the corner and continue down the hallway where there is a continuation of the wood paneling and artwork.  you come into a beautiful large reception/bar area.  The bar itself is a large curved bar very tastefully decorated with wood panels &amp; granite countertop.  Behind the bar there is a full height display of all the liquor available displayed on glass shelves &amp; mirrored walls behind the shelves.  The lighting in this area is very tastefully done with glass chandeliers, candles on the bar and down lights above the glass shelves that illuminate the shelves with the liquor displayed for all to see.

From there you go into a large colorful 2 story dining area.  This area is spectacular with a whole array of items to catch your eye.  The lighting is so cool.  They have checkered lighting panels on the ceiling with a whole color assortment that are back lit &amp; pendant type light fixtures wrapped in an assortment of colored fabrics that give a nice soft lighting effect &amp; bring a beautiful color arrangement into the room that catch your eyes.  There also colored wall sconces wrapped in the same motif of colored fabrics.  The walls are also colored in multicolored vertical color stripes with an assortment of pieces of art decorating the walls.  

After we were seated we waited for our server to come and take our order.  This was a little and the only glitch in the evening.  It seems like the area where we were seated was straddling two servers so not knowing neither one came to take our order.  Once this was brought to their attention Sharon (manager) came over a apologized profusely for the mix up.  She was a very sweet lady and as far as I&#39;m concerned no harm no foul on what was an incredible dining experience.

Oh yeah the food.  Well it was getting late and I needed to be up at 4am (yuk) the next morning so we didn&#39;t eat.  YEAH RIGHT just kidding.  We decided to keep it light and since Kim had been there a number of times I let her do the ordering.  She did a great job everything was delicious.  We ordered 4 appetizers which proved to me more then enough and had left overs to boot.  
* Guacamole - the seasoning was awesome
* Shrimp Quesadillas - Very simple yet very good, cheese, shrimp, arugula, chipotle and tortillas, melts in your mouth.
* Ropa Vieja - Braised Brisket with sweet plantains, malanga, aji Amarillo, aioli and queso fresco in miniature hard shell tacos
*Tacos de Pescado - This was by far my favorite dish.    This had fried tempura cod, vigoron slaw (lime &amp; cabbage slaw), &amp; chipotle aioli.  OMG to die for.  The flavoring the crunch of the tempura cod and vigoron slaw.  I savored every bite of this dish.

They also brought a glass filled with caramel corn with a paper stem and cotton candy with a little birthday candle. (Nice touch).  Unfortunately I didn&#39;t touch it as I am trying to cut sugar from my diet and lose weight.  It didn&#39;t go to waste though I gave it to 4 girls sitting at the table next to me. (2 wanted it &amp; 2 didn&#39;t)

Would I go back again NAH.  Are you F--in kidding me I would go back in a heart beat.  Everything about this restaurant from the ambiance to the food is stellar.  Thanks Kim for a great evening"

I was greeted (or rather received with no expression) by the hostess and was seated in a corner next to women&#39;s restroom. The restaurant was empty and there was plenty of space available for them to seat me. 

The ambiance was dingy and dark. Like a run down cheap casino with a tropical theme.

My waitress didn&#39;t have a smile on her face nor did she bother to explain the menu to me. This place does not deserve to be $$$. She was fumbling with getting my food.

Now the food, I ordered a chicken dish which was dripped in a variety of sauces. The chicken ended up being soggy and unsavory. 

I would strongly advice against this restaurant."

Tbh it&#39;s probably the main attraction for me. This is not to say the the food isn&#39;t good because it absolutely is but wow hats off to whoever designed this place .

Parking is valet;  complimentary  last time I went on a Monday for lunch though it is has been roughly 5 dollars other times I&#39;ve gone. There is street parking as well.

The environment again will grab you soon as you enter . Vibrant colors and Latin based music playing. I mean it really does feel like carnivale. Love it

So I been here a few times but I&#39;ll discuss my recent lunch . There was a 22 dollar full course entrée which included the  lobster empanada, short rib, and for dessert the tart. I really enjoy the empanada though my guest who has way more experience partaking of Latin food says it was ok. My short rib was mouth watering amazing. I would certainly order it again. The tart was great if you&#39;re fond of sweet with a hint of sour. The guacamole was great as well and worth trying if you want to be on the safe side for an appetizer . 

Overall, the visual warrants at least one dine in experience and my personal recommendation from the menu off recent memory is the short rib and guacamole. Everything else is enjoyable though and you have a variety of options . One of those spots  everyone should try once ."

The atmosphere is wonderful, the best I have ever seen, however, I do not eat at a restaurant and pay a pretty penny for a below average meal. 

I am ethnically of mixed Latin descent with my parents hailing from the Caribbean and South of the border. Carnivale&#39;s &#34;modern twist&#34; on Latin food left me begging for actual Latin flavor. I had 2 entrees to try from and 6 different appetizers. There was not one that I liked. If you are not of Latin descent, then maybe you will not be left disappointed? I&#39;m not sure about that one, but even if I considered the food not to be Latin, the taste and flavor was simply inadequate for me (at least make good fish tacos?! simple enough and not too &#34;Latin?&#34;). 

People go here to be seen and impress, but they definitely do not go here for the food. I have yet to hear anyone rave about their food from my large circle of friends that love going there which makes it more apparent that they go solely to impress and be seen. I wanted to like this place. Sigh."

Went here for my birthday with some friends on a Saturday night.  Had reservations and got in pretty quickly.  The interior of the restaurant is pretty swank with good use of color and cool accents throughout.  It did get a bit noisy around us but whatevs.

Our server was very good at helping me find something vegan so I decided to get Fideos and guac.  The guac was good which actually can be screwed up so I&#39;m happy about that.  The Fideos was mediocre.  When it came out it looked like hamburger helper and if you&#39;ve ever messed up and put too much chili powder in something you get that overbearing, burnt chili taste...that was almost every bite.

I&#39;m not entirely sold on the place as our friends all kind of agreed the food wasn&#39;t really spot-on.  It&#39;s cool that they grow most of the herbs and stuff on the roof but I&#39;m not sure I would come back.  

You definitely have to go and experience it once, though."

We started with guacamole which had a wonderful creamy texture. The empanadas were baked, but were crispy with a delicious ham filling.

Our group was large. We ordered several appetizers entrées and desserts. From the entrées the guacamole with a real winner, had a really nice bite to it. The calamari was very nice, but the shrimp was just so-so. From the entrées the steak with chimichurri was well-liked, as was the lamb and short rib. The chicken was so so. The Arepa, my entrée, was rather dismal and lacked flavor or seasoning, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. From the desserts the chocolate bomb had a fun appearance-as they pour the melted chocolate, the hard outer covering melts revealing a delicious creamy inside. The tres leches was good. The cotton candy with caramel corn had a fun appearance as well. While the cotton candy was nice, the caramel corn was quite stale and frankly inedible.

Service from our actual primary server was very attentive, as well as helpful. The gentleman pouring our waters was just about the clumsiest fellow there ever could be-there was water everywhere on our table, napkins, and sometimes our personally effects.

Overall this would be a nice place to take a group, especially if they are out-of-towners. We felt that the overall experience took a very long time, possibly related to the fact that our group is larger, and it was Saturday night as well. After the almost 3 hours this dinner took, some of us were too tired to go out after, which was going to be a big part of our night.  I wouldn&#39;t personally return again, but I think it would be a fun experience for newcomers."

The first hour was for drinks and appetizers. I had a margarita and it was not bad at all. The appetizers were delicious. I could have made a meal of those alone.

Dinner was served family style and was more of a hit and miss deal. We got an assortment of Latin dishes. I liked the pork and the plantains the best. The pasta dish was rather boring and the garlic mashed potatoes seemed just out of place.

I loved the home made cotton candy we had for dessert, along with a cheese cake tartlet. I haven&#39;t had cotton candy in years. It was fun!!!

My only gripe was that it was incredibly noisy. I don&#39;t enjoy having to literally yell to the person next to me. I guess noisy is the price of success, or poor acoustics."

This place has been a chicago institution. Tucked away in a non descript part of the west loop, right off 90 and randolph, this unassuming looking building is beautiful on the inside and has been decorated to remind you of a circus. Paper mache lanterns, colorful walls, life music while you talk with your dining partner, this has all the ingredients to make for an enjoyable evening. 
I tried the brunch and dinner. For brunch, I had the red velvet french toast, which was pretty good, their waffles were fine, I would recommend trying something a little more unique. 
Where carnivale excels is their dinner. 

Lots of great latin options. My recommendations are the following.

Ropa Vieja - their most popular item. Kinda like barbacoa, this is very flavorful beef with a spicy component.
Guacamole.
Skirt Steak.

For dessert, order the cotton candy to share for the table... you could order the ice cream cake which is a gigantic 3 layer cake with passion fruit cake, mango and guava flavors... this was maybe a little overwhelming but if you love fresh flavors then you would probably like it."

To be honest,  I would have never come here on my own. The exterior looks a little too circus-y and not an intimate dining experience. 

The event staff definitely knows how to through a banquet! Bartending staff was great and quick. They were smart and offered signature cocktails (pre mixed for quick service) and tray passed appetizers (could have used better timing in the service, seemed a little sporadic) and dinner was family style rather than buffet. Banquet staff was quick to clear plates and make sure you had cocktails. 

Decor is gorgeous and the bar looks like a fun place to go. Food is delecious and I would definitely book a large party here or even for date night. I didn&#39;t see any children, which frankly, I was expecting  (based on the exterior) so I was definitely happy about that. We ubered in, but they seem to have a valet service."

The atmosphere is upbeat and fun. Our server Ramon was very polite and full-filled our every need. The food speaks for itself. Every dish was well thought-out and and beautifully executed. We had the mixto ceviche as an appetizer, I had the yucatan salmon as my main course and my boyfriend had the pollo criollo. I recommend all three, but I highly recommend the yucatan salmon. Also, there&#39;s wine pairing suggestions to go with your entree on the menu, which is pretty cool. Mine was perfect with my dish. Definitely see myself returning in the near future."

My first time there I was with a group and we had reservations. We were seated pretty quickly but since some of us got there a little early we had drinks at the bar. Boy, were those drinks good!!! 
So it&#39;s an A+ for beverages alone but with the food it goes A+++! The menu has many different things to offer, dishes from Latin America. I&#39;ve tried different dishes each time and never have been disappointed. My favorite was the ropa vieja.  Everything is seasoned to perfection and incredibly fresh ingredients.

--
I was here for a private event with the whole restaurant was booked. Excellent buffet service and options. The appetizer options were filling enough that the entree buffet was too much but great for large groups. The bar selection worked well. Service was very good with people coming around cleaning up quickly and restocking the buffets frequently. 

Would recommend -- except there was no music! Odd.. when you expect even just background music, wonder if that was a decision by the event managers.

Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Venue: 4/5 - Would recommend signs to bar locations as the front bar was always crowded and others had no idea where the other bars were."

The food was ok to good.  The guacamole was decent, just not fresh but salvaged by the sweet red jalapeños.  The mole empanadas were good, the mole itself was spicy and smoky but the meat a touch dry.  The seafood paella was good too but the clams were a bit off.  Solid meal but not worth returning for.

The decor was something to behold, a kaleidoscope of color in restaurant form. Worth a visit just to check it out."

The food was ok, but for some reasons it&#39;s very pricey. Every time I dined here I always ended up spending more than $50 per person even when I shared an entree with a friend.

We initially worked with Ally, (who later resigned to pursue being a stay at home Mom) to which we were then introduced to Doug. We were skeptical because we laid the ground-work with Ally and almost felt as if we were starting over with Doug. When I tell you this guy is fantastic, WOW! He was EXTREMELY thorough and worked so hard to make sure we had everything we needed. He was so accommodating and he made planning a wedding as painless as possible. We LOVED his worth ethic, responsiveness, professionalism, and his down to earth personality.

Doug is also good at getting a feel for your budget and will recommend great ideas based on what he&#39;s experienced with other weddings. We are BEGGING for another reason to have to work with Doug just because he&#39;s so damn GOOD. He also serves as a day of coordinator to ensure everything runs smoothly.

The food... Probably the greatest thing about this venue. We received countless texts and calls about how good the food was! Their menu is seasonal so it&#39;s ever changing but we had a REALLY AWESOME menu! We didn&#39;t get to eat as much as we wanted but we already had all the food at the tasting beforehand. We don&#39;t think there is a bad tasting thing on their menu... Top notch food!

We spent about 16K (with consumption bar) for 121 guests. This can be pricey for some but Doug knows how to cut corners and alter things to get the price where you want it. They require at 5K to reserve the date, at least 8K for the wedding to go on, and you can pay the remainder afterwards.

We said that we would make it an annual thing to go to Carnivale in honor of having our wedding there because we love this place so much.

If you are contemplating on having your wedding here, please do it. Doug will make sure you&#39;re in GOOD HANDS! 

THANK YOU CARNIVALE!!!"

Heard lots of good things about their drinks however when we ordered off the brunch drink menu the waiter told us they couldn&#39;t not make the drinks as it was a new menu and they were not prepared to offer the drinks. We tried to speak with the manager, as we observed her walk around the entire restaurant and speak with every patron however she purposely avoided our table even though she spoke to the three other tables that were around us.

Truly disappointed."

We brought my parents there and luckily everyone with us likes to have some cocktails :). Not one staff member or manager apologized or even acknowledged the fact that we waited 45 minutes over our reservation time. 

However, the food was AMAZING!!!! I had been one other time (years ago) but I was probably too young to appreciate the cuisine. This time, we had the octopus, guacamole, and coconut shrimp (omg amazing) to start. I had ordered the scallops but they were out of them :( Instead, I ordered the salmon which was one of the best salmon dishes I have seriously ever had! The best salmon in the city still might be Guilt Bar&#39;s, but this was a VERY close second! We finished with dessert (banana cream pie and this chocolate moose thing--- DELICIOUS! 

Overall I think this is a great restaurant for entertaining out of town guests and has amazing food. I was a little disappointed that no one even came to apologize for seating us so late past our reservation time. Like I mentioned though, luckily we were with a late night crew who don&#39;t mind the time so much!"

The ceviche sampler was off the charts, plentiful, and beautifully presented.  Four (or was it five?) selections including shrimp, salmon, tuna, octopus.  The ingredient description was a little too complicated to cover here, but if you like ceviche, you need to share this dish with one or two close friends.

My entrée was the arrachera - skirt steak cooked a perfect medium rare atop rice and black beans with a chimichurri sauce.  No complaints on this one, other than maybe a little heavy on the salt, but that&#39;s pretty normal for skirt steak dishes.

The cotton candy desert is a little campy, but obviously well-loved by the female patrons.  I just don&#39;t get it,

Service was professional, but you may note a tendency to upsell."

The first time I went the appetizers were good but the entries we ordered were not. My entree did not taste good and my friend&#39;s entree was some raw seafood thing. When the waiter came by he noticed we were not enjoying our meals so he offered to trade in our meals for two new entrees. We re-ordered and loved the new entrees! The waiter being so nice and understanding made me have more respect for this place.

The second time I went with a group of friends and feel in love!!!! We ordered guacamole,tacos and some crab cakes (all so tasty and good).... For their entrees they both ordered this big shrimp thing (I do not think they really like it. The shrimp were literally huge lol)... I on the other hand LOVED my entreee!!! I had this churrasco dish with this chimichurri sauce and some amazing potatoes. I am coming back for this dish! They cooked it perfectly. I recently went to Puerto Rico and they couldnt duplicate the taste of this dish. 

For dessert we had the Carnivale Ice Cream Cake, Chocolate Lava Mousse Cake and the Banana Cream Pie.

So we had heard about Community Tavern, but just hadn&#39;t had an opportunity to try it and are so glad that we finally did. It happened to be our anniversary and my wife had put it in the comments on our reservation, so as we sat down we were greeted with two glasses of champagne, nice. 
It&#39;s a quaint little place with a great feel to it great for an intimate dinner. Our waiter was great, explained the menu and concept to us as well as making suggestions, and was funny and friendly. He gave us wine recommendations which were right on, and didn&#39;t rush us at all. 
So the food....just amazing. I started with the baby iceberg salad, and would come back just for that! It&#39;s a small head of lettuce stuffed with blue cheese, bacon, avocado, ranch and it just explodes with flavor. My wife ordered the whole fish for dinner which was a fried Branzino and the crispy skin melted in your mouth. I ordered the aged ribeye, and I&#39;ve had good steaks but this was over the top delicious. The demi glacé you could drink with a straw, and the char on the steak was perfect and pink in the middle like I&#39;ve never seen. We also shared a cauliflower gratin which was loaded with cheese and had a nice back end heat that just perfect. 
We will definitely make regular stops here now, as long as we can get rid of the kids."

I was pretty floored by all the food they brought out. Hard to believe but one of the best filet preparations I&#39;ve ever had. Everything else was mind blowing as well. Seems to have a French inspiration without all the crappy French food.

My only request would be some more affordable wine options. Translation: I want to get drunk at dinner. Hook that up."

From the warm welcome from the manager, Jamie, to the superb service provided by our server, Jessie; from the complimentary champagne (Jamie remembered it was an anniversary dinner) to the warm chocolate chip cookies at the end of the meal (not complimentary), the entire experience was memorable.

The decor and ambiance was romantic and just a little funky, informal but special. With Lovely lighting and eclectic light fixtures, this was a spacious and lively dining room.

A nuanced Pinot Noir began the meal and the food was never less than excellent. Grilled octopus, vegetable terrine, and the stuffed iceberg salad were delights. Our entrees were also fabulous: the Tomahawk grilled pork chop and the flank steak were cooked perfectly and accompanied by savory side dishes, some of which were ala carte.

Of course we had to have dessert (we boxed up some of our entree just to make this possible!) and that was also special: besides the aforementioned chocolate chip cookies, we also had the butter cake, which reminded me of gingerbread topped with thinly sliced apples and Creme Fraiche. Just delicious.

So all in all, an excellent meal, pricey but well worth it for any kind of occasion when the Golden Nugget just won&#39;t suffice (no disrespect intended; we love the Nug!) We were at Community Tavern for almost 2.5 hours (our timetable, not because of their service) for a leisurely, scrumptious meal. We are pleased to have such a fabulous restaurant in Portage Park."

I liked it, but I thought the octopus appetizer was even better.  Next time I come, I&#39;m getting two of the octopus appetizers as my entree.  The place is expensive, but really right in line with the quality of food, the ambiance, the location, and the service.  I&#39;d say the only negative is I don&#39;t like the close seating, but by Chicago standards, it&#39;s actually roomier than comparable places.  Nice selection of whisky."

Small neighborhood, Portage Park jewel. Drive 5 more miles to the loop, or river north, and you would pay why more for the same meal. 

The room is lovely, and the service was perfect. Now for the food. Oysters were fresh, but a $3/e for baby oysters was a bit much. We had a filet, two whole fishes, but my steak frittes was the winner. The mixologist, BARTENDER did a great job of keeping us all lubricated. 

The big waste, and it always is a peeve of mine, was the bone marrow. Someone at our table, BABES, always has to order it, and it is a waste of money, a throwaway. Some thought from food. Oh, and these guys need to up their game a little more with the dessert selection.

Community Tavern came up with very positive reviews and an interesting menu. We booked it and made the drive over to Portage Park. 

We started with the night&#39;s special appetizer which was pork sausage with a chili yogurt sauce, blueberries, squash and spicy peanuts. Yes, this sounds like a completely zany concoction of ingredients, but it was surprisingly delicious. I wished there was more of it! 

The salad menu offered 3 different choices, but none of them really stood out. I ordered the shaved veggies and it had pistachios, kale/arugula, cherry tomatoes, goat cheese, squash, and some kind of vinaigrette. It was fresh and tasty, but I think I would have preferred this combo on a mixed greens or spinach leaf. 

My wife ordered the chicken and it was so delicious! The skin had a crispiness to it that broke under you fork to reveal the juiciest, most flavorful chicken inside. It&#39;s hard to get chicken to taste that incredible and it&#39;s a rare occasion that we are raving about chicken at a restaurant, but this is the exception. 

I had the filet mignon with au poivre sauce. It was the perfect tenderness and cooked to a perfect medium rare. The meat itself was so flavorful and moist. We both noted there was a distinct buttery corn flavor to the steak. 

The dessert menu is fun. We had the Chocolate pot de creme which came with a marshmallow and graham cracker crunk on top of the cream. So rich and yummy! We also had them bring out the brown butter chocolate chip cookies (which were of course, served warm). 

We really liked our meal here and commented about how we wanted to come back to try the double cheeseburger (which we saw a ton of coming out of the kitchen, so they must me amazing). Still, I think we&#39;d have to order that chicken again. Wow, is it delicious!

Service was incredibly polite, professional, and friendly. We were seated at a high top, which was fine for seeing the whole restaurant. I think next time, we will request one of the lower tables by the wall. Great dinner spot. We&#39;ll be back!"

I went here with my Uncle and our server&#39;s name was Jessie. He is one of the best servers I&#39;ve ever had. I have celiacs, so when my uncle ordered a dish with gluten in it, he came back to let us know that the couscous is not gluten free. It was not even my dish, but he still wanted to make sure we knew. I have never had a server do that before. He went out of his way to make sure he was 100% certain that all my dishes were GF. The restaurant was more than accommodating. 

The food was outstanding! We ordered muscles, escargot, and I got the steak and fritas. The steak was cooked medium-rare (how I ordered it), the food had intense flavors, and the portions were just enough to where you were able to take some home. 

One of my pet peeves is when you go to a restaurant and you finish your water and it takes 10 minutes at least for someone to refill it. This was not the case here. Anytime my glass was half full, someone would come over to fill it up. Jessie also requested A drink and I&#39;m drawing a blank on the name. If you&#39;d like to try it, it was a berry cocktail that was sweet, with a little sour taste 

Hopefully my uncle brings me here again!"

The service (aside from the busser) was lackluster, the food was insanely overpriced and not accurately described, very strange ambiance. 
We were seated immediately at the window. Our busser came over and filled out water and was chatty right away. The server came over told us the specials and explained the menu since it was our first time in. He told us about the CHILLED pea soup special and the fish and chips special. Noticing the prices seemed a little higher considering the neighborhood we opted to split some things.
We ordered the pea soup, &#34;house made&#34; breads, endive salad and the fish and chips special.

The pea soup was served hot. To the point that I burned my mouth expecting it to be chilled as said by our server.

The bread plate involved one bacon muffin/roll that was ok, a SLICE of pumpernickel and a SLICE of Texas toast with an over seasoned butter. How on earth are you justify charging money for two slices of store bought bread with one bacon muffin?!

The endive salad was probably the best of the meal. Well balanced citrus and salty flavor. My only complaint about it was that the pecorino was not uniformly spread through out the salad.

The fish and chips arrived in a giant platter. It was rather hilarious actually to notice the disproportionate amount of fries to fish and the 8 medallions of zucchini. The fish and chips were mediocre at best. I had multiple bones and my boyfriend had a few large thick pieces of  skin and the occasional fin joint. They also seemed to have been fried and redropped causing them to become oil logged. Strangest thing about the batter was they added cinnamon to the seasoning?! 

I finished a drink and the hostess came to take my glass and asked if I had another coming. I did not so she said she would return with a menu. Since it had been 15-20 min since our server had acknowledged us I was gracious at the offer. She returned to her host stand and visibly started texted and never returned with the menu. That amazing busser came by and asked how we were doing and I asked him for a drink menu, and ordered with him. He was the only saving grace at the place.

When the bill came I literally almost fell out of my chair. $36 for fish and chips??! They talked us into the special, didn&#39;t give a price and then charge the same cost as the nicest pubs in town?! Ones that don&#39;t serve you bone in, skin on fish and chips?! 
Never again, you&#39;re awful. Owen and engine charges $18 for a large portion of perfectly cooked and trimmed fish and chips. They also offer attentive service so I&#39;ll be going there next time. Next time I get that Texas toast hankering I&#39;ll be sure to go to jewel."

Overall, the food and ambiance were wonderful. I stuck with wine from the bar as my friend had some iffy cocktail experiences. (I&#39;m sorry, but if you need to ask your guests how to make a French martini, there&#39;s a problem.)

For food, I started with the cheddar bacon muffin, which was baked to perfection and had a nice subtle flavor to it, though I wish it had been a bit more pronounced. The butter it was served with was practically frozen, but fortunately the muffin itself was so toasty warm that the butter melted right away as soon as it made contact with the bread. Next I enjoyed the shaved squash salad, which was heavenly. I opted for the filet entree, which was very good (and an extremely good value). My friends had the Paris gnocchi, which I sampled and very much enjoyed. We shared sides of roasted fingerling potatoes (excellent) and the glazed seasonal vegetables, which happened to be broccoli that night (okay but nothing spectacular). We ended the night sharing the banana cake, which was pretty good as well. 

So overall, the food was very good. Nothing really blew me away besides the salad, but it was all very good. I like the ambiance of the place (and the chandelier hanging at the front of the restaurant is just stunning). I was not very impressed with the service, which was friendly yet disorganized and inattentive at times. Our entrees were served about 10 minutes before the side dishes arrived. At one point, three of us ordered drinks and only one of them made it back to the table: the other two followed about 15 minutes later. I also felt like the server was rushing us at the very end, even though no guests were waiting for a table. 

Another issue: the bathroom. It was nice and clean, but the mirror over the sink in the ladies room is Barbie doll size. Seriously?! How am I supposed to reapply my makeup? That kind of thing bothers me. 

Overall, I had a good meal here. Pricing was borderline for me. I don&#39;t mind paying a lot for a good meal and compared to most Chicago restaurants, I think pricing here is a good value. However, I don&#39;t think I fully got my money&#39;s worth tonight. I will definitely give it another chance, though."

All things still hold from the first review but after a few more visits I am completely sold on this experience. It is truly a breathe of fresh air to have such an establishment in the Portage Irving area. The attention to detail and genuine care shown by owner and staff here is more than apparent. They must do some type of staff rotation because from &#34;bus boy&#34;, to waiter, to hostess, they all know their stuff. Menu items are hand crafted and phenomenal. 

Since my first visit, I&#39;ve had the salmon, the burger, the potatoes and vegetables, the oysters, and beef tartare. All great!

It&#39;s cute from the outside (love the signage) and really nice on the inside - the way the side tables are tucked under the ceiling, the pretty chandelier in the front. the wrought iron light pieces over the bar (they each have a little bird on top).  It felt like I was in Austria or Germany.

While the meal was not bad, it was not great. I won&#39;t go out of my way to go there again.  Well, maybe to try some red meat.  (But I am not much of a meat eater) Those plates looked awesome and could feed a Viking!

We ordered the escargot, which I had high hopes for as it arrived all bubbly at our table. It was good, but bland for what I was expecting. It had enough butter, but not a lot of garlic.

He ordered the fish of the day, which was beautiful . . with all the veggies and all, it looked like it was a food design for a magazine. They didn&#39;t overwhelm it with any flavors. Beautiful.

I just ordered the mussels &amp; clams. It did say the word brie in the listing of ingredients, but I was expecting it on the side. The sauce was a creamy tomato sauce (the brie was obviosly in the sauce). On the mussels and clams. I was looking for a light meal.  It was good, but not what I was expecting.  I was planning on giving the brie to my date to eat (I try to shy away from daily as my body doesn&#39;t like it). 

If it was in my neighborhood, I would probably try it again, but it&#39;s not my hood.
Service was perfect - there, but not overbearing. Our female server was very enthusiastic - overall and with describing the special meat of the day. She described the whole half an animal (I can&#39;t remember if it was a cow or pig), and when we didn&#39;t order any it (we don&#39;t really eat meat), I could see her spirits fall.  I bet the dish was fantastic. Based on her description, it sounded great.  :)"

Yeah, so that&#39;s not exactly how it happened...

Ok, our besties read about Community Tavern and we decided to give it a try. Glad we did.

Lisa and I were with our foodie buds, Adam and Janet... and were determined to take advantage of the menu.

The decor is a conglomeration of styles.. from industrial to French. But it works and will hold your interest.. well, at least.. it held mine.

The service was top notch throughout the evening.

For appetizers we shared the Short Rib and Oxtail Terrine (don&#39;t miss it! kind of a fancy meatloaf with an egg on top), King Crab Legs (small portion, but a taste for everyone) and the House Charcuterie Plate and because we just wanted to try them.. we ordered a side of the Breakfast Radishes as an appetizer too. One of the things we love about our friends is that if someone suggests something they are always like.. &#34;sure, why not?&#34; I&#39;m the curmudgeon but they all put up with me anyway.

We almost forgot to order the Cheddar Bacon muffin, fortunately, we recovered in time to have one before the meal was over.

I had the bone in Berkshire Tomahawk Pork Chop, cooked perfectly.. it was delicious.. in my opinion only eclipsed by Lisa&#39;s order of Braised Short Rib on Risotto (OMG!) which was not only delicious but surprisingly not at all fatty.. that&#39;s what I&#39;ll get next time. 

Or maybe I should get what Adam ordered.. the Steak Delmonico.. I didn&#39;t taste it, but it looked delicious and his discriminating palate thought it was pretty terrific. Or..maybe Janet&#39;s Dry Aged Rib eye....she loved that, so...

All of the food was excellent!

We were stuffed but shared a Brownie Sundae, just because."

I started with their cheddar muffin and enjoyed that almost as much as anything else that night.  The cauliflower soup had great seasoning and was probably my favorite dish of the night.  That was fortunate because it was about a 30 to 45 minute wait until our entrees.  

Jesse was our server and while personable, totally disappeared during the kitchen backup with no explanation as to why the long wait.  This would have been forgivable, however, the entrees were more like appetizers.  I had the seared sea scallops. At $28 a pop, i was expecting a bit more than 3 large sea scallops with little garnish (like tiny pieces of lobster and shrimp). Honestly, it would have made a great appetizer for $13, but this was just disappointing ... I was more filled up by the $2 muffin than the main course..  Particularly after the long wait.  Maybe its because I had recently been to some great tapas restaurants, this dish would have blended in fine, but as a standalone meal, I left hungry.

My friend had the sirloin filet and it looked equally small.  Tiny portion of mashed potato under the steak on a large plate just didn&#39;t cut it for him.   The manager/owner stopped by to ask about our dinner and although i mentioned, the long wait, I got the feeling like he couldn&#39;t wait to get away from the table and talk to people who were 100% happy.  I could be wrong, but didn&#39;t get the feeling their was much concern.

Anyhow, we all agreed that while a nice place to visit, very loud atmosphere but not worth a return visit."

Portage Park is an interesting neighborhood. 

The bread appetizer was very good, though the butter accompanying it was cold and hard as a rock. My dining companions liked the bacon and cheddar muffin, while I found my pumpernickel to be a little bit more of a standard rye. We all agreed the shaved squash salad was outstanding, and for me the highlight. The entrées were pretty good. One of my party enjoyed a filet.

Go here and eat the Braised Short Rib. It&#39;s over this insanely delicious creamy risotto that could stand alone as a meal (if given more of it that is). SO. GOOD.

Had the charcuterie which was delicious, though I had heard rave reviews about the chicken liver pate, but I&#39;ve had better (it was still good)!

Excellent service, really friendly staff, adorable little place, excellent food!"

While we were at the bar, we spoke with Jose, the bar manager. He is clearly invested in his craft--he personally created many of the cocktails on the drinks menu.

The major winners of the night were:
* the basil-infused vodka martini with a twist
* the wedge salad
* the french onion soup

Overall, their menu is fantastic--you cannot go wrong!"

It is lovely having a high quality restaurant that we can walk to from Old Irving Park. The service was very attentive to our celebration, offering champagne and a complementary amuse plate. The food was excellent, especially the corn potage and flat iron steak. The scallop dish was a little sweeter than expected. The cocktails were a great treat as well.

My husband and I really loved our experience at Community. The food was outstanding. We were really impressed. We hope more places like community come to the area. Sister restaurant, maybe? Ha. 

We came for the Sunday night $5 burger special. It was so juicy and delicious. We highly recommend you check it out. You won&#39;t be disappointed. The menu has something for everyone. 

Granted-if you try to alter the $5 burger they will tell you it&#39;s not possible (understandable) and also, give you a little snark when you request ketchup and mustard. (The woman who delivered it apologized that they did not have &#34;yellow&#34; mustard, which I didn&#39;t request, I believe she was subtly making fun of me.

I thought the food was delicious! We had a party of 4, but none of us were particularly hungry so we ordered 3 entrees to share. We got the bouillabaisse, the braised short rib, and the bone marrow steak. Each entree really featured a different type of protein, and I thought they were all cooked perfectly! I would definitely go back! I only give it a 4 star only because I think the menu selection could be a little broader. I mean I had no problem picking out something I liked, but I know my mom had some trouble with it. But overall loved the restaurant!

We had reservations but we didn&#39;t want to necessarily sit at the table they offered us.  If you take a chance to look around you will see the faux bird cages surrounding the lighting. I found that unique. 

At the bar it was easy to notice that they were experts in making cocktails. They also have an excellent wine list.  

I don&#39;t know that I have any particular type of gem to share but I know this. They have the best french onion soup I ever had.  It was sweet and salty. They use a manchego cheese. My buddy and I also ordered the beef tartare. If you like beef tartare it will hit the spot. It isn&#39;t anything special but they did it correctly.  I am not sure the quail egg they added was entirely necessary but it presented well.

My buddy ordered the steak delmonico which they told us was new to the menu if I understood them correctly. He had nothing but great things to say about this steak. It was perfectly done. They served the marrow in a large bone.  I ordered the steak frites.  It looks exactly as the picture shown on their website.  They use a skirt steak.  I ordered it medium rare.  We shared a bottle of their 2004 bordeaux.  I love this wine. After it was opened I tasted to check if it was corked. It was not but came off bitter. By the time we got the steak the wine became super mellow, very smooth, not bitter at all. 

To sum this visit up,  it was home cooking at its best for what we ordered.  We were very satisfied and happy to make the journey from the Gold Coast out to here. I think that this restaurant is perfectly named. I would have to visit multiple times to get through this menu. I am sure I would enjoy every visit too.

Thank you to Community Tavern for the comfort food."

I will say the ambiance is nice and the service was great despite it being a busy Saturday night.

Our food was what made our experience &#34;meh&#34;.  We had the charcuterie platter, which was good but nothing outstanding.  We also ordered the tuna appetizer, where things started to go awry.  The tuna was of OK quality and just covered in way too many ingredients.  We wanted something light and refreshing on a hot day and instead got a borderline gross hodgepodge of flavors piled on top of a mediocre cut of fish.

I had the burger which was basically inedible.  In the sauce on the burger, there was the very distinct and overwhelming flavor of fish sauce.  It was all I could taste.  I attempted to scrape some of it off but the damage was done, it was really an odd choice for a beef burger and not enjoyable.  The fries were cooked well but also had strange flavoring... either cinnamon or nutmeg?  My husband had the chicken which he described as &#34;OK&#34;.  He finished it but said he wouldn&#39;t order it again.

We both walked out agreeing that we wouldn&#39;t return.  Maybe we would visit the bar?  The beer list was pretty good, especially the drafts.  But the food was an overall disappointment."

We started with cocktails, my wife had a very nice Cotes du Rhone, and I had a Sidecar. My drink had too much fruit juice, that diluted the cognac.

The salads were good (my wife had the Clam, Avocado &amp; Arugula, and I had a Wedge.  Nice portions and good taste.

For entrees, she had an appetizer of Lamb Chop and Pirogue, with a chestnut sauce, and I had Steak Frites (and a glass of Cab).

We went here three times, and each time things were wrong, that should not have been, especially at this price point.

First impressions are everything and the hostess is not warm or welcoming.  On our first trip, she turned us away when came here at 5:30 on a Saturday for a quick meal. The hostess working the front said that they were &#34;fully committed&#34;in a room that was half empty.  She  does not say &#34;hello&#34; or &#34;welcome&#34;; just barks out &#34;do you have a reservation?&#34; 

I have had the steak frites on three different visits.  It was good once and twice it was inedible.  The cut of meat is lower end and cooked improperly.  My medium rare was done &#34;blue&#34; on two occasions....cold uncooked center.  The last meal, the butcher did not trim the cut properly, so the meat was undercooked and has this vein of sinew that made it impossible to cut.  The server saw me struggling to cut my entree, as french fries flew off the plate with each effort.  He took it away and, I swear the kitchen sent me a &#34;take that mr complainer&#34; replacement. It was a strip steak cut that was way way way too salty, and again cold and blue in the center.  They gave us a cookie and a free beer to compensate.  I&#39;d rather pay for my beer and skip the cookie, and have a properly prepared meal by people that make you feel welcome.

I did not care for the bone marrow, although I crave this from other places. The bread was greasy tasting. The wedge salad also left us wanting.  The cauliflower gratin tasted bland.

At $150 for dinner for two, we are &#34;done&#34; with Community.  Its a shame, because the NW side could use some better food.  Back to to the city for me.

Been there  a couple times now, and we were  impressed on both occasions. The 16 Oz. aged ribeye  is my favorite: so flavorful and  tender. The bone Marrow appetizer  is a must: two nice bones served with really wonderful sourdough crostini and a side of shallot jam. I wish it was a &#34;canoe cut &#34; because I&#39;m lazy like that,  but well worth  the  digging .

They have an imaginative drink program with all the beers, wines liquor and mixed drinks you can imagine. 

On our last  visit they had a  rabbit/shrimp budin  (sausage) served with asparagus,  and pickled ramps. Ramps are only in season for about 5 minutes in the spring,  so I hadda try it: omg - incredible.  Total grand slam. We were talking about that dish all the way home. 

Anyhow, not cheap, (dinner for two can easily run 150 bucks) but worth it for the quality of the meats,  imaginative specials and excellent service.

Community Tavern checks all the boxes."

Yet, I sometimes wish to go out for a steak, while avoiding the $300 price tag for the pleasure, a near inevitability for any refined couple in one of the downtown steakhouses.  Whatsoever shall I do?  How will I cope, you might ask?  I&#39;ll tell you - I&#39;ll visit the newly opened Community Tavern.

The steaks here are fantastic.  Kelly ordered the filet and she enjoyed it very much.  I ordered the dry aged ribeye - rare, and you&#39;d be advised to do the same - and it had a rich, earthy, bloody flavor.  The steaks are certainly acceptable alternatives to a trip downtown.  The whipped potatoes side was light, creamy, and very buttery.  Even the french fries are superb, and worth a trip to have at the bar.  

The appetizers were more of a mixed bag.  The crab legs appetizer was superb - fresh, served cold, with a light lemon aioli.  The miniature boule of bread was fine, but the butter was overly salty.  The salad was a bit salty too.  I was intrigued by the foie gras butter and biscuits, but I did not order them this time.  However, I saw an order and it looked like the foie gras was baked in to the biscuit, which was not a selling point.  You may wish to inquire for yourselves.

The cocktail list is fine - Kelly enjoyed her gin drink, and I had a Bulliet Rye Manhattan.  It was very well made.  I would have liked a bigger glass, but we are just quibbling at the point.

The wine list is predominantly American, and heavy on the Napa Valley cabernets.  There was but one Bordeaux, but it was very affordable at $55 and a rich, earthy old world wine that matched perfectly with the steaks.

Just one word of caution - the brownie dessert with the ice cream and caramel sauce - has pork belly the ice cream.  Not bacon, but fatty hunks of pork belly.  It was, to be kind, a greasy, extremely unpleasant discovery, and not listed anywhere in the description.  If you are the sort who enjoys bacon in everything, then you might like this, but I think bacon needs a bit of decorum and needs to learn its place.  Which, in my opinion, is nowhere near ice cream.  In any event, you have been so advised.  We were able to send the dessert back without incident or cost.

We will definitely be back.  Perhaps I&#39;ll see you there?"

The entire staff was warm, inviting and knowledgeable. And the owner, just as at The Portage, is as good as it gets. He could give lessons in this stuff. Our table was late getting ready, and while we didn&#39;t quite mind enjoying drinks at the bar, they gifted us with oysters as an apology as soon as we did sit down. Clear sign of folks that care.

Four of us almost ran the table on all the appetizers. Such great variety of tastes and textures. Shared whole fish and Porterhouse for dinner. The homey/trendy balance flowed through the food with bold complex flavors punctuated by a keen eye to presentation and style.

We will return."

Quay did the decorating from the antique mirrors to the gorgeous lighting fixtures to the comfortable seating. Very well done. 

Staff was excellent, friendly and accommodating. David was our server and he was charming.  If u get him, you will be well taken care of. 

We started with the steak tartare which was extremely tasty. Others had a wedge of lettuce and soup. 

My partner had the pork chop for his entree which he said was outstanding. Two others had steak and raved. I had cassoulet which I had never had before. It was a nice mixture of sausage, duck etc. I thought it was good. We ended sharing two desserts, one of which was a crispy brownie which was a great end to a lovely evening. The coffee was very good. 

I Wd go back to try something new."

The service was spot on.  The staff treated us like we were VIPs when we&#39;re just a couple of folks from the neighborhood.

We tried a couple of the house cocktails and were quite impressed. The &#34;dark Manhattan&#34; (using dark rum instead of whiskey) left a positive impression on my palette. My wife had the whiskey sour and it was one of the best sours I&#39;ve had the pleasure to taste. My first cocktail was a lovely gin concoction whose name now escapes me. I could have had several of those if I wasn&#39;t driving that evening.

The charcuterie plate is highly recommended. Community makes everything on the plate in-house, with the exception of the mustard (whole grain, delicious). I could seriously have had several servings of that plate and that would suit me for an evening.

I tried the vegetable potage and was very pleased. The dish screamed &#34;fresh!&#34; I could have had a large bowl and been entirely satisfied.

We had the 16oz ribeye and the tomahawk pork chop. Both were cooked and seasoned  perfectly. The accompaniments to each dish were expertly matched. I wish I had an extra two stomachs so I could eat more of Community&#39;s offerings.

We were so full we weren&#39;t going to have any dessert, but Quay convinced us to give their banana cake a try. We were glad we did. 

Community is definitely on the pricey side, but for an upscale joint in Portage Park/Six Corners I highly recommend it.

I&#39;m in love with this place and will be back again and again."

The service was top notch as well. The staff was very personable, attentive, and knowledgable.  

For our food we split two appetizers and an entree. The king crab legs were wonderful, especially the dipping sauce that came with them. The beef tartare was delicious, but there were far too many capers on the dish compared to the amount of beef. We had dozens left on our plate at the end! We also got the whole fish, and the flavors were excellent! The garbanzo beans and sauce perfectly complimented the fish. We finished with a brownie sundae, which was good, but not mind blowing. I had a couple of bites and was okay with letting my husband finish the rest (which very rarely happens, trust me!).

It was our first time exploring Portage Park. Very happy we found Community Tavern (right next door to the Portage Theater), a relatively new place. Both nights we had a small group and they were able to accommodate us. However, to be safe you should make reservations. The place filled up fast.  Both nights the service was great. Everyone was very friendly, had a great sense of humor and knowledgeable. They also have a well rounded beer menu.  

More Gastro Pub than steakhouse. It is upscale but laidback and not pretentious. Both nights we had the Crab and Avocado salad. It&#39;s a great portion half an avocado greens and lots of crab. On friend did not like the amount of onions present. We also enjoyed the side of Roasted Mushrooms. I could have had a few of these little cups of mushrooms. Our first night we tried the Tuna Crudo. The Tuna was great, the toppings of olives, peppers and some grapefruit was really strong for me. I brushed about half of it off and at one point all of it so I could enjoy the fish. We also had the Salmon. Wow, what a portion. Usually you get a small 6oz Salmon filet.  They are very generous here. It was almost too much for me. The skin was crispy and flavorful and inside flaked apart. The Gnocchi underneath was warm and soft. I really just wanted the Gnocchi.  Our second night, I paired the Alfredo with Beef Stroganoff with a side of the Roasted Mushrooms. It was the perfect amount of food for me. The Stroganoff is a smaller portion. The noodles are soft; the meat is tender with the juice as a perfect sauce that is not too thick. It was nice to have a non-creamy sauce on this type of dish.

The food and ambiance are warm and inviting. You will not leave hungry.  Come for a drink early, enjoy hearty food, grab a dessert and call it a great night!"

I could park at a meter right out front because we had dinner early so that  was good.  We sat near the front of the restaurant and I had a perfect view of several empty storefronts across the street.  These storefronts had been painted some time ago with &#34;roaring 20&#39;s&#34; theme pictures that had seen better days.  I&#39;m not sure how to deal with empty storefronts but one thing Community could have done is to have blinds or curtains to keep the view inside the restaurant but that might go against the &#34;community&#34; idea behind that presumably inspired the name?

Reason I&#39;m deducting 1.5 stars is because owner booked us at the same time as a private party for a Sunday 4pm Brunch. We weren&#39;t told this until it was time to go downstairs, and we&#39;ve already waited close to an hour in the living room. They managed to pull out a table right by the door, which was fine but the owner had to keep the door open for temp. control and the cold November breeze wasn&#39;t as pleasant when eating the food. I didn&#39;t think atmosphere would bother me, but it definitely had an impact on my experience on enjoying the food. 
The private birthday party was definitely joyous for the 25+ people who were there, but that also meant that my BF and I, being in close proximity, couldn&#39;t carry a conversation because of the guests excitement.
Rant over - let&#39;s get to the food. 

There was plenty of food to go around. It is a buffet style brunch. There were definitely some dishes that stole the show - the etouffee, the chicken, non-veg. black beans, steak and the little cheese bread/balls were a highlight! Other dishes like the porkchop and the fish was a little too salty for my taste buds. 
The food definitely won over my bf more than me (but full disclosure - I was in the beginning of getting a viral cold that definitely messed w/ my taste buds). According to him, everything was delicious. I could again, pass on a few things and the food was just average for me. It lacked that kick I expected from brazillian food, but again, that could be my taste buds failing me. 

For the price alone (33$/pp), the food wasn&#39;t worth it to me. The groupon made it worth the money for me. 

Will I give this place another shot? Maybe . . . but not anytime soon, and definitely not when I&#39;m sick/about to get sick :/"

Better

Communal dining isn&#39;t really a draw for me but i do appreciate the fundamentals. And when it happens by chance, unplanned or unforeseen, well, it just works.

You are seated where there is space.

You&#39;re handed a menu. 

You&#39;re advised of protocol. 

You indulge.

Thank you for dining.

We came for the Sunday brunch, which has two set times (2 pm and 4 pm). You are literally in the owners/chefs house, where you sit side-by-side with strangers at the same table. It&#39;s obviously not meant to be an intimate or couple-y meal, but it is a very unique way to meet some new people and enjoy some great food. 

The food is phenomenal! After spending some time in Brazil a few years ago, I&#39;ve been searching for an authentic Brazilian dining experience and Sinha definitely delivers. From farofa, feijoada and pao de queijo, you are instantly transported to Brazil. There is more than enough food to completely fill yourself and the options feel endless. There are even multiple vegetarian options, which makes it a little less authentic, as you would be hard-pressed to find many vegetarian options in Brazil. 

I&#39;m already planning another trip back"

It&#39;s very small and subtle. I drove past it several times and had to approach it from the east in order to see a worn sign on the side of a two flat. It was underwhelming in what is clearly the basement of a home but the service was phenomenal and the food was outstanding. The appetizers are a buffet with some of the best rice and beans I&#39;ve had in my entire life. We ordered an entree to come later and my friend who&#39;s a vegetarian ordered the portobello mushrooms. When they were out they provided a homemade tofu dish just for her. During our meal we were given fresh sugary cheesy bread bites with fig marmalade. Amazing! The Hibiscus tea...Amazing! The entree came with the worlds best coconut milk based broth, a plantain, and half a fresh prepared mango. This is a well hidden gem that the Hungry Hound has also visited. I look forward to returning!!!"

It feels like you are attending a dinner party in someone&#39;s home, and in many ways, it is exactly that. Reading reviews beforehand was very helpful. It was obvious some of the guests were confused as to how the meal is set up. It&#39;s supposed to be a leisurely meal so do not come here if you are pressed for time. 

The Sunday 2pm brunch starts with you entering into a home with comfortable sofas where the host offers you tea. You can snack on fruit, cheese and salsa/chutney with pita chips (all homemade). You may chat with others or simply admire the décor while waiting for all the guests to arrive. Once everyone arrives, you are invited to the dining area downstairs with communal tables. 

You may sit down wherever. We sat by the window. We waited for a bit longer for the host/chef/owner (aka &#34;Lady of the house&#34;) to introduce the items at the buffet. The food was all very delicious!! It&#39;s all homemade with a dose of love. There was over 20 items which included rice, 2 versions of black beans, cod fish stew, tender pulled pork, farofa (grainy cassava meal), carving station with steak made to order and sausage, fresh cheesy bread, differently prepared salads (chicken, cabbage, kale), stuffed fritters, sautéed orka, green beans, peas, sweet plantains, cut up fruit, variety spicy garnishes. At the end, the host serves her fusion red velvet cake topped with flan with a side of ice cream.  

They also have a beautiful back patio where you can sit under the grapevines or walk around to look at what&#39;s growing.

I can&#39;t even describe everything we experienced. Go see for yourself. It&#39;s a very welcoming home experience as well as professional service."

The buffet is tricky because you will be tempted to go back for seconds before your entrée come, we had been warned and took only a little. 
My Aunt selected the shrimp, which were in a light cream sauce, served with really tasty rice. 
My husband had the chicken, he truly enjoyed it.
My mother order the special of the day, Brazilian Pock Chops which were spicy and extremely juicy. 
I had the steak, medium, which was so tender and perfect. The steak was served with delicious Yukon Potatoes. 
Each meal was $15, well priced and delish. 
After our meal we toured the location. There is an area for small parties upstairs and a beautiful patio with grapes growing.

As someone said before, come with someone you know well and who&#39;s adventurous. It&#39;s not a first date spot... Also, she made this flan custard cake that was AMAZING.

Although I am not a fan of communal dining, this was a wonderful experience.  From the moment you enter you are made to feel welcomed and part of the family.  Diners are invited to enjoy appetizers as all guest arrive.  The owners assistant provides information regarding the in&#39;s and out&#39;s of dining.  Before the actual dining the owner introduces herself, her background, her inspiration and food on the menu.  

Food: I will admit I am picky and critical regarding food...it takes alot to impress me.  However, this food was awaesome.  There was a variety including chicken, fish, beef and vegetarian deals.  The buffet also included sides such as salads, rice, beans and fruit.  Dessert was a red velvet flan, which I assume was awesom based upon the comments and my son eating 3 of them.  Everything was well seasoned and tasty.  The chefs, owner, replenished food as necessary.

The only drawback was the tight seating area.  Occasionally my chair bumped the woman behind me or someone had to squeeze past another.  

I was so impressed that I immediatly purchased another coupon when I got home.  I can not wait to visit in the summer where can dine outside."

You would need to get buzzed into the metal door for entrance. You will walk into the lower level and it appears to be a living room with a large communal dining table. It was an akward situation and I felt lost. The owner/chef walked me into the spacious backyard with more seatings. It was actually very delightful sitting below a grapevine tent. By the way, she makes her own grape wine. I was here on a weekday for the lunch platter. I had the brazilian meat and the side dishes was a buffet style inside the house. Overall, the home cooked food was enjoyable. The owner also gave me a tour of the house and the Sunday brunch would be located in the 2nd floor with cute tables and tea setting."

Food is great, lots of different dishes to choose from, interesting  concept. I don&#39;t eat meat, but ate the fish and it was great, and so was the lasagna. Felt like back home, very authentic. Appetizers where excellent too.
Here is where I take 2 stars off. Dessert. As a born and raised Brazilian, I am a huge sweet lover. It&#39;s in our blood. Brazilians love their sweets. With that much variety of appetizers, salads, enters and sides to chose from, I could only imagine there would be at least 3 or 5 dessert options. I couldn&#39;t wait to have some brigadeiro, bolo prestigio, pudim leite condensado, mousse de maracuja and such. Big expectation building there. 
So then the host brings in this red velvet cake flan out. (Red velvet is nowhere found in Brazil, but she did point that out). She slices the cake into VERY THIN pieces, I mean seriously, 3 bites in each portion tops, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the top. It tasted ok, nothing to write home about it, but SO SMALL. Like she had to make that cake last for a week. OMG. I was so disappointed. I keep looking around hoping she was serving that while the dessert table was being set but NO. No more. That&#39;s all we got. I felt empty, not satisfied and sad. She then thanked us and proceeded to collect payment. It was really the end. 
So we drove straight to Brazil Legal, a little brazilian deli nearby to stuff our faces with delicious sweets like the brigadeiro and pudim. Proper dessert to end a yummy meal."

Ambiance is unbelievable, you feel at home and just welcomed such that you can be yourself while enjoying the best home cooked food outside your own home.

My boyfriend and I took the CTA route 126 bus from downtown for the weekday lunch/brunch special, which is available weekdays from 11:30 AM to 2PM. Upon arriving to the house, we discovered that you have to ring the little buzzer on the outside gate to be let in. We were seated at one of the communal tables, where we proceeded to make friends with the people already sitting there. They showed us their plates and explained what all the dishes were, which definitely helped us decide what to order, although I&#39;m sure that every single one of the lunch entrees is delicious!

So, here is the deal with the weekday lunch/brunch: 

First, you give Jorgina your order for which entree you&#39;d like (ranging from options like shrimp and fish stew to steak, and even a tofu dish). After ordering, you can get up and go to the buffet in the rear of the room, where you help yourself to your pre-meal delicious rice and beans, as is customary in Brazil. There are also beverages available to order, like mango juice and teas. At some point before entrees arrive, you will get a little appetizer (for instance, we got yucca/cheese balls with a pineapple salsa... to die for!) Finally, Jorgina comes with your entrees, and from there you can also order dessert afterwards.

My boyfriend ordered the steak and I got the fish stew. Each came with a fried plantain and perfectly sliced mango (to see what the plates look like, check out the pictures I&#39;ve uploaded!). The fish was so fresh, and the steak was done perfectly- flavorful and authentic. Jorgina was such a sweetheart as we chatted with her about the food and Brazil.

Overall, we would come back to Sinha in a heartbeat. In the future, I would especially like to try the brunch, which is available on weekends with two seatings at both 2 and 4 PM. I would also assume that their catering is fantastic... something to keep in mind if you&#39;re having a wedding and want some really unique, reasonably priced and flavorful ethnic cuisine!"

My partner and I were so exited upon entering this place, but first rewind....

I got buzzed in the front door but quickly noticed that we walked into the garden apartment (this is where you actually dine), oh the looks everyone gave when we walked in since it was a different party. But that&#39;s okay, the usher took us up the stairs where we we smack dab in the middle of Georgina&#39;s (owner and cook) living room. With its fireplace and majestic yet simple look. This is actually her home as you have read from other reviews but Georgina is a beautiful hostess. 

We were given a few appetizers and while we waited for other guest on this 2 PM lunch crew to arrive, we munched and chit chatted. She (Georgina) came up and just was as pleasant as can be.  She explained what our dining experience would be, and the various foods we were about to taste. 

Our lunch started a bit later but she came up to ask if everyone was okay with that. We were of course.  So the Buffet portion of this was beyond expectations. The usher offered to mix up our BYOB of Champagne and Orange juice and we of course tipped him well because he didn&#39;t have to do that. 

Brazilian Top Sirloin (Pinanha) was amazing, as she came personally to the table and of course she explained all the local foods of her country and how some may contain peanuts just in case anyone is allergic, that only made me smile because of her caring. Then there was the Black beans cooked Brazilian style with shreds of pork. WOW! She also served up some plantains in a little butter. Yucca Croquettes (Blinho de aipim) some cassava cake for dessert and flan which of course was to die for!

Oh did I mention that this is an all you can eat buffet? Yes, with salads of the Brazilian culture, some drinks, and you are off. Absolutely a must try, and at $30 per person on Sunday Brunch, you can&#39;t pass this one up! I couldn&#39;t possibly mention everything I ate, but wow, I am still thinking of it. Call for reservations since you only can get in this way."

Jorgina and her staff were helpful and friendly, and the environment was casual and comfortable.

Pro tips:
1. Try one of each of the appetizers before the meal, but no more. You&#39;ll want to save room for the real food.

2. There was a group of ~16 women there for a baby shower. I thought Jorgina&#39;s house was a great place to host a group activity which would still have a feeling of &#34;being at home.&#34;

3.  Call to check you have a reservation. Although I made the reservation 2 weeks in advance, when I showed up Jorgina was uncertain that I had a reservation. Thankfully there were 2 seats available."

The non-ostentatious facade is belied, however, by the rear patio, which is centered by a type of gazebo sheaved in grape vines (yes, with grapes on them).

The patio has several seating/conversation corners and small tables, which, on the day I was there, invited comfortable ease.

To reach the patio, one is taken through the front indoor seating area and through the kitchen. When I was there, two smiling women were talking amiably while working.

The food presentation was surprising -- very upscale attention to detail in the arrangement and assortment of colors and textures. 

The taste of the food - that&#39;s why we go, right? - was very very good. I am not a Brazilian expert, but the sauces, meats, vegetables -- it was all the right mix and density.  

I remind you it is BYOB.  Very positive experience.  While we were there, a painter was painting angels on the wood surfaces, using the faces of the staff as the angels. The entire staff left the kitchen to watch her and laugh at spotting their own faces -- a touch of ease one does not always associate with high-quality kitchens!"

I really like the service because the owner was very attentive.

As i recall food was spectacular and i really feel like i&#39;m at home, someday i will even wash the dishes after i&#39;m done!

I had the picanha with mango, potatoes, rice and beans and it was fabulous!! So good that i had to order a second one to go so i can give to my co-workers and they all agreed how amazing the food here is!!


So, what are you waiting for? Go try it for yourself!!"

I especially liked the steak, bacalao, lamb, chicken &amp; shrimp dish &amp; Brazilian French toast. I ate so much the first time around that I couldn&#39;t even get a 2nd plate even though I really wanted to. the lady was sooooo friendly and explained what every dish was. very homelike and cozy as if she personally invited u to eat at her house in brazil. need to go back soon!!!"

Jorgina is very friendly and personable. She explained all the dishes that she prepared. The hibiscus tea is excellent. When you walk into the house, it&#39;s more like a house party type of feel. There were some chips with mango salsa and crackers with a variety of cheeses. You can arrive early and just hang out in her living room before your seating time. There is street parking, but there is also a parking lot next to her building.

At 2pm, Jorgina came up and started checking everyone in and then escorted you down to the basement where the meal will be served. For the brunch, it included: 

1.  Black beans- This was very good with lots of flavor.
2. Basmati Rice
3. Collard greens- lightly seasoned
4. Plantains- my absolute favorite dish anywhere!
5. Farofa- looks like quinoa. A little sweet. I liked it.
6. Orange Salad
7. Vinaigrette
8. Wings- Oriental style, these were ok. Nothing out of the ordinary
9. Beef Ribs- Excellent. They are very tender.
10. For dessert- it was a red velvet and flan cake. 

It is BYOB, so feel free to bring your own drinks. The seating downstairs is pretty cramped and there is no air conditioning. She has a portable air conditioner, but it does not cool the room one bit. The doors were opened, which I don&#39;t think helped since it had just rained and the heat just added to the humidity. I was sweating in my seat because it was so hot. I would recommend going here in the fall when it&#39;s cooler out so you won&#39;t be so hot. It was a little hard to enjoy the food from the heat. There is plenty of food to go around so you don&#39;t have to worry about not having enough."

I bought a Groupon because we wanted to try new food. When we arrived we were greeted by the waiter. He explained how the menu worked and we were under the impression that the side dishes were &#34;All You Can Eat.&#34; 

After we received our main entree dish we decided to serve ourselves a second dish of sides to accompany our main entree. We had a horrible experience when the owner snatched the plates from our hands and mumbled a few words. We explained that we just wanted some rice and that we were not going to be wasteful. She didn&#39;t listen to us. We double checked the menu and it clearly stated &#34;All You Can Eat&#34; side dishes. 

The worst part is that she rudely scraped the leftovers from the side dish on top of the main entree. We could not believe what happened. We were shocked. She ruined our appetite and our brunch date. So much for trying new places. This had never happened to us before. We will not be going back and will not recommend this place to others."

You had unlimited portions of rice and beans, veggies/fruit, chillies.  Just a note- the veggies has bits of mango which are delicious!!  For the lunch entree, I had the fish which was good.  The steak was also delicious.  I believe we paid no more than $15.00 per person. Oh and it&#39;s BYOB!!

The chef/owner was a sweetheart.  She was so warm and friendly.  It started to rain while we had dinner and we took a cab to the restaurant so she offered to take us back to work.  WOW!  

I will definitely return.  The food was delicious and the service was great.  You also don&#39;t find too many home cooked Brazilian restaurants in Chicago."

This small, intimate restaurant is located in an old house near the United Center and the Medical District.  The menu is Brazilian, but very different from (and perhaps more authentic than) the Brazilian steakhouse concept which has come to prominence in the last decade.  Instead, it features a small selection of plated entrees, accompanied by a sideboard selection of two kinds of black beans ( vegetarian and with pork), basmati rice, heart of palm salad, and relishes.  We were also served small, fluffy cheese muffins accompanied with a chutney of coconut, mango, and ginger; the combination was oddly evocative of memories of Christmas cookies from my childhood.

Our entrees were uniformly excellent.: 

Roupa velha, a mildly-spiced pulled pork dish with onions and collard greens.

Brazilian fish stew, cod flavored with coriander..

Brazilian top sirloin, thin strips of beef grilled with onions.

Dessert was a wonderful two-layered combination of flan and red velvet cake, accompanied by a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled with lime sauce.

Open only for breakfast, lunch, and Sunday brunch.  No liquor service, but BYOB-friendly.  They don&#39;t really have their own parking lot, but an adjacent lot belonging to the United Center is likely to be available when nothing is going on at the Center, which is to say most of the time."

From the moment you enter her home you feel welcomed. Nice, low music playing, waiting area (living room) seating design for smaller groups to sit, chat and enjoy small appetizers. 

The Sunday brunch began and we were asked to the lower level of the house where there is a professional-style kitchen and tables. Some are community style. Hubby and I wanted it to be more date-like so we opted for one of the few two-tops. 

Georgina runs through the menu, gives a little personal background and quite politely asks though it&#39;s buffet style dining eat all you&#39;d like but in smaller portions so if you dislike anything much won&#39;t go to waste. Got it. 

Nothing went to waste on any of my plates. Everything was impeccable. Well-seasoned, tender steak. Some type of cold collard green dish I&#39;ve tried several times to make. Mann. Salpicon chicken, black beans, perfectly cooked rice, shrimp. The list goes on and on. 

Everything was flavorful. Great service. Very unique experience. 

Tip: there&#39;s almost always a groupon for 2 folks 34 bucks. Just use the search feature."

Chef Jorgina (sp?) was very nice and personable showing me how she makes her spicy pepper sauce thing. Her food was just excellent. Loved the rice and beans, especially how she uses basmati because she likes the taste of it better. You can use Minute Rice for all I care because the beans were just so good. All of the food was really good. 

I came with Alisa M so check out her food descriptions. I think her being bothered by the heat moreso affected some of the food rating from her as I loved it all (asides from the wings which was liked a lot.)

Definitely will be back, but maybe not until fall unless the heat was just when we ate."

Everything was tasty - from the relishes, to the farofa, fried plaintains, kale salad, steak and pulled pork. Flan dessert with ice cream was alright, but I was happy to chow down on everything else.

4 stars because we waited about 45 minutes before we finally got seated for food and there was no coffee to wake me up from food coma after eating massive amounts of food. 

If you find the groupon for $30 for Sunday Brunch for 2, it&#39;s an amazing deal."

However after experiencing what we did tonight I have to say the following: Avoid this place. Now there is nothing around here other than the United Center, if you&#39;re driving make sure you have a high tech car alarm. You might also want to ensure that the United Center does not have any events going on because parking would be a nightmare. The food was alright in fact that is the only reason why I&#39;m even bothering to give this place a star. But be advised you could end up paying far more then what you were originally quoted. She steals from her staff, that fat tip your leaving, one would think would be split amongst the workers? WRONG! She keeps all of it, this women may come off as a sweet, kindhearted, gentile old lady. But she is a thief, and a liar. Our party had a promotional deal for the meal. There were 13 of us in total. After we drank and drank the bill was brought to us. Not only was it double what she had asked us to pay before, but she had the audacity to accuse us of stealing money from her. She should have honored the price she had stated to us beforehand. Steer clear of this place. The food was very mediocre and the home looked like an episode of hoarders tchotchke edition. As icing on this crap cake she thought that by threatening to call the cops we would fork over the money... You have been warned. Stay away"

I like how you have to ring the doorbell to get buzzed in. It&#39;s almost like being invited inside for a home cooked meal. I went during a weekday lunch. We started the meal with Brazilian cheese bread which would&#39;ve been better warm. There&#39;s a small buffet of sides with plenty of vegetarian options. The black beans and rice were the best. There was another yuca dish which had golden raisins and was crispy. The pearl couscous was really flavorful too. For the entree, I tried both the fish and shrimp. I liked the shrimp more because it has a good balance of coconut and peanut flavors. I thought the fish was a little over cooked and didn&#39;t taste that fresh. Overall, service was good and I loved the setting. I almost liked the side dishes more than the entrees but I would still recommend the shrimp."

We walked down through the door into what looked like someone&#39;s dining room and kitchen. Instantly I felt like I was at someone&#39;s lunch party, because I kind of was! Jorgina was in her kitchen preparing food and talking to employees.

 A buffet table was set up with chaffing dishes full of beans, vegetarian beans, hot jasmine rice cooked in vegetable broth, a kale salad with a light vinaigrette, and bowls of  assorted vegetables and tapenades. My boyfriend and I agreed that we could have filled up on that alone. The rice was incredibly flavorful, and my boyfriend said the beans tasted exactly like what he ate while studying abroad in Brazil. 

We were brought a small plate of pão de queijo, which was served with a warm pumpkin, coconut, and cinnamon marmalade. The spread was so good I found a recipe and am planning on recreating it at home.

We ordered the steak and the shrimp and 2 guarana sodas (brazilian sugar soda?).
The shrimp was very flavorful and my bf liked his steak too. But to be honest, the unlimited sides and the pao de queijo with spread stole the show!

Check out the beautiful painted staircase on your way out."

It was like going to a friends place, and his mom gives you the best dishes you&#39;ve ever tasted, leaving you wonder if this is some recipe passed on over generations. 

The shrimp and rest of sea food is the BEST I&#39;ve tasted. You must know I&#39;m from Kerala, India and fish is what we eat all the year. But this beats everything I&#39;ve tasted till date.

Sinha is the classic example of where Yelp is a great tool; without it, I would have driven up to the house on Adams where Sinha is based and taken one look and bugged out.  But after ringing the bell for my noon reservation yesterday, I popped in with a friend and had a great experience (admittedly, with the Groupon for two for lunch during the week).  We pounded the all-you-can-eat sides (rice and veggie beans were great, and the pasta is underrated) then got the steak; the sauce, the mango, the salad, all perfect, and my friend said her pork dish was great also.  Because we were the last ones eating, the owner gave us a tour of the property and the back patio; if I can trick eight other friends into making this work, I might come back and do a party upstairs.

We arrived earlier than expected but they were very gracious and brought us in to wait inside.  First floor is an eclectic mix of styles for decor with Brazilian music playing.  Small snacks were already waiting and they immediately offered glasses for our wine.  BYOB is great!

We waited as others arrived and some hot appetizers were brought around.  At our reservation time we were ushered downstairs for brunch.  Jorgina made every effort to make sure everyone was comfortable.  My wife and I were sitting at a high top.  Jorgina had her team bring out another table so we could be seated by ourselves on a low table for more comfort.  She then explained the food in lovely detail.  It was nice that she asked people to come back as often as they like and not waste food.

The food itself was an enticing mix of flavors.  It is not high end in terms of presentation but it was exceptional in terms of taste and charm.  I don&#39;t normally eat collard greens but her description and presentation won me over!

Lot of choice for everyone from carnivores to pescatarians to vegetarians.  A great place and a small adventure."

Her restaurant is located on west Adams, and is open for Sunday brunch by reservation/appointment only.  Although no one checked up on us when we walked in.  The restaurant is in her home.  We entered on the first floor for hors d&#39;oeuvres and beverages while we waited to be called to brunch. It was a warm summer day and although her home was comfortable, there is no air conditioning nor ceiling fans.  It is also BYOB.  Jorgina showed up about 20 minutes after we got there for a 2pm seating, ushering us to the lower level where there is seating for about 25 people on the same level as the kitchen.  The food is served buffet style, but first she takes you on a culinary explanation of the dishes and their origin which is information.  Jorgina is personable, charming and a gracious hostess.

The buffet had black beans cooked with pork, basmati rice, pulled pork and sausage, yucca, a sauteed chiffonade of collard greens which were not immediately recognizable.  Entering the kitchen there is more food: grilled vegetables including peppers, eggplant, steamed broccoli, fresh fruit, mushrooms &amp; peas, a chicken dish that I believe was called chicken bola, an eggplant pie (a la parmesan style) an assortment of chutneys, shrimp empanadas, grilled steak (to order) and forgive me if I missed a dish or two...there was a lot!

Overall the food was good, not stellar just good.  Jorgina makes the event with her personality and outgoing demeanor.  I heard from others that there are sometimes Brazilian dancers the liven things up, but we were not treated to such entertainment the day I went.  

I found many of the dishes lacking in spice.  The yucca was ground to a powder and was &#34;sandy&#34; in texture, I didn&#39;t get it nor did I get the addition of hard boiled eggs.  The pulled pork was dry and chewy.  The grilled vegetables were puny and very thinly sliced, while the chicken bola was lacking in spice, although well prepared.  The steak cooked to order was good, just ordinary sirloin.  I enjoyed the shrimp empanadas encased in a cornmeal based crust.  The combination of mushrooms and peas was delicious, while the assortment of chutneys didn&#39;t deliver on the promised &#34;punch.&#34;  

It was hot in the room and I was glad I didn&#39;t drink any alcohol.  They served some sort of flavored tea which was refreshing and iced water.  The service was pleasant and overall it was a nice experience.  I believe she is open for lunch during the week.  There is a 2pm and 4pm seating for brunch. The complete brunch is $30 and is probably worth it, but as pleasant as it was the food didn&#39;t bowl me over.  If you haven&#39;t had Caribbean/African/Brazilian food and want to experience this type of cuisine, definitely go.  It was a good experience but doubt if I will return."

She does all she can to make sure her food is enjoyed to its fullest. I was with a choosey eater. Jorgina noticed that this person didn&#39;t care for rice, beans or salad but did over hear that onions were a favorite. Lo &amp; behold, the side dish that appeared with the pulled pork (which is exquisite) was onions! The ambiance is beautiful, festive &amp; quite welcoming. If you have a chance, go upstairs &amp; see where she often holds events. Look outside the window to her garden &amp; see her vineyard.

I love this place, Jorgina, the food, music &amp; atmosphere. Whether a specal occasion or just the opportunity to chow on some excellent &amp; healthy food, Sinha is a fabulous choice. If i lived closer, I think I&#39;d be there several times a week!

It was awkward and my friends and I were uncomfortable.  The eating area is the basement of the home and it is small and crowded.  The cook will talk to the group as a whole and it was just awkward.

I have gone to many concerts and games over the past few decades and never new this amazing, hidden gem existed!!

As we walked into the foyer of a three-flat, we were welcomed by the singer and were told there were appetizers at various stations around the room.  Pretzel thins with a white spread and caviar and fresh made and fried chips with a spicy salsa.  Both were fantastic!  I had to make myself stop because I was afraid I would not be able to eat. the brunch.

When we got escorted downstairs, a waiter opened our cider bottle (You got that right, byob!!) and told us that he would pour some and bring down the bottle and full glasses.  As we sat by a couple we didn&#39;t know (Thank goodness, I love talking to people!), the owner/chef told us what was on the menu:  fried plantains, collard greens, pork, chicken (amazing spicy sauce, with a hint of ginger), fish, olives, eggplant, cheese mini-rolls, and dessert.  This woman is amazing when it comes to Brazilian food.  I polished two plates.  Holy belly buster!

While we ate, a female singer crooned the entire time and added to the ambiance and experience.  

What a creative idea!!  Invite small groups over to your three-flat and have them experience your culture.  This is not your normal Sunday outing!!"

We arrived at 2:20 and went to the front entrance and were confused to go up or down.  The top door had just the screen door so we chose that door.  When we got in, a bunch of people were just standing and sitting around and looked at us when we walked in. No one was there to greet us. I thought I walked in a private party in someone&#39;s living room, so I turned around and walked out feeling awkward.  We called the place to figure out where to enter, and she told us to proceed through the living room to the back patio.  We mustered up the courage and went back in and out to the patio, which was empty.

We sat there confused, there were 2 workers getting stuff set up, but no one said anything to us, so we just waited until people started coming.  The brunch started at 3. The food is a buffet and the host explains what is offered.   The Acaraje (shrimp stuffed black eyed peas) and steak was my favorite. I wish I would&#39;ve known it was BYOB and brought something to drink, although the hibiscus tea provided was amazing (and I don&#39;t like tea).  The family style environment was not for me. I prefer to have my own conversation and not listen to others, especially when they&#39;re talking loudly and its inappropriate table conversation.  Interesting experience, but I won&#39;t be back."

I love the homeliness about the place. It feels as if you&#39;re visiting a relative for a meal.  The home is inviting, the seating is arranged in a manner that makes it easy to converse with those around you, and it&#39;s BYOB!  There is a lot to park in next door as mentioned in other reviews."

She let me taste a persimmon for the first time. So I decided to come to her restaurant last week.  She cooks out of her home. I sat next to the kitchen. I ordered steak and while waiting for the steak, I got side dishes from the side dish bar. We got cheese biscuits and instead of butter, we got some kind of fruit and coconut milk and herb to put on the biscuits. Altogether, I got steak, rice, beans, salty kale, sweet kale, and some sweet potato mash with a refreshing Guarana Brazilia soda. Brazilian food is the healthiest soul food you can eat. Saboroso!"

Is the home cooked meal setting charming?  Yes. And if someone served me this as a guest in their home I would be grateful. But they&#39;re charging money and this is a restaurant and based on that it&#39;s just average. The steak is average - cooked properly but something you can find anywhere. The pao de quiejo or cheese puffs weren&#39;t warm and didn&#39;t have that much flavor. These have to be served hot or else they get hard. Sides - all average.

Are you ready to try something extraordinary and completely different dining experience? Don&#39;t come here unless you&#39;re ready to get out of your comfort zone.

I came here with my brother, girlfriend, and friend. It was my brother&#39;s idea and when we got to the restaurant, I was really skeptical. Umm... It was in a house?! We were seated in their living room for appetizers? Interesting. There was some entertainment, which was totally unexpected! The cook was unbelievably friendly. She mothered us. (Reminded me of my mom or grandmother). Don&#39;t have a family in Chicago? Come here.

The main course was ready and we were escorted down to their basement? Even more interesting! It was like a Thanksgiving dinner, but we were sharing a meal with strangers! It&#39;s not a big basement, so talk about being cozy with everyone! After dinner, we went back upstairs to dance. Although they made me enter in a booty-shaking contest in front of everyone (which was VERY embarrassing), I had so much fun. My girlfriend better not post that video you youtube!!! LOL.

This is like the Blue Man Group, you gotta try it at least once."

It provides an opportunity to come together on a Sunday afternoon for Brunch. It&#39;s very similar to going to a relatives&#39; house for a Sunday meal. The food is authentic Brazilian cuisine, and provides an opportunity to experience something different and cultural in Chicago, with that being said. Please make sure you a lot at least 3 hours for this brunch/event.

We went there as a group of four for Sunday brunch and there was about 40 people there total. Here are some things to be aware of. This all takes places at someone&#39;s private residence not a restaurant. During the winter the house is cold, which some might find acceptable. There will be at least 90 minutes between getting there, and eating the meal. The food is plentiful and served buffet style, so you can go for seconds if you wish.

I personally thought the food was OK, nothing mind blowing and slightly heavy.  However, due to the vibrant atmosphere, and presentation, music, dancing its certainly worth visiting at least once and experiencing. I am not sure I would go back for seconds. I definitely enjoyed my visit and meal there."

We called to reserve our seats, got there, rang a doorbell and we were greeted by the butler (?) Really? LoL I knew that the restaurant was in her house, but we were expecting to get there, sit at a table, order, eat, pay and leave. No no no! We sat at an open living room and waited for more people to show up. After about 15 minutes we were taken outside to the patio where we sat again and WAITED while we were served hibiscus tea and explained the whole damn story of how popular hibiscus is in Brazil. (I&#39;m brazilian born and raised and that was my first time ever drinking that tea) anyways! After all the yada yada, this lady stands up, introduces herself as Jorgina&#39;s friend and starts singing a capella (shoot me). After all this uncomfortable situation  we were finally taken back inside the house and got seated and shared a long table with everyone. (Ugh!) The food was all u can eat but honestly, not impressed at all. We were just so annoyed by the long wait and the singing, not impressed by the food and had to listen to Jorgina talk about the origin of feijoada and how Brazilians eat their food. Not to mention her friend who sang throughout lunch too. People didn&#39;t know if they ate or stopped to watch the lady walking around singing like Julie Andrews.

For my first attempt at Brazilian cuisine I thought I would skip the normal &#34;go to a restaurant and figure out what to eat on the menu&#34;. Nope, I went for the &#34;come to my home, listen to live music, and eat some home cooked Brazilian&#34;!!! No seriously, I went to this lady&#39;s house and she made me dinner. But then again, this is EXACTLY what she does. 

Tickets might be a little bit pricy for some people but I can say just with the live music and the food alone, it is worth it. I won&#39;t even go into the decor and set up (mainly because others have explained it so well) because it is something that should take you by surprise plus it adds to the overall experience. I&#39;ll admit in the beginning I was taken back, didn&#39;t have a clue what I was supposed to be doing or where I should go, but what got me through it all was the staff. They wait on you like you&#39;re family (a nice family). Joking and laughing through out the whole dinner but of course left you alone to eat. Then there is the lady of the house or &#34;Sinha&#34;. She is extremely warm and inviting. She explained what each food item was and a bit about Brazilian history and their cuisine. She has one of those infectious smiles and likes to joke around. She seems to be one of those women that is all smiles till you cross her and then look out.

Ok, so the food. Ah, the food. I couldn&#39;t stop eating, I&#39;m sure I went for thirds maybe fourths. Something about the spices and flavors, the chicken, the vegetables... I&#39;m drooling as I write this. I&#39;m actually having a hard explaining it because I can&#39;t stop my mind from thinking about eating it again. Basically it comes down to this, do you want to know what food tastes like when it&#39;s made with hard work, love, and a whole country&#39;s history behind it... go to Sinha!

hors d&#39;oeuvres--mango salsa w/chips and risoles, which are mini veggie empanadas.  salsa had a lovely, delicate flavor, sweet w/a hint of onion and perhaps cilantro? risoles were tasty bites of warm cheese. yum. perfect palate-teasers.

downstairs for lunch--the Brazilian iteration of black beans was one of the best i&#39;ve sampled. while my colleagues raved about the pulled pork--delicious, melt-in-your-mouth meatasticness, perfectly seasoned--i was a bigger fan of the chicken bobo: &#34;chicken breast cooked with yucca, coconut milk, ginger &amp; cilantro.&#34; i&#39;m not a ginger or chicken lover, but somehow my tongue found the flavor combination not only delectable, but alluring. it was a moment of food synergy--the ingredients combined to establish a harmonious sum far greater than its parts. i kept wanting to put more into my mouth. so i did. 

our set menu did not include a beef component, so it was a surprising treat to hear Jorgina announce the addition of steak with grilled pineapple. my non-vegetarian tablemates and i made a beeline for the cow, and i added a heaping portion of chimichurri on the side. my medium-rare portion was cooked to perfection, with a tenderness approaching the luxuriantly unctuous. more fun for my mouth. 

our office brought a modest selection of wines and beers, and i felt the sauvignon blanc was a fine complement for the meal.

red velvet cake with flan was delightful. not a transcendent finale, but delicious in its own right. the cake had a moist, coarse crumb, and the custard had the firmer consistency of flan--as advertised--but smooth (no scrambled-egginess here.) on the side was a simple scoop of vanilla ice cream with a lime syrup drizzle. 

all in all, one of the best meals i&#39;ve had out in a while. this place was good enough to bring me out of pseudo-yelp-review-retirement. it does not disappoint. don&#39;t miss it."

I had no idea what to expect upon entering this place.  It&#39;s located in a neighborhood that used to be the heart of the ghetto, but has recently been on the upswing.  The place is a three flat with no markings on the outside to let you know that you are outside of a restaurant (know the address).  You have to ring the doorbell at the front gate in order to get in.  

Once you enter you&#39;ll think you&#39;ve entered your grandmothers house with a Brazilian twang.  The first floor is where you&#39;ll have your cocktails and appetizers.  Jorgina, the owner, lives upstairs.  After finishing the unique appetizers you will be asked to go downstairs to the dining room.  The bottom floor consists of a dining room and a large kitchen.  There is a spread of food in between the kitchen and the dining room.  Jorgina will greet you and tell you about what she has prepared then you go to town.  

I had two plates and I had never felt so uncomfortably stuffed in my life.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  There was every kind of meat imaginable, but my favorite was the Brazilian rice and black beans.  I&#39;m going to need about six months to digest, but once I do I&#39;ll be back.

I felt like I was a guest at a family gathering. My ex husband is Haitian American and I really miss the family get togethers with the awesome Haitian food and music.  Sinha so reminded me of those days that I called my ex the next day and told him all about it.

We started out with some wine that we brought and appetizers. Then we hit the buffet and finished the afternoon off with a Samba show and lesson.  Yes, I danced.  I had to do something with all those calories I had just consumed.

Sinha (means lady of the house) Elegant Cuisine is Brazilian cooking at it&#39;s finest. And the name is apt- as this is a single family home that has been rezoned to be a restaurant for private gatherings.   

Jorgina Pereira, the owner, started a small catering business about 12 years ago because her family and friends loved her cooking.  Today- she opens her home to private parties where she and her amazing staff cook up specialties from Brazil.  I was amazed as I drove down Adams Street that this place actually existed as there is no signage or anything to indicate a place of business.

She sets up a small bar in the back (we had mojitos with sugar cane stirrers) and there are women dressed in the fanciful dresses and headpieces that make you feel that you are at a carnival!  We had cocktails upstairs and then went downstairs for dinner.  It&#39;s like sitting in someone&#39;s dining room as the food is set up buffet style along one wall and there are a variety of tables and chairs. 

The food was great!  Not too spicy, but with the opportunity to have it be as spicy as you want.  On the night I was there- there was salmon, Feijoada ( a Brazilian dish) many vegetable dishes, breads and cakes and some type of a pork dish.  All were delicious!
 
After dinner we went back up stairs for cocktails and dancing. There were Brazilian musicians and we kicked off our shoes and danced in front of the fireplace in the front room!

All in all- I&#39;d suggest this as a place to host your next party or business gathering.  It is unexpected, fun and really like having dinner at a friend&#39;s house.  I was also told that there is a Sunday brunch from 2-6 which is open to the public but that reservations are necessary.

Check out the &#34;lady of the house&#34; and you&#39;ll wonder why someone didn&#39;t tell you about this place before now!"
sinha-elegant-cuisine-chicago,Bill C.,r2kbOCQU7fXiYBarLjjVDA,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,24,6fp9_xKF8Y7rJrQgeQfm9A,4.0,2012-10-01,"Wow, honestly, this was unique experience.  I&#39;m quite a fan of this little home establishment.  I came here for a weekday lunch with a friend since I had the day off.  Like others have mentioned, this is located in the &#34;basement&#34;, more like the garden level of a tall 3 story residential home.  It was a very well lit room that was more long in depth than wide.  There were 4 different tables:  (1) Long dining table that sat approx 12-14 ppl, (1) smaller table off the side that sat 4 people, (1) medium table that sat approx 5-6 people where one side of the table are indiviidual chairs and the other side is sofa like seating (kind cozy), and (1) cock-tail table for two with high enough chairs so it&#39;s not awkward.

So my friend came at around quarter to Noon to have lunch.  We accidentally went up the first floor instead to knock on the door.  We were supposed to go the garden level door.  Mental note next time to go downstairs instead.

Very nice decor that make it home-y, reminds of very nice arranged dining room.  There was use of cream color table cloth with bright, colorful cloth napkins.  Colors that I would percieve as brazilian culture (I&#39;ve never been to Brazil, but that&#39;s what I imagine).  

Is it hot inside?  I was afraid it may be given it was 90 degrees at 11:30am  two  months ago,  but it was actually very comfortable because of 4 reasons:  1. we were there early in the day.  2. it was garden level.   3.  there were fans.  4.  enough natural lighting that didn&#39;t require use of lights that would only add heat.

We sat the large dinner table, but since were basically only there we just had the entire table to ourselves.  perfectly fine and actually made me feel more at home.

Food was excellent.  The buffet comprised of basmati rice and beans (with pork or vegetarian) and also salad.  The rice was great probably because it was good quality or it was freshly cooked.  The beans were a little to salty for me, but I didn&#39;t really mind it.  (I know there a little salty for me personally because I&#39;m pretty thirsty 2 hours after lunch).  Lettuce is shredded romaine lettuce with fresh tomatoes and eggs and peppers and other condiments if you&#39;re interested.

The main entree were excellent.  Of course i can only speak to what I ordered which was Morqueca de Peixe which comprised of comprised of codfish with lemon juice and coriander seed.  So the dish itself was 2-3 small fillet of the cod (each filet was approximately my two thumbs to together in size.....or think about it as small buffalo wing, but all meat). There was  small piece of plaintain and some greens on the side and slice of mango. The mango was sliced up and inverted so the mango fruit much how Asians do it.  But the mango here was cut up pretty fance and it looked rhomboid shaped instead of cube shaped as how i would do it.  In fact, the mango was easy to eat, you could use the fork to pick at all the meat of the mango.

Anyway, i just spent 5 lines on the mango when I should spoke more about the fish.  The fish seasoned very well and tasted great.  It didnt&#39; blow me out of the water, but certainly a solid dish.  Fish was not too dry.  I wonder if it was baked.

Overall, food is nothing to get terribly full on, but was it nonetheless a good and healthy meal and good experience with enough food to last you to the late afternooon.  If  you&#39;re want to get full meal, you should take your $12 to subway and can get 2 foot long subs.

Anyways, great place for weekday lunch if you&#39;re off work, but not sure if i would get back to work on time if I had work that day.  I have time in the future I&#39;d like to try there weekend brunch."

After so many years in IT, Brazil native, Jorgina Pereira, decided to be her own &#34;CEO&#34; and started doing Brazilian catering full time.   She told me, &#34;After a while, I was so homesick for my food and music and I thought if I can make a little part [of] Brazil in Chicago, the winters won&#39;t seem so bad.&#34;   And, indeed, the Sunday brunches she has been hosting for a year in her elegant three-story Victorian near the United Center add a lot of warmth to our often chilly and very windy city.

Periera welcomes guests at 2 p.m. into her antique-filled first floor salon with appetizers and drinks, inviting them to the lower-level dining room when the brunch is ready. There, they find colorful fabric-covered tables bearing rows of pretty chafing dishes and counters of colorful salads and meats.

Brunchers can gather at one of the large or small tables in the dining room or in the sunny back yard, which is mostly protected from the sun by a big canopy. Some folks mingle at shared tables while others chat with friends -- a group of students learning Portuguese are regular patrons.  

And if you think you are &#34;done&#34; after eating ... not a chance... the best if yet to come.  After brunch, diners can return to the upstairs parlor for a dance performance by a hot Brazilian couple---donning feathers and all, Carnival style---- who will teach you how to samba or salsa dance.  ... or you can lounge around the house as the afternoon fades into early evening.

Menu highlights: 
Feijoada (Brazilian national dish of rice, beans and smoked and dried meat), collard greens with orange salad and farofa (cassava flour) and fried bananas. Wide assortment of salads, roasted and stewed meats, and rich coconut desserts.

Dress light ... 
Come for the wild feast.  
Stay for the hot and steamy dance.

Let&#39;s start with the food service. We went there for her legendary Sunday brunches, which has two seatings for the day. You are greeted up the main stairs (almost a story up from the street level) with delicious, freshly-squeezed juice and a huge series dippable treats and great live music. You&#39;re surrounded by a bright, happy room with many plants, mirrors and natural light.

When it&#39;s time for you to eat, downstairs to the grade level you go and enjoy a large selection of fruits, cooked veggies and meats in the kitchen. The food is reminiscent of my travels to Brazil but a little more limited. The waitstaff is attentive and helpful, just after you&#39;re introduced to the cuisine du jour by Chef Jorgina herself. It&#39;s though you&#39;re sitting in someone&#39;s dining room. And there&#39;s not a ton of people here, but it still feels a little cramped. Still the food more than makes up for it.

After brunch, you are treated to the outdoor patio that is decorated by brightly-colored tableclothes and walls with growing grapes she uses to make her own wine. Enjoy coffee and Jorgina&#39;s storytelling out back, then you head out to the parking lot.

Now... The second part. Our idea of the brunch was a taste-testing (at Jorgina&#39;s request) to get a taste for her food for our wedding in a few months. We enjoyed the experience so much we met with Jorgina a few months later to discuss our options. She was very eager to work with us, even meeting us at 8p to accommodate our schedule. But after the initial meeting, and after e-mailing and calling a couple times, we never heard back from her. We were very excited to work with her. I hope nothing happened.

In all, it&#39;s DEFINITELY worth visiting for brunch. Definitely. And it would&#39;ve been four-stars if not for the bad taste in my mouth for the catering. But it definitely doesn&#39;t affect her ability to make mouth-watering food. Enjoy!"

...But a few minutes later there was a couple dancing tango. And then a cute guy and a girl came shimmying down the steps to dance in head dress and spangles - carnival style. They made a nice speech in honor of MLK Jr. (tomorrow is MLK Jr Day).

This is a culinary true delight! I&#39;ve been craving to make feijoada (Brazil&#39;s black bean stew) after visiting Rio last summer. Yesterday my husband surprised me with Sinha for my graduation party. It didn&#39;t click when I met Jorgina. 

You see I yelped Brazilian food in Chicago--sure the churrascharias such as Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brasil popped up---but I wanted just simply brazilian food besides their barbeque. Sinha came up and I&#39;ve been dying for months to get the group of friends we traveled with to go. Jorgina  is the owner to Sinha and the one who took care of this wonderful, mouthwatering experience for my family and close friends. 

She catered the party at my parents&#39; beautiful home. There was a bartender who served caipirinhas (just like I remembered sitting by the beach at Ipanema) and we had for an appetizer hearts of palm croquettes...our dinner buffet was churrasco (steak filet cooked perfectly) with chimmichurri sauce,  oh----and the feijoada which is accompanied with different platters of meats served with black beans, onion, and garlic. It is served with malgueta peppers (HOT!) and sliced sweet oranges, arroz brasileiro (sauteed white rice), couve (kale), and farofa (finely ground manioc root (cassava)----it reminds me of cornmeal---this goodness is what you sprinkle on the feijoada or on your meats...it has also carrots, raisins, slices of egg, nuts added in...this buffet was just crazy silly!!!! I loved it all!

I have friends and family who went back for seconds and thirds. My mom gave winning points to my husband for finding this gem. For the discreet palates they were in awe, too. 

I highly recommend Jorgina&#39;s Sinha if you want a cook&#39;s tour to Brazil. You will not regret it!!!"

There are two seatings, 330p and 500p. There is an upstairs and a downstairs.  To start off the meal there were appetizers upstairs in the living room.  I could not stop eating them!! To build up an appetite, there was a Brazilian dancer to show us some Latin moves.  Somehow I got dragged into dancing...... after dancing we went downstairs to eat, buffet style.  Everything is cooked by the owner Jorgina Pereira.  This restaurant is actually her home (she lives on the top floor). Everything was delicious! Lots and lots of food. Lots of desserts to try too!!! Seating is family style so be prepared to enjoy your meal with strangers!  Parking is plentiful. Cost is about $35 and they accept credit cards. Yay!"

I had a pickup order of beef green curry, shrimp pad kee mao and crab Rangoon. The crab Rangoon was more similar to the ones you get from Thai bowl (also on Taylor Street). The green curry was a little bit spicer than you would get at Thai bowl, which I enjoyed &amp; the pad kee mao was probably my favorite. The only reason this doesn&#39;t have a 5 star is that they charge extra for choosing a meat (beef, chicken or shrimp) but don&#39;t include that in the menu as an extra charge. The other places around, like Thai bowl &amp; Golden Thai, don&#39;t have an added price for the meats because it states that the dish comes with one. I would appreciate it if the added cost was incorporated in the menu so ppl know exactly how much they&#39;re going to spending. I wasn&#39;t told there was going to be an extra cost and was surprised when the bill was higher than I expected, not by much and I didn&#39;t mind but I almost didn&#39;t have enough for everything in cash. Overall food was great and would come again.

Oh! And I was especially annoyed of the added cost (2$ for shrimp, really not much) because I only had about 3-4 pieces of shrimp in my dish (the pad kee mao). I was willing to overlook it though because of how tasty it was."

The evening turned a bit chilly for the Texas girl, so we decided to order in. We got a call from the delivery driver requesting we come down because he wasn&#39;t able to park in front of the hotel. No problem, right? I went down to the lobby...no delivery guy. Walked outside...no delivery guy. Waited 20 minutes, literally. He called again. By now, the wife had arrived down to the lobby wondering what the hold up was. She walked out and discovered the man walking towards us. We finally received our food. Apparently, he had gone to the wrong address. 

In regards to the food...She&#39;d ordered the pad thai and Tom kha gai soup. I had the chicken satay and teriyaki salmon.  We ordered mango sticky rice for dessert. The pad thai was dry and lacked flavor; soup was bland; salmon was pretty good; chicken satay was dry and overcooked, and the peanut sauce had an odd gelatinous texture. Her favorite part of the meal was the mango sticky rice. 

Our overall experience was a poor one. Aside from the delivery snafu, which we could overlook, the food was mediocre."

The interior/seating area looks a little antiquated, but this sort of adds to that authentic vibe I get from here. I ordered carryout over phone, and my order was ready within 15 minutes. 

I ordered the Tom Yum Soup with Tofu, for a price of about $7. The soup was really good! It was pretty hot (came with crushed red chili peppers in the soup) and had a lot of flavor; I really enjoyed the spicy yet sour/garlic flavor. Portions were generous, and the Tom Yum soup came with plain noodles on the side. I really enjoyed the food, and you can get pretty high quality, flavorful Asian food for a pretty cheap price. This is a great carryout option, and they even give UIC students a 10% discount! 

All in all, this is a pretty good place to try some relatively cheap, flavorful Thai food, and I will probably be back in the near future!"

I have to say that Khaosan definitely reigns high on the list, and is my new go-to spot for Thai in the area.

The restaurant is tucked away on the ground floor, so it may be easy to miss. Once inside, you&#39;ll see plenty of seating options available, including those for large groups. I actually came here for a rather large dinner when Arden Cho came to visit UIC, and they were gracious enough to provide space for us to enjoy our meal.

Now, let&#39;s talk about the food. Out of all the other Thai joints around, this one serves up some of the best appetizers I&#39;ve had. From the fried tofu and satay to the vegetarian spring rolls, Khaosan definitely tops over the competition. As for their main entrees, I was thoroughly satisfied with my spicy tom yum, with a side of sticky rice. There was actual flavor in my soup!

But wait for it...yes no cutlery. So, we waited for another twenty minutes. Oh, the place wasn&#39;t packed so the waitress cannot blame the crowd. 

Now the food quality. We soon found out that the rice was not completely cooked. Seriously, how hard is it to cook rice properly?! Apparently, an extremely hard and unsurmountable task for the cook at Khaosan &amp; Taylor. My green curry wasn&#39;t great either -- it was watered down with three small pieces of chicken.

My boyfriend ordered the Thai basil. He said the chicken was relatively flavorless but that the broth was very flavorful. He requested 4 on the spicy level (1-5). The dish was not as spicy as he had hoped. 

I ordered the pad Thai. The dish was relatively flavorless. The taste was very uniform and I felt like something was missing but I couldn&#39;t quite put a finger on it.

I have been multiple times because someone in my house loves this place (but they also order the same thing every time they go). 

I have a nut allergy and always ask for no peanut sauce or cashews in my food. Whenever my food arrives, it has nuts in it. One time I didn&#39;t realize and started eating the food. I could&#39;ve died because of the waitresses mistake! The nuts were finely chopped and mixed in so I couldn&#39;t see them. 

Sometimes they will leave out the nuts and substitute something without asking me. This is NOT okay either. You should ask a person if it is okay to substitute peas for nuts before doing so. Also, the portion sizes are small, and even when I get my food and we have an appetizer, I leave hungry.

I was asked the spice level I prefer. I wanted spicy but was only given an enormous amount of black pepper on my dish, not spice. So disappointed and really wanted to support this small business because it&#39;s family owned and operated and seemed like the food would be fresher and cleaner than the other Thai option which is Thai Bowl (a block over across the street). However, after my second experience - there&#39;s NO WAY I&#39;M RETURNING. I ordered a standard dish off the menu and the chicken was served far under cooked (see picture)!

My friends and I decided to check this place out and to give it a try after seeing the 5-star rating from just about 16 reviews. This place used to be Thai Wok, which honestly I liked. Too bad they had to close the business down. I think Khaosan &amp; Taylor took over this place pretty recently.

Honestly I wasn&#39;t really hungry so I only ordered 1 dish - the Thai Fried Rice with Beef. I liked how it had Kai-Lan (Chinese Kale/Broccoli) in the fried rice. It was decent, although it wasn&#39;t exceptional either.

My friend ordered the Khao-Moo-Dang (Thai-style BBQ Pork) and told me that the BBQ Pork was pretty good. Although he was a bit disappointed because the menu clearly says that it comes with Hainanese Rice but instead he only got regular white rice. And the rice was kinda cold as well. Another friend ordered the Penang Curry and he seemed to enjoy it.

This is not a comprehensive review in any way and I will update it again once I give this place another shot and try their other more authentic/unique dishes. The place has a cute patio with hanging light bulbs and pretty flowers by the windows.

I&#39;ve tried so many Thai Restaurants in Chicago and so I know which ones are good and which ones are okay. I will give this restaurant a 2nd shot and hopefully they can impress me this time. But so far, based on this first visit, there&#39;s still a lot of work to be done if they really want to compete with the plethora of Thai Restaurants in Chicago."

They have a spice rating system from 1-5, and they ask you to pick a number. I usually pick a 4, and the spice is well integrated into the food, rather than dumped on as an afterthought. Admittedly, the systems subjectivity means that its a hit and miss, but for the most part, the spiciness is what I had expected and chosen.
The portions are HUUUUGE! I have a healthy appetite and I can never finish an entree by myself. The soups alone are sufficient to have as dinner. The Panang curry (spice level 4) is pretty much comfort food by now. 
The staff is super friendly and efficient, and special shout out to this place for making the vegetarian versions of their dishes as solid and substantial as their meaty counterparts!"

I ordered the veggie spring rolls, red curry with tofu and spicy basil with vegetables. The spring rolls, I didn&#39;t care for them too much. They came with a sweet and sour sauce which was quite flavorful. But the other two dishes were stellar. I had mentioned medium spicy for the red curry - and it still packed quite a punch. Loved it - I was not prepared for so much flavor. The spicy basil dish was also perfect. 

The reason I am taking 1 star off is because it took more than an hour and a half for the food to get delivered. I did call them to enquire and they apologized for the delay. I was fully expecting the veggies in the dishes to get soggy by the time they were delivered - but that was not the case. It was just perfect.

We could see they were preparing everything fresh to order - that was the highlight! I&#39;d want to try a curry without killing my taste buds before I can comment on the flavors. It was good enough for me to want to return!

I ordered the papaya salad. The flavor is legit and the portion is ginormous. The papaya salad was tossed with green beans. It was topped with a generous scattering of peanuts and two huge, plump shrimp. I&#39;m not Thai and I&#39;m no Thai food connoisseur but I think it may have been Isaan-style. The dish tasted savory, pungent, and kickass. It&#39;s the kind of dish that grows on you while you&#39;re eating it. The server told me they may start assembling the papaya salad tableside. 

I also ordered a green curry with extra vegetables. It was delicious and hit the spot. 

I wish I lived in Chicago so that I could visit again!"

The order came 1 hour and 40 min after placing the order when they told me 45 min. I specifically asked 2 spice level on both. The fried rice was cold and soggy...disgusting.

I ordered pad se ew, pad Thai, red curry with pork, green curry with chicken, another beef dish and some egg rolls! Everything was pretty good. Pad Thai is the best I&#39;ve had in a long while. Husband loved the curry in green sauce. Bought the red bc of the reviews but I think I&#39;d agree with my husband that the green was a bit tastier. Think it just depends how spicy you like it.

The spicy basil leaves were set on top of the Pad Kee Mao instead of on the spicy basil dish. I also ordered the Tom Kha soup. The flavors were not all there. There was no spice, no citrus or coconut flavors. There was also a very huge piece of ginger root in the Tom Kha, much bigger than i have ever experienced at any other Thai restaurant. Of course the spicy basil dish did not taste like it should have either. There were some good flavors in the food but over all I was very disappointed that I spent so much at this place, for less then mediocre Thai cuisine."

Tom Kha (sp?) soup: chicken, spicy, creamy, amazing. Normally I don&#39;t eat any of the soup when my wife orders it. I almost finished her bowl for her. Very filling too. 

Spicy Papaya Salad: other than the fact that it came with those creepy little itty bitty shrimp this was fantastic. Perfect blend of spicy and sweet and refreshing on a summer day. 

Pad See Ew: I ate until it hurt. And I will do so again in the future. 

Drunken Noodle: nice savory flavor. Good veggies. Chicken cooked to perfection.

I asked for lots of veggies and they gave only bell peppers.   On the positive side, they owner came over, apologized profusely and gave me a 30% discount, and didn&#39;t charge me for the rolls.

It is seriously so delicious. I&#39;m from NYC and am somewhat of a Thai food snob, so I was a bit skeptical of the great reviews other yelpers gave this place - and of the tiny restaurant&#39;s fairly dingy interior, but the food is soooooo good. I ordered the pad see ew, a safe standby, and I think it&#39;s up there with the best noodles I&#39;ve ever had. They were light and fluffy, not dense and sticky, and perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend had the green curry, extra spicy, which was actually spicy enough and had fresh jalapeños. We would definitely go out of our way to come back here again. I think this place mostly does take out, but in the summer there&#39;s a little outside patio which was very pleasant to sit in."

Over 20 minutes later, a drive that takes less then 10 when the traffic is at it&#39;s busiest, the food arrived... Cold. As normal humans, I called the place and complained and told them I didn&#39;t want the food and I wasn&#39;t going to pay for it. They made up a ton of excuses as to why the food was cold, &#34;It&#39;s cold outside&#34; was one, apparently having never heard of an insulated container.  I ended up talking to the &#34;owner&#34; who told me I could get a credit on my next order, but not a refund -- because, yes, I do want to order cold food again (sarcasm).  Then he tells me that I will have to talk to the owner (wait, I thought that was you), and that he would call me tomorrow.  I&#39;m not holding my breath.  Basically, wait 2 hours for cold food, horrible customer service, and it only cost me $50+ to find out that I should just give up on finding a good Thai place that can also deliver."

My boyfriend and I were really craving oysters so I searched up places that had a great happy hour for oysters. Oyster bah popped up pretty high on the list and was a great location. Their happy hour runs pretty long during the weekend 3-6 it&#39;s usually 5-6 on the weekdays. I made a reservation really easily on opentable the day before and showed up. They had more than enough seats and offer their happy hour anywhere you sit. I really hate places that only offer their happy hour JUST at the bar. That just really irks me so I was happy we could sit comfortably at a table and still indulge at the happy hour special.

They were pretty straight forward about which oysters were half off so we chose half a dozen of each (there were only 2 options). They did have an impressive list of oysters I wish they were all on the happy hour deal. They also had clams on the half price happy hour but we stuck with oysters. I wish they had more options for happy hour like drinks and what not that would&#39;ve been nice. We ended up ordering a bottle of rose with our oysters and the waiter was super nice and always making sure our glasses were full. We ended up ordering another half dozen of the east coast oysters but both oysters were great choices. We were still hungry so ordered the grilled octopus. This dish was perfectly cooked and I suggest ordering it if you want something small to eat. 

This will definitely be my go to oyster spot place! It&#39;s super close to the train and it&#39;s such a great area with bars and other good restaurants around!"

We tried a few cocktails on the menu, and even though we were told the cocktails were on the dry side, I thought they were on the sweeter side and not well balanced. I had the seafood salad, which had somewhat wilted lettuce and incredibly fatty dressing. Considering the salad was more expensive than a lot of seafood entrees on the menu, I had higher expectations. At least they can come up with a lighter alternative to louis dressing, which is all mayo. Fish and chips was nothing to write home about. Overall, it&#39;s a incredibly boring menu at inflated prices. 

The service: 2/5. Not particularly attentive. No one checked if we wanted another round of drinks and our bill was brought without asking if we wanted dessert. 

Overall: 2/5.  Oyster Bah has a vibe of an upscale Applebee&#39;s with zero creativity and overpriced entrees. Solid &#34;meh&#34; category."

We made reservations so we were able to sit right down. Making reservations is highly recommended because the location is small and does get very busy and crowded. 

We ordered the oysters which were our waiters choice. Overall very tasty and shucked perfectly. The calamari we ordered had a very greasy batter and I didn&#39;t even finish it. Finally the seafood roll we ordered was small and very overpriced. Overall the oysters were tasty but everything else we ordered seemed overpriced and the taste was not worth it at all. 

The drinks I would recommend. I ordered the &#34;cape for a cause&#34; and &#34;starbird&#34;. Both really good but the starbird was definitely my favorite. Its a take on a margarita. 

In the end I probably wouldn&#39;t go back unless they had specials on oysters during the week for a quick bite."

Now for the food. They had a nice selection of oysters. I think we tried 4 types total. We liked the Kumamoto oysters the best. They were all very fresh. We also ordered the grilled oysters, and those were really good too. My husband ordered the New England seafood platter, and I had the Thai red snapper. Both dishes were pretty good. We made room for coconut cake, and they gave us a free scoop of peppermint ice cream. Both were delicious.

I made a reservation for my husband and two girls on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm thinking it wouldn&#39;t be the busiest time which is good since I&#39;m bringing my kids. We got in and it was pretty empty so that was nice and I liked their cape cod like atmosphere! That&#39;s definitely nice! 

So we ordered their happy hour oysters that came to like $1.50 a piece which isn&#39;t a bad deal and I got some west coast and east coast ones to try. Honestly, they weren&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, didn&#39;t taste as fresh as I would have liked and the place is called oyster bah so I had high oyster expectations. We also got their wicked calamari which is fried calamari with a bunch of other veggies, I felt like the ratio of veggies was more than calamari and for $14 i thought that was okay.
What we did love were the lobster rolls. They were $27 and it came with 3 little lobster roll sliders, again I felt like it made it look bigger than it was since it&#39;s mostly bread and then there is some lobster chunks. But it certainly was delicious and I would still get it because the fries that it came with were crispy and tasty as well.

We were full from everything so we skipped out on dessert. But I would have wanted to try their coconut cake or key lime pie. Our server was also a little pushy and didn&#39;t care for him so overall our experience was okay, some of the food was good, some was a miss but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be back."

It&#39;s on Halsted, a trendy street with some really good eats (and it&#39;s Chicago so plenty of bars too). Their specialty is oysters from the east and west coast. We had a dozen ($3 per) from 6 regions (did you know east coast oysters are more briney,  and west coast oysters have a scalloped shape?). We loved them all. And the best was the champagne vinegar (they mix champagne with vinegar, sugar and salt and herbs, freeze it and then chip off some for each oyster serving)... how can we ever go back to horseradish tomato sauce- we can&#39;t! We shared a nice roasted beet salad and fried whole snapper with coconut rice and Thai chili sauce. The fish was lovely and delicate and perfectly quick fried and dipped in the Thai sauce it was so so good. For dessert the hubs had clam chowder (for real) and he said it was the best ever and I had their famous coconut cake. Omg that cake was the moistest and most delectable cake I&#39;ve ever had and not too sweet just naturally so. Gotta make reservations because the place is packed and a lively bar scene too. Decor is modern rustic with an updated marine room look (no dark lighting). The service was impeccable. The waiter knew the oyster selection, menu and drink items.

Overall, a much better experience than my first visit. My boyfriend and I started off with the calamari because I raved about it from the first visit. Calamari was still good however half of the order was deep fried lemons. We tried a few oysters, pretty good - I can&#39;t remember what we tried but both were tasty. for the main course, he ordered the mussels and I ordered crab cakes. Unlike his delicious mussels (really good) my crab cakes were VERY tiny and did not resemble a crab or crab cake taste. They were sort of a let down for the $26 I paid. Again, his mussels were great and I would come back for those. Really a shame that two trips and the entree I choose disappoints me. I now have an understanding of what not to get.

May come back again for bloodys and mussels but not crab cakes."

Nice selection of oysters, but by 7:30pm on a Friday night, the selection of 10 varieties had been whittled down to 7 choices.  Our server was knowledgeable however, so we trusted her suggestions for alternate sections. Hand-crafted cocktails were tasty.  Wine selections were seafood friendly,  but def on the pricey side.  

New England Seafood Platter was OK, not great.  3 butterflied shrimp were left on the grill too long, and were dry/overcooked.  The 2 sautéed scallops, and the lump crab cake were flavorful.  The small portion of jasmine rice with parsley was barely warm.  Fish &amp; Chips were good.  Matchstick french fries were crispy, and lightly battered haddock was moist.

Chowdah: delicious but scarce on the amount clams. Could have used some chopped chives, scallions or parsley for a little extra flavor and color.

Stuffies (stuffed clam): you get one clam for $9 - yikes! Hard to taste the clam and chorizo amongst al the bread crumbs.

Our waiter, Clayton, was awesome! Very friendly, funny, patient, knowledgeable and calm and cool. And very accommodating - he brought over 3 extra hot sauces for us to experiment with.

All of these was very fresh and very good! 

We also got the Kennebec Fries on the side which were great!

All-in-all it was a very nice evening and while I would certainly come back nothing about this place stood out as being amazing or special.

I&#39;ll be at Oyster Bah.

Yes, that&#39;s how much I loved this place. I&#39;m a bit of a seafood addict, and, in my dream life, I walk down a rock New England beach each day, meandering to lunch in my favorite seafood shack.

That&#39;s probably not going to be my reality anytime soon, but eating at Oyster Bah sure filled that void.

We went recently on date night, wanting a good, but casual, meal. The vibe at OB--complete with kitschy seafood shack decor--really fit the bill. We&#39;d made reservations, which I&#39;d suggest, and were seated immediately. 

I expected all of the good raw bar options: oysters, crab legs, shrimp, etc. What I hadn&#39;t expected was the entree listings, which were packed full of pretty much every one of my death row meals: lobster roll, fish tacos, NOLA BBQ shrimp, whole fried snapper in a Thai sauce. I could go on.

Our poor waiter, who was AMAZING, fielded a gazillion &#34;what would you order?&#34; questions.

We ended up with oysters--both raw and charbroiled, crab bites (OMG--can I have these instead of a birthday cake?!), tuna poke (needed a bit more spice and salt, but pretty good), clam chowder, garlic bread, fish tacos, and the whole fried snapper. Everything was insanely delicious, fresh, and plentiful. 

We also had two cocktails, including The Cape--their take on a cranberry and vodka. Also delicious.

For dessert, they only have two options: coconut cake and peppermint ice cream with hot fudge. We did what any self-loving people would do; we ordered both. WOW. You really don&#39;t need multiple desserts when the ones you have are so gosh darn perfect.

Our bill was well over $250, which was a bit much for a casual night out, but what could we expect? We ordered half the menu.

It was tough deciding which entree to order, so I asked our helpful waiter how he would rank the three dishes that caught my eye.  His vote: 1- burger 2- fish &amp; chips 3- po&#39;boy.  I was surprised that the burger was the top suggestion at a seafood place, but boy was he right.  It was juicy, cheesy, and filling (especially with the fries).

After all, there are at least 10 different east and west coast oysters daily, a cocktail  list that has a little of something for everyone, and servers who really seem to love what they do.

But after two months, they are still working out some of the &#34;new restaurant blues&#34; which I found surprising, given this is a Lettuce Entertain You concept and usually they nail it from day one.

But I digress.  This was actually my third try to get into the Oyster Bah.  On my first attempt, the hostess told us we &#34;didn&#39;t need a reservation but just to come before 6:30&#34;.  So we did.  Only to be told when we arrived at 6pm that the earliest that they could seat us would be after 10pm.  And clearly she told this to others as well as the two couples in front of me had the same story at the hostess stand.  And if she sends you down the basement to the &#34;Crab shack&#34;, know that the space there is even tinier so all the people who didn&#39;t fit upstairs are now downstairs.

On my second attempt, there was an OpenTable glitch and while I had the much needed reservation, they couldn&#39;t find me in the System when we arrived.  Hmmm . . .so their sister restaurant Summer House was great about getting us in.

Third time&#39;s the charm and on this visit, the reservation went fine and we had a nice table for two, but on this visit, the kitchen pacing was off.  But let&#39;s start with the good.

Our server, Clayton, was terrific!  Friendly, knowledgable, and just all around nice, he was quick to suggest some of his favorite drinks and items on the menu, which of course we followed.

My friend had &#34;The Cape&#34; which was a vodka based cranberry drink (with crushed ice, my fav) and I had the Nor Easter which was rye based and smooth and creamy, says a lot for the drink as I am not a huge of rye.

We ordered a range of oysters to start as well as the tuna poke and a crab cake, but this is where the timing issues started.  We waited an hour (yes, I checked my watch) for the oysters to show up.  We were joking that they must be out catching them or that the little buggers were putting up a huge fight about being opened. The tuna poke (super fresh) came as did our crab cake (just like Shaw&#39;s and served with a horseradish sauce ) and both were excellent but still no sign of those darn oysters.  Odd given this place is called the &#34;oyster bah&#34;.

Our server was very apologetic and ended up comping the oysters, when they did come, which was very nice.

But the next delay came in getting our entrees to come up.  I ordered the trout which was delicious, split, fried in some glorious butter with crispy skin, then served with creamy potato salad and was spot on.  My friend had the BBQ shrimp and just like our server warned, was &#34;very messy&#34;.  The shrimp have their shells on which means you have to peel them through the BBQ sauce, thus the mess, but hot towels and lemons were provided to clean up afterwards.  

But this food, again, took a very long time to come up.  So much so, by the time we left, we had been at the restaurant for almost 2 hours and 20 minutes.  And while that would be okay in a fine dining restaurant with many courses, this place is all about a casual dining experience.

Also- save room, as while they only have 2 desserts on the menu, on this night, it was a coconut cake that was smooth and creamy and certainly calorie worthy!

If you drive, valet parking is available out front for $14.  And while this is casual dining, know that the prices may be higher than what a &#34;crab shack&#34; might conjure up.  Dinner for two with two drinks was $160 (the oysters had we been charged for them were another $18) but it&#39;s priced right for the quality of the food and the neighborhood.

All in all, I came,I saw,I ate.  But I am wondering what all the hype is about?  The food is good, the place is cute, but the timing hiccups are probably going to find me heading elsewhere to get my &#34;oyster fix&#34; until they get those resolved."

Doesn&#39;t have quite the same ring to it. 

On a mid-December Tuesday evening, I found myself seated downstairs in the nearly empty Crab Shack (Cellar) which, with its red-n-white picnic table cloths, mismatched chairs and black-and-nautical themed shortie bar, was acceptable enough in itself. Where it went awry for me...was the &#34;just my imagination...runnin&#39; away with me&#34; and &#34;every-body plays the fool...&#34; I&#39;m a fan of Motown but it just didn&#39;t seem to fit the scene. 

Something else was off: timing. 

Soup came out quickly - the clam chowdah was good, as compared to my other experiences with the Lettuce Entertain You Ent (LEYE) restaurants, and it tasted as expected.  

Then what? The Swordfish Schnitzel chef must&#39;ve been overwhelmed. The waiter explained &#34;it&#39;s the same kitchen as upstairs,&#34; (where it was bustling) but this server too, timing-wise, seemed uneven: pregnant pauses, an air of formality in a casual setting...the service just felt &#34;off.&#34;

As a fan of LEYE overall, I&#39;m happy to return and to try again. The schnitzel and accompanying potato salad was good, as expected, (&amp; hey, coming from Christkindl Market &amp; nabbing a tasty fish schnitzel, how fitting) even if the service/pacing/music downstairs was not exactly to my liking, I liked the menu choices. 

Next time, I&#39;ll stick to upstairs, eat oysters and enjoy the more vibrant atmosphere and hopefully a smoother dining experience. 

Oysta Bah!"

Making a reservation was very easy via opentable.com.  When I had arrived, I was greeted by the hostess and seated right away.  Dina M, server, had greeted me within a few minutes.  She was very polite and very professional.  Since I had reviewed the menu prior to my arrival, I had decided to order off of the Restaurant Week menu. Beginning with Shrimp Cocktail and then Fish n&#39; Chips for the entree.  

This is a smaller restaurant than most of the Lettuce restaurants with a nautical ambiance.  There is a small bar area.  The dining area has various size of tables.  A little cozy.

My appetizer was delivered - no complaints.   After the appetizer, the food runner had delivered the main entree.  The entree was just the right size and delicious.  Meanwhile, Dina would check in with me without being intrusive. 
 Great service!   I did save room for dessert.  I had ordered the Peppermint Ice Cream with Hot Chocolate Syrup on the side - excellent.

My entire experience was excellent.  I would highly recommend this restaurant and Dina M for service."

We started with a dozen oysters.  We mixed to get most of the menu and cover both coasts.  Our server (Nick) seemed to know quite a bit about the menu and was happy to help us pick what we wanted.  The oysters we all fantastic.  On top of that, the restaurant has some of their own hot sauces and they were all really good, too.

Both of our main dishes were really good.  I got the manila clams and gnocchi and was really happy with my meal.  It was rich and a good portion without leaving you feeling like you needed to be wheeled out.

In all, we will definitely be going back soon!"

Finally had the chance to stop in this week. Started off with a dozen of the oysters. I generally like west coast over east, and the Washington based oysters were by far the best. My friend had the blackened fish which I believe was actually the mahi, with the grilled asparagus. 

I went with the mussels which were massive. Generally I go with a spicy red sauce with mussels but their white garlic is amazing! Our waiter suggested dessert so we went with the coconut cake which was light and moist. Overall the food was amazing, I only wish the cocktail menu was a little more developed, but I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

Small inside which just adds to that cozy feeling of walking into an old, neighborhood east coast seafood joint. We were seated right away and after some recommendations on wine and food, we threw in a bunch of orders. Everything we had was amazing so I recommend it all! The oysters, crab bites, clam chowder, and poke were the apps worth getting. The snapper and the swordfish are two of their most ordered entrees- I can see why! For dessert the blueberry pie tasted like homemade. Phenomenal meal and service.
Downstairs is an even smaller space called the &#34;crab cellar&#34;. Its a bar and a few tables and they serve a few things there if you&#39;re hungry and can&#39;t get a seat upstairs. Their focus down there is the king crab platter. Be sure to grab a drink at the bar from the friendly bartender, Rudy.

I was actually way more impressed by my second Oyster Bah food experience(tonight)  in comparison to my first one. I was able to easily make a reservation for this Wednesday night dinner, but unfortunately we were running late due  to CTA delays. Despite our 15 minute tardiness, we were welcomed with a smile and seated right away. 

The dinner started with a refreshing glass of one of their white wines. For appetizers, my boyfriend and I ordered some of the oysters the waiter recommended, and also the fried calamari. I was very pleased with the taste and quality of the oysters, just like during my first visit. The calamari had a good balance of lemon and spice to it. The portion of the calamari is also very generous, and would be fine for groups up to 4 people. 

As my main dish I had the shrimp and grits, and the tomato type gravy that is used really complements the meal perfectly. I only had the shrimp and grits like 4 hours ago, but I can&#39;t wait to have it again. My boyfriend had the bbq shrimp, and that dish was unexpectedly delicious as well. When I imagined bbq shrimp, I almost was imaging some shrimp swimming in Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s or something. I don&#39;t know what this bbq sauce is made of, but it is unlike any other bbq sauce I&#39;ve ever had and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s homemade. My second Oyster Bah experience was wonderful in every way."

Crowded, very loud, and very pricey.

Clayton was an excellent server.  Oysters were good.  Garlic bread was ordinary.  Shrimp and grits were better than I&#39;ve ever had in New Orleans.  Coconut cake was moist and light, absolutely perfect.  Wine listing was very weak - good variety but few choices, I can&#39;t even call it a wine &#34;list.&#34;

End result:  We agreed, we&#39;ll stick with Shaw&#39;s,  Closer to home, not as noisy, larger menu selection, and similar quality food.  But if you&#39;re a lot younger than us and enjoy the noise and crowd, give Oyster Bah a try.  The food is outright fabulous."

We sat in the downstairs lounge area and were fretted by the world&#39;s best server, Dina.  We started with the Cape cocktails (delish!!) and ordered the stuffies right away.  Dina recommended a few dishes and we ended up with bowls clam chowder, red snapper, salmon, and fish tacos.  I loved my red snapper and would order it again.  My friends enjoyed their dishes as well.  

The lounge was an adorable spot, perfect for any occasion.  I loved the &#34;boat feel&#34; of the space and the cozier vibe.

We ordered three oysters each - their three most popular ones they had on the menu that night. I thought they were a tad overpriced for how small they were, but the taste made up for that. So fresh and so delicious. After that, we shared the Poke Poke (some of the freshest, best raw tuna and salmon I&#39;ve ever had), the Smoked Trout Dip (was very creamy, but that didn&#39;t overpower the fish which was excellent), and the New England Stuffies. I know everyone here raves about the stuffies, but I just wasn&#39;t a huge fan. They were a little dry and lukewarm by the time they arrived.

Why only four stars and not five: The place itself is pretty small. The jam a lot of tables into a small space, so we felt like we were on top of everyone else. The server was great once she arrived, but it did take a while to get our drink order. We ordered a bottle of white and it arrived after our first dish. Stuffies were just okay.

All in all, a pleasant experience. I&#39;d probably come back."

It took maybe 20 minutes for us to get our table but once we were seated our waitress was great. And because of the wait they gave us a dozen oysters for free! 

The oysters were delicious! We also had the tuna poke and it was really good. Over all a great experience. For a Friday night it was busy but not ridiculously overcrowded. I would recommend reservations!"

We went during happy hour and two oysters (1east+1west) are half off so of course we did that. My favorite are Pink Moon,Little Island, Shigoku, and Summerside. Least was the Kumamoto it didn&#39;t deliver the sweet taste finish. Pink moon and Shigoku did Yum! Trout dip was eh if u like mayo do it and the ceviche was subpar but we do that right in TX so try it at own risk. Clean, nice Place w a sweet waitress."

We went after lunchtime, prior to the dinner dinner rush, so we had most of the place to ourselves. Our hostess informed us we were just in time for happy hour* and that all oysters we half off, score! 

Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgable about the selection of seafood. Normally I wouldn&#39;t order a dozen oysters by myself, but the happy hour price of $18 wasn&#39;t bad. I ordered every single oyster that was offered! 

The oysters were delicious, and our waiter was very attentive and came back to discuss which ones were my favorite and the differences between east and west coast selections. 

However, when the bill came, we were charged the original price of $36 for a dozen oysters. After discussing with our waiter apparently only 2 kinds oysters are under the happy hour special. What? 

This was disappointing, as it doesn&#39;t say anything on the menu about only getting those 2 choices. While our server was apologetic we were still charged the full amount. Not a deal breaker, I just would have gotten those specific 2 or only half a dozen. 

Be sure to try the coconut cake before you leave! It changed my life. So moist and delicious! 

Overall a bit pricey, especially with the happy hour mixup, but the food was enjoyable. 

*happy hour is from 3-6pm Fridays through Sunday&#39;s. Please be sure to discuss with your server which oysters are included in happy hour, as this is not outlined on their menu."

Dad: Trout Dip appetizer, Fish and Chips
Mom: Tuna Poke appetizer, shrimp cocktail app as an entrée
Me: Originally lobster roll, substituted with BBQ Peel &amp; Eat shrimp
Dessert: Coconut cake

What was good:
-Tuna Poke was great but very small and my mother doesn&#39;t believe in sharing
-My Peel &amp; Eat BBQ shrimp was excellent and I thoroughly enjoy any appropriate reason to get BBQ sauce all over myself and have it be publicly acceptable
-Ambiance and décor is awesome
-In which countries is it legal to marry coconut cake? 

What was meh:
-the trout dip was just weird, but maybe I&#39;m just not a trout fan

What was bad:
-I originally ordered the lobster roll and it came out looking fine enough, but one bite set off a red siren in my head. My dad is the king of &#34;it&#39;s fine, just put it in your mouth and eat it&#34; so I had him take a bite...and for probably the first time in my life, he agreed that something tasted really off - almost sour and the lobster was uncomfortably warm. I was not in the mood for digestive issues that evening and flagged down the waitress, who was awesome about it and my new order came out in record time.

-The prices are higher than Willie Nelson. Let&#39;s break this down: I had 7 pieces of shrimp and two drinks. My dad had fish and chips, a thing of dip smaller than the size of my fist, and a beer. My mom had two drinks, 6 pieces of shrimp, and 4 chips worth of tuna poke. We all split one dessert. Before we applied our Lettuce Entertain You points, that came out to almost $60 a person. Unless the fish is blessed by the Pope, that seems a little insane for the amount of food we actually ate. Maybe it&#39;s me, but this place is way over priced for what it is.

come on payday / with a wealthy significant other and cry tears of joy whilst eating your coconut cake"

I came here on a Thursday night and the place was packed!

We started with the chilled seafood platter.  Being a midwest girl I&#39;m not a huge fan of oysters but gave it a shot.  The platter included oysters, shrimp, little neck clams, poke, stone crab and crab bites.  We asked the waitress to give us a few char grilled oysters instead and she happily accommodated.  I  definitely enjoyed the garlicy grilled flavor the oysters had with the crunch of breadcrumbs.

For entrees we had the crispy rainbow trout and the crispy one-sided red snapper with thai chili sauce.  I wasn&#39;t that impressed by the rainbow trout but the crispy red snapper was amazing!.  It took a bit for me to get the hang of fish on the bone but the flavors and heat definitely made up for my labor involved meal.  The chili sauce was addictive and the crisp texture was perfect.  I didn&#39;t sense it to be greasy and the fish was flaky and moist.  The french fries as a side were a great option to dip in the thai chili sauce as well.

Over all I loved the laidback vibe and fresh fish options.  The hostess, manager and wait staff were all great and I would definitely be back!"

There were 4 of us and we worked our way through a lot of the appetizers. We had a big selection of oysters to choose from and our dozen were fresh and flavorful. I ate many without the dips and drank the juice in the shells. 
The trout dip was terrific and next time we&#39;ll order 2. Loved the crab bites, which are chopped pieces of legs. You push out the meat and we had 2 dips for them. And the last cold dish was the Poke poke with sesame ginger tuna and cilantro chili salmon. A real treat!
Our hot dish was the wicked calamari and it had some good spice!
We were filling up pretty fast so we shared the grilled fish tacos. The fish had a nice mustard char glaze. 
Finally we had the coconut cake everyone raves about and I saw why. It was very light and airy but with amazing moisture. We also tried the key lime pie and it also was perfect, nice and tart without to much sweetness."

The most recent trip to Oyster Bah was a really stellar time. We were sat right next to the open front facing window on a beautiful day. The Cotes Du Provence Rosé we ordered was delicious and surprisingly a 1L bottle instead of the typical 750mL (could have had something to do with the amount of enjoyment that occured!)

Our waiter, whose name I forget unfortunately, was far above average. He had a very good knowledge of the menu, good humor, and provided great service.

We ordered oysters (6), clam chowder (2), and split the Maryland-Style Crab Cake Platter between the two of us. Everything was outstanding.

We had the Poke-Poke, trout dip, and coconut cake on a prior visit and all of those are great options. ESPECIALLY THE COCONUT CAKE!"

The interior is really fun and feels just like a bar on an East Coast beach. It&#39;s nautical and fishy without being tacky. We were easily able to get a reservation at 11 on a Sunday morning and it really never got too packed or hectic. Our server was helpful and friendly. We took forever to order and he was very patient with us. 

The others in my group had the bloody mary, which came with a ton of toppings like pickles and shrimp. I had the Pearl in the Park but with vodka instead of gin. My drink was delicious. It was like a fancier mimosa with a nice fruity flavor, but not too sweet. The others started with three types of oysters (not my thing) and they really enjoyed them. There&#39;s a great selection of oysters available, I think there were 12 the day we visited, from both the East and West coast. I had the fish tacos, which were insane. You get three tacos. The fish pieces were huge and so crispy. They also had a really nice amount of meat in the middle so they weren&#39;t all batter. It had a cabbage slaw and some kind of nice spice on it as well. My husband had the oysters benedict, which he said was delicious. My friends got the shrimp and grits and it looked awesome as well. 

We had a really nice time at Oyster Bah. When it was time to pay our server helped us sign up for the Lettuce Entertain You app so we could get points on our meal. I&#39;ll absolutely be back for food, and definitely cocktails."

Order more cold drinks: check.

The eagle rock oysters were on their 1/2 off happy hour and are delicious. Ordered 3 dozens of those. The calamari came with a spicy mayo which was yum. They mix in fried vegetables in their calamari which was different in a good way. I&#39;ve never had a deep fried lemon but it was tasty. 

The staff is nice but they need more help. It was a long wait to place my drink order and a long wait to have it in front of me.

I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect from this restaurant since I LOVE LOVE LOVE Joe&#39;s, but absolutely hate Shaw&#39;s--- so what could another seafood venture from LEYE bring?

The calamari is alright, just another heavily breaded calamari dish, as if we didn&#39;t have enough of those in this city. The red snapper with Thai chili sauce was decent, but nothing to write home about. Oysters weren&#39;t bad. Service was acceptable.

I know what you&#39;re thinking: If she doesn&#39;t eat oysters, why in the world would she eat at a place called Oyster Bah?

Well, I happen to be married to someone who can eat oysters any time, and since man cannot live on oysters alone, I knew they would have other seafood offerings I would love. After all, this is a LEYE spot, run by the team from Shaw&#39;s Crab House. I go to Shaw&#39;s all the time, so how could I not like OB? I&#39;m also a LEYE points whore, so there&#39;s that.

We popped in on a Thursday night about 8, and were quoted a 45 minute wait, which we expected. (They do take limited reservations, but I believe only until 6:30), so we got drinks at the bar. A &#34;Cape&#34; for me, and my husband chose the &#34;Nor&#39;easter.&#34; The Cape was a twist on a classic Cape Cod, but with fresh sage and cranberry bitters. The Nor&#39;easter was a rye-based drink with lime, ginger beer, and freshly grated nutmeg on top. Both were delicious.

After about a half hour, two seats opened at the bar, so we decided to sit there instead of waiting for a table. We love sitting at bars anyway so it worked out much better. And as luck would have it, one of the bartenders is someone I recognized from Shaw&#39;s. Luke took great care of us, as did the female bartender (whose name I didn&#39;t catch).

We ordered 8 oysters (they offer 10 kinds daily; a mix of both east and west coast varieties): 4 of the Umami, and 4 of the Spring Creek. As I mentioned, I don&#39;t eat oysters, but my husband devoured them.

We also shared the calamari, tuna tartare, roasted broccoli, and kennebec fries. Everything was on point. My only quibble is that there was too little of actual calamari--the plate was heaping, but it was mostly fried lemons and peppers, and a huge slice of toast under all the fried goodies. Kind of misleading as there was barely any calamari.

When you only offer two desserts, you better knock it out of the park. Coconut cream pie and blueberry pie are the only options. I didn&#39;t try the coconut, because after trying the blueberry, I didn&#39;t need to. If you&#39;ve ever had the raspberry pie at Shaw&#39;s, this is the blueberry version. Excellent sugared crust. Dense fruit filling. Not too sweet. Perfection.

We quite enjoyed Oyster Bah, and we&#39;ll definitely be back to try more seafood offerings."

Had a 7:30 reservation on a Friday night and we were promptly seated at one of the few remaining tables. By the time we ordered drinks there were many more people standing around, hoping to get downstairs to the Crab Cellar. 

Our server was friendly and helpful. We took some of her recommendations and order a few smaller plates and an entrée to share: 

 1/2 dozen oysters--so fresh. I also really appreciated that on the oyster menu they include descriptions of what they have rather than just the name. Our favorites were the Island Creek ones (which comes as no surprise as they are always our go to when in Boston)
Tuna poke--so good and just the right portion. Would definitely order again.
Fried oysters--Instead of ordering more fresh oysters, we wanted to try their fried ones and I have to say, they didn&#39;t disappoint. Not too greasy and a good size.
Red Snapper--great flavor and plenty big to share between 2 people. We opted for the rice, but it was the only thing that we were disappointed by (and why this is a 4 star review instead of 5). It wasn&#39;t anything special, flavor-wise, and not cooked very well. We dined at Naoki the previous week (another LEYE spot) and they should just steal their rice recipe!
Fries--because we wanted fries but opted for rice with the snapper, we got them as a side order. Though they look like regular fries, they are actually harder and crispier, kind of like kettle potato chips. Didn&#39;t bother either of us as we were perfectly happy with them, but it&#39;s worth noting.
Coconut cake--I am not much of a dessert nor coconut fan, but having read the rave reviews on here, I wanted to make sure we saved room for this. It did not disappoint! So so good and definitely more than enough for 2 people. It&#39;s sweet and I don&#39;t even want to know my caloric intake from the night, but sometimes you gotta live a little. 

If you&#39;re looking for a quieter date night, I would look elsewhere. The atmosphere at Oyster Bah was pretty loud and lively. Not so much that you&#39;re yelling to hear your dinner mates, but not a great place to come and discuss anything serious. They also REALLY committed to the boating theme; it really is on the edge of being a little tacky. I saw some reviews on here mentioned timing and long waits in between courses, we experienced a little bit of that, but nothing too extreme."

I did not and they canceled my reso which was kind of annoying.  But I called them before we went and they were nice enough to accommodate my original reso.  

The crab cake was very good.  My husband enjoyed the oysters and the crab bites.  I thought the lobster roll was delicious but he thought the fish tacos were better.  Either way they are both great!  The ambiance is fun and upbeat and the service was super friendly.  Prices are high but I guess with seafood that&#39;s what you get.

Really cute nautical shabby chic interior (including some bait/chum buckets for lights on the ceiling). There&#39;s also the crab cellar downstairs which isn&#39;t very big but has a full bar.

The menu has a little bit of everything from the sea. We tried each of the oysters they had available that day, in addition to the clam chowder, mussels and dirty rice. All of our food was good, I really liked the mussels and they will toast up more bread for the broth too if you run out. We eat a lot of oysters and I thought what we had was fine, but they aren&#39;t GT level IMO/or at least with that day&#39;s offerings. I prefer minionette sauce too which isn&#39;t offered. The pacing of our food was a little odd despite that it wasn&#39;t too crowded but we were in no hurry and it&#39;s a new place. Our server was very sweet.

It&#39;s not a huge place but the tables are spaced such that you get a seafood shack feel with quality not all fried food options. Looking forward to seeing what more they do here. Check it out!"

At the table we ordered a bottle of wine, oysters, and the poke poke poke... All excellent. Everything up to our entree was great- including staff, timing, etc. 

For our meal I ordered the lobster roll and he ordered the snapper- per the server these were the 2 top things on the menu. Do not waste your money on the lobster roll. I believe the cost was $27 and I received 3 bite size pretzel buns with barely any lobster ingredients inside them. All three combined should have been one. I ate one as it came and then combined the 2 remaining lobster portions into one. The fries it came with were mediocre at best. It was a complete disappointment. When I mentioned it to the server she said, &#34;I&#39;ll let them know&#34;. 

The snapper was good but overall the entrees didn&#39;t meet our expectations. When spending over $200, I expect to be happy when I leave. 

I recommend the cold portion of the menu along with the cocktails."

The crab cake was big and delicious, it went well with their mustard/mayo sauce. The other food was just okay-- clam chowder, fish tacos, trout hash. They did have moody tongue sliced nectarine IPA on tap which was a huge plus! 

The decor is nautical but looked fake, can see it being more of a family spot for the area. Service was great, attentive and friendly. 

I would maybe go back to try the oysters and cocktails but seemed overpriced for the quantity."

It was pretty pricey as well. As you probably have guessed, we went anyways. We stopped in on our way back into down on a Sunday evening around 5 p.m. It was not super busy yet, but we were not alone. My fiance really wanted to try this place. We love Shaw&#39;s and had really high hopes. They do have the Shaws&#39; famous crab bits on the menu; that was a plus. 

The place is really neatly decorated with an old timey feel ye hipster with the oldies but goodies station playing. Pretty sure the menu changes a bit and often. 

The crab bits must stay! They make a good appetizer. I also got a large bowl of the Clam Chowder. It was think and creamy with  enough substance to serve as most of my meal. We also compromised on the Crab Cake as an entree. Two portions of the crab cake were pretty fulling. The cakes were a wonderful portion of crab to other stuff ratio. Of the few items we ordered the price tag was hefty. I also was not that interested in the rest of the menu which made me sad. I will defintily be back and I hope something else appeals to me."

Two of my girlfriends and I went to Oyster Bah for dinner last night. We had made reservations earlier in the week without a problem. When we arrived last night, their main floor seating was filled so we were directed to their downstairs area called the Crab Cellar. The Crab Cellar is an intimate room with minimal seating - seems like it would be the perfect place to bring a date. 

Dina was our server, and she was FABULOUS the entire time. She had some really great recommendations, and we all loved her bubbly personality. She seemed very excited about the restaurant and menu which made us excited as well!

I ordered a 1/2 dozen oysters, clam chowder, and grilled salmon. We also ordered the &#34;stuffies&#34; to share. Everything was so, so, so good and the oysters tasted super fresh.

Freshness is its utmost level and flavor is incomparable.
I got a mussels also which were great specially the one with spicy red sauce. As I asked for some dessert, the server suggested that i should try their coconut cake i i did order one, it&#39;s pretty delicious, price is  a little high but still i wanted to come back for more yum dishes."

In order of favorites:

Swordfish Schnitzel - sounded interesting so I orderd it and absolutely loved it
Oysters - we tried 3 different oysters - all fresh and nicely shucked
Mahi Mahi - bf (and his dad) love fish - they smoke it, grill it, etc and he was impressed by how nicely prepared it was
Wicked Calamari - really fresh and light breading, some places will have a lot of breading on it so you can&#39;t even taste how fresh the calamari is, they do it right here! 

Drinks - Remember the Maine &amp; Ward 43 were both excellent.

Would definitely come back - excellent service and menu!"

Thankful we were able to make reservations since it was pretty packed when we arrived.  It&#39;s a very cozy spot that&#39;s pretty narrow.  I was worried about bringing the baby, but the hostess greeted us warmly, took care of stowing our foldable stroller, and asked us if we wanted to us a high chair or sling.  I was impressed they had several options for the baby!  We were taken downstairs and seated in the small dining room that also had a bar space.

We started with a round of drinks (yay they serve the oyster porter here).  The cocktails packed a punch.  I tried The Cape, which was refreshing, but pretty potent, at least to a lightweight like me.  For starters we shared a plate of fried oysters.  They were HUGE! and crispy, and divine.  I had the lobster roll, which had a great ratio of lobster meat to filling and not runny at all.  The buttered roll was able to contain the meat, but still on the small side.  I was only disappointed in the quality of the fries that came with the dish.  They were soggy sad.  Hubby enjoyed the Crispy One-Sided Snapper with the coconut ginger rice.  The Asian me thought, how can they only serve one side of the fish, what a rip off?!  Nonetheless, it was delicious.  For the table we shared an order of the Roasted Broccoli and the Cajun Dirty Rice.  The sides were good as an addition, but not necessary since the entrees were pretty filling alone.  No dessert menu, just two options, one of which was peppermint ice cream but we passed since we were all pretty full.  Our server was great, and even took the time to interact and play with baby."

Oysters were very good and they have a good selection.  The issue I had was with the King Crab Bites.   This is a Lettuce Entertain You spot, and with myself being a regular of Joes assumed the food quality and service would be up to par.

I took 1 bite of the King Crab bites and spit it out.  The crab had a rotten pungent taste I will never forget. To make things worse when the waitress noticed neither of us we&#39;re eating it she asked if everything was ok.  My girlfriend said no, and I said something was wrong with it.  The waitress replied, oh sorry you don&#39;t like it, its really popular here. She then took it away and brought the bill with the crab bites were still on it.  I didn&#39;t feel like arguing with anyone at the time, but figured I&#39;d let you fellow yelpers know.  Be careful with the Crab Bites, and expect to pay for everything even if its uneatable."

Oysters - There is a variety of oysters that are fresh and delicious

Old Bay Shrimp Cocktail - the shrimp cocktail was great and the old bay seasoning gave the the dish a unique twist to a timeless classic. 

New England Clam Chowder - a good mix of light and heavy with the correct amount of everything. You should at least get a small bowl 

Asparagus - at first when I tried the fried asparagus I wasn&#39;t to sure about it, but upon a second taste I really enjoyed the dish. It was just an unexpected combination. The lemon and asparagus really compliment each other well

Fries - thin, crispy, and topped with old bay. Great side and a big portion"

- east coast nautical decor provides the right vibe for oyster shucking. 
- oyster definitely tasted fresh and the menu changes daily. 
- coconut cake was decadent. 
- wait staff was friendly and attentive from host to bartender to waitress and bus boy. 

Areas to improve:
- ordered the red snapper which was good but the this chille sauce was too strong and overpowered the dish. 
- prices are high especially for the lobster roll.  I think it was $27 and came with fries. 
- no bread or crackers served with an order of oysters.
- out of the specific oyster I ordered and crab cakes."

Low moments of my Saturday night visit - WATER DOWN MY BACK and service, which was horrifically bad.

I really wanted to like this place more.

Oystah Bar is a charming New England-inspired space. With an upstairs and downstairs seating area. Both are tight and narrow though, so it can get warm and cozy inside (in good ways and bad, especially in winter). Reservations are available but go quickly, but there is a good size space for walk-ins, which I like to see.

Went on a Saturday night with a friend and I was really disappointed with the level of service. It took 10-15 minutes to get a menu (and all of them), 20 minutes for our drinks (of which my beer was wrong, cue another 10 minutes to get the right one), and on average, about 15 minutes between courses, so order all at once.

Due to the small space, the high-top walk in tables are stacked together, and you feel everything if you&#39;re facing the walkway. I had a delightful evening of sweaty male staff and waitresses rubbing against my back. Capped off with a delightful glass of water poured down half of mine from a male staffer clearing a table. Not exactly refreshing. I could not wait to get out of there simply for that reason.

Food, we got the tuna poke (delicious), clam chowder (good but next to no clam), assortment of oysters (lovely) and split the fish and chips. Portions are small (but expensive for what you get), but the quality of seafood is really good. My only complaint was that we got the end of the fry bin and the cup of clam chowder (for $5.95) was very small.

Beer, wine and cocktail menu is pretty well varied, no complaints there at all. Surprisingly good assortment.

This place only gets 3 stars because of the food. It would be 2 because of service. I get it&#39;s Saturday night in the city and it&#39;s Lincoln Park, but this place has been open for 8 weeks and still can&#39;t get in a groove? That was disappointing.

Overall, I walked out of here not wanting to be touched (got enough action at the table facing the walkway) and feeling like my Oystah Bar meal could be described in the worst way: expensive and with terrible service and okay food. Ouch.

I may try it again another time, but apparently more time is needed to figure out the Saturday night crowd."

To the people complaining about the wait/service, I&#39;m a little confused because the service we had was awesome! First, the host was amazing! Her name is Jordan. She was super polite and friendly to us, almost felt like a long lost friend! We wound up deciding to wait for a seat by the bar upstairs. Then as we were waiting, one of the staff offered us a menu and asked if we would like any drinks while we wait-so we did (try the fish house punch!). I think we wound up only waiting 20-25 minutes which isn&#39;t all the bad. People need to understand that this is a new place, so of course the wait is going to be long if you walk in without a reservation, especially on a Friday/Saturday night. 

The food was also just as good! My boyfriend selected 1/2 dozen oysters off of the menu and we split the calamari, which was some of the best calamari I&#39;ve ever had. Then I had the grilled oysters, SO YUMMY-almost reminded me of the oysters I had when we went to New Orleans. But anywhoo, we didn&#39;t eat any entrees, which was fine because the food we ordered was more than enough to fill us up. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place. The staff is amazing, food is delicious and the atmosphere was great!"

The place: Walked in to &#39;Ain&#39;t No Mountain High Enough&#39; playing overhead, random for this establishment, but I enjoy Motown so I dig. The walls are decorated with nautical themed items like fish nets which I find appropriate. The lights had shades made from plastic buckets which I thought was s cute touch. There was a decent sized raw bar at the front. Located downstairs was the &#39;Crab Cellar&#39; like a speakeasy of sorts just passed the bathrooms. Looks cute, I just might have to check it out next visit.

The service: Friendly wait staff. It was a fairly busy night but our server was responsive to our needs.

The food: Nice oyster selection from both East and West coasts, including some of my all time favorites-- Hog Island and Island Creek oysters (same ones that Thomas Keller uses at TFL). The oyster sizes were a little inconsistent though. A few were way too scrawny and barely contained any meat. The clam chowder was a little runny and contained too much potato/celery for my liking. Too few clams. Sorry, a bit of a chowder snob after living in Boston for close to a decade. The star was the New England Stuffie. Basically stuffed quahogs. It&#39;s smaller than your typical stuffed quahog from New England, but it packs a nice flavor.

Overall, I think I would visit this establishment again the next time I visit."

We were sat immediately for our 8:45 reservation. The service was good - a little bit slow but that&#39;s understandable for a Friday night. We ordered the oysters, stuffies and the tuna poke for appetizers.  The oysters were fresh and wonderful! Growing up I loved stuffed clams so these were a great trip down memory lane. The tuna poke was fresh and good! 

For dinner we split the red snapper, mussels, I can&#39;t remember exactly what the salad was called but I believe it was just a seafood salad. The red snapper is a must order - it was truly awesome. Ask your server to show you how to cut it! The mussels were good but very sandy, I understand how fresh they are so it didn&#39;t bother me but bothered the people I was dining with. The seafood salad was awesome - there was king crab, lobster and shrimp in it.

We walked in on Sunday without a reservation and got sat promptly. (Before the dinner rush came @5pm.) Nick our server greeted us in a great mood and we got our delicious cocktails really fast. Try the Fish House punch if you like rum. We also ordered the calamari, tuna poke, and an order of casino oysters.

The calamari was SO TENDER and flavorful. It melted in your mouth. I was impressed.

The tuna poke was so good I wanted to order 3 as my dinner.

The casino oysters were devoured within 2 minutes by my boyfriend who &#34;doesn&#39;t like oysters.&#34; Until now!

I tried multiple kinds of fresh oysters per nick&#39;s recommendation. All were fantastic and unique!

My boyfriend got the blackened fish as his dinner and I got a dozen charbroiled oysters. He loved the fish. The oysters were okay. I was thinking they&#39;d be drowned in butter like Drago&#39;s charbroiled oysters in New Orleans. The flavor was good. But once I put the HOUSE MADE FRESNO HOT SAUCE on them. It took the plate to a whole new level. I bought a bottle of the sauce because I fell in love.

If you&#39;re looking for something new and fresh seafood THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO. Lettuce entertainment group has stepped up their game. Can&#39;t wait to come back!

Price wise it was a good deal. Dinner for 2 with three appetizers and a few drinks a piece only cost us  $150. We left full too. That doesn&#39;t usually happen at these small plate trendy places. I think for seafood and drinks downtown it was a more than fair price.

THANK YOU NICK FOR YOUR OUTSTANDING SERVICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS."

If I had known I would&#39;ve sent them back.  I guess that&#39;s a risk you take when you order oysters during the summer.  Thankfully it was Happy Hour so the oysters were half off.  The calamari was really tiny but tasted ok - but the dipping sauce was watery and there wasn&#39;t enough.  I thought the service was great and the decor was fun.  One issue was somebody kept smoking right outside, and because the whole wall was open, smoke kept flowing into the restaurant."

When we finally got our table we decided to order the Poke, Poke, Poke, Fried Oysters, Wicked Calamari, Shrimp &amp; Grits, and Crispy Fish Tacos. With the Poke, Poke, Poke it was good but we thought the portions were pretty small and it could&#39;ve been marinated with the sauces a little more seeing as there was so much avocado in the bowls with the poke. The Fried Oysters were okay but it wasn&#39;t anything to wow us with. If given the chance between raw oysters and fried oysters I&#39;d honestly go for the raw oysters. The Wicked Calamari was alright as well. The breading was too flaky so it got all over and wouldn&#39;t stick onto the calamari even though it should&#39;ve been fried. After a while we just got tired of eating it and didn&#39;t even finish the plate. The Shrimp &amp; Grits were alright. I never really had grits before this and realized that we both didn&#39;t like grits. The shrimp in the dish was average and seemed like it was frozen shrimp. The Crispy Fish Tacos were average yet again and there was nothing to rave about them. The fish in the Crispy Fish Tacos weren&#39;t seasoned at all and tasted like nothing and the overall seasoning used on the toppings of the fish tacos was way too strong and spicy for the both of us.

So overall I really wanted to like this place but everything in this meal was just average and honestly it made us sad that we chose to eat at this place our first night back in Chicago."

When looking at the menu my girlfriend and I decided to get all small plates and split.  We ordered 6 raw oysters, the char-grilled oysters, New England stuffies, tuna poke and crab cake.  For dessert we ordered the coconut cake.

I would say the stuffies and crab cake were our favorites and a must get.  They had a good selection of raw oysters and they came with stout ice which was unique for me.  The char-grilled oysters were on the smaller size and came 5 to an order.  The tuna poke was tasty but I felt like could have used a little more avocado in the order.  Last the crab cake was a very nice size and a lot of crab meat.

The coconut cake was amazing, and we are not a couple who orders dessert a lot. When we ordered our waiter exclaimed &#34;we only offer one dessert for a reason.&#34; (I believe they do have ice cream as well but who&#39;s keeping track)

Also our waiter was very helpful and attentive.  Will definitely be back."
oyster-bah-chicago,Allison M.,CAGg06Ft3ncXCllFyYMMhQ,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,47,16,KJ3MbW2qtR8PAvz_uhY0Ug,5.0,2015-12-21,"Somehow I was able to grab a reservation for 6:15p.m. on a Friday at Oyster Bah. It was packed when I arrived and I overheard the wait for walk-ins was about an hour (so head in early or be prepared to wait). The dining room is relatively small and unfussy, which contributes to a relaxed and unpretentious vibe (heels welcome but not required). Adding authenticity is a bar right up front with about ten stools for those who want a first-hand look at the magic that is oyster shucking. 

Service was phenomenal. This is a place where you can put trust in your server from start to finish. Case in point: My friend and I wanted a bottle of white wine but couldn&#39;t decide on one off the bat. Our server, Dina, was more than happy to bring us multiple samples and didn&#39;t seem annoyed at all, even though she was clearly busy. When we asked her a question about one bottle in particular and she didn&#39;t know, she brought the manager, Rose, to our table. Similarly to Dina, Rose was incredibly friendly to us and, best of all, did not try and upsell by recommending a more expensive bottle (average bottle price ranges between $45 - $90). The entire night continued this way. The stuffies are a standout and the fish and chips will make you forget you&#39;re in Chicago. And let&#39;s not forget about the oysters! A wide variety (about ten) of both east and west coast jems, including standards like Blue Points and Kumamotos, and lesser knowns from PEI. All were perfectly shucked and so fresh that there&#39;s no fancy ice needed (although they&#39;ll give you that, too!). 

During my visit Rich Melman and a managing parter were walking around the dining room for quality control. As far as I could see, they stopped at about every table, as well as the bar, to evaluate service. 

I will definitely return, not only because I love oysters and fresh seafood, but because the service made the experience one of the best I&#39;ve had in the city. It should be noted that the busers also contributed to this- we never had an empty plate or emplty water glass on our table for more than five minutes, seriously. Everyone on staff here was working to make things top notch. 

TLDR: I loved Oyster Bah so much that I&#39;d move in if they let me."

I would recommend fresh oysters of course. I mean it is in the name of the restaurant, you have to have try their oysters! They have a largest variety of fresh oysters I have ever seen. All are delicious, extremely fresh and are flown from west and east coast each day.

Fortunately we had a lovely wait person, but really -- my co-diner had blackened snapper which was barely thicker than a sheet of paper and came with a serving of rice.  That&#39;s it -- no veggie on the plate, no garnish, and no bread or rolls were served.  I had the lobster roll -- had seen a photo of it in a review and knew that I had to have it.  It came with fries -- that&#39;s it.  But the crazy thing is that the lobster was tough.  Ever had tough, chewy lobster?  Had to cut it with a knife as I couldn&#39;t bite into it.

We ordered coffee and it came in paper cups!  I asked for a mug -- no can do.  Server very proudly stated that this way they can top off your coffee for you before you leave and you can take it with you.  I HATE drinking out of paper containers, and thought a restaurant charging $3 for a coffee and (I think) $28 for the chewy lobster roll could have done much, much better."

It was a really great atmosphere and I felt like I was in a classic New England seafood joint.  Really appreciate it, since sometimes I miss the east coast.  The bar tender was very friendly and helpful.  He was very knowledgeable and patient and let me try a few of the wines and made some great cocktails.  We started out with the Chilled Seafood Platter.  He mad an exception and let us choose the oysters we wanted and it came with tabasco ice and Guinness ice.  These were really delicious on the raw clams and the oysters.  Very cool and innovative.  Only complaint is that the Alaskan crab was a bit water logged.  They green split the salad for us which was simple and delicious.  Green goddess dressing was spot on.  We were very pleased with the shrimp and grits.  The grits had a texture to them that was good and made it clear that you were eating something from the earth.  Boyfriend would have preferred them to be creamier so I guess that&#39;s a personal preference thing.  Overall a great spot!"

We started with 8 oysters, and they were good, however, I would not recommend that Guinness coffee thing they have going on. It didn&#39;t work for me. Secondly, we had the Tuna Poke and this was good. Smaller portion, but it was a nice share item. Lastly, we split the mussels and the half Red Snapper. The snapper was delicious, but why not jut give the entire fish if you&#39;re going to charge $28! It was a good dinner, but I certainly did not walk out of there stuffed. We split a bottle of wine as well. We walked out spending more than $100 per person. I feel like I could go to Bavette&#39;s and spend that much and get WAY more food.

I think this maybe affiliated with Ferrara Pan Candy located in Forest Park.  I think both were started by the same family but I could be wrong.  Who cares?  This is a great little place.

I&#39;m not much of a sweet girl so this place for me is all about the sammies, focaccia and pizza.  You cannot go wrong with any of these!  Trust me, my middle name should be bread...or yeast...or gluten.  Whatever!  I adore anything this place creates with a bread base.

I had the tiramisu. It wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, but it was okay.

Cannoli has peanuts and not pistachios like other have stated, but I wasn&#39;t really a fan of it.

My sister didn&#39;t care for the strawberry shortcake. She said it tasted like cheap cake and overly sweet.

Sorry, but doubt I&#39;ll be back."

I get the cappuccinos made with whole milk (as one should always do). They&#39;re always really good and have the perfect amount of foam . The sfogliatella is sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. They have an excellent texture and a hint of orange zest, which gives them a unique taste. As for their cannolis, I don&#39;t find them particularly great. The shells are better than the cream, which always tastes a little off to me for some reason. Overall, Ferrara is a good place with an interesting history and is nicely located.

It&#39;s a bakery, and yes, I have ordered more than my share of Cannoli cakes for family events, I&#39;ve eaten many cookies and pastries - more than I care to admit, but it&#39;s so, so, so much more.  It&#39;s been awesome to experience the expanding menu of savory items on Ferrara&#39;s menu over the years, some have been misses (no one is perfect), but most have been hits, from soups, to sandwiches to pastas to pizzas and salads - so much good food!!  

On my most recent visit, I decided to keep it simple and try something I never had before - a Garden Salad with ranch dressing on the side.  I figured it would be a small salad - something I could eat at my office to get me through the end of the day.  When the young lady came out with a big bag I had to ask &#34;What did I order?&#34;  She repeated exactly what I ordered...when I got back to my office I pull out this huge container with a beautiful salad with romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, olives, roasted red peppers, croutons (made in-house), celery, carrots and more that I can&#39;t remember.  And the ranch - which tasted like it was also made in-house, was SUPER-DELICIOUS!!  Seriously, sometimes, it pays to keep it simple.  This was one of the best salads ever.  

The staff at Ferrara are also worth mentioning, they are all so friendly and attentive.  It&#39;s always a pleasure to go for a visit.  Hope Ferrara is around for many more years."

I made the trek  out even though my Groupon was expired so that I could try out some of these pastries. I understand I was a couple of hours away from closing time, so they had already run out of a lot of stuff. I missed out on tiramisu and probably many other more popular items. It was also the day before the 4th and they were selling the goods at 50% off to reduce inventory and avoid tossing stuff out. I got the apple tarte, carrot cake, and the strawberry shortcake. I think these are all a little more on the sweeter side for me, which is a little too much. I like that the place also sells other food items like sandwiches, salads, pizza, and other entrees.

I haven&#39;t been here in almost a year, although I work less than a block away, I just stopped cold turkey due to eating so much of the same. But its been almost a year since I had come here and I just decided to see what has changed. To my surprise NOT MUCH! Which to me is just perfect since their food has always been good. 

Now today I decided to see if they had the Tuscany Chili, and although it didn&#39;t state the name, I KNEW THIS CHILI. Oh good lord with the nice taste of Italy and just a hint of heat, this is what its all about. I tasted their chili for weeks on end and than one day they stopped making it I guess due to clients not requesting it so much, well that&#39;s what I was told. 

But its back and for that, I am happy. Ferrara&#39;s is still family owned and I expect it will always be, I hope they always stay true to form with their taste and that all these various flavors will always be passed down from generation to generation."

Our daughter&#39;s absolute favorite item is the cannoli, which they made a separate box up just for her to take to the hotel after the reception.  The cocktail hour sandwiches and pasta salad were a huge hit. The cookies and pastries for the sweet table had all of our guests going back for seconds and thirds!

Instead, the girl that was behind the counter glared at me until someone from the back came and helped who said &#34;did you want something?&#34; ... No, I just came in to fucking do nothing and stare back at your dumb asses.

I have worked nearby for years and been in countless times.  To their credit, I must say that they are consistent. The food (soup and sandwiches) are always quite tasty.  The cookies all taste the same all the time.  And, the business owners are regularly unpleasant, unwelcoming, unappreciative and generally just nasty.

A few years back after a several month stint of daily trips (Monday - Friday)  for their soup, I ordered a salad.  The salad came with a live green bug on it.  After quietly calling it to the attention to the woman in charge, she barked &#34;What do you want me to do about it?  We don&#39;t make the lettuce?&#34;  Needless to say I swore of the place from that day forward.

Admittedly, I occasionally give in to an urge for one of their items and find myself going back for some more EXCEEDINGLY POOR customer service.  Today was one of those days. I am regularly surprised (shouldn&#39;t be) that the rudeness continues.

I was here yesterday, about 8 minutes before their 6:30pm closing time.  I came specifically to try their cannoli ($2.25).  They didn&#39;t have any left in the case, but they offered to make one on the spot for me. In the meantime, I took a look around. They have so many different Italian cookies to choose from, I ended up getting two, a lemon knot and an Amaretto meringue type cookie (I don&#39;t remember the exact names).  The cookies are $9.99 and two cookies were $1.09 by weight.

I ate the cannoli about 25 minutes later.  The filling was spot on, perfect.  The shell, however, was way too thick and unbelievably crunchy, not in a good way. I like a crispy, fresh cannoli shell, but it needs to be thinner to be enjoyable. Also, the ends are dipped in peanuts. I am really used to the pistachios on the end, so it seemed a bit of a downgrade.

On the plus side, the cookies were amazing.  The lemon knot especially - I loved it because it was straight-forward lemon. Many times I have bitten into a lemon knot and have had an anise aftertaste, which is not something I look forward to. 

They have many sandwiches on the menu, they all seemed reasonably priced, about $4 - $6 each. And they sell Mr. Luigi&#39;s brand of frozen pastas (love, love, love the gnocchi), and Ferrara Pan candy (same family) such as Lemonheads and Red Hots.

I have been coming here for close to 20 years.  Today I had to turn around and leave because the service was so completely abysmal and I couldn&#39;t wait any longer. I think this is the third time I&#39;ve had to do so in the past year. I have seen others do the same.
The people at the counter have absolutely no clue, or possibly just don&#39;t care about trying to move the line along when it gets busy.  When it&#39;s slow you can easily wait 5+ minutes for anyone to even appear at the counter. When there are more than 3 people waiting in line to be dealt with they seem to just kind of shut down.  Today there were two people behind the counter and about 5 ahead of me when I stopped in.  One gal was completely focused on preparing an espresso drink the entire time I waited.  The other was having a long happy chat with someone at the register. Nothing was moving at all.  Neither one of them ever even looked around to see how many people were waiting to be served, and neither seemed to have the slightest concern for getting to the customers in a reasonable amount of time.
It&#39;s like this more often than not.
When this place goes out of business, I have no doubt they&#39;ll blame it on &#34;the changing times/neighborhood, e-commerce, Costco, etc.&#34; but it will be completely their fault for not being service-minded."

Great Italian food and pastries.  Good portions and fair prices.

Oh well. Luckily I was driving and not walking.

I only tried two things from this bakery, both of which I thought were delicious. I had the cinnamon butterfly cookie (elephant ears), and the apple turnover. YUMMIE! I wanted to try some of their other cakes and cookies but thought I&#39;d save myself for my next trip back.

Definitely not located in the best of areas, so bring a buddy or go during the day."

After walking in today, I noticed it has been expanded. There are many more tables to sit at and enjoy some coffee and pastries or one of their Italian dishes. They have racks and racks of cookies, pastries, trays of cannoli, and several kinds of coffee drinks.

I would recommend the chocolate caramel cookie and a cannoli. but everything else is dry.  I think the cannoli would be better with chocolate chips on the ends rather than nuts though. 

The food is actually pretty good. I highly recommend the tuscan? sandwich (red peppers, spinach, and chicken). The summer salad is also tasty.  I should have asked for the dressing on the side because they put too much dressing on the salad for my taste.

I did not like the pepper and artichoke pizze (aka pizza).  They only have pizzas from 11-2 pm on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. I bought into the exclusivity and thought this pizza will be delicious. Nope, I was wrong.  The sauce had a really odd flavor (almost tasted sour) and it was covered in cheese (usually a good thing but that&#39;s not like an original Italian pizza). The red peppers were soggy and the artichokes did nothing for flavor. Overall the pizze tasted like a bad frozen pizza. 

As for the frozen food, the chicken pastini? was very salty. My grandparents could not finish it.
The stuffed peppers took forever to warm up.  I asked the owner how long to put it in the oven for. She said 30 minutes in 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  Not even close, I had it in the oven for 1 hour and it was still cold in the middle.  I eventually had to put it in the microwave to warm it up and then it was soggy.  As for the taste, a bit flavorless. 
I have tried the frozen lasagna and that was worth the money.

As for the service, I think the young girls work hard and are relatively friendly.  The owner, however, is not  friendly and she is constantly barking orders/ correcting her staff making for an uncomfortable environment. She takes your order or rings you up and you&#39;re on your way.  She makes no effort to engage her customers. 

I only come here because I live very close. I would not suggest going out of your way for it, unless you want a cannoli."

This restaurant is difficult to find with only an old sign on their brick building, but it is a great place for lunch, especially if you are not wanting to spend too much money and are craving some Italian food.

She is my Italian grandmother and there is no comparison.  So, to make me happy with a real good bolognese? WOW! A big bowl of pasta with red sauce, bread, and salad for like $6 and the pasta is for reals, the bomb.  Francescas? Rose Bud? Tuscany? (Yes, Tuscany) Crap. Crap. Crap.  Ferrara has a great, authentic bolognese that tastes like its been on the stove for a good 6-8 hours before served with a very generous serving of pasta. Add a meatball or an italian sausage and you have yourself a great meal, for under $10. 

Do be careful, when you walk in and order, there is some 30-40ft worth of display case with cookies and desserts galore! Again, the biscotti, nothing can compare to my grandma&#39;s but this stuff is good. I could eat them by the pound.  And the cannoli cake? WOW! Another favorite.  

This should be anybody&#39;s staple joint if you are in the area. Because its really good food time after time. 

The service just leaves you wanting a little more.  I feel like the girls behind the counter are often really impatient.  And there was a time I stood at the counter for like 4 minutes, as I needed a spoon (any proper italian knows pasta is eaten with a spoon) while an owner (male) stood on the other side of the counter and decided just to not acknowledge me until, oh, I don&#39;t know, he was good and ready? Yea, not cool.

Also love love love their tiramisu (one of the best I&#39;ve had). Their other pastries are meh (cheesecake, cookies) but the tiramisu is amazing.

This is a very old school place, but with new school prices. It&#39;s obviously got that nostalgic draw going on - I could just imagine tiny, lil Italian woman ordering bread and sweets, barely seeing over the counter. 

So, I ordered one cream puff, one cherry turnover and a coffee. 7 bones! Ouch. Okay, so I am a lil cheapish. 

The cream puff was yuck. Whipped cream instead of custard. Not good. The turnover appear to have a pizza crust-like base to it, and was not at all light. Kind of bland. Meh. 

I will try it again sometime."

I ordered a carrot cake from Ferrara&#39;s for my dad&#39;s birthday. It was a &#34;small&#34; cake, your stardard 8&#34; inches wide and probably about 6-7&#34; inches high. It looked nice but failed miserably. My family typically loves carrot cake, but was hugely dissapointed with this one. 

There was way too much cream cheese filling.  The actual cake portion was moist but not flavorful. The cream cheese ratio to actual cake was about even. Not a good thing. With so much cream It was difficult to taste the &#34;carrot&#34; in the cake, the cream cheese was overpowering.  It wasn&#39;t the worst carrot cake I&#39;ve ever had, but it was close.  Next time I want a cake, I know where I won&#39;t be going."

Now Ferrara has a pignoletti (which means small) that is pretty tasty and close to what I have been making for years, and what I find every time I go to NY to visit. Their other cookies and pastries are spot on, fresh, creamy and delicious. Service was good, the people friendly, and even though it was a little crowded, quick and efficient.

I have not been to any other bakery that can compare. My parents went there as kids and I have been going there since I was a year old. We would always make sure to get birthday cakes here and a wide variety of pastries for Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. 
So, you are say &#34;Why only 4 stars if this place is the best around?&#34; I stopped in a few years ago and found that the place had put in all these long tables in the bakery so that people can come in and have lunch. I understand that the owners are just looking for a revenue stream to bring in new customers, but you should have seen this place before. When you walked in there used to be small tables where old people sat and had coffee or espresso and pastries. There were fancy display cases that held Marsala Crystal Glass that you could purchase in sets. When you walked in, you were not just buying pastries, but going in for an elegant experience. It was much different from the penitentiary style dinning that they currently have in place. I guess that the old people eating pastries have passed on and their kids have moved to Elk Grove Village or Orland Park. 
None the less, this place still knocks out a top notch product!!"

Immediately the smile begins to spread across my face and I can almost smell the sweet pastry in the air.   I think I&#39;ve eaten everything on the menu and I&#39;ve never been disappointed.  

I love sweets.  My inner cookie monster is so satisfied after a Ferrera binge.  The Chocolate Dip Almond Bars are heavenly.  The quality of the chocolate they use for dipping isn&#39;t like other bakeries.  They don&#39;t skimp on the dip and they don&#39;t use cheap grade chocolate.  All their cookies have the perfect texture.  They&#39;re firm enough to feel substantial and soft enough that they don&#39;t crumble into a million pieces when you bite into them.  

The Chocolate Cherry Almond Biscotti....oooo....yes.  Dip one in your cup of coffee and I guarantee your morning will be brighter!

Chocolate Cannoli what a marvelous invention. 
I could seriously rave on for several pages, but the sentiment would be the same.  You just need to stop by and see for yourself.  Trust me you won&#39;t walk away disappointed. 

They have a casual set up of tables and chairs which i appreciate, because I can sit right down and eat a few cookies before I head out to the car.  So the next time your in Little Italy pop in, you might just find me there."

We came here just to snack and to check out our &#39;hood. We had another dinner to attend shortly. We tried the following:

1. Hamachi roll - good. Nothing fantastic. 
2. Ramen - it&#39;s nothing special. It was a quick-job-kind-of-broth. 

The total bill was probably like $25-30, not much. Based on the better reviews though, I would consider coming back here for the rolls."

It&#39;s been a couple weeks since I was there and forgot to review right away but I&#39;m pretty sure my two rolls were something to do with Halloween and the other was Chicago Fire roll, or something along those lines. The Halloween roll was sooooo sweet. The other roll, Chicago Fire, was good and spicy but still had sweetness. 

There presentation is nice but ease just in the sauces on the plate. Perhaps that is what over did the sweetness but I couldn&#39;t pin point what it was.

It was completely empty and parking right on Halsted was easy."

They don&#39;t advertise that they deliver to our area, but we were able to order through GrubHub. We tried it out, because we seem stuck in our old ways with ordering from Talay every time and wanted to venture outside of our box. 

There were definitely some pros and cons of our meal! We ordered the Spicy Roll Combo, which was a deal! You get a spicy tuna roll, spicy salmon roll and a California roll plus a salad and miso soup for $17! We also got the dynamite roll, which is your tasty/standard dynamite roll. Finally, we go the Fallen Angel roll, which neither of us really enjoyed. I love scallops but the combination of scallops and crab meat on a roll makes a really fishy and slimy texture that was hard to get past. 

All in all, we enjoyed our sushi, but probably would have chosen different rolls if we could do it over again. I am interested in trying the dining in experience, as well!"

Pros: 
-We were promptly greeted and seated right away. There was no wait and it was around 8pm
-Staff was friendly and courteous
-Local neighborhood restaurant
-You can bring your own bottle of wine, and they will uncork it...for a small fee of course  
-Food came out quickly and it was piping hot

Cons:
-Our server when asked questions about what vegetables were in the Udon Stir Fried noodles seemed a little confused
-When I asked her how they tasted, she responded &#34;They smell really good.&#34; Side eye . She then went on to tell me that, she would have to purchase herself so she just makes her own.
-They bought out one entree for our two person party. The other one had to wait another 3-5 mins for the other entree to come

We ordered Gyoza, Spicy Tuna Roll, Beef Ramen, and Chicken Udon Stir Fry.

Kawa&#39;s aesthetic is nice, simple, and relaxing. The Asian influences in decor do a great job of fitting the Japanese menu without transporting you to the tackiest corner of China town like so many other places do. The staff is always wonderfully courteous and are more than happy to share recommendations.

Their specialty rolls are wonderful, especially the Fallen Angel roll. Around Valentine&#39;s Day they have a special Cupid roll and it&#39;s also awesome."

It is TASTYYY and affordable. When we walked in yesterday we ordered almos immediately and seriously, the waitress must of sent the over via brain WAVES because the 4 rolls were out in like 2 minutes. Dissss mak meeeee very happpiiiii. Here&#39;s the order people! Prepare yourself:

// rock shrimp tempura - $6 - tempura fried shrimpys that have a great spicy sauce on top. And get this.. 6$ gets you 10 MOTHER FLIPPIN&#39; pieces! Ha so basically. It&#39;s pretty filling. 

// spider roll - $9 - yummmmm i love spider rolls. Pretty standard but well made. And great! I think this one has soft shell crab in it and was huge! 

// shrimp tempura - $6 - pretty large roll and the shrimp was made very nicely. 

// UIC roll - $12 - WOO WOO REPRESENT SON&#39; UIC ALL THE WAY. Actually in all honestly this roll was delicious. It was topped with white tuna/fish (can&#39;t remember) and a little tempura crumbs. With a bit of spicy sauce on top. So good. The fish was so fresh and would just melt in your mouth. Definitely get this one. 

// salmon avocado - $6 - standard roll. We always get it because the fish is so good. 

I forgot home many pieces come with each roll but they include it on the menu. Another reason I love it. You don&#39;t have to ask your waiter/waitress how many blah blah blah. You get it. Right? 

Oh and did I mention.. It is BYOB?! DOUBLE WIN! 

So yeah, if you are in the south side area I would definitely check

The sushi is not very good. It&#39;s what I consider sushi buffet quality. There is nothing inherently wrong with that; there are days when I want to just pig out and have some all-you-can-eat sushi, but when you&#39;re ordering rolls by the roll (and paying for them by the roll), it really does not make a satisfied customer of me. 

If you&#39;d like me to nitpick further, well here goes: the fish didn&#39;t seem all that fresh, the rice was cooked all that well, and the rolls themselves were quite small. I ordered a staple of any sushi place: the salmon skin roll, and I was very disappointed. Usually, the fried salmon skin provides a nice crunchy contrast to the bed of fluffy rice around it; here, the salmon meat was not filleted off of the skin enough and so you ended up with a somewhat awkward bite. Crunchy, yes, but also quite tough to chew through. Color me disappointed. 

Another negative was the special dessert offered on Valentine&#39;s Day. Though given to us for free, it really wasn&#39;t very good. Matcha frosting and filling on a yellow-cake cupcake? No, that&#39;s okay, but thank you anyway.

And now on to the good news:

Tonkotsu Ramen. &#39;Nuff said. Delectable pieces of marinated pork belly swimming in a pork broth with handmade ramen. Fantastic! Truly the star of yesterday&#39;s meal. Friends and all raved on and on about that fantastic bowl of noodles. If I were running Kawa, I&#39;d make the ramen the star of the show; hey! it&#39;s popular now, anyway. But that&#39;s just me, and my four friends, and an acquaintance who recommended your restaurant to us. 

Also, Olivia. Great job, lady. You&#39;re a great server, and truly a valuable asset to the Kawa team. 

Well, that&#39;s that. Go for the ramen, eat sushi if you want to, skip dessert. Once again: TONKOTSU RAMEN. That is all."

I am just happy there is a good sushi spot so close to home, but this place is average compared to a few of my favorite sushi spots up North. Plus, this is a BYOB spot, so that is definitely a plus. The service here has been pretty good, but I believe they have introduced a new wait staff. It is a pretty small location, so I would recommend making a reservation just to be safe because this place is pretty random. Sometimes it would be empty and at other times it would be packed.

For my fellow Yelpers, if you check-in, you get a free Edamame, but our waiter still charged us for it on the bill, which we never complaint about, but keep this in mind if you use this offer.

For appetizer, the Fried Calamari is pretty good and the Thai Chili Sauce goes perfect with this.

For sushi, I like the American Eagle, Cherry Blossom, and Fallen Angel. The Black Dragon, Anaconda, and Mexican Roll is okay as well. The Grayslake Roll is suppose to be popular there, but we didn&#39;t like this. It tasted kinda bland compared to the other rolls. Also, the Spicy Tuna Handroll here is okay at best, but for $6, I think I will pass next time around."

South Kawa; you have been a dream. I have tried almost all of their sushi rolls and I absolutely love them! I order delivery and for take out, mainly delivery,  and they almost always arrive within 30 min of my order and never once has my order been incorrect (I order about once a week). When I come in to pick up food, they are always friendly and kind and seem speedy in trying to get me my order so I can go home and enjoy my delicious sushi!! 

Some of my favorites include: Spicy Tuna, Halloween roll, Cherry Blossom roll, Sweet 16 roll, Sexy Mama roll, Sandwich roll, Mexican roll, Dynamite roll, Spicy Crab Cucumber roll, and Boston roll. 

The veggie tempura is also delicious, you get quite a few pieces for only $5 bucks. 

This is my favorite place to order from and I&#39;m so glad my neighborhood sushi joint is this amazing; thanks South Kawa!! 

.... now I&#39;m off to review the menu for the 200th time to order something new!!! Happy sushi eating!!! :)"

I came in here last spring around April 2013 with a girlfriend to indulge on mercury. Yay salmon and delicious fishes! This place definitely changed since my previous review. It is no longer a sushi buffet that it once was. 

However, they went onto bento boxes and lunch specials along with the Japanese basics. Streer clear if you were expecting the high end awabi.

The prices are average and portions are good. Definitely try this sushi joint since it also comes with a romantic ambience. 

I had to say, I came in several more times prior to April and the chef had an oopsie with the miso soup. They  mistaken vinegar for the seasoning. Lol. The waiter and host was very apologetic and did not hesitate to replace when a fresh pot was made. Awesome service and smiles can be found in here."

I&#39;ve been meaning to try this place out for a while since I live across the street from it. I don&#39;t think there has ever been a successful restaurant on this block for a really long time. Other than George&#39;s of course. But its predecessor and the stores on the same block have straight up STRUGGLED for so long. There used to be a pho place, a Chinese restaurant, a toy store, etc. 

Therefore, I&#39;m happy that this place is getting some recognition and breathing some well deserved LIFE into Bridgeport. It&#39;s always so stodgy and rigid. I&#39;ve lived here all my life and although this probably wouldn&#39;t be my first place for Japanese food, I would definitely go here for something casual.

The decor is very nice. It is a nice upgrade from the stereotypical Chinese restaurant with white walls and Chinese lettering on the wall. Instead, there are leather seats and attention to detail. The service was friendly. They didn&#39;t have shot glasses, so they gave us tea cups instead. We ordered the Fallen Angel and the Yakuza. I enjoyed both. I was surprised by the Fallen Angel because I&#39;ve never seen a restaurant create a roll with seaweed inside. 

Some things to point out, they need to work on maintaining a professional and courteous environment. They were speaking Mandarin from across the restaurant. Also, their AYCE sushi is a bit overpriced. I&#39;d rather go to Wasabi Cafe since it&#39;s cheaper. Plus, why don&#39;t they have in-house menus? Why are we ordering from the same menu as the menus they put on people&#39;s doors? Now this is me being nit picky, but I don&#39;t like their plates. The plates they use are found in other Chinese restaurants like Chi Cafe and others in Chinatown. I&#39;ve lived in Bridgeport all of my life and I&#39;m Chinese, I recognize plates. I would recommend that they keep things simple and use white plates to let the colors of the food stand out, rather than having sushi that is wrapped in a dark green seaweed, sit on a green plate. 

Thanks for contributing to the neighborhood, but there are still some things that need to be fixed to accommodate the local area."

It was packed upon arrival so I would recommend that you make reservations if you want to eat here with more than 3+ ppl.  The wait was not that long for me as it was just for a party of 3 ppl.

Food:
All you can eat Sushi Buffet for $24.88-the presentation and sushi were both good!

Salmon (order 1 pieces) - comes with a piece of salmon on top a ball of rice..tastes good..yum!!

Spicy Lover Roll (5 pieces)- comes with spicy tuna, avocado inside, &amp; fried tempura..delicious, and not really too spicy (for ppl who can&#39;t handle spicy food)

Volcano (6 pieces) - comes with shrimp tempura, avocado with spicy tuna on top...yum and it actually looks like a volcano when it comes out with fire! :) 

Fuji Roll (8 pieces) - seared pepper tuna, avocado top w/ white tuna and 3 different sauces..tastes good!

Yakuza (8 pieces) - spicy assorted raw fish, topped with marinated salmon &amp; wasabi mayo..yum

Edamame - comes out warm!! :)

Snow Shirmp Tempura (10 pieces) - tastes good and the shrimp pieces are not huge so don&#39;t worry it won&#39;t fill you up!

*I would recommend ordering the Sushi Buffet because prices are costly if you are just planning on ordering multiple rolls.

Atmosphere: nice decor, and clean!..not really big though..which is why the wait might be longer if you come with a group..

Parking: street parking with meters.. didn&#39;t have issues finding parking though!

I would definitely come back again if I was craving a sushi buffet.. better than Sushi Para.."

Ordered the spicy udon noodles, the edamame, the Mexican roll, chicago fire roll and dragon roll. The noodles were not spicy but were tasty, husband appreciated the bacon in them, im not a bacon fan but they were still tasty. Edamame was good, its pretty hard to screw that one up.

The usual waitress (Olivia) wasn&#39;t there, and while we ordered 4-5 separate menu items from the waitress taking our order, two of them just never came out. Additionally, we sat for 10 minutes without anyone approaching the table (it&#39;s a really tiny place) and even after the sushi was served, we were still missing plates and silverware. At the end of the meal, we were the last table in the place, and it took us forever to flag down the waitress for our bill.

I came with a Groupon and surprisingly they let us use it with the buffet. We went during lunch and only one other person was in there.

Chicken Yakitori - We ended up getting 2 orders of these. It wasn&#39;t bad, but we wouldn&#39;t order it if it wasn&#39;t for the buffet. 

Snow Shrimp Tempura - Not bad, but it&#39;s like walnut shrimp without the walnut. 

Spider Roll - We ordered 2 of these too. This was really good.

Crazy Salmon - This one is fried. It was ok, but I probably wouldn&#39;t order it again.

Eel with Avocado Roll - We ordered the eel with cucumber, but they gave us this. I liked it, but my sister isn&#39;t a big avocado fan so she only ate one.

Sweet Potato Roll - Lately, I&#39;ve been seeing a lot of people rave about this. I had to try it. I liked that it had a crunch to it, but not sure if I would order it again as the sweet potato flavor was light.
 
2 Piece Masago - My sister ate this.

Overall, I think the food was very fresh and I enjoyed most of it. I believe they are a bit overpriced. Buffet options didn&#39;t even have unagi pieces or any of their signature rolls as options. For the price they charge, I think they should maybe offer a little more."

The salmon sashimi was very buttery tasting and cut in nice thick pieces.  The fallen angel roll had just the right amount of spice and the addition of the seaweed salad inside gave it a nice crunch texture.  Spicy tuna handroll was also very good and had a hearty fish to rice ratio.  If you check in on yelp, they give you a free order of edamame (pretty decent portion too!).  Anaconda roll was good too.

The waitress was very nice and personable, and helped me find the best bang for my buck between the lunch menu and the full menu. She made sure to point out that their lunch menu hadn&#39;t been updated, as they have since reduced the price of their 2/3 sushi rolls, which is great. Sushi was excellent. The bathroom was nice and clean, which is a huge plus for me. 

The ONLY thing I wish they could&#39;ve provided us with is the wi-fi password. The restaurant is in a service &#39;dead zone&#39; and it was tough to get a decent connection. A gentleman who sat a couple tables down from me had the same problem and asked the waitress for the password, but she didn&#39;t know it and that was that. Obviously, this wasn&#39;t a huge deal and I wasn&#39;t going to have her go find out, but hopefully management will see this and be able to provide customers with their password in the future because people love wi-fi, amirite!?!? :)

First off, this place is BYOB so my husband brought some quality German beer.  Our server gave us a PLASTIC cup.  Seated right next to us were rows and rows of nice wine glasses, and she gives us a plastic cup?! WTF? When he asked if he could have a wine glass instead, the server looked annoyed and said they&#39;re not supposed to give wine glasses to those who bring in beer.  However, after we insisted on a wine glass, she begrudgingly let us have one and said she&#39;d inform the manager.

For those who don&#39;t know, SK has a $25 AYCE sushi special all day, everyday.  Our server initially informed us that we have to eat every piece of fish or else they charge $1 for every piece of sushi not consumed.  No problem, that&#39;s how it usually is in most AYCE sushi places.

My husband and I can eat A LOT of sushi, and we were both starving.  We initially ordered 6 rolls and a handful of nigiri.  When the server came to get our order, she told us that 6 rolls was too much and she was crossing off two of them to start with. Um, okay... shouldn&#39;t that be for us to decide? Whatever.  Anyways, we got our rolls and nigiri and finished EVERYTHING, except for some of the rice from the nigiri.  I feel that many of the nigiri pieces we ordered had too much rice, so I pushed about a third of each piece aside.

When the server came back, she explained that she should charge us for the rice we didn&#39;t finish, but she was going to let it slide this time.  I stated she told us that they charge for each piece of FISH we didn&#39;t finish, NOT rice.  She said that nigiri rice is special, and that if we ordered a second round, she would charge us for not finishing the rice as well.  Again, WTF?

Although we probably could have eaten another roll and a couple more nigiri, we were so turned off by service at that point that we just wanted to leave.  In addition, the quality of sushi seems to have gone down since the last time I came here, or maybe I just didn&#39;t enjoy it as much because of the rude service.  Anyways, sad to say, but I&#39;m never coming back here.  I&#39;ll just go to Hing Kee in Chinatown when I want my cheap sushi fix."

Oh, you want an actual review as well?  Okay, I&#39;ll oblige.

I&#39;d heard a rumor that there was a sushi place opening in Bridgeport.  I am initially skeptical (because as much as I love my B-port digs, I&#39;ve been burned in the past by &#39;southside sushi&#39;).  This rumor then became that there was a sushi place opening in Bridgeport with a Buffet option.  I am officially intrigued enough to investigate.

I looked into it further.  Definitely sushi.  Definitely Bridgeport.  Definitely not yet Buffet-available.  Everyone talking about great sushi (still skeptical), but constant delay of the Buffet option.  I place a phone call and find out through some very broken English that the buffet will be open on Tuesday.  Others have claimed the same piece of news many Tuesdays prior, but I have faith.  I called that following Wednesday.  The Sushi Buffet is alive, and it costs $24.88.  A price well-worth investing if the legends are true.

That following Saturday, we make the quick trip over and at about 5pm, we&#39;re pretty much the only ones there.  Not a good sign.  But it does mean excellent service.  Ah, a classic sheet of paper to check off the things we want.  &#34;Let&#39;s take &#39;em to school,&#34; I fictitiously stated to my girlfriend Char O. as I picked up the pen.

Miso Soup - Good.  Hard to ruin miso soup, and they didn&#39;t.

Rock Shrimp Tempura (with creamy spicy aioli) - Holy appetizers, Batman!!  This came as about a dozen fried jewels coated with a ziggy-zaggy drizzle of reddish aioli sauce.  Lovely amount of spice, perfectly-cooked shrimpies; ecstasy on a plate.

Snow Shrimp Tempura (with special coconut cream sauce) - What the hell - it gets even BETTER than those other shrimp???  If the rock shrimp are ecstasy on a plate, then these represent Food Nirvana.  I recall noting that if I were given the option to eat one food item all day, every day - these would likely be near the (if not THE) top of the list.

We ordered them both, Rounds 1 AND 2.  The spicy yang of the rock shrimp.  The cooling yin of the snow shrimp.  It&#39;s just... PERFECTION.

Oh, and there&#39;s sushi here, too???

For nigiri, I didn&#39;t see eel, but I did see Tamago (disguised as &#34;egg omelet&#34;) and Maguro (tuna).  Both pieces were HUGE.  And not overloaded with rice, either.  Good tamago, and the maguro was quite tasty as well.  I can&#39;t tell what &#34;good quality&#34; is, but it tasted good to me and that&#39;s all I care about.

Then come the rolls.  Now their AYCE menu doesn&#39;t include many of the &#34;Special Rolls&#34;, but it did include some and we tried the Dynamite, the Volcano, and the Yakuza.  [Insert &#34;sleeping with the fishes&#34; joke here, because I know I did at the restaurant (much to Char O.&#39;s dismay).]  We also wound up trying their Spider roll, Dragon, Philadelphia, and the like.

I have to note: they have an Eel Avocado roll.  One of the best combinations of things I love in a roll, with no filler cucumber or carrot crap.  Just two delicious items wrapped up in a bit of rice and some nori.  Yes, please.  Keep &#39;em coming.

Oh, Round 3?  Char O.&#39;s too full?  Nah, I&#39;m gonna get more miso soup and ANOTHER ORDER OF THOSE SNOW SHRIMP!

We&#39;re going to go back.  There will be shrimps a-poppin&#39;.  I think we ate about $28 apiece on those shrimp (the a la carte menu features those shrimp appetizers at $9/$10, but not sure how many more you get a la carte) - let alone digging in on the sushi.

Other pros:
- It wasn&#39;t very crowded, so service was fast (good refilling of water) and food came out pretty quick.
- The music selection (when we could hear it over the TV) wasn&#39;t bad.
- Rock shrimp / Snow shrimp.
- Washroom was pretty spiffy (although the lighted mirror was creepy and the men&#39;s room was painted Mango)

Some negatives:
- They asked us to share one order card.  That meant having to pay attention when they brought stuff out to figure out who had which rolls.
- When bringing out rolls, they rushed and didn&#39;t speak too loudly/clearly, though we did eventually figure it out on our own.
- It was dark.  Creepy-levels of dark.  But I could still see my shrimp, so it&#39;s okay.
- I fear that if we came here during a crowded time, the service would not have been so great.  There was not a huge staff on-site that we saw.

I really do feel bad when a sushi place&#39;s non-sushi items overtake the sushi items in noteworthiness, but I feel good that the sushi was still damned excellent and that just means those appetizers were THAT MUCH BETTER than &#34;damned excellent&#34;.

Oh, and they&#39;re in Bridgeport!  Seriously!  And all-you-can-eat!!  Go there.  NOW.

You won&#39;t be disappointed.  But you WILL have a chance to enter Food Nirvana via the Yin and Yang of shrimp appetizers..."

Understand why most of you hear crickets when you enter this establishment: I&#39;m from the neighborhood but after being here and reading the reviews, I can absolutely tell you the barnacles of welfare (can&#39;t afford it) and hipsters (too cheap to afford it) we have here won&#39;t give the proper business this place deserves. Thus, the emptiness you encounter when you arrive. But I digress. 

The RICE: Decently great. Not overcooked and had an almost flawless amount of salt and vinegar.

FISH: Pretty good. If it was frozen, I couldn&#39;t detect it. I occasionally dabble &#34;my meat&#34; (double entendre fun!) in soy sauce/fresh wasabi, it was not necessary here. I forgot to ask the chef where he buys his stock - I will be updating this review after I go again.

BYOB: Oh yeah, we brought a bottle of Pinot noir - but I didn&#39;t use a glass. No cork fee, either - because I used my teeth.

ATMOSPHERE: Clean, simple, nice. Where is everyone? Read my first paragraph.

SERVICE: Couldn&#39;t be happier with our waitress. She was very helpful and even threw in a free side dish. I generally tip well, but this time I tipped wellx2.

PRICE: Expensive? A little, but this is good sushi. Some places near Wicker Park have more expensive items for less the amount (and quality, for that matter) but still manage to get by. If their sushi wasn&#39;t at least &#34;good&#34; I&#39;d be on board with the too expensive train. People bash this place because it&#39;s in Bridgeport and they expect cheap prices.

In short, I&#39;m so happy we finally obtained a good sushi restaurant in Bridgeport but I&#39;m sad that it may not last."

I just tried South Kawa out last night after seeing it pop open a few weeks ago. I was wary... I did not expect a sushi spot to open up on South Halsted. However, I was hoping that South Kawa would add a little more diversity to our neighborhood dining selection, &amp; it has. 

I was greeted &amp; seated immediately upon entering by a friendly staff person. 

I was very happy to see how nicely South Kawa refurbished the former establishment that haunted this store-front space; it has a nice feel, decor, &amp; an open kitchen/sushi bar area. 

I stopped in for a &#34;light&#34; meal last night, &amp; ordered two rolls - their special Fallen Angel roll &amp; a California roll (sans avocado!) The rolls were huge! Tasty, generous cuts of fresh fish, no over-doing it on the sauce or rice, &amp; the coup de grace being... they did not mistakenly put any avocado in my sushi. Hooray! No allergic reaction = extra points, South Kawa!

I took a menu home with me &amp; noticed that South Kawa has lunch specials... &amp; South Kawa is just a few blocks walk from my apartment. Houston, we have a problem. Or should I say, Bridgeport, we have a problem. I might just satisfy my sushi cravings with ease &amp; carry out more often that I realistically should. 

I enjoyed my first visit, &amp; I look forward to visiting again. It is nice that there is a sushi place of decent quality in Bridgeport now, &amp; I hope you will join me in giving this spot a try.

P.S. BOYB!!

UPDATE: I have frequented South Kawa so many times now... for lunch, dinner, &amp; take out, &amp; each experience has been lovely. I have never had a bad piece of fish, &amp; the presentation is always beautiful (I went home with a gorgeous purple orchid from last weekend&#39;s dinner plate!) 

The servers are attentive &amp; accommodating. I am so thrilled that South Kawa is here in Bridgeport... no need to travel out of the neighborhood for excellent sushi, atmosphere, service, &amp; a BYOB treat."
south-kawa-chicago,Shannon S.,BF-NcYCbRsCfKUn4T5olLg,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,214,9,IdnHH5NDqmBkLqGcFT5kWw,4.0,2012-05-18,"Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love sushi and I LOVE my neighborhood.  I just don&#39;t really consider Bridgeport to be a sushi destination in Chicago. When this place popped up I had very mixed emotions.  I was excited to see a sushi place I could walk to but also extremely nervous about the quality and execution.  Well I finally tried South Kawa last night and I can say that it blew my expectations out of the water and made me drunk with pure bliss.

I had the spicy tuna roll, spicy scallop roll and fallen angel.  Each of them was fantastic.  Not only were they fresh and flavorful but as another reviewer mentioned they definitely come heavy on the fish and light on the rice which is the opposite of just about every other sushi experience I&#39;ve had.  The fallen angel roll made me giddy to try the rest of the specialty rolls on the menu.  And try them I will!  I will definitely be a repeat customer (and repeat, and repeat, and repeat ...).

I also got the spicy udon which was just ok. I probably would not get it again.  The noodle itself was excellent but the dish consisted mainly of peppers and onion and was pretty one dimensional as far as flavor goes.

Last night I carried out but I&#39;m excited to dine in with friends now that I know it&#39;s BYOB.  I like to drink sake.  It can get expensive.  BYOB sushi joints are where it&#39;s at people!

The prices were great as well.  I&#39;m not sure what one of the reviewers was talking about when they said the prices were too high. All of the regular rolls range from $4-$6 each, the specialty rolls go from $9-$15, and both are a total steal for the amount of fish you get in them.

Now that I&#39;ve been to South Kawa I still have mixed emotions.  I couldn&#39;t be happier to have a quality sushi spot in Bridgeport with the BYOB and price point bonuses but I&#39;m also severely depressed by the potential damage this could do to my waist line."

I too, wanted to see if my dining-in experience would live up the take-out I had. I had been to this location once before when it was Noodles-Pho-You. Now under new ownership and name this gem may be my new Bridgeport go to. 

My friend and I rolled up to Kawa about 3:45 today and were surprised to see that the open sign was not on. After investigating the menu in the window, we realized they take an hour break between lunch and dinner service (3-4). This would normally be no big deal, but my friend had to work down the street at 4:30. We decided to wait it out and hopefully get some quick sushi in. No more than five minutes later the owner strolls up to the door keys in hand and says, &#34;do you guys want to come in?&#34; We replied excitedly in the affirmative and enter into the restaurant. 

The owner, Kwok, showed us to a table. I felt kinda bad because the staff was in the dinning hall resting during their break which we had cut about 10 mins short. I was impressed in how quickly they all got up and began to prepare for us and the rest of the dinner service to come. Our server quickly came to take our drink and appetizer orders. Our food was served quickly and they were very understanding of our time constraint. 

Right away Kawa passes my number one indicator of a solid Japanese restaurant, their edamame was amazing! Steamed and salted to perfection. Wow, I&#39;m an addict for this stuff. Vegetable and prawn tempura was fried nice and crispy and the vegatables were both varried (sweet potatoes, bell peppers, broccoli) and fresh.
For sushi we had the Volcano Roll (my pick) and Spicy Spider roll. Both were excellently crafted, fresh, and all to easy to whoof down in a hurry.

If you&#39;re in the area (Chinatown included) this is some of the best sushi I&#39;ve had anywhere in the city. Service was impeccable, and the owner seem smart and dedicated to quality food."

Came here with my brother and she was really nice and attentive. The food was decent and the prices were okay. A tad pricey for lunch but it was fun.

What we had:
Vegetable Yaki Udon: Tasty, large portion, with good, fresh veggies!
Snow Shrimp Tempura: Very good! Only, it wasn&#39;t like described on the menu, it was like Honey Walnut Shrimp...
Fallen Angel: Crab, avocado, scallops, and tobiko. Yum!
Sweet Sixteen: The mango just made this roll POP!
Halloween Roll: This one was actually free! The server brought it to me mistakenly, so she told me to keep it and enjoy it on the house. It wasn&#39;t half bad either, even though I&#39;m not the biggest tuna fan...

Everything was plated and presented beautifully that I almost didn&#39;t want to mar the artistry! Our server was patient, helpful, and even cracked a few jokes, making for a very enjoyable meal! I intend to return."

We&#39;ve lived in Bridgeport for 15 years and were excited to be able to walk to a restaurant where we could get a nice sushi experience for a fair price and BYOB.  Last night after failing to make dinner in a timely fashion my husband and I decided to walk on over.  It was about 9:00 pm so we checked their hours online and they were open until 10:00.  We grabbed our wine and walked over.  We arrived before 9:30 and were told they were only doing take out.  WTF?!  Why even have hours?  Not cool.  We walked north on Halsted to the Potsticker House.  They&#39;ve never let us down in 15 years!

Everything they serve here is great! I know I have ordered one or two things that they were out of, I was not disappointed because I can taste their dedication to good, fresh quality food.  The All American Roll is one of my favorite dishes there. They give you a good portion of tuna. It&#39;s fresh and spicy. 

The unfortunate thing is that it doesn&#39;t get that busy which is great for immediate seating but no so great for my hopes of seeing this place stick around a while. I hope more people catch on to this hidden gem so that me and my new found love can continue to get to know each other better.

I decided to try this place based on yelp reviews and came to a conclusion that these reviewers don&#39;t know sushi. 

Their sushi is mediocre at best.  I ordered the spicy scallop (almost no scallop) and they were tiny specs of scallop, a couple pieces of salmon nigiri (tasted like it was frozen before and tough), yellowtail/scallion roll (decent), tuna apple salad (the best thing I had there), and chicken teriyaki (horrible), overcooked chicken and bland sauce.

I get that the fish comes in frozen and that they thaw it out in a refrigerator.  

However, the sake (salmon) sashimi i received was still frozen in the middle.  I just kind of thawed it out a little on top of the rice, not a huge deal for me.  Then again, I&#39;m not that high maintenance.  If you are you&#39;d probably not like that.

However, I think that the price is a little high since each of us spend 24 dollars and still didn&#39;t feel full at the end. I believe i will come again when they start their sushi buffet which is 25 dollars per person. 

As from the food, I liked Fallen Angel, it&#39;s very flavorful.  my friend liked Dynamite because it has cheese in it. The other friend liked Sweet sixteen which has mango in it. 

After 3 orders of specialty rolls, we are still not very full, so we ordered udon with shrimp. But like the other yelper said. The quality of noodle was great, they are chewy but the flavor of it is blah and i dont think I will order it again. 

Over all it was a good dining experience and I will recommend it.

Until now. Ok so you are eating something called &#34;sea urchin gonads&#34; if you try to find this online - but ignore that for a second.... It tastes amazing, kinda sweet, like mushed up roe but different. 
All the sushi is amazing, the fish has always been fresh, melt in your mouth kind of thing. 
The Fallen Angel roll tastes decadent and very good. We usually go for the raw fish and every time it has been flavorful and fresh. 
We also had hand rolls and either salmon or spicy tuna have been delicious. Their fried cheese cake desert thing is decadent and amazing if you have space. Yes, in this place you can actually get full on sushi!

Most notably would be pub trans and food options. Luckily, the latter has improved significantly over the past few years. 

Kawa took over the space that was previously Noodles Pho U, Thank God! That place was super gross. Enter, Kawa. They revamped the place and it looks like any other casual sushi joint, albeit maybe a bit darker. The service is a bit weird, but I&#39;d rather have too much, than not enough attention.

When you think of bridgeport you really don&#39;t think about a great sushi place. I was really impressed with their all you cna eat deal.

So be careful.

If you&#39;re like me, there are sporadic days throughout the year when sushi feels like a necessity. It was time to knock off this new AYCE to the city.

The fish was bland (the salmon was not glossy/fatty, the squid was flavorless, and the white tuna/escolar was watered down - pretty standard blocks of meat that had been thawed/frozen/thawed/refrozen).

At least they could cover up the shortcomings of their fish in some good old American makis? Nope, they didn&#39;t do too well in that front either. Everything was doused in mayo. They actually used four different colors of mayo to draw a big mayo grid on top of half of their rolls. I recall a deep-fried roll that should be aptly named &#34;The Mozz Stick Roll.&#34; It&#39;s a mozz stick crust holding back a few grains of rice and a lot more cream cheese. Yes, it sounds like it&#39;s taxing your arteries enough to taste good - but it ended up just making us queasy. 

Also, the tempura batter on everything (the vegetables, the &#34;rock shrimps&#34;) was heavy, a sad shortcut for the more expensive, but lighter batter. Finally, the rice was the worst part. It&#39;s hard, salty, and lacked vinegar. 

Our waitresses were actually very attentive and the ambiance was decent (you could probably guess that means the food must have been pretty bad). Well, back to the ho-hum status quo: Sushi Para and House of Sushi - at least the rolls taste like sushi."

The service was wonderful especially since it was a bit crowded. For an appetizer we ordered the Shumai which came pretty fast but was piping hot and very tasty.

As far as the sushi goes, I thought 3 of the 4 rolls we ordered were amazing. We had the spicy tune, shrimp tempura, Grayslake, and the Sweet Sixteen. I thought the Grayslake roll was a little bland which was a bit disappointing because it was said to be the most popular.

Overall, the service here is great. The servers are very attentive and welcoming. The food was tasty for the most part and came almost as quickly as the appetizer. I will definitely be visiting again."

My boyfriend and I first ordered kawa from grubhub. We were excited since they had such good yelp ratings. I had the tempura udon which was very bland. My boyfriend ordered a few rolls: salmon skin and crunchy spicy tuna. He also got the yaki soba. He really enjoyed the yaki soba, but the rolls were what stood out, specifically the salmon skin. My boyfriend even said it might have been the best he&#39;s ever had. The rice was still warm and the salmon skin was crispy and fresh! So delish!

So a few days later, I told my boyfriend I was craving for the salmon skin roll (I never even eat sushi, let alone crave for it). I also got the mexican roll as well. I was so excited for the salmon skin roll, but the first bite was disapppointing. The salmon skin had a stale texture, not crispy like the first time and it was cold. The Mexican roll was good. The jalepenos were crunchy and spicy, just how I liked it. All in all, I feel a little put off from ordering again because I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to be fresh or not."

we got the sushi buffet which was around 25 dollars without tips and tax yet.. so yes.. it was a little on the pricey side compare to other sushi buffets in the northside..

i like their appetizers.. the misu soup was good.. the bufflao shrimp and rock shrimp was not bad..

the sushi on the other hand was ehh... most of the sushi is covered with too much sauce which ruins the taste in my opinion... also a lot of the sushi was fried... it just wasnt my cup of tea.. 

dont think i will be coming back here again.. but for the people that is not into that much raw stuff and like saucey and fried food.. give this place a try..."

The menu had a lot of great options particularly with their special rolls. For 4 girls we ordered about 5 rolls and 2 desserts. We ordered:

Sexy Mama Roll - This was a really unique roll. Its ingredients was wrapped around with a cucumber. However, I barely tasted anything. It was my least fave roll.
Volcano Roll- This was our fave! If you love spicy tuna, you will love this!
Cherry Blossom- I don&#39;t recall much of this roll. My friend stated it had a sweeter taste compare to the others.
Fallen Angel- This was recommended by our waitress. It was great. Def. recommended. 
Yakuza- Nothing too special about this roll. It was okay.

All rolls were well proportion, I did not notice there was more rice or more mayo like some reviewers had stated. I felt most rolls taste about the same and nothing really stood out. Over all, they were okay. 

As for desserts, we got mochi and cheesecake. The manager (I believe who he was) kept pushing us to order the cheesecake that came along with a mochi. The mochi was good, however, the cheesecake was not so great. I felt it wasn&#39;t done. The texture was still too mushy that it tasted more like a mousse cake to me. It also came with a red sauce that just didn&#39;t complement well with the cheesecake.

Presentation of food and ambiance of the restaurant was great! Service was also great. Never had to flag down a waiter/waitress to refill our teas, which I appreciate a lot.

I would come here again only if I had a coupon. I felt the bill was pretty steep even with our coupon. The sushi was good, but it was not worth the cost for its quality of fish/sushi. 

Side note: This sushi restaurant are own by Chinese people."

Menu is great with lots of options. Ordered 4 rolls for 2 people. Plenty of food! The spicy salmon roll was not spicy at all, a little disappointing, but still good. The roll had a crunch, as if there was a tempura element in it, liked that. The dragon roll was good, as I&#39;d expect. The other rolls were good too, but can&#39;t remember which they were. One had mango, which I hoped to be A-mazing, but was a disappointment as the amount of mango made it nearly impossible to taste.

Ordered hot tea. Tasted like hot water with zilch flavor. Skip that.

Seating is good, atmosphere is quiet. Overall I like this place. If you live in the neighborhood they&#39;ve probably put a door hanger on your front door. Be sure to bring that!  It has a 20% off coupon!"

I love Indian street food and I love it even more when people think of new ways to make Indian food a &#34;grab&#39;n&#39;go&#34; style of food. This was my first time visiting Bombay Wraps and overall I was pretty satisfied. My sister and I a samosa wrap and the channa wrap and then we split them. 

Overall, the food wasn&#39;t bad. We ordered the wraps &#34;spicy&#34; but i wish they were a little more spicy. The wraps were also pretty messy so it was kind of hard to eat and easier to eat with knife and fork. But, the lady preparing our food did warn us of that. I liked that the wraps were made of paratha, which was a nice nostalgic thing for me from my childhood. We also ordered the sweet potato masala fries which were cooked to perfection: crispy on the outside, slightly soft inside and incredibly seasoned.

I would recommend this place to someone who wanted something on the go and were downtown. Not sure if there are comparable places (I&#39;m sure there are), but overall, I was pretty satisfied with my first visit there!"

The workers also somehow managed to make me feel rushed for my order even though the restaurant was empty. It must be a gift.

The rolls seemed kind of small so I got 2, the chicken tikka and the panner. I would not consider this chicken tikka at all. There was very little flavor to the chicken. It tasted like the oven baked chicken breast from subway with added psuedo tikka masala. The &#34;Paneer&#34; doesn&#39;t have the cheese like flavor real paneer does, its more of a tofu blocks with the same 
&#34;psuedo masala&#39;. I added onions and spicy sauce which wasn&#39;t spicy at all. Although its called &#34;Bombay Wraps&#39; it doesnt really have the exotic spice/flavor profile indian food has, its very Bland/Americanized. Its about as indian, as Taco bell is Mexican.

Cons: Price, small portions, inconsistent sizing

Came here to grab dinner the other night. Clean set up and super friendly staff even with the store coming close to closing time. The ordering and prep works pretty similar to a Chipotle line, where you can choose between a wrap or salad bowl and then pick from a variety of traditional Indian fillings. Being a bit on the hungrier side, I opted for 2 wraps and tried the chicken tikka and lamb curry wraps. I have so say both were pretty tasty, however I noticed the chicken tikka wrap had considerably less meat than my curry lamb wrap. At just under $12, I have to say I expected a good amount of food, but my togo bag definitely felt a bit on the lighter side. And after inhaling both, I definitely was still hungry. 

Maybe portion control is a good thing, but I must say I expected more for what I paid. Also, I forgot to add that both came with options for spicy or mild. Mild is really mild, I&#39;ll give the spicy a chance the next time I&#39;m in. I really hope they adjust their portions and pricing accordingly, because other than that the food is really good!

&#39;Til next time!"

Well, that&#39;s about to change.  She has started broadening her horizon in the downtown Chicago area.  

Back to the usage of first-person pronoun, I purchased a groupon on Bombay Wraps since it&#39;s a place that hubby can partake since many items on the menu are vegetarian-friendly.  Apparently, it&#39;s a fairly new joint, with chic-looking furniture, bright lights, and clean facilities.  

The groupon basically provided $10-worth of credit to spend on food and beverages.  I chose the unwrapped version of lamb curry, while hubby picked the two (2) wraps meal combo special.

If you have chosen the &#34;unwrapped&#34; option, it would be presented on a plate with a cup of spiced lime vinaigrette dressing (similar to a salad bowl...in an Indian style).  I personally thought the meal combo deal was right on the money.  The &#34;wrapped&#34; style would cost less than the &#34;unwrapped&#34; version.  If you were to choose two (2) wraps, you could get a fountain pop for $0.99 extra.  For instance, hubby&#39;s potato tava wrap ($3.99), samosa wrap ($3.99), and a fountain drink ($0.99) would make the entire meal under $10.  

We paid approximately $10-difference since the lamb curry was one of the most expensive items on the menu ($8.99).  I wouldn&#39;t consider the portions as generous, yet they were enough for individuals with healthy appetites.  

My lamb curry &#34;salad&#34; was average.  Although I requested &#34;spicy,&#34; it wasn&#39;t anything strong that would cause a burning sensation.  Hubby enjoyed his wraps, but he did agree with me that the entire meal was on a &#34;pricer&#34; side.  

Nevertheless, I would prefer Bombay Wraps over other &#34;fast-foodie&#34; commercial chains nearby in a heartbeat!  The dining room was very comfortable, with Indian music videos constantly playing.  Who wouldn&#39;t like synchronized dance moves and syncopated music beats?

This location is pretty close to the Navy Pier and Lake Shore Drive.  If you ever end up staying or visiting in the downtown/Magnificent Mile part of town, Bombay Wraps would be a good alternative if you are trying to steer away from the Mc*ona*d&#39;s."

Those are good, and well seasoned so they don&#39;t even need the spicy ketchup sauce they come with.  The Chicken Tikka wrap is also very tasty, the chicken still moist and the sauce just delicious.  The menu now includes some breakfast items, various wraps involving eggs, so we tried one of them.  Can&#39;t remember the name (and their website doesn&#39;t have them up yet), but it was eggs, peppers, and tomatoes cooked with Indian seasoning.

A newer fast food entrant to the Streeterville area, Bombay Wraps provides wraps and plates of popular Indian street food at reasonable prices in a well lit, modern and funky dining space.

Get your wrap ($3-$7) in flaky buttery paratha bread or whole wheat roti. I prefer paratha. Wrap fillings run from spicy potatoes or paneer cheese for vegetarian options, to savory lamb curry or probably the most popular, tender chicken tikka for meat options. Samosas (Indian veggie rangoons, essentially) are excellent. Haven&#39;t tried desserts. You can build your own fountain drink, buy familiar bottled favorites, or be adventurous like me and try the goofy foreign drinks. The mango juice box was sweet but had spices in it. Not good. The aloe/honey drink from Thailand, however, was a hit.

An ultra-suave British/Indian looking bloke must be the proprietor of this spot. He&#39;s there a lot. Other than that, employees are cheery and helpful.

A TV plays Bollywood stuff over the dining room, which is funny to watch. Look up &#34;Bollywood Boss video&#34; for a laugh.

I love loyalty/rewards programs but BW may just have too many. From Spring Rewards to a loyalty punch card to AAdvantage Dining miles, methinks they&#39;re giving away too much for marketing."

The wrap was so much better than what I was expecting. It was flaky and the chicken was cooked just right and went well with the sauces. 

I don&#39;t recommend ordering the sides. The samosas were very small but generously stuffed. They were overcooked and pretty hard. The fries were near burnt. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the fries were good but they just had a burnt taste to them. 

They offered me a cup for water without me asking and threw away my trash once I was done. It&#39;s a fast food place, something I don&#39;t expect the workers to do. 

Overall, I&#39;d return to try their other wraps!"

So I was power walking home for lunch one day with my blinders on when I decided to take an early left turn directly into this newly opened establishment. I walked straight up to the menu, decided on the Beef Kabob Wrap and only the Beef Kabob Wrap, paid, received my food, and beelined for my living room couch. There could have been a mutant monkey sitting at a table and I wouldn&#39;t have noticed it. If you&#39;d ask me about the color of the floors, walls, tables or chairs, I would have no idea.

Anyway, my first impression when I opened the foil was, damn, this is sort of small. But it was tasty! And - surprisingly filling. Oh - and they gave me a $5 coupon! Okay, I like you guys. 

Today I ordered the &#34;make-me-whatever-you-desire&#34; off of GrubHub for takeout. Pick up was quick and easy, the staff was friendly. I took a moment to take a look at the aesthetics of the place. It&#39;s a pretty typical fast-casual venue: simple, clean, crisp and modern. 

My meal, which I, again, ate on my living room couch, was more elaborate than the first, and just as delicious. The staff at Bombay had bestowed upon me a Chicken Tikka Wrap, three Samosas, a side of cilantro chutney, and some super odd, bright orange fudge-looking thing. To be honest I really had no idea what I was eating, as my experience with Indian food is minimal and I didn&#39;t even think I liked it - but I am now a fan. 

I took an itty bitty nibble of the dessert and had to pass. I&#39;ve received plenty of rejection when I try to share my Polish sweets with people, so deep down I knew the people of Bombay would understand. 

If you&#39;re in the area, check this place out for some unique, quick dishes at a bargain. You won&#39;t regret it."

Mind you, I&#39;ve eaten here before and I was expecting an overall good experience with food and customer service. I came in today, 6/7/16, at around 5:20 pm, and clearly ordered for an unwrapped Chicken Tikka. The line server put it on a wrap, which I politely reminded him that I ordered it &#34;unwrapped.&#34; Right after being reminded, he gave me the stankiest stanky face his face can handle, then slapped the chicken pieces back into the container. Why do you treat customers that way? I hope management reads this and puts you in your place because this Yelper does not love what he saw today. Horrible service!

Chana wrap on roti - loaded with salt and just okay, a little smaller than I hoped (but for $4, it was a fair size); glad I ordered the combo

Samosa - room temperature but flavorful

Spicy mint chutney - star of the show and saved this from being a 1 star experience

And for a serious pet peeve unrelated to the food: SUPER LOUD VENTING SYSTEM. I came in to relax and listen to a podcast during my lunch break. The vent would shake and rattle so loudly every 10 seconds I finally got fed up and left with 30 minutes left on my break.

OK, honestly, I wouldn&#39;t necessary say it&#39;s on the same caliber as Kati Roll in NYC, but oh my, is Bombay wraps tasty!! It&#39;s fast food, so very convenient for those needing a quick bite while shopping on Mich Ave, doing touristy things and needing something to hold them over until dinner, or just looking for something quick and tasty! 

My favorite at Kati Roll is the Paneer wrap, so naturally that&#39;s what I gravitated to at Bombay wraps - and it was tasty! The guy asked if I wanted it mild or spicy and I asked how spicy spicy was - he said about a 7, so I said mild and that was still kind of spicy for me! So, if you&#39;re not a huge fan of too much spice, opt for the mild knowing that you&#39;ll still need a water chaser! But, it&#39;s delicious enough that you won&#39;t care! 

Yelp&#39;s check in offer is 10% off wraps! And, as I was ordering, my phone died! As I was checking out, the cashier told me that she put in the happy hour deal for me which is 20% off wraps! So, definitely try this place around the late afternoon to get this deal! Worth it!

They even have a little section with indian spices, snacks, condiments, etc - so if you&#39;re living downtown and don&#39;t want to hike to the nearest indian store, this is a quick place to grab a few things (likely overpriced, I didn&#39;t look too closely).

Overall, very good - and if I&#39;m staying at the Intercontinental again like I was this time (and do on every trip to the city), I&#39;ll be back :)

PS they have free wifi!"

It was 30 seconds walk from Hilton&#39;s double tree hotel and we found ourselves having our brunch here everyday.

I am vegetarian so can only speak for the vegetarian wraps. Chickpea chana and potato tava both are pretty nice - but the 5 stars that I gave them are mainly for the Cheese Paneer wrap.
mixed it up with chutney and pickled onions - and it tasted heavenly.
They also have a collection of lassis - Mango lassi is where you simply cannot go wrong.
The other one - coconut + pineapple lassi was something I tried for the first time - very unique! It was something you should try at least once. I personally found it too sweet - but then I am not much of a fan of sweets anyway!

They also give you a choice between roti and parantha based wraps. I tried both and I will go for the parantha based wraps any day but if you are big on avoiding too many calories- then the roti wrap is for you.

Came here for lunch because I wanted something different from the usual sandwiches. Opted for chicken tikka salad bowl and got a huge bowl of fresh salad with generous topping of flavorful chicken. So flavorful, in fact, I didn&#39;t need any of the salad dressing that came with it (though I did taste it and found the flavor interesting). I think I&#39;d get the sauce on the side next time because it got a bit too salty near the end but overall a decent meal!"

That&#39;s cool.
3.5 stars

The wraps are ~$3, which seem like a good price except that the pictures make them look like they&#39;d be quite a bit bigger... But the combos are a good deal esp since you&#39;ll definitely need 2 or 1+ a side to be full. The snack size allows for more variety and flexibility - like what if you did just want a snack?

Taste wise, I thought the paratha could&#39;ve been fluffier, the filling was decent but not amazing, and overall just alright. Compared to chipotle/naf naf where every bite is so flavorful... this isn&#39;t quite that.

I think this location is new, so everything is super clean and bright and the ambiance is great for a quick bite. We picked it because it wasn&#39;t crowded and the owners were gracious enough to let us bring our bikes in to keep inside against the wall, and I&#39;ll definitely be keeping this in mind for future rides along lakeshore drive. Exit path just north of Navy Pier at Ohio Street and it&#39;s like 3 blocks away!"

I ordered the Samosa Wrap and the Chicken Tikka Wrap, and actually did enjoy both of them. The Samosa Wrap had incredibly crunchy pieces of Samosa in it with a nicely spiced mix of potatoes and peas. As for the Chicken Tikka, the pieces of chicken were cubed and weren&#39;t dry, but could have used a bit more in depth in terms of spices. The sauce that they drizzled on was good, but nothing phenomenal.  Perhaps I&#39;m being critical because I&#39;ve made these at home before and know that it really doesn&#39;t take that much effort to heat up a Paratha Roll(they can sell these at the grocery store and are just as flaky and delicious), and then throw in some meat + onions + sauce in the mix.  At $4 for a vegetable roll, and around $5 for a meat one, you should expect to get something a little more substantial."

Finally, I found a place that satiates my desire for good Indian rolls, if not the best. This little place located in a nook of downtown Chicago definitely justifies its name. We ordered paneer cheese roll, chicken reshmi roll, and samosas. The paneer cheese roll was a show-stopper. It was spicy, juicy, tangy, all at once making it a must-have according to me. The chicken reshmi roll on the other hand was a little mild (contains raita-based sauce), still very palatable. I might try chicken tikka roll the next since it looked pretty akin to paneer cheese roll. The samosas were just about OK. Rolls were definitely good, but that&#39;s not it. Here&#39;s the real deal, the place is insanely cheap - The two rolls and a plate of samosas (3 little samosas) cost us about 11 bucks with taxes (partly because we were lucky to get 20% discount during happy hours). This place gives you the bang (and even more) for the buck. Definitely, worth trying if you are looking for a little more than a light Indian snack."

We split the breakfast combo platter and the chicken and waffle.

Employees.
Coffee.

Cons:
Water is luke warm and served with two cups with no ice. I&#39;m a fan of cold water, not really a huge issue since I probably could&#39;ve asked for some, so besides that I&#39;d say this place is A1.

(I definitely like this place better than wildberrys)

I will definitely return here when I come back to chicago!"

They offer combo plates with both sweet &amp; savory items! Never again will you have to deliberate over a breakfast of carbs or protein, French toast or eggs. They let you have both! Why doesn&#39;t every breakfast place do this? The Yolk Street combo was perfect: 2 eggs, sausage, bacon, and French toast or pancakes. The best of all worlds. 

I will say, the French Toast was just okay- definitely on the dry side (don&#39;t you hate it when it&#39;s just a piece of dry bread with an eggy coating?). But still happy that I got my carbs &amp; protein in one sitting.  

Service was fantastic for our very large group. Food came out fast and coffee refills were a&#39;flowing.  Definitely a breakfast hot spot for good reason."

FOOD: It is of my opinion that breakfast is hard to mess up, so the food here is as good as one might expect. The food options are plentiful, ranging from red velvet French toast to 5 egg omelettes and bacon waffles. 

I&#39;ve tried their oatmeal here before and it was very thick and good. 

The OJ is fresh, and I like the way they use small rounded ice in their drinks. Not that I put ice in my OJ, I&#39;m not a savage. 

ATMOSPHERE: The seating area is pretty open with choices of &#34;&#34;bar&#34; seating, tables, and booths. This place is pretty casual and is less than five minutes from the brown line/purple line."

The service was fabulous, truly enjoyed our server but the meal wasn&#39;t entirely memorable. 

The latte was in a coffee cup so it was tiny. Maybe I am spoiled by large, grand lattes at breakfast spots but it just didn&#39;t justify the size to price ratio for me. 

I went for the South Beach which was a 1/2 pineapple filled w/ goodies: strawberries, yogurt, granola, and walnuts. While it was presented beautifully with a #FoodPorn stature, it just didn&#39;t deliver for me. I felt like the pineapple pieces were overwhelming to the rest of the plate and there wasn&#39;t enough yogurt or granola. 

Overall is was okay but not sure I would return quickly."

My girlfriends and I stopped in during a bachelorette party weekend and were admittedly hangry even before walking through the door. After reading beaming reviews for the South of the Border Benny, I decided to give it a shot. I don&#39;t have a high spice tolerance, but I figured the chorizo wouldn&#39;t be too terribly spicy. Alas, I was wrong - it had quite the kick to it! The flavor was great, but I should have asked the waitress about the spice level before ordering it.

The rest of our party was happy with their selection (we especially appreciated the fruit selection in the fruit salad - no cantalope or honeydew).

We were a large group of thirteen that arrived to Yolk on a Saturday morning and prepared ourselves to settle in for quite the long wait. To my utter surprise, before I could stake out some prime waiting real estate on the sidewalk, our table was ready.  

We were immediately greeted by our waiter and handed an extensive menu upon which to ponder. It didn&#39;t take me long to decide on the chicken and waffles but I our waiter to validate my decision, which he quickly did! And I was not disappointed. The waffles were light and perfectly golden and the chicken was seasoned to perfection! But be forewarned: these portions are large! This is a meal that can easily be share amongst two people.

And that strawberry orange juice.... I promise you will not be disappointed!

I needn&#39;t have worried, as they had a table for us right away, and we actually had to wait for enough of our party to get there to be seated!

Our waitress was awesome; she saw our BYOB bottles of champagne and immediately recommended the strawberry orange juice (which was delicious!).  She asked if we wanted our checks split, which surprised me because so many places in Chicago won&#39;t do it even when you ask.  She was attentive in checking on us while we waited for the rest of our group to arrive, and throughout the meal.

The food was delicious, which is consistent with the other Yolk experiences I&#39;ve had.  The food came out pretty quickly as well.  After we were done she didn&#39;t rush us out the door, either, which was nice.

The only downside I can think of is that it&#39;s pretty loud in there.  That&#39;s about par for most brunch places, so it&#39;s not a huge deal, but worth mentioning.  Everything else was great!"

Three types of (unconventional) bread, toppings, and a full dose of pure happiness. Granted, you&#39;ll have a sugar high for roughly 3 hours, but I think we can both agree that it&#39;s so worth it. I&#39;ve ordered the monkey bananas or something pancakes which were pretty good (very filling too), but most recently the red-velvet French toast. I think you can get the gist of things by now. The vibe of the restaurant and the staff is so much better than going to Rockit or something for brunch. I think they&#39;re BYOB, but cannot confirm.

It did not disappoint. It was very good. The big fat Greek omelet was nice, and the potatoes were well prepared. I swapped out the toast for an upgrade to the nutty monkey pancakes, with real Vermont maple syrup. The pancakes were good, although a bit heavy on the chocolate for my liking. The iced tea had excellent flavor and was refilled right on cue, which brings me to the service ...

My waitress, Rin, was terrific. She was very informative and very attentive, with a personality to match.

Eggs any way you can possibly think of, pancakes, french toast, waffles, the list goes on. You will definitely have a hard time deciding, like I did.

I finally settled on the Irish Benny - toasted english muffin, corned beef hash and grilled tomatoes topped with two poached eggs and hollandaise. I love poached eggs and I love corned beef hash, so I knew I had made the right choice. Or at least I thought I did. It wasn&#39;t as good as I expected. The hash was very greasy, expectedly so..but that together with the hollandaise was just a little too much - especially for a first meal of the day. If you&#39;re going to order this, I would suggest asking for the sauce on the side.

The good thing is that they give you huge portions, so a meal here is definitely worth it. My eggs benny came with some home fries and a good amount of fruit. The fruit really helped with cutting down some of the grease.

The pancakes here are pretty good. I&#39;m not normally a fan of pancakes but I wouldn&#39;t mind waking up to a couple stacks of those every now and then! If I&#39;m ever in Chicago again, I would deffo stop by Yolk again."

Every time I come to Chicago, I make it a priority to come to Yolk. Ordering breakfast/brunch is not always the easiest for me because I like a little bit of everything. I can&#39;t just order an omelette or pancakes. I NEED both. So sometimes I&#39;ll make whoever i&#39;m with share an two entrees so I can have both. But no need to do this at Yolk. Yolk makes this SO EASY!!! When you order an omelette, you get an order of pancakes on the side (or toast) AND fruit (or potatoes) - no extra charge! It&#39;s just too perfect. I am also a creature of habit so i always order the same thing. I&#39;m sorry but it&#39;s just so dang good and perfect for me. 

I always order the California (five egg) Omelet. OMG. Do yourself a favor and get this. It is an omelette with avocado, sautéed mushrooms, green onions, tomatoes, and garlic - topped with jack, swiss, cheddar AND sour cream. Add blueberry pancakes on the side and that&#39;s pretty much all I need in life. OKAY YOLK. You win. I&#39;m in brunch heaven. And don&#39;t forget the coffee. They actually have great coffee too.

There is ample seating at this location.  so there was no wait. The menu is quite extensive and sometimes this frustrates me because it always takes me long to make a decision. It was between the red velvet French toast or chicken and waffles. I chose the latter because it was cheaper. 

The waffle was delicious. Fluffy, savory because there was bacon in the batter, and buttery. Paired with the decent yet generic chicken tenders, it made for a great breakfast.

My two coworkers both ordered skillets. All together the bill came to just under $50. So it was relatively inexpensive for the portion sizes."

Had a great breakfast skillet; feta, tomato, spinach. The coffee is brewed my Metropolis for Yolk and it&#39;s delish. One of my breakfast companions ordered the breakfast poutine and I had a taste. Yum. Another ordered chocolate chip pancakes topped with banana and layered with peanut butter. I think it was called chunky monkey. Lots of options for vegetarians and even gluten free items as well. They have a great staff and food is always cooked well and fresh."

The plan was to come here before heading to Art Institute. I&#39;d heard about the long waits and had wanted to come earlier but got off schedule waiting on a long line for doughnuts at Doughnut Vault. Don&#39;t worry, we didn&#39;t eat all 5 we got until hours after brunch, heheh.

We arrived around 11 to an estimated 25 min wait but were seated in 10 at the counter, yay. The open kitchen is an absolute madhouse with dozens of orders in queue to go out every minute. Despite the bustle, it was all so orderly! Very interesting to watch. Anyway, I ordered the egg white California omelette which came with fruit or potatoes and a choice of carb soo pancakes, obviously. 

This 5 egg omelette was an absolute beast and loaded with cheddar, swiss, jack, avocado, peppers, green onions, tomatoes and mushrooms. Each bite was oozy, delicious and very satisfying. The side of fruit was fresh and plentiful. The pancakes were also very good. Fluffy and light. I enjoyed these pancakes more than the ones I had at the super popular Wildberry Pancakes &amp; Cafe. I ate everything. The value for this supercharged meal was baffling -- $12! What. 

I&#39;d definitely come back if I make my way to the Windy City again."

The service was good and I was seated quickly but Both times my meal was cold.  The first day I went I got the chicken and waffles in and every thing was lukewarm.   I went a second time and got pancakes and they were cold as well.  I sat at the counter and saw why.

I ordered El Torero Scrambler which consisted of chorizo, avocado, tomatoes, jack and cheddar cheeses, topped with sour cream and served with a side of salsa. I thought it was delicious! The chorizo had a nice kick to it, but not too spicy. The portion size was big so I only ate half, but I could have easily finished it if I was hungrier. I picked a side of toast and fruit to go with my scrambler. The toast was a little burnt, but I didn&#39;t mind it too much. I also got a cup of bottomless coffee which the servers kept filling.

This place is pretty busy, which makes sense since it&#39;s a great place for brunch. The estimated wait time was 25 minutes, and our group of 5 was seated within 5-10 minutes. 

The service was fast, friendly, and attentive. Our waters and coffees were never empty; staff was by regularly refilling drinks. 

Everything on the menu sounds amazing. Everyone in my group got something different and everyone was raving about how much they enjoyed their dishes, so no matter what you order, you can&#39;t go wrong. The side of pancakes is enough for a meal itself. The pancakes were some of the best I&#39;ve ever had---so light and fluffy with great flavor. I had eggs florentine which was delicious. The poached eggs were cooked perfectly, and they put a nice spin on traditional eggs florentine which usually just has spinach by adding mushrooms and diced tomatoes.  Others is my group thoroughly enjoyed the West Coast Crepes, a scrambler, an omelet, and a frittata. The food was delicious and a great value for the price.

The atmosphere was casual. The place is a lot bigger than it seems when you first walk in. It feels very open with high industrial ceilings. Everything appeared clean. There were lots of groups and families."

Some of the best coffee I&#39;ve had and their fresh squeezed strawberry OJ was delicious.  Perfect for a hot summer day.  
I got the West Coast Crepes.  It was good, but would definitely try another dish if I&#39;m ever back.  Lots of beautiful dishes coming out of the kitchen.

Ordered: South of the Border Benny ($12.49) + added avocado- Toasted english muffin, chorizo (sausage), cilantro and chipotle sauce topped with two poached eggs and housemade hollandaise. This has a bit of a kick to it so if you&#39;re sensitive to spicy (like me), be prepared to sweat a little. This also comes with a side of fruit (pineapple, grapes, and orange) and potatoes. There was so much food I could not finish (but wish I could).

I think for the price, service, quality, and quantity of food, this is a MUST EAT place. I love the decor and fresh feeling of the restaurant and already wishing I could go back and try more things on the menu. EVERYTHING looks SO GOOD."

It was around brunch time so it was busy, but luckily we were able to be seated quickly since it was only 2 of us. Looking at the menu I wanted to order almost everything and couldn&#39;t make up my mind. But I eventually choose the French toast and it was superb! As I write this review I am trying to think back on the food. I did have coffee that day which I rarely do b/c places usually don&#39;t have flavored cream, but Yolk did and seeing that on my table made me want coffee and it was so good too. 
Too bad my company was a dud. He was so into work and paying attention to his phone that it was such a turn off. But at least I had my food to enjoy. So the only thing I wanted to send back was my date.. Lol

It was of course packed. What good brunch place wouldn&#39;t be packed on a Sunday morning? Luckily our wait time for a party of 7 was only about 15-20 minutes. With a 20 minute wait and this being a BYOB place, Yolk is golden in my book. They seated us within 25 minutes.

We had brought our own bottle of champagne for the birthday girl, unfortunately they didn&#39;t sell carafes of orange juice. They do bring you small glasses, and we made do by just getting a large glass of orange juice to share. 

I was starving and ordered the Yolk All-Star Breakfast and upgraded to a sweet specialty for $2.99. It seemed like the best deal to get to try one of their special french toasts and get some sides. I opted to get the cinnamon roll french toast. Presentation wise, the cinnamon roll french toast looked okay, but it tasted amazing.  They put cream cheese icing on top of the french toast in place of syrup.  It came with two pieces, but I was STUFFED after eating them. It was extremely heavy and a tad too sweet, but I enjoyed it. They forgot to bring my friend his side of pancakes, but he was so full from his meal that he didn&#39;t care too much.

Bonus points to our extremely strong waitress who consistently filled up our cups of coffee and managed to make one trip and carry out our 7 dishes of food on one massive tray."

First of all, for a Sunday mid morning,  the wait for 2 people was only 15 minutes. A miracle for Sunday brunch! For our wait, we purchased coffee which was not only tasty but piping hot. Always a plus!

For breakfast, we both ordered skillets. I ordered a country skillet with scrambled eggs and a side of waffles. My friend created her own skillet and topped it with sunny side up eggs. Both types of eggs were cooked to perfection. The scrambled eggs were extremely fluffy. The sausage gravy that accompanied the skillet was delicious and definitely did not have the chalky taste that some places tend to have. The waffles were light, fluffy and delicious.

I came down to Chicago to celebrate a friend&#39;s birthday and was happy to find the next morning that I was within walking distance of two Yolk locations. I opted for the River North option and had a surprisingly speedy experience considering it was prime Sunday brunch hours. 

Since I was solo, I was able to get a seat at the bar and was greeted and able to place my order within a minute of being seated. It took maybe five minutes for my food to be delivered, and my server had my drink refilled and my check ready to go just as I was finishing. 

As for the food, my Tour de France was as perfect as ever. The tour consists of banana bread with sliced bananas and peanut butter, lemon poppyseed bread with blueberries and orange sauce, and orange bread with sliced strawberries. Each slice was incredibly moist and flavorful, and perfectly portioned from mini loaves. The strawberries were a little bland, but since it&#39;s late December in the Midwest I had no expectations of them being at their peak. 

The Red Velvet french toast always sounds amazing, but the Tour de France is a guaranteed knock-out; next time I&#39;ll have to bring a friend who will let me talk them into ordering the former so I can give it a try."

I decided to order the Yolk Combo as it was well reviewed and my co-worker had Salmon with eggs, and upgraded her bread choice to Red Velvet French Toast.  She loved it, said the Salmon was delicious and thought the eggs were cooked perfectly over easy.  She especially loved the French Toast.  The Waffle I had was excellent, the sausage was good, but not even warm (which made me question it&#39;s freshness) and the Bacon, which was salty and bad.  I was really disappointed with the Coffee, bitter, the kind of quality you might find in a lower scale diner, and most heinous of all they didn&#39;t have cream!  They had those little flavored &#34;non-dairy&#34; coffee creamer cups.  The waitress brought a little Milk eventually which did nothing to overcome the bad coffee.  I can think of half a dozen better breakfast spots within five miles. If I go back I may try the chicken and waffles."

When I sat down I noticed my mug had lipstick on it, so I discreetly gave it to her. She brought back a clean one and slammed it on the table.

She filled my mug with coffee even though I did t ask for it. When I told her I didn&#39;t want any, she gave me a dirty look and walked away.

My daughter asked for a small oj, and she brought a large one. When I asked for the eggs Benedict with salmon, I asked her if I could get the fruit earlier, or on the side. By the time they arrived, my grapes had hollandaise sauce all over them. We didn&#39;t complain because she seemed not to listen anyway.

Our eggs Benedict and omelet were fabulous, and the portions are huge. The potatoes were not so crunchy and could have been cooked slightly longer. They were also a little in the greasy side. 

The pancakes were good.  Our waitress never checked on is, and I had to ask a busboy to have her come so I could order a tea. I will come back, definitely for the food."

I went Sunday morning for brunch and we had a short wait of just about 10 minutes. I was super happy we ended up getting a nice little booth table but if you are a party of 1 or 2, you&#39;ll definitely be seated more quickly if you&#39;re okay sitting at the counter.

I had the Harvest Breakfast Quinoa Bowl for $7.79 which was warm quinoa with cranberries, apples, peaches &amp; pecans. It came with a little plate that had an orange, cinnamon, and milk. We thought it was a bit strange there was a milk option because I&#39;ve never heard of pouring milk on quinoa, but maybe that&#39;s a thing. This dish was just about exactly how you&#39;d expect a bowl of quinoa, fruit &amp; nuts to taste! Not the most amazing dish I&#39;ve ever had but it was exactly as expected and helped me feel a little more healthy than alternative options I could have ordered.

I was also able to try my dining companion&#39;s Irish Benny ($11.49). Their Irish Benny comes on an english muffin smothered with corned beef hash, topped with two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. The strangest part of this dish for me was the giant tomato everything sat on top of on the english muffin. Aside from the tomato, I enjoyed the dish. It was a giant mess of gooey hash soaked in the hollandaise but that&#39;s what it should be!

Our server was very friendly but seemed extremely busy! She would check in on us here &amp; there while placing various random items on our table and forgot our carry out box at the end of our meal. Overall though, no big issues on service.

I liked Yolk and wouldn&#39;t mind going again if I&#39;m in the area. I&#39;d absolutely try something less healthy next time! Perhaps their french toast everyone raves about. Based on my experience and what I tried though, I&#39;m in no huge rush to go back!"

Only think I could really vouch for is the French toast. Skillet was above par as well. Wish they had more steak options but overall you really can&#39;t go wrong here for breakfast with a wide variety to choose from.

Red velvet French toast

Yolk has the feel of a diner, but with a modern twist. We walked in around 10 am on a Friday morning and although most tables were full we were seated immediately. It turned out that right before we placed our order there was a catering order for  80 people, so our food took a bit longer than expected to come out. Otherwise our service was great and our waitress was friendly and attentive.

I decided to order the Irish Benny (fried tomato and corned beef hash with a poached egg &amp; sauce), while my wife ordered 2 eggs scrambled with a side of fruit. It was a good thing I was hungry, because my plate was jam packed with my Eggs Benedict, sliced red potatoes, and a full stack of fresh fruit. The fruit tasted extremely fresh and was a yummy mix of grapes, pineapple, and honeydew. The Eggs Benedict itself was delicious, and the corned beef hash on top dealt the salty and savory flavor I was craving. The diced red potatoes on the side were also great and I would have eaten more if I wasn&#39;t so full. 

Overall Yolk was a great stop for a tasty breakfast to kickstart our day, stop by if you are hungry!"

Pros:
Tasty skillets
Greek Toast
Fast, moderately-priced food
Interesting Diner decor
Variety of foods

Cons:
Difficult parking situation
Weird throbbing sensation as you sit due to bridge traffic

I love their vegetarian skillet or their gypsy banquet skillet, they&#39;re very flavorful and just the right size. I always eat the whole thing but don&#39;t feel like I hate myself. So it&#39;s good there&#39;s no food waste yet it&#39;s still well portioned.

I love their Greek toast and I also love that the waitress is willing to let me have one slice of Greek and one slice of raisin if I choose.

This place is known for being on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, but I&#39;m not sure what was highlighted on the show - I&#39;d like to know.

Their menu is really extensive, they have a lot to choose from, but I always just end up getting a skillet. They are usually really good about poaching my eggs, which can often be a very hit or miss thing.

The biggest problem I have with this place is parking is a bitch. The only option is to find paid street parking, but there&#39;s only one small strip that&#39;s close, otherwise you have to take a walk. There are several parking garages nearby that are way too expensive and White Palace does not validate for them, so you&#39;ll have to patronize a local retailer if you want validated garage parking.

But other than that, I enjoy coming here."

One of the people who worked there overheard us talking about grabbing a bite to eat and suggested we go to White Palace Grill. I had never heard of it before and given its location, I don&#39;t think I would&#39;ve found it on my own.

We decided to go and it didn&#39;t disappoint. The portions are HUGE! It&#39;s a classic diner with classic diner food and a gigantic menu. Our waitress was really sweet and attentive with a THICK Chicago accent. You want authentic? Go here.

I ordered the classic chicken and waffles. It was the perfect amount of food. Louisiana hot sauce is a must for this dish! My friend ordered an omelet and pancakes for the side ($1 charge to make them chocolate chip, no biggie!). The &#34;side&#34; of pancakes were actually three massive cakes that easily could&#39;ve been both of our meals.

I&#39;m happy this fun Chicago staple was recommended to me! If you&#39;re in the Loop, take the 15 minute walk south and check this place out."

Diners Drive-ins and Dives didn&#39;t disappoint when they visited this place. This place is busy, busy - but thats ok. Anything worth waiting for has to be good. 
Went on a Sunday morning around 10am after a night of Chicago Pizza and after drinking enough beer to qualify for a water boarding warm up session. Needless to say - my body was in serious need of carbs and maybe a pedialite drip... so, pancakes were in order.
Ordered the full stack of buttermilk pancakes (5), 2 over easy eggs, a side of bacon an coffee. 
We sat at the bar - so we got a great look at the workings of this iconic location. The waitress&#39; were great, friendly helpful, full of whit and most importantly a smile. Had a great conversation with them while waiting for our food. 
Food came in about 10-15 minutes - hot, delicious and cooked perfectly. I can pack away some serious food - and these 5 pancakes proved to be too much for me. Leaving a small amount for the garbage. 
Parking can be difficult, street parking - meters are 7 days a week and its $4 an hour to park. I recommend dropping someone at the door - to get your spot, then find a place to park and meet up with your crew. 
I recommend. Our Breakfast was awesome.

FOOD: exactly what you would expect at an ex-truck driver dive diner. I always say it&#39;s hard to mess up breakfast and they definitely didn&#39;t here.

What melted my heart was the pancakes. I ate the skillet first then moved to the pancakes and I wish I had done the reverse, because the pancakes were heavenly. I&#39;m very weird about my Pancakes, but I love when there is a slightly crispy ring around the circumference. And they had that On both pancakes!! That&#39;s so hard to accomplish. Trust me, I&#39;ve tried.

The milkshake was good too. I kind of wish it didn&#39;t have caramel on the sides, or at least I wish they had asked about it first. But either way, I drank it. 

SERVICE: The waitress was really on it. Very attentive: water glass and coffee mugs stayed filled. She was very easy to access, because she was constantly circling. And she was very fast. Sometimes, if you ask for a to-go box or an extra fork, waitresses will forget amidst 72 other things going on. Not at all the case here.

It&#39;s 24 hours and the menu never changes.  So going there for anything other those reasons is a setup for disappointment.  

So if we&#39;re judging it on that, the food is pretty good and the portion size is fairly large.  And again, it&#39;s cheap.  You can be in and out that place with a good breakfast in less than 20-30 minutes.    

Problem with White Palace is as the night comes, the customers get more rowdy and the service tends to reflect that.  And now after a certain time, you are asked to pre-pay for your meal, which is something I&#39;ve never heard of before at restaurant/ diner.  That&#39;s for fast food establishments.  I understand it from their end because I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve had problems with customers paying the bill or skipping out on bills but that also tells you what type of crowd you may get on a late Friday or Saturday night.

Also a lot of loitering outside which was a little scary. There were signs everywhere that customers must prepay before they get served their food, which I had never ever seen before at a restaurant. Must be some sketchy customers coming in...

I just wanted a greasy-spoon snack, so I ordered cheese fries. Fries are over $4 with taxes and an extra $1 for cheese. All in all I spent $7 on cheese fries including tax and tip.

At times the place can get loud, remember it&#39;s a 24hour joint, so all the sudden you may find them vacuuming around you. There used to be more of these places in the city, now they&#39;re dying off, I hope this place stays around for a long, long time. Everyone needs a diner in their life."

The food here is great if you are drink but it gets really noisy and shady at night. The service was a little bit underwhelming considering that my party was forced to pay up front and a mandatory gratuity. However, the overall feel is still welcoming.

I want to just start this off with a summary but I can describe more of the food. The coffee is unlimited refills as expected but it was difficult to get a refill. I ordered a reuben sandwich that came with soup and fries. First, I love how they have crinkled fries, but the reuben was okay. Standard reuben. I had a clam chowder soup that had a fair amount of clams. Another plus for this place. 

Overall, it is still hard to beat a late night diner. Skillets and pancakes or chicken and waffles. I would recommend pregame before coming in at night ; just to fit in with the environment. Really noisy at night, but will come again."

To respond to your response below  what you are saying is lies as far as the size of the party that was seated. The host claimed the woman&#39;s husband was parking. The woman&#39;s husband did not come the 5 mins we sat down before decided not to spend money in your establishment. As far as the staff being intimidated you must be talking about a different person because I only addressed this with your hostess. I told him calmly he was wrong when tried to explain I said sir you are wrong. Then we were seated and after talking with the members of my church we decided to leave. I&#39;m a pastor and we did not cause a scene but we just walked out with no comment left the free water on the table. To lie to try and discredit what I have said is wrong and I hope you all change your heart and the way you treat people because it&#39;s 2016 and no one deserves service the way you do business. As far as your staff being 70% African American. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true or not but on Sunday morning I only saw 3 African Americans out of a staff at least 15. I can&#39;t say it&#39;s false but I can say what I saw was not 70%."

Hubby remembered this place called White Palace Grill that was nearby and it was on diners drive-ins and dives and Chicago&#39;s best tv shows.
When we walked in, we were greeted right away and we were able to sit in a booth by the window so we can people watch.  The place had a dinner feel with red/white/black colors of the interior.  The place was pretty clean and neat, not bad for a restaurant that is open 24/7 for over 70 years, wow impressive.  They must be doing something right!  They make everything from scratch even their Italian bread crumbs! I believe it&#39;s owned by a Greek family so you know your portions will be plentiful.
Here is what we ordered for lunch:
-Chicago Deluxe Burger-it was juicy on toasted brioche buns.  Served with crinkle fries that were hot and crispy.  It came with a soup which hubby chose creamy mushroom.  His soup was thick a hearty with sliced of mushrooms.  I tasted it and I would get it too lol.
-Catfish Sandwich Deluxe-it was two large pieces of breaded catfish filet on toasted Italian bread with crispy fries and a soup.  He would get this meal again. 
-I got the hot Meatloaf, it came with mashed potatoes made fresh topped with beef gravy and a cup of soup which I got the chicken noodle.  My soup had plenty of noodles and it was also hearty and not salty, I would order this again.  I LOVED this meatloaf dish, I got 4 pieces of moist meatloaf that had a crispy crust on the outside.  The gravy was so good not salty at all, I even asked extra on the side for dipping.  The meatloaf was flavorful with bits of carrots and celery in it.  I wanted to save some to take home, but I liked it a lot that I ended up eating it all.  If I say hmmm while eating without thinking, then I know it&#39;s good haha!   Good comfort food. 
Even our server was really nice and polite.  She was very attentive when we asked for more mayo , we got more, I asked for more gravy, I got it.  Our drinks were filled without us asking, nice.  Overall, I like this place and it&#39;s 24/7 all year round.  I&#39;ll be coming back as I want to try other things on the menu as seen on TV  lol!"

That being said I think Guy Fieri is full of shit when he came and ranked this place so highly.

The burger I ordered was mediocre at best and a bit on the over done side; the veggies that came with were what you may have had in grammar school as a kid and obviously straight out of a can; they were soupy, tough and sad looking. The soup options were clam chowder and chicken noodle; I opted for the former and learned that there are tomato based clam chowders; the soup was average.

The second dish I ordered was the Grecian Tilapia, and from the menu description lead me to believe it was expertly prepared and high on taste; I don&#39;t know what the hell I was thinking as it was anything but. The saving grace to this entree was the greek rice that made it passable. The fish was over cooked, burnt on one end and looked like the cap came undone on the seasoning bottle; something akin to a young girl discovering makeup for the first time, too much.

The nail in the coffin was when I asked the manager if I could charge my phone as it was on 16% and I figured I would be here for at least an hour; he asked if I was a customer and I motioned to the table directly in front of him with my winter attire and open menu. He said no. I just stared at him and took my seat. This review was written on my dying phone after the meal had been finished. I could forgive shit service or bad food, but not both; the twenty minute wait time to be served would have been dissmissable had other things been different.

I opt you check out laurence fishery for some decent seafood on canal and cermak as that was where I intended to go originally, but hunger won out for me.

Stay curiously hungry and adventurously hungrier on the quest for good eats."

It&#39;s about a house in the country that, over time, gets surrounded by a city. But when it was built, the owner declared that it could never be sold, even for gold. (You can hear someone else&#39;s mom read it here: http://youtu.be/YqlOJKt4-RA.)

This is my impression of White Palace. It&#39;s been there forever, and whoever owns it gets a big tip of my sombrero for not selling out. Moxie is worth an extra star. It&#39;s one of the few independent businesses in the area, after being surrounded by every chain store that you ever find in the suburbs (can you say Marshall&#39;s, DSW, Michael&#39;s, Best Buy, Home Depot, Bed Bath Beyond, Staples, Nordstrom Rack, whew, I&#39;ve gotta stop... Though I&#39;m giving you a pass, you over-priced gem of a goody-two-shoes health nerd, Whole Foods!). And it&#39;s a classic diner with consistently tasty, value-priced large portions, especially good for breakfast. (And the perfect antidote to a trip to Whole Foods, I might offer.)

I&#39;ve been coming here since I moved into the neighborhood more than ten years ago. In fact, I used to phone ahead for comfort food takeout on the way from a god-awful job in the north suburbs. I NEEDED that open-faced roast beef sandwich on white bread with mashed potatoes and a lot of gravy as a mommy replacement to soothe my nerves. In fact, one night the counter guy had accidentally made a strawberry milkshake. Did I want it? Hell yeah! And that&#39;s exactly how it tasted. Hell yeah!

On a Saturday afternoon at around 2 or 3, I sat at the counter and the waitress offered me the Sun Times, the perfect read for the occasion. I had the skillet with corned beef--long, sandwich-style strips of corned beef, rather than the little cubes of beef and potatoes, which I also appreciate, but this had those crispy hash browns that I can&#39;t get enough of. Yum. A good afternoon was had by all.

I only hope that this place doesn&#39;t end up like The Little House in the picture book, whose owner&#39;s granddaughter finds it in disrepair in the middle of the city and moves it out to the country. I love this place, but not enough to move out of the city to partake in its haute cuisine."

So we decided to stop here for breakfast.

We sat at the counter and it was a few minutes before anyone greeted us to take our order. It seemed like there was a lag time between greeting us, giving us water, etc but they were busy so I guess I will give them a pass.

I got the Ultimate Meat Skillet - holy cow there was a lot of food! It came with a choice of toast or pancakes and I picked pancakes....bad choice for me because my eyes are bigger than my stomach. There was probably enough food to feed at least 2 people. My husband got biscuit &amp; gravy and he said that he got more biscuits than he expected - he scarfed them down like there was no tomorrow.

I would go back again...for sure!"

Sorry, White Palace, too many rules and regulations. Do you know you&#39;re in the service/hospitality industry? I.E. YOU ARE THERE TO SERVE CUSTOMERS. Not the other way around.

Seems like White Palace is concerned that they have too many customers, who are spending too much time in their restaurant. So, I&#39;ll do them a favor and eat somewhere else."

Don&#39;t let that new construction fool you though- there&#39;s good people and good breakfast.

Our waitress was right out of the &#34;stereotypical diner waitress&#34; handbook- she looked like she had a little attitude, she playfully messed with the regulars at the counter and she definitely called me &#34;hon&#34; more times than my grandmother. But she was super nice and moved around the restaurant like she knows it blind and backwards.

The walls are covered in faded news clippings and paintings that celebrate Chicago lore- everything between the Bulls, Harold Washington, Oprah and everything in between. Forget the Chicago History Museum- just get a booth at White Palace Grill to get your fill of Chicago&#39;s history.

My cousin and I had a pretty straightforward breakfast- pancakes, eggs, sausage and the like. We definitely got our food in less than fifteen minutes, even with a packed house and a line almost out the door. Everything tasted great and came at a reasonable price.

What I was most impressed with was the speed and efficiency with which the staff took care of their customers, all while remaining warm and friendly. I&#39;m not sure what breakfast restaurants are in the new mega malls surrounding White Palace Grill, but don&#39;t count out the old guy on the block- not by a longshot."

Everyone knows what constitutes a typical DDD place. I&#39;ve been to a few and always had some great tasting food, whether it was a dive or a nicer-looking joint.

I ordered the fish/grits/eggs (perch) for about $9. Also came with toast. This is a ton of food for the price, no complaint there! The grits were flavorless and disappointing and the eggs had an odd texture. Can&#39;t mess up toast, nor fried fish. All in all it was very disjointed - I felt like it was eggs, grits and toast with a side of fried perch. Maybe that&#39;s how it was supposed to be and maybe I&#39;m an idiot.

All in all, I feel about WPG how I feel about Navy Pier -- I&#39;d bring a friend here if they wanted but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back."

It came with a choice of toast or English muffin, I chose the English muffin and it was charred on one side. The pancakes were fantastic though, very fluffy and plenty of syrup and butter. Service was quick but not the best. 

My favorite part if this place was the place itself. Amazing murals, art on the ceiling, old newspaper clipping and art on the walls with a typical retro diner feel.

However, I will not be returning to this restaurant ever again! I went with 3 other people for breakfast, and had the worst experience of my life.

Our waitress didn&#39;t come to the table for 15 minutes after sitting down, our food (three out of four of the meals, anyway) came before she brought us silverware. My meal came out at least 10 minutes after the rest of the meals, and in two parts. I ordered chicken and waffles, a popular choice. The chicken was brought out 5 minutes after the waffles, and once I took the chicken off the plate to eat it with the waffle that had been getting cold waiting for the chicken, my boyfriend pointed out a hair on the empty plate. 

Throughout the the meal we found two other hairs in the food on different plates, and my chicken was grey and uncooked in the middle. 

We were made to walk around the restaurant to find a manager to ask for something to be done about all this. The head manager proceeded to accuse us of lying, as all of his cooks wear hairnets and hats (but nothing to catch the beard hair, like the ones we found). 

He wouldn&#39;t comp our meal, apologize, or make any effort to rectify the situation. I&#39;ve worked in restaurants for years, and his reaction was simply ridiculous, he should lose his job, so they don&#39;t keep losing customers.

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."

It all started off with having to wait 15 minutes, after sitting down, for staff to come over to our table of four people to get our order. The place wasn&#39;t busy at all. 

Once our food got to the table, we didn&#39;t have any silverware. However, that&#39;s not even the worst part! There was hair on THREE DIFFERENT PLATES of food. Disgusting. The waiters took the plates back, and once they brought back the replacement plates there was ANOTHER PLATE WITH HAIR IN IT. It was at this point that we all decided we didn&#39;t want to continue eating here. 

Our waiter said that the manager had removed one of our orders, but we would have to talk to him about removing the rest of the orders. Okay, sure. All four of us go over to the manager and complain about how terrible our experience has been. He has the nerve to ask if we purposely put our hair on the plates, and says that it&#39;s impossible for hairs to have gotten on the food plates because all of the cooks wear hairnets. This manager was by far the most incompetent person I&#39;ve ever spoken to in the food industry. We ended up having to pay for a meal that we didn&#39;t eat, and terrible service.

I WILL NEVER EVER BE GOING BACK HERE OR RECOMMENDING THIS PLACE TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY.   

I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE 0/5 STARS!"

I loved this diner. They had me immediately as I walked down Canal Street and saw the architecture of the building itself. Then when I entered the door, the ambiance screamed vintage diner and the cooking was true Home-Style. 

The menu was so vast, I could not decide what to order. There were so many items that either are a favorite breakfast item of mine or one of my featured list here on Yelp. 
I was tempted by the Chicken and Waffles and The Biscuits and Gravy, but went with a simple Egg Breakfast. I choose two eggs, hash browns with bacon and wheat toast. 
My eggs were done right, over easy. So many diners over cook  &#34;over easy&#34; eggs, but not here. They also made my hash browns crispy and the bacon was crisp, thick cut and wide. My wheat toast was a thick slice making for a perfect foundation for an egg with bacon sandwich. 

My waitress was friendly, provided service with an early morning smile and made sure my coffee cup was never empty. For me that is a good diner server. 

I had the tiny booth next to door which was perfect for people watching in the diner and those out on the street where Canal intersects with Roosevelt. No need for my iPad, I was totally entertained. In fact one of the last diners to arrive took my breath away. Good people watching!!!"

However the chef worked on 12/11/2015 Friday evening. I walked to the cashier asked him to check out for us, he point out no split bill which is fine, but he gave me the attitude and not glad to take my check at all and I wondered why?

Came in after a long day of walking around and shopping July 4th sales. My fiance and I were pretty tired (hungover really) still from July 4th and didn&#39;t want any silly salad business. We needed comfort food. White Palace was there to deliver.

We each thought we were going to go for breakfast for dinner - perhaps some waffles, an omelette, or a skillet of some kind. Then I saw it...I saw their chicken and waffles option. I had been debating if I truly wanted breakfast or if I should go for a savory dinner...

It&#39;s just like that girl from the Old El Paso Hard and Soft Tacos commercial. WHY NOT BOTH?

So yes, I went for it. And it was glorious. My fiance decided to have their Gypsy Baquet skillet and it was also incredibly tasty. 

Everything about our meals was classic, felt like home and made just right. No fancy fixins or additions - just good ol&#39; diner food. 

I need to go back for a burger and milkshake though...that review to come!"

We took a cab here and found it easily. The environment is like walking back in time. The staff were friendly, especially our waitress.

What I really wanted were the braised short ribs, but they didn&#39;t have it as a special the day we went, so I ended up with the breaded porkchops. It was a LOT of food but delicious. I couldn&#39;t finish the gluttonous masterpiece but was happy I got to experience it! (My crew got chicken and waffles, which were decent.)

For this place to have been on Diners Drive Ins and Dives (Guy Fieri show) is a jaw dropper. Not only is the food pricey for the low quality of the food. They don&#39;t even allow you to split the bill. At the end of the day you&#39;re getting paid(white palace). I don&#39;t know why they (white palace) make it that difficult to pay. All legal money is currency! No matter how and where it comes from White Palace. If you&#39;re coming for the chicken and waffles.... don&#39;t. The meat is processed taste like McDonalds chicken. The waffles are bland. I recommend going to Churches Chicken ( as greasy as that sounds) They have some &#34;bomb @$$ chicken &amp;waffles cost way less (4 something) and you leave satisfied .

Luckily, I&#39;ve gotten a few of the former in my lottery of visits, and I can&#39;t say anything terrible has come out of the meals.

It&#39;s a diner, so we figured they would have something on the menu that would satisfy both of our taste buds.  We were seated immediately which was great, but the service failed to be on point after that.  While the menu was filled with tons of tasty options, I stuck with the beef sandwich platter with fries, while she ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  The food was just ok...  I was more dissatisfied with the service.  After dropping off our meal, our server disappeared, never to be heard from again.  Throughout the first 15 mins of our meal, we kept looking around for someone to refill our drinks and for some silverware (the gf likes to cut her burger in half lol).  One of the other servers finally noticed and notified us that our original server had an emergency and went home. Ok cool, I understand, but when there are more servers on the floor than people eating, I figure that we would get checked on more than once.  As I mentioned before, the food was just ok and I&#39;m more than positive that an alcohol filled me would be loving this place at 3am, but a sober me at 6pm on a Wednesday feels otherwise.

We ordered grilled cheese and strawberry Belgium waffles with whip cream. The grilled cheese wasn&#39;t melted all the way and I was still able to see the unmelted slices. Also, the waffles looked good at first, but the whip cream melted way to fast. It just showed me the quality of the item they use for the food isn&#39;t the best.

-Cleanliness 

Our waitress approaches our table and asks us if we&#39;re ready to order, we hadn&#39;t noticed the menus had been tucked behind the condiments so we needed a minute and ordered soft drinks. After she gets back to the table with tiny 10 oz tumblers filled to the brim with ice, she takes our order. An eternity later, watching her eat her soup to completion, she finally gets up to get our food &amp; another set of refills. 

We get the pleasure of seeing her again 20 minutes later to ask for the things that had been missing from our order &amp; a third round of refills. Finally after a whopping 40 minutes of watching our waitress slather toast with butter using her finger, yes HER FINGER, and handing it to the cooks as we ate, she finally came to us to drop of the bill and walk away without a word. 

I was feeling another refill, naturally, so upon asking she informs me that she had already charged me for a refill 3 times already and this would be my 4th. My eating buddy declined their refill on lemonade as well. Finally she returns to our table with a bill close to $46 for two $8.99 entrees and soft drinks that surmounted to $46 some how. When approaching the counter to pay, the sullen man at the cash register informed me that they cannot split the bill or charge two cards so I swallowed the $46 and tip. 

Long story short I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back here again unless they get rid of their questionable business practices, their should be a sign informing guests about no free refills , just like the massive sign that says parties over 5 must prepay after 1am, as well as a sign stating their inability split a bill at that high of a price point."

The service was really good, but the food isn&#39;t all that. I ordered the chicken fajita skillet and the chicken seemed dry, the eggs that I ordered sunny side up were not fully cooked on top of my skillet and the whole dish pretty much didn&#39;t have much flavor.

Extremely disappointed with this place. I ordered a pizza on a Friday night and knew the wait would be long but I never expected a 1 hr 45 min wait for a small stuffed. The girl on the phone seemed to not know what she was doing, told me my card was declined, and then said never mind it went through. 

When the pizza finally arrived I gave the delivery driver a really nice tip EVEN though it had taken so long. I kept hearing my phone going off in the next room and when I finally answered it was the manager saying quite rudely and loudly that if I didn&#39;t pay for the pizza NOW she was going to call the cops. That the driver had been knocking and no one had paid! I tried explaining to her that the girl on the phone said it had gone through just fine but was cut off.

One we never heard knocking at the door. Two there was no need for her to act up the way she did when it was a simple misunderstanding. And then she hung up as soon as I gave her my card information. I was pissed off. Never have I ever been spoken to like that by a &#34;manager&#34;. AND the pizza wasn&#39;t even good. Barely any sauce. I&#39;m NEVER ordering from this giordanos again."

Got deep dish pizza, good ingredient, great taste, made to order. Way less greasy than I anticipated, which is great.
However, upon paying, waitress took our credit cards and then came back to ask for ID stating that her manager would need to see the ID&#39;s. Didn&#39;t think twice and handed the waitress our ID&#39;s. She took them to her manager. 
This is when I thought it was highly strange and irregular that they had to take our ID&#39;s out of our sight. So I went back to the cash register where the apparently appointed  manager was running credit cards, I told her I thought it was entirely inappropriate to have our ID&#39;s taken to her and I needed my ID right there.  
This is highly inappropriate and now I wonder if they are running a scheme. There is absolutely no need for this, the waitress can ID customers without taking their cards where God knows what they can do with them (scanning machine, copies, etc)

Very disappointing end to what could have been an ok meal. Now, I am wondering if I will be the victim of credit fraud. 
I am alerting my credit cards and mentioning them as a potential source of future problems. 
Oh, and the &#34;manager&#34; acted surprise when i told her I need my ID CARD back. Unbelievable bad commercial manners, what a witch! Will not return in the future."

I will not bore the reading with tales of how or why we ended up eating dinner here on Wednesday July 27 about 5pm.  It does not matter and we absolutely find those stories utterly so self-absorbed that anything the reviewer types afterward becomes suspect. 

Our server was a chunky male with black hair and he had a short name, but just cannot recall.  Part of our order for the appetizers was the parmesan fries.  He brought out a small plate of regular fries.  When I asked about the parm fries he said &#34;I heard you just say fries. I will take these back to see if they can do something.&#34; About two minutes later he brought the exact same plate of fries, now with some parm sprinkled on them.  I still had to ask for the ranch sauce.

Time and time again throughout the meal he would pass by to refill other tables water or beverages, but never stopped at ours.  Several times he had a full water pitcher as he raced past with no eye contact at all. 

After the meal we sat for almost 15 minutes for him to bring a check.  Another 10 to get the credit card and receipt back.

I watched as other servers gleefully assisted their customers.  Not us.

We had a view of the entrance toward the kitchen area.  Bussers stood there often. One frequently biting his nails and spitting what he chewed off out onto the floor.

The calamari was fantastic.  Chicken chopped salad divine blew my mind with the texture and flavors.  Do not pass it up and the portion was yuuuge.  Now the pizza.....sigh...well....bland. Almost no sauce and just was bland. There is a shaker of some seasoning at each table, please use it because the kitchen does not. 

So, that sums up the visit. Even though the hotel we stay at is just down the street, on the next visit we will certainly find another pizza joint. This one is just too pricey to give it a second shot and it to fail. Be well, my friends."

So visiting Chicago for the first time, being a total tourist. How could I not have the Chicago deep dish pizza.

After, much debating my wife and I finally decided to go to Giordano&#39;s along with a few friends. We decided to order the bruchetta since the wait time for a deep dish pizza is 45mins-1 hour. For the pizza, we decided to play it safe by ordering classic pepperoni. 

The bruchetta did not disappoint. The tomatoes were as fresh as they could be and the bread nice and crispy. It had a nice flavor. 

A little while after getting done with the bruchetta, there it was, the moment of truth, our deep dish pizza finally arrived. The cheese was nice and gooey, the filling was nice and fresh, and the crust was perfectly crispy. All in all a solid pizza. We ordered a medium, which was good for 4 people. 

Now was this the greatest pizza, perhaps not, maybe because I&#39;m too used to having my pizza New York style on the go with the cheese dripping and the paper plate being greasy. Having said that, the pizza was still pretty solid and would recommend it to someone. The only thing which was disappointing was the service. The servers looked confused and were not very accessible."

Two of us had the small veggie which is 6 slices and ended up saving one slice each for breakfast the next day (take note...equally as good cold as it was warm the night before). There are naturally a lot of pizza options, and we also split a side Greek salad as an appetizer. Speaking of appetizers, I had joined the Giordano&#39;s e-club and had a coupon for a free bruschetta or garlic bread. Unfortunately, I was informed that they cannot be shown on a mobile device, they must be printed, which is fine, but what bothers me is that it is not written anywhere so how would we have known? Anyway, our pizza took over an hour to come out which I should add is completely normal and should be expected (even when we just ordered a small pizza and the restaurant was relatively empty at the time). Our waitress got the job done, though I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to praise her friendliness by any means. For the pizza, salad, and we each got a pint of beer (not a huge beer list), the tab came to about $50."

I live a few blocks from the 63rd and Cicero location and it&#39;s the location I normally order from. The last few times I&#39;ve ordered for delivery it has taken close to 2 hours for the pizza to arrive  which is not a big deal since they tell you up front that it&#39;s a long wait, the problem is that by the time the driver makes other deliveries and gets to me my pizza is already cold. 

Second issue is that they stopped accepting coupons as of June 1st so the extra coupons I had (with no expiration date) are no longer valid and they wouldn&#39;t even honor my $5 coupon as a courtesy given that I didn&#39;t know they had stopped accepting coupons.

The gentleman who took my order suggested I sign up for email alerts or whatever in order to get coupons via email. Soooo you still issue coupons but you can&#39;t honor mine? Mmm, okay so I register online and the coupon code never arrived, how annoying.

I will continue to buy from them because I love their pizza, I just wish their service was a little bit better so I can happily recommend it to other people, for now all I can say, if you don&#39;t mind paying a lot of money and waiting up to 2 hours for lukewarm pizza then this is your place!"

I tried the stuffed pizza with pepperoni and everything about it was heavenly. The crust on this pizza was flaky and light, which is different than any deep dish variety you can get out east which is normally dense. The inside of the pizza oozed unendingly with cheesy goodness. I can normally eat quite a few slices of pizza, but here I struggled through two. I won&#39;t even think about the potential calories so I&#39;m glad I live far far away.

Plenty of parking.  I was forewarned the pies are made fresh so it takes a while for the order to arrive.  If your in rush, it might be an issue.

A work colleague and I had finished a business trip to Michigan City, Indiana and we drove back to Chicago for our respective flights home the next day.

After checking in at the nearby Hampton Inn, we separately asked for restaurant recommendations and pretty much got the same response (word for word) from 2 different front desk staff. Oh well, beggars can&#39;t be choosers, especially since we didn&#39;t want to get in the car, 

Giordano&#39;s is one of the Chicago Deep Dish Pizza chains that some people swear by. And so much so that cross-country delivery is available.

We went ahead and ordered half all-beef meatballs with mushrooms and then chicken sausage with mushrooms on the other side. The winning protein topping was the all-beef meatballs! We had to get a personalized 6&#34; pizza combo each before we left Chicago.  Each combo came with a bottle of soda and choice of a side salad or garlic fries for $8.95.  We also ordered fried calamari to-go. Everything was delicious from start to finish! We noticed they do nationwide shipping on their website and will definitely have to try that in the future.

Tip: Each pizza takes about 40-45 minutes to make, call ahead and order to go, or if you&#39;re dining in, order some appetizers to hold you over! Also, don&#39;t forget to join their mailing list as they offer a complimentary appetizer of bruschetta to try!"

But... with that said, I think the deep dish was pretty freaking phenomenal. I have Celiac Disease, so I have to eat Gluten Free items so I wasn&#39;t able to get the deep dish for myself. However, I had a couple bites of my boyfriends deep dish pie and was in love. Trust me, the stomach pains were worth every bite.

The gluten free pizza is pretty good as well. I haven&#39;t really found a place where I rave over the pizza but I think Giordano&#39;s offers a good alternative for pizza, since I can&#39;t eat it that often anymore. The toppings are ALWAYS so fresh, with the mozzarella cheese being so deliciously gooey and yummy. I would just recommend, that if you are ordering the GF Pizza to order it &#34;crispy&#34; because the center of the pizza always comes out with half cooked raw dough that I have to eat around."

Unfortunately this place isn&#39;t very solo diner friendly if you want pizza and are traveling. They do not do pizza by the slice or offer pizzas small enough for one person. I stayed in a hotel with a tiny mini fridge so I couldn&#39;t really take leftovers with me. I was about to leave but in an effort to try and accommodate me the waiter offered the Beefzza as an option. I decided to try it and it tasted alright but it wasn&#39;t the deep dish pizza I was looking for. Maybe if it had had tomato or Alfredo sauce in it it would have been enough but instead it had a dipping sauce (which tasted good but again, was in the mood for deep dish pizza). Probably won&#39;t eat here again unless I&#39;m with other people and can split something. I gave it three stars because the staff was friendly and attempted to accommodate me."

The atmosphere is informal and they do get busy.

Gooey delicious mozzarella cheese inside a pie with a buttery flakey crust. The sauce is divine with the perfect amount of sweetness to it. One slice and I was full and between the two of us (my husband and I) we took half of the smallest pie size home. We decided to get meatballs in it which we regretted because they didn&#39;t do much for the pizza but wow we thought this pizza was delicious. We also did get a small size of the Harvest Salad to start which was a perfect size for both of us to snack on during the 45 minute wait for the pizza. The wait is typical because they need every minute to make this pizza perfect. I liked the feel of this place. It reminded me of a Friday&#39;s meets Italian restaurant so it was casual but nice enough to enjoy a glass of wine with our food. We are not local to the area so we won&#39;t be able to return but I&#39;d say this would be the type of place I wouldn&#39;t go to often because it is super filling. More of a special treat. Their menu is huge though so there are many other options other than their famous stuffed pizza.

Not only were they loud and rude but the girlfriend was swearing extremely loud. There were kids everywhere, parents and older guest kept staring and the staff didn&#39;t seem to care but their waitress seemed annoyed. This shouldn&#39;t reflect on how great the service and food are but I hope the staff becomes more aware of people like this in a well respected restaurant.

This is a meal that is worth taking your time, and enjoying.  But if you are in a hurry phone ahead and they will have the pizza ready when you get there.

I don&#39;t feel that 5 stars is enough when speaking of the amazing Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria.  My friend was going to take me out for some Chicago deep dish pizza on my last night in the city.  We were going to the Navy Pier afterwards so we were gonna head out to the location closest to there.  We decided to call ahead of time and were told the wait time on Saturday nights can be up to 2 hours during dinner time.  We were too hungry for that, so we stopped at this location near the Midway Airport.  When I say near the airport, that&#39;s an understatement.  You can actually see the planes landing through the window looking to be only about a couple hundred feet above you.  Kinda scary/cool.  Anyway, back to the incredible food...

We got here around 7:30pm and were seated immediately.  Our waiter was friendly and brought our drinks out right away.  We ordered our stuffed pizza and were told it was going to take about 30-35 minutes.  In about that time, the pizza came out and he served up our plates.  As I took my first bite, I knew that pizza would never be the same for me again..No other pizza could ever compare!  Lol. There were 4 of us and the large fed us all with a slice or two left over. 

I cannot wait to make my next trip to Chicago, even if it&#39;s just for an hour to stop at Giordano&#39;s.  Hey-- maybe that&#39;s why they have this location practically on Midway Airport&#39;s runway."

For the pizza we got the small which is still 6 slices.  We didn&#39;t want to overstuff ourselves before getting on the plane so it was just right.

I liked this better than Lou Malnati&#39;s and Gino&#39;s East, but this is purely personal preference.  I gave Giordanos the edge because I like their sauce slightly better.

This location is a little small, so it&#39;s good to call ahead.

Also a little tip is to call about 30 minutes before you want to eat and order a pizza to be eaten when you get there...  It kinda puts in a reservation for you.

Besides, who wants to sit around and wait 30 minutes for there pizza to be ready?  Not me.

My flight was delayed, and I was coming to Chicago with the express purpose of satisfying my deep dish craving. The places I&#39;d hand-selected closed at 11 and 11:30, and it was almost 11:20 by the time I got my rental car. I was thinking dark thoughts of starvation. As I headed south from MDW, something caught my eye. It was a flashing light-up sign that clearly said &#34;PIZZERIA&#34; beneath. The place was open. My needs were fulfilled. I was at Giordano&#39;s.
Disclaimer: I&#39;m from NJ. My expertise is NY-style pizza. But here&#39;s what Giordano&#39;s offers:
* Their pizza is unquestionably the thickest around. It was harder to eat their small than it was to eat other places&#39; mediums.
* A lot of toppings, some of which you won&#39;t find most places
* Very nice beer selection.

It&#39;s a bit pricey here, and the sauce is barely on the plus side of average. That&#39;s about all I can say against them. They&#39;re open past midnight, critical for the late-night delayed traveler, and for a local chain (about 2 dozen restaurants total) the quality is as good as I can hope for. Very friendly, attentive service. They changed the channel at the bar for me so I could watch Sportscenter. If I were stranded in the middle of a desolate Chicago neighborhood, I would absolutely flee to the nearest Giordano&#39;s for salvation if that were my best information. Heck, if I fly into MDW again, I would very likely come right back here. It&#39;s a bit more money than other places, but you get more than a bit more pizza."

The deep dish pizza is really thick and delicious.  The cost of a medium pizza was a little pricey which was about $27 for a medium but worth it.  What I really like is that they put meat inside the pizza so that there is flavor all over.  This is one pizza that will be hard to eat with your hands and it is messy.  I would recommend this place but make sure you come hungry! There are several different locations, I went to the one by the airport.  If you want to pick up an order it will take about 45 mins to get, just so you know."

We were on a limited time schedule so our family could make it back for their connecting flight. We chose this restaurant so that our out of town family could enjoy some Chicago style pizza which they can&#39;t get in Seattle. I was told they didn&#39;t take reservations on a Sunday after 3:00. I explained the circumstances to the manager and asked if they could make an exception and accomodate us. She said no. She said they were usually busy on Sunday nights and could not guarantee a table nor estimate the average wait time. When I suggested half our party would arrive early to secure a table she was concerned about us taking up a table waiting for our traveling family to arrive. The pies take 45 minutes to cook. It didn&#39;t have to be so complicated. Now instead of me posting a wonderful, accommodating experience I am posting how rigid and unflexible they were. Yes there are rules but a truly customer focused organization would have handled this better."

Was going to have a beer, but they&#39;ve got their beer on a 500% markup- $5 for a so-so Miller Lite that cost them something like 50¢ - that&#39;s not even beer!  Settled for a coffee.  That was $2.75 (2x Starbucks) and tasted like it was made the previous shift- burned and bitter.  Server was good, but everything else was bad.

Our front desk lady said if you girls are starving go down the street. The pizza place has to die for Chicago style pizza. So we walked the block from our hotel walked right in and got sat in what looked like a small section for out server. We didn&#39;t get greeted for about 7 minutes. Our waitress also seemed bugged we wanted to order off the lunch menu. After she took our drink order she walked to another table and discussed the entire menu to this older couple. 
     Now I&#39;m a server also so I get sometimes you run into that guest who forgets he or she isn&#39;t the other one in the restaurant. After about 10 minutes discussing pizza and how it&#39;s made and how to order she walks away and I thought she left to put our order in. At the top of the menu it claims it takes 45 minutes to make the pizza. So I&#39;m not complaining about how long the food takes. The food was wonderful!! But our waitress could care less about our experience and how things tasted. 
      We finally get out sodas after 15 minutes of waiting. Then she comes back to the able to let us know they only have two lunch portion pizzas left. So the three of decide to order an appetizer and split the pizzas. Again we have plenty of food so that&#39;s fine. 
        Once our salads arrive I finally get my beer that took 25 minutes. No apology for how long it took. My friends drinks were empty at the time. Our appetizer makes it in a record time. And finally the pizzas make it. She doesn&#39;t offer them another drink and we don&#39;t see here again for about 25 minutes. We are done eating now and my friend still wants a drink refill. So I walked up to the front desk I assume I talked with a manager and I asked if I could get a Sierra Mist. The lady told me to ask my waitress. I said I would be we haven&#39;t seen her in a while. She then asked where I was sitting I walked back to the table which was in eye view of her and other co workers who were gathered around a computer. She brings me a Sierra mist I pass it to my friend and she takes some empty plates. This is where the manager should probably ask how everything was. But she didn&#39;t. Our check comes and then our waitress asks if we would like a refill. Needless to say if we do go back I&#39;ll ask for an experienced server. 
     I&#39;ve worked in the restaurant business for over 10 years. All you have to do is be honest with your table and say sorry for forgetting to put the order in or your mistakes. This lady didn&#39;t care at all about our drinks or what we ordered. And she never said sorry for the extremely slow service."

It&#39;s hard to find a nice basic breakfast sandwich in the city. I always find breakfast items are often times over the top and over loaded. While I had the simplest item on the breakfast menu (bacon, egg, and cheese on an English muffin) I was really satisfied. The service was friendly and the wait time was not long at all like a lot of food trucks can be. Also, the price, very reasonable not only for a food truck but for a brick and mortar restaurant.

Blue Street Market was the first truck I saw and the Fire Cracker Chicken description sounded yummy (Sweet Chili chicken...and I love Sriracha)! The flavor of this sandwich was amazing!!

For $8.50 you get the sandwich and one side. I went with the Vegetarian Jambalaya. I&#39;ll be honest I could have used a little meat in it, but it was still pretty good. I just ate mouthfuls of the jambalaya between bites of the Chicken Sandwich. I will not be a stranger the next time I see this food truck. Looking forward to placing my next order.

It was early morning and I had not had breakfast yet. The idea of Dunkin Donuts or Panera just wasn&#39;t cutting the mustard. As I headed into the office the notion of chewing on my fingers till noon was being ever more attractive.  Then, out of the fog, or possibly food truck pollution, I&#39;m not sure which as I hadn&#39;t had coffee yet, I saw this giant blue truck with food in it.

The truck said Blue Street on it which confirmed my suspicion that I knew what the color blue looked like. Having one win under my belt prior to 8am meant today was going to be a good day!  As I approached a little white board on the side of the truck had a menu of 6 things I could order... all under 8 dollars. This would be win number two!

I got a breakfast burrito because those happen to be two of my most favorite worlds outside of &#34;all you can eat&#34;. They offered my choice of meat from bacon, sausage, or chorizo. It took a few minutes to make and a nice young man handed me a sizable burrito.

As far as breakfast burritos go, it was exactly what I needed. It could have been better with some refried beans in it, but now I&#39;m just being picky. Will I eat from this food truck again? Maybe. When the conditions are right and the fog/pollution parts and color blindness hasn&#39;t stricken me... yeah I&#39;d like to try their biscuits and gravy."

The truck was clean and looked professional. Blue Street doesn&#39;t skimp on the size and weight of the sandwich. 

I ordered the Turkey Guacamole roll with Jumbalaya. It was a big sandwich and there was a lot of turkey on the roll. It was passable, but....... I am pretty sure the guacamole wasn&#39;t homemade. The guac was the consistency of mayonnaise or ketchup something you would squirt out of a bottle. I prefer some chunkiness to my guac. Also the sandwich was kind of bland, although I think the tomatoes were fresh. The Jumbalaya had okra in it, I like that, but it also wasn&#39;t very spicy.

All in all, a decent lunch, but not exciting."

Can you expect to have southern cali quality tacos here? No. but your in the south side of Chicago, and given that, I think they do a quality job. The carnitas (sandwiches) are especially good. The most popular is the Milanesa (breaded pork loin). This is not my favorite, but I think the chicken and steak are both good. For tacos I recommend the government (chorizo and steak). The quesadillas were an especially nice surprise. Great cheese, great with chicken added. Good hot sauces too. And, it&#39;s byob. Bring a bottle of wine or a few cold beers and this place is great. It&#39;s not cheap, but also not expensive for a great lunch or dinner. The also have breakfast, which I haven&#39;t tried but am excited to.

Food: had their atomica cemita, which was just too much meat and not enough of everything else. The meat was good but not enough to be the sole star of the sandwich. The atomica was about $12, so not cheap either. The best part about my meal was the horchata (milk based drink)...incredible cinnamon flavor.

Service: no complaints. You get a number and they bring it to your table fairly quickly.

Employees are smiling, service was quick, responsive, space is clean and decorated nicely.  But one goes to eat at a restaurant in order to eat food, and thus so much depends on the food itself, which just didn&#39;t stand well for me.  I got the Taco Cecina (cured steak) and the Cemita Al Pastor.  Both suffered from a lack of flavor, and the 3 sauces on each table can only do so much to save it.  The Cecina was a slightly moist beef jerky texture (but without marinade), and the Al Pastor was dry (no sauce?) while the guac and cheese smooth out any remaining flavor.  Perhaps I just chose the wrong items, heard the Cemita Jamon was good and piled high with ham."

I have to think that something might have went wrong with the food... I ordered the Al Pastor cemita, I don&#39;t remember if there were onions on it. But I do remember a few other things.The pork was pretty bland, and a little dry, and the bun was (very good) but way too big that it drowns everything else out. There was some nice cheese, but too much of it relative to the other stuff on there. Some kind of green paste was applied to the cemita but it just seeped into and made the insides of the buns a little soggy. It cost almost $10, so that added to the disappointment. Someone I sat with had the pico + chips which was good, and another person mentioned their milanesa being good.

Also, none of the salsas went well with that cemita in particular. I&#39;d probably give this place another try with the tacos."

I had a cemita pollo and large chips &amp; guacamole.  I thought they were both good.  I still prefer going to Pilsen for great Mexican food, but this was decent.  The sandwich ($8) is large, but it&#39;s just bread, chicken, and cheese.  They have 3 salsas on the table, and I put a lot of salsa on the sandwich.

The cemita roll is a great vehicle, the fillings are a nice array of satisfying and interesting meat, cheese, etc.  And while it seems that the seasoning of the meat has been a little inconsistent in the early days, you should be eating this sandwich with a squeeze bottle of salsa in your other hand anyway, so keep that in mind. Yes, I would like more vegetables on my sandwich, but salsa is a vegetable, right?

Weird as it is to say, this might even be the best *restaurant* in Hyde Park, though I realize it can be hard to compare to places like A10 and Promontory and (my favorite) Yusho. I mean, here&#39;s how I think of the Fulton Market location -- it&#39;s not so great that I regularly make trips to Fulton Market JUST to eat there, but it&#39;s good enough that if I have any reason to be over in the West Loop I will often time my trip so that I can grab lunch there. And if that was true of the West Loop, with an intense density of amazingly tasty restaurants, just imagine how this place rates in Hyde Park, the culinary land left behind.

Five stars for Hyde Park. Looking forward to trying the breakfasts, tacos, etc. This place should be here for a while."

I was thrilled to see a new restaurant quickly replace the rapidly closed Dumplings: reimagined. Cemitas Pueblas joins the recent spate in Mexican offerings in Hyde Park including the tasty tacos sold at Z&amp;H and Hyde Park Taco Station. Being a taco lover I ordered the pollo and the al pastor both of which were incredibly bland, the chicken more so. The salsas helped to kick the tacos up a notch, but the taste itself was seriously wanting.
Here&#39;s why I will be back - the service was friendly and quick, and seeing as though I think I caught them on an off day and they&#39;re a new business in the area I want to give them another shot.

While on a &#34;neighborhood walk&#34; with friends who live in Hyde Park, our final stop was tacos at Cermitas Puebla. It was a perfect way to end the day!

Cermitas Puebla is super sleek and contemporary inside. You order at the counter and place your card face up on your table. I went with the Taco Pollo and my husband went with the Al Pastor sandwich.  My tacos were good although I recommend grabbing the optional sauces. They add another level of taste. My husband liked his sandwich but would&#39;ve liked a bit more spice/heat. The hottest level sauce was the perfect compliment. The chips &amp; salsa were excellent and the salsa was awesome on my tacos. 

I&#39;m jealous that Hyde Park has this amazing restaurant. We need a Cermitas Puebla in the South Loop."
cemitas-puebla-chicago-11,Rodrigo G.,XC6XIwcy-vzPLRjaJEIn3A,"Washington, DC",0,1,0,0,69,DHY4xq27aNUdR683RdTbFg,1.0,2016-09-27,"So I&#39;m going to preface this review by saying two things:
1. I&#39;m from Tucson, AZ where we have access to actual Mexican food made by actual Mexican people at pretty bare bones prices - think nothing on the menu over $8. 
2. I&#39;ve lived in Mexico City and Puebla and know that you don&#39;t need to break the bank to make great tasting Mexican food. 

Ok, now the review of Cemitas - Hyde Park. 

The place looks great and seems to be cashing in on the Chipotle model of assembly line-esque service which has proven itself pretty effective. However, at Cemitas this doesn&#39;t seem to be the case, as the food comes out fast but is cold and hastily prepared. 

I ordered the Al Pastor sandwich which came with literally eight strips of sad looking pork on it, one of which was all gristle and inedible. Atop my now seven lonely strips of room temp pork was a mountain of Chihuahua cheese that had any semblance of flavor surgically removed from it. The bun was cold, and the &#34;spicy&#34; al pastor pork was so flavorless it felt like I was working my way through a mouthful of erasers. 

The one saving grace was that the sauces on offer were actually very solid and ranged from mild to fairly spicy. However, it sucks that you have to employ them rather enthusiastically if you want to tease out any kind of flavor from your meal. 

The guacamole as a side is quite tasty, but is either different from the one they use on the sandwiches or is simply not flavorful enough to salvage the turbo-bland sandwiches. 

Finally, the price point is too high. After two sandwiches, a side of guacamole, and a coffee, we ended up spending a little over $30. Which is comparable to a night out at Kuma&#39;s Corner where the quality is outstanding, the quantity is enough to slay a grizzly, and the food isn&#39;t cold. 

All things considered, we know where we&#39;ll be spending our next $30."

I added avo &amp; onions and it made my tacos quite tasty. The hubs got the Arabe Cemitas and it was awesome! Their chips are yummy too. Cooked right and not too salty! And the delivery was SO fast! 15-20 min tops!

Big reason why we will be back is they did forget one of my tacos, but its their response that was so great. I called to tell them not to bring me another one but just to let them know of the mossing item and ticket that was wrong. She admitted fault (something most people don&#39;t do in general) and then offered to refund both the tacos. Something we didn&#39;t want her to do but she insisted. We&#39;re all human, everyone makes mistakes. It&#39;s how she handled it is why we&#39;ll definitely be back &amp; continue to order from here. Great customer service!

I ordered 3 carne asada tacos, and 2 fish tacos to go.  $22.  Okay, no problem, they must be really good.

NINETEEN minutes later, after standing in the cramped corner with the other people waiting for to-go orders, I finally got my order.  I couldn&#39;t help but notice that the people who were eating in got their food within a few minutes, while the rest of us hovered in the drink/bus station corner waiting for our names to be called.

Another note:  I always think it&#39;s so tacky when I see employees snacking while on their shift.  I saw multiple employees eating chips and refilling their drinks at the fountain while I was waiting.  Perhaps the owners don&#39;t mind this, but as a patron it seems unsanitary and unprofessional.

Lastly, I checked my order when I got in the car, and it was wrong.  But, upon noticing how TINY these tacos are, I was thrilled that it was wrong BC they gave me an extra fish taco.  I considered going back in to order a few extra BC there was NO WAY my husband of normal stature will be full from his 3 tacos, but realized I didn&#39;t have another 20 minutes to wait.

To be clear, I just want to say that if these tacos were amazing, I would deal with all of this and support this local business.  But, these tacos were average at best.  Bland, needed some salt or something.  

Lastly, I am not a student, but so many people in the area are.  I&#39;m not sure, with these prices and portions, that they will be able to make it.  Another Hyde park disappointment."

Firstly, as many other reviewers indicated, the tacos are unforgivably small for the price. They were yummy, but my stomach was like...

...where they at? Because I felt nothing.

Secondly, the service was friendly, but I saw the cashier handle/prepare food and drinks, which I was under the impression was not best practice. You just handled money from the person in front of me a minute earlier and now you&#39;re touching my food/drink? Eehh... 

Other than that, I enjoyed it!

There were a lot of students there when I went, which is great. But don&#39;t get the idea that this place is for students on a budget. $11.50 is kind of ridiculous for just a sandwich, even a thick one. For that reason, it remains to be seen how viable the place is; it isn&#39;t fancy enough to draw people willing to pay more, but it&#39;s a little too pricey for hungry neighbors to make it a frequent stop."

From the ashes of the mythical disappointment that was Dumplings: White Bastardization Reimagined rises like a blindingly glorious Phoenix Cemitas Puebla, a no-nonsense, reasonably priced, amazing service Mexican restaurant serving up classics and its sesame seed bun cemitas. 

Upon first walking in, you&#39;ll be greeted by a savory, heavenly aroma of cooking Mexican food as you approach the counter. Lovely employees take your order and brought food and sauces to our table in record time that would put even the fleet footed Achilles to shame. 

My friend and I started with a 4 oz chips and guac (the small size). Fresh avocado? And housemade toasty, salty chips? Too good to be true. A great guac blend where no onion or tomato overpower the flavor. Instead you get a precious medley of guac fit for a rey.

My horchata simply delighted me. While I could do with more cinnamon I noted immediately that unlike other horchatas I&#39;ve had, the elixir wasn&#39;t watered down. The milky taste of rice water you want from a good horchata was ever present. 

My taco government precioso hit just the spot. Add the lime! 

The cemita was gargantuan. A true behemoth. A Titan of flavor. A mountain of beautifully grated oaxacan cheese overflows in decadent splendor. Each bite of my milanesa cemita blended great textures and flavors I practically nut.

While the price may be a dollar too steep, what you get is amazing value; enough to power you through the day (or through your next charged frantic Yelp review). A must try, and hopefully a staple of your regular eating out rotation, for I hope Cemitas Puebla makes a home out of Hyde Park."

But I regret to report that this food is mediocre. Chicago is full of joints offering delicious tacos al pastor for a buck or two. Here you will pay much more for a dry and bland version in both the sandwich and tacos. The requisite onion and cilantro do not redeem it, nor do the salsas. 

The bread on which the cemita is served is too much for the cheese and protein it carries, and it had a slightly off--perhaps under-baked--quality to it. 

I can&#39;t help but feel that the owners determined that their prospective clientele lacks the sophistication to appreciate quality, flavorful Mexican food. Why else offer this undistinguished product?

May I invite the proprietor to visit the Maxwell Street market on any Sunday morning and experience delightful, inexpensive Mexican food. Perhaps some inspiration will rub off."

Tiny tacos. Some tastier than others. Kind of lacks flavor. They give more chips than salsa which lacks heat and salt. They charge for lettuce and tomatoe on tacos. The cemitas which they are known for aren&#39;t very good. Better tortas at los comales. Carne asada is tiny bits of meat some harder than others. Service is either very attentive or not. A little spacey and don&#39;t really smile much. Really don&#39;t like how they serve chips and salsa. Chips are on a plate. Feels weird. Not many options on 57th street and it&#39;s not bad.

The cemitas are huge, fresh with great texture; however, the flavor is a bit bland and requires salsa. Unfortunately, the red and green salsas also tasted like they needed salt, to me, but the chipotle was good. I think people tend to lowball Mexican food generally, but even I think the prices are a touch too high. Also, the whole calavera (skull) motif is so overdone and commercialized right now for anything &#34;Mexican,&#34; so that&#39;s a little annoying.

More positives: The horchata is amazing, I love the selection of beverages and the few sides they have, and the service is super friendly and pretty efficient. 

Hyde Park needs more Mexican food in its traditionally lackluster (but improving) restaurant scene, so if they can spice up the sandwiches and not raise prices, I will keep going back."

The menu&#39;s graphic design looks nice from a distance, but repeatedly I&#39;ve watched customers get lost trying to figure out what is on offer and what each item comes with. This confusion is compounded by the number of times the staff has gotten orders mixed up. My most recent visit featured an extended back and forth with a server who tried to convince me that I had ordered chorizo tacos despite a clearly labeled receipt. Adding to the general ambiance of confusion, the menu includes alcoholic beverages, despite the assurance from staff that the establishment is strictly byob. Maybe after a few months getting established all of this will iron itself out, and I can be satisfied to have a taco joint that is open in the evening to visit in Hyde Park."

We spent at least an hour trying to eat find a place to eat lunch at around 1.30 on a Saturday...apparently not a good idea, especially since there was a big rugby game or something and the wait for everywhere was an hour plus. So we wandered in here because it looked like there were open tables for fast seating. We got a table right away!

We ordered dim sum from the lunch menu. They had a special with certain plates for $5 only. Each dumpling plate comes with 3 pieces unless otherwise specified. I had the siew mai (shrimp and pork), zhao ji (pork with crisp rice disk), and something off the $5 menu that I believe was chee cheong fun (glutinous rice noodle-cakes) lol. We also got spring rolls, Szechuan xiao long bao (soup dumpling) and a mushroom soup to share. All of the food comes out at different times which actually works well because if it all came at once, the sheer amount would overwhelm you. My favorite was the xiao long bao and zhao ji dumplings! Everything was well cooked, flavorful, and tasted authentic - not greasy or fatty.

I think for the amount of food it was a very reasonable price too! Service was attentive and polite, and our server made sure to explain the menu with us which was helpful because we had never done dim sum-style dining before. The food was so much that we skipped dessert but the egg tarts looked really good. 

The atmosphere was far more relaxing than a lot of the other trendy restaurants around here, which are good but super hectic at a busy (???) time like that. I&#39;m so glad we decided to stop in!!!"

As soon as I got there, I realized that the ambiance and decor was quite modern, unlike most Chinese restaurants I&#39;ve been to. As my party was being seated, I noticed the restaurant&#39;s open kitchen area, where they were making the lamian. 


The menu is pretty standard, and a little bit pricey for lunch. I ordered a Combination Xiaolongbao for myself and the Tiger Shrimp Wok Fried Lamian to share with my friend. 


- Combination Xiaolongbao: I shamelessly ordered this all for myself because I really wanted to take foodie photos for Instagram. The waiter also told us that the combo had each of the six xiaolongbao flavors, so I wanted a sampling of everything. The dumpling wrappers were a bit thicker/heavier than I had anticipated. I thought that the Shanghai, Spicy Szechuan, Duck, and Crab were pretty tasty. To me, they were all different versions of the standard xiaolongbao. The Truffle and Gruyere were an interesting twist on the traditional dumplings, but a bit overpowering, especially the broth. 
- Tiger Shrimp Wok Fried Lamian: This dish wasn&#39;t anything too special. It was on the oily side as well. 


I would stick with the xiaolongbaos. On the plus side, our waiter was the bomb. He gave us plenty of time with ordering as well as some recommendations on touristy things to do in Chicago."

I especially enjoyed trying their creative twist the Shanghai styled Xiao Long Baos. An order of 6 combination Xiao Long Baos come in a bamboo steamer and ginger soy sauce. The flavors ranked from my favorite being #1 are Yellow - Gruyere, Orange - Crab, White - Shanghai, Red - Spicy Szechuan and Black - Truffle. I didn&#39;t get to try the Green - Duck, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s delicious! Their food is bit pricy, but I honestly love the interior design and don&#39;t mind spending a light lunch here again.

Very intrigued by their photogenic Jasmine Tea Smoked Ribs though."
imperial-lamian-chicago,Lin Z.,R2QQkKhREpT9U9Lf0Kliqg,"San Mateo, CA",1,1,1,126,645,5Sv57k5a82eajh7TkSNvXw,4.0,2016-10-27,"There are certain dishes here that are overly pricey - in the sense that you can get them elsewhere in Chinatown for a decent quality but cheaper.  But there are other dishes here that are so worth coming for and paying the price.  Chicago really has been missing a high-end Chinese restaurant that does food of this caliber. Though since I moved away, more and more of them seem to be popping up (Duck Duck Goat also comes to mind). 

Here are the dishes I think are worth coming for: 

- The xiao long bao.  We ended up trying three kinds: the shanghai, the szechuan, and the gruyere.  I would probably come back for the shanghai and the gruyere, although a part of me cringes at the price (since you can get these so cheap in Shanghai!). But these are the best xiao long bao I&#39;ve had in Chicago, so worth it if you want to get your fill. To be fair though, the competition for good xiao long bao in Chicago is not very stiff.  

- The hand pulled noodles. Ok, these are probably the star of the show. I would come back again and again for these hand pulled noodles.  There is also a guy who is pulling and making the noodles right in the restaurant (they have a big window so you can see him).  The brisket pulled noodles are so good.  The texture of the noodles is excellent, really expertly pulled.  They are not really the wide hand pulled noodles though, if you like chewier, thick noodles. They are the thinner ones, but they still are pretty chewy and delicious. We also tried the minced pork hand pulled noodle dish, which was good as well.  If you are choosing between the two though, go with the brisket.  If you don&#39;t want to spend that much money, the hand pulled noodle soups are the best value for your money. 

- Tiger shrimp fried la mian: We loved that soup la mian, so wanted to try the fried version.  I&#39;d honestly skip this and try some of the other dishes. It&#39;s delicious, but you can really get fried noodles anywhere. Not worth the money in my opinion. I think we got some sort of beef fried noodle too, but again - not super special and not worth the money in my opinion. 

- Yang Chao Fan (fried rice with char siu, tiger shrimp, asparagus, and egg): Also yummy, but you can get yang chao fan anywhere too. Not super special and not worth the $16. 

- Asparagus: Good vegetable dish, but nothing outstanding about it. 

- For dessert, we had these salted yolk buns. These were probably some of the best sweet buns I&#39;ve ever had.  They were salty but sweet and rich and creamy in the middle - and served hot and fresh. 

If I were to recommend you get anything here, I would recommend a selection of the xiao long bao (I really liked the shanghai and the gruyere) as well as the hand pulled soup noodles.  And finish your meal off with the salted yolk buns.  You will leave happy and full."

Precision cooking with good ingredients in a common menu.  Shareable is passé.  Sunda is to Japanese, and Lamian is to Chinese.  Related?  Better version of PF CHANG.  *wink*

PRICING is comparable to the area.  Limited LUNCH and BRUNCH may be a better value.  2 booze COCKTAILs @$15 and WINES by glass @$10 has excellent pricing.

SHAREABLE CRAB ($16) - good value for 2 crabs as divey places charge $9 for one.  Great breading and flavor.  The wok tossed dried shrimp, chili, curry leaves and shaved almonds is great as rice topping.  With a side of rice, it can be an affordable singular dinner dish.

XIAO LONG BAO COMBINATION ($18) - flavor failed to be addictive.  First and Last.  Wrapping is a tad too thick.  Amused with color coding.  Vinegar is too strong and overpowers the bao flavoring.  You know CHEESE is NOT in chinese cooking right?  Chinese American it is! *LOL*

EGG TART ($8) - impeccable pastry crust, with a perfect egg custard.  3 pcs @$2.50+ each.

Heroine in AMERICANO COFFEE ($5)?  Normal regular espresso is $2.  Normal regular Americano is $2.50.  WHY o WHY is it $5?  Only ESPRESSO OR AMERICANO in LAVAZZA beans.  NO foam or steam milk for you!

RARE TEA CELLAR selections.  $3 Bottomless Blackberry Jasmine iced tea was delicious.

SERVICE is friendly and informative.  It was amusing that food deliverer insisted that he tells me the Xiao Long Bao contents even though it was color coded.  How sweet!  *kiss kiss*

OPEN WINDOWS gives beggars access solicit for $$. You feel guilty if you don&#39;t carry cash.  Difficult to enjoy a pricey meal when you are less than a ruler away from the streets.

I would stick with the dumplings and dim sum here. We really liked the spicy Szechuan soup dumpling, mapo tofu, zhao ji and Szechuan wonton. The latter of these 3 was presented very nicely. 

Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t feel the same about the wok dishes, sides or noodles. We had the sea bass wok, the fried la mian noodles and the broccoli side. Those were mediocre at best and if we hadn&#39;t had the dumplings, I would probably have a much loser review.

This is a place that has 4 kitchens, each for different types of food.  This means quicker food delivery but unfortunately not great timing.  If you come here with a large group, they will do their best to time the meal correctly, but people will inevitably receive their food earlier/later than you.

The menu is not huge, which is fine...although maybe a bit surprising given the 4 kitchen setup.  

Presentation of the food is wonderful and I would say is the only redeeming quality to this place.  Unfortunately, presentation does not make up for poor food taste.  The food has mediocre flavor at best, which is pretty upsetting given the price.  That is where the straw breaks the camel&#39;s back.  Value.

The portion and flavor of the dish you get, in comparison to the price...is nearly laughable.  This was an expensed lunch for work and I still was appalled by the disconnect here.  Kung Pao chicken, which portion size is lacking, and flavor is absent is $20.  Are you kidding me?  You could go to any chinese take out place around town, pay $8 and get twice the portion with over twice the flavor. 

Overall, this place is a big dissapointment.  The extra star was for food presentation and service."

Soup dumplings are great here. Really tasty with the assortment of flavors. My buddy and I split the following soup dumplings: Shanghai, Spicy Szechuan, Crab, and Duck. All very good. It&#39;s a bit pricey the cheapest coming in at $7 for 3 dumplings. Dumplings were 5 stars no doubt. 

We also split the Mince Pork noodles. This is soup base. It&#39;s very tasty. It&#39;s about your typical overpriced Ramen prices here in the Chicago area. Lol. But didn&#39;t mind as it was really good. Very smooth tasting. Not to salty, felt like there was no MSG or any of that sort in it. Really clean broth. 

We also split the Pork Belly dish. This is where this place left a sour taste in my mouth. Most of the &#34;entrees&#34; are in the range of $20-$30. We both wanted to try the pork belly and even asked the waitress what she recommended. I was excited when the Pork Belly came out. There were 4 square pieces in the bowl that it came out on. I was thinking to my head, ok there&#39;s definitely going to be more pieces underneath. Nope. I was wrong. There was only 4 pieces. WAIT, WHAT? I JUST SPENT MORE THAN $5 ON ONE SQUARE PIECE OF PORK BELLY!?!?! Yeah left a really bad taste in my mouth. My friend agreed as well. 

I&#39;ll go back again for sure for the soup dumplings and the noodles. And hopefully the rating will change but for now the 3 stars will have to do."

The authentic ethnic dishes are a big question mark for me, although I have always been a little lost in Chinese-American Chicago.  My culinary family upbringing is very different than what I find here.  I do love the Xiao Long Maos although they are on the smaller size.  The ham sui got, har gao, and shui mai were outstanding.  The ma po tofu was not not the saucy, spicy soft bean curd dish that I am used to--it is a fried tofu wrapped in deep fried tofu with sweet dipping sauces.  I enjoy the seafood hot and sour soup, but prefer a little more heat.  The shrimp lo mein did not live up to my expectations.  Imperial Hamian is an experience.

Usually I take the trek to Chinatown because I know that the dim sum I will have there will be authentic, inexpensive, and absolutely delicious.

Upon entering the restaurant I was absolutely captivated by the decor and the attractive hosts and hostesses. Between the design of the space and the dress code, I knew that I was going to have a fantastic experience because I am one who takes pride in appearances. 

The wait staff all wore black (my favorite color) which kept everything uniform. I love the menu. It is very easy to read and it is not overwhelming like most Asian restaurants are in Chinatown and other areas. 

I ordered the Gua Bao (porkbelly with spinach buns) and the assortment of xiaolongbao:  SHANG HAI, SPICY SZECHUAN, DUCK, CRAB, GRUYERE, and TRUFFLE. What I absolutely adore about these were the intersection between east meets west: the majority of the dumplings stayed authentically true to its Asian roots, but the gruyere and truffle were such a delightful surprise with a modern European twist on an Asian staple.

I actually loved every single one of the dumplings. The porkbelly bao was fantastic as well, but the only thing that bothered me was that the bun kept sticking to my teeth -_- this was not okay when you&#39;re trying to sit pretty with your date lol."

Service was okay...our server was great but another that came around asked strange things of us. Also, their benches are really far from the table making it hard to eat without scooting them forward. I loved their interior though and they have great windows that open over one section of the restaurant. I wish I was sat in that section.

We went straight Dim Sum on our first visit -
-Shanghai Xiao Long Bao $7 for 3 - Pork soup dumplings! There&#39;s a special way to eat these and we did it wrong.YouTube it! These were very good and loved them.
-Ham Sui Gok $9 for 3 - New menu item! My favorite dish of our lunch with a glutinous rice flour shell. 
-Xiang Gu $8- New Menu Item! Mushroom filled dumplings. Loved these and it was a different type of dim sum than I&#39;m used being all veggie. Plus they are inside of a very cool, almost sparkling, semi-translucent dough wrap.
-Szechuan Wonton $10 for 5 - Spicy pork explosion! Smaller in size but packed with flavor and served in a pool of soy sauce for some added saltiness.
-Zhao Ji $8 for 3 - New menu item! The presentation on these dumplings was masterful with a cool spiderweb of dough incasing them into the pot. It sure looked cool but more importantly, they tasted great!

Important to note, they don&#39;t have their colorful, signature dim sum dumplings during lunch. Dinner only. :(

It used to be Chinese wasn&#39;t too fancy unless you went to the Mandarin Oriental or the Peninsula. Nowadays, I guess there&#39;s an appetite for chic Chinese fare in a hip environment. Imperial Lamian fills that bill in a choice Gold Coast/River North location.

This is the first North American outpost of this Indonesian chain. The interior is dark and elegant. There&#39;s no shortage of hosts, hostesses, and managers at the front of the house and walking through the restaurant to smile at me, ask me how everything is, and thank me for my business. Too many, in my opinion, but maybe this was an anomaly. 

The menu is daunting. There are multiple areas for appetizers, dumplings, noodles, main courses, and fried rices. In retrospect, it all seems so familiar, but when I looked at it in front of me, I felt a bit overwhelmed.

A test of a great Chinese restaurant is Hot and Sour soup by my book. This was just okay: heavy in the corn starch and light on familiar ingredients like mushroom. Two mini saucers of hot and sour flavoring offered to customize the soup to my liking set this presentation apart. I dumped both in and still had a soup not close to my Aristotelian ideal. 

Next came these cute little color coded soup dumplings which were hand made and burst with a pop off broth coddling the crab and brie interiors. This was more substance over flavor because while the craft of the dumpling was spectacular, it fell short on taste. 

The highlight and savior of the meal was the slow-cooked broth served with the hand pulled lamien noodles and Chinese barbecue pork, char siu. This was a bowl of heaven. The noodles were made before my eyes in the open kitchen. They had a slightly sweet toothiness. I&#39;d definitely go back to try other combinations of lamien. It&#39;s better than I&#39;ve ever had. 

My server was very helpful in making suggestions and negotiating the menu. She put me at ease. Since I avoided most of the entrees, I got out of the restaurant for under $50, which I consider a coup!

Overall if you order the right thing, it&#39;s excellent; but that menu is minefield. Coupled with the fact that this was the most expensive Chinese restaurant I&#39;d ever eaten in, I left slightly underwhelmed."

We started with the  MISO Blossom tofu, royal trumpet mushroom, wakame, goji berry. Absolutely beautiful and delicious.  Normally I would say miso is just miso but the presentation made the tofu blossom look like an anemone in the sea.  Yes, that is exactly what it looked like! 

Next we had the CRISPY SPRING ROLL - Carrots, royal trumpet &amp; wood ear mushroom Each roll packed a mouthful of flavor that was remarkable. And just for kicks we also had the PRAWN ROLL -Tofu wrap, nori and HAR GAO- Shrimp dumpling. These did not disappoint.

We had the IMPERIAL- Mixed greens, watermelon radish, charred shallots dressing which felt like a great way to cleanse our pallets before we started our adventure. 

We of course could not pass up the namesake Lamian noodles and tried the 
MIXED MUSHROOM -Miso vegetarian broth, shiitake &amp; enoki mushrooms, carrots, bean sprouts, snow peas.  It was very nice to see the noodles being made behind the counter in the window to the kitchen but unfortunately as delicious as they were they lacked enough broth.  I was glad to see that the broth was veggie friendly.  The bowl of noodles is just what you would need on a cold Chicago night.

For me the show stopper was the CRISPY PRAWN - Wasabi aioli, mango, passion fruit.  Crispy, tangy, savory and creamy all in one.  The prawns were generously sized and the helping is plenty full. Presented in a wonton basket this is a dish not to miss.

For sides we had the GAILAN - Chinese broccoli, soy glazed, roasted garlic, ginger jus and wouldn&#39;t miss an opportunity to have the housemade chili to go with everything.

To end the meal we had a sesame lotus paste ball.  A semi sweet finish to a very royal feast.

I would highly recommend Imperial to anyone looking for a upscale Chinese meal in the River North area.  The food was great and the service was working out it&#39;s kinks but still good."

It&#39;s not often I feel like you find a good, upscale Chinese restaurant outside of Chinatown.

Normally, I am not one to spend a lot of time on the service, but I think this is where our experience started to go down hill. Our server was just pleasant enough to get by. She took our order and kind of left abruptly. She offered no explanation about the menu or about what she recommended.

We started with hot and sour soup, schuezwan wontons and spring rolls. For entrees, my husband ordered the sea bass and I ordered the kung pao chicken. Note: everything is a la carte so rice was an extra $3. 

We got the wontons and soup immediately. Both were delicious and had great heat. Then randomly, a food runner appeared with 2 seabass. We were confused since we only ordered 1, so we kept one and sent the other back. There was no explanation provided as to why there was a mixup. Also, I am not sure if this was one of those restaurants that brings stuff out tapas style as its ready, but if it is, they didn&#39;t explain this.

The seabass was a major disappointment. My husband couldn&#39;t cut through it with his fork because it was tough. We had to ask for a knife. I tasted the fish and it was extremely rubbery and tasted old. He was not able to finish the fish because the knife wouldn&#39;t clutch through the ends.

We received our spring rolls 5 minutes after the seabass and the chicken almost 10 minutes later (that also after asking the status). The spring rolls didn&#39;t have much flavor, but the chicken was delicious. It&#39;s not for the faint of heart as it does pack some heat.

During this time our waitress never checked on us. We had to flag someone first available to even get us a knife. Around the time I got my chicken, I did order another drink, but that took so long that it finally arrived at our table when our food had been cleared and we were ready to pay. 

Overall, this place does have promise. There is definitely room for improvement in this extremely competitive restaurant environment. If I do come back, maybe I will try the food other reviewers recommended."

It was impressive to watch them make and tasted impressive too! My bf ordered the beef brisket in broth with the hand pulled noodles he loved how tender the beef was and over all would order again, however the beef was a bit fatty. I guess that&#39;s what it takes for tender and flavorful beef. One star off for being a little pricey for dim sum. But understandable for not having to drive out to China town. Will come back to try more."

Let me say upfront that I have taken away one star at the...um, suggestion...of my wife, who considered their prices a poor value for money, and was heard to mutter the phrase &#34;tourist trap.&#34;  Repeatedly.  All afternoon.  Point taken, but my comments will be based on my impressions of the restaurant itself, leaving financial considerations to the discretion of the reader.

This is an open room, clean and modern in decor, and refreshingly clear of &#34;Happy Lucky Golden Dragon&#34; ornamental cliches.  There&#39;s a mix of U-shaped booths and tables for two and four.  Open kitchen.  Separate bar area along the Hubbard Street side.  

Arriving at about 1:00 Sunday afternoon, we were seated at once in the only moderately full dining room.  We discovered that only dim sum is served before 5:00 on Sundays.  Don&#39;t expect the traditional roving dim sum carts, though; all choices are from a fairly limited printed menu.  We tried:

- Szechuan Spicy Xiao Long Bao.  A bamboo steamer with three pink bao, filled with a very spicy finely-ground meat, and a side of soy sauce and shredded ginger.  I liked it; my wife drew invidious comparisons to the fare half a mile down the street at Wow Bao.

- Shrimp and Pork Siao Mai.  Topped with some sort of orange roe.  Tasty but not especially memorable.

- Tiger Shrimp Noodles.  A modest-sized portion of a stir-fry of hand-pulled noodles, shrimp, bean sprouts, three colors of bell peppers, and onion, topped with a fried egg.

Overall I&#39;d give food, service, and ambience four stars; food selection (at the hour of our visit--we haven&#39;t tried the dinner menu) and value two.  Our three fairly small items ran about $34.

Convenient to public transportation, two blocks south of the Grand Avenue station on the Red Line.  On the 36-Broadway and 29-State bus lines.  One block (eastbound on Illinois) or two (westbound on Grand) from the 65-Grand bus; also, in season, one block from the free Navy Pier &#34;trolley&#34; (really a bus tarted up to look like a 1900-era streetcar), which loads at the southeast corner of State and Illinois."

What a gorgeous restaurant! You will never eat at another PF Chang or Big Bowl again. Not after you visit this place. The interior has a mix of brass and steel, making this restaurant look exotic and smart. The menu took and years to construct perfectly- and the wait was worth it. The soup dumplings seem to be what they have perfected but everything was great, and can&#39;t wait to come back for lunch once that starts too! 

I felt the rush of the NYC vibe, great sound quality playing the latest pop hits, a rush of bussers and waiters going back and forth, and not one seat available. Chefs table was awesome- I want to meet the chef&#39;s on my next visit. Our waitress was probably the worst part about our whole dining experience. After being seated, she came quickly talking about the water choice, specials, and the cocktails, and the teas and told us she&#39;ll be back. She didn&#39;t introduce herself and had no smiles. I understand it was a busy night but I would expect finer service! 

On that menu: 

Cocktail on the Specials: Trans Atlantic for $13. I have never tried Maraschino Liqueur but I&#39;m on a hunt for it and being able to get the good quality of Hangar 1 Vodka got me spending that 13 in River North happily. 

Blue Xiao Long Boa for $10 and some of the money from ordering the specials goes towards charity- a win, win! Poke two holes in the boa to get that soup out and that black pepper beef had the freshest black peppers I have tasted in awhile with a kick of heat, I fell in love. The prettiest and tastiest blue food I have ever had and all the other boas have fun colors too. 

Tiger Shrimp Noodles: Not many places in Chicago where you will find that your shrimp has been curled to make the presentation of the dish to look extra special! I appreciate the simplest of flavors and the noodles did that for me. 

Su Chafan Fried Rice: Ever dig in fried rice and it&#39;s sticky, or some parts of the rice is just not cooked well, or it&#39;s too salty? I would come back just for the fried rice. It was that PERFECT. You just have to get it to balance out any meat dishes. And definitely try to get the seafood fried rice to get a presentation of the crab and lobster plated on your dish- just for presentation. 

Kung Pao: Got my mouth heated with delight and I&#39;m so picky about sauces, that even if it&#39;s a little bit more thick then it should be, I turn away but I was not disappointed with the Kung Pao at all. The pieces were cut so perfectly for bite size portions, and even the vegetables were diced with precision. It was nice to have cashews in the dish that kicked it up a notch! 

Dessert: They are dim sum boas. Come in 3. Got the salted one and I wasn&#39;t impressed but some people according to reviews- were! Maybe I was just too full to enjoy it but I think they should expand their dessert menu for sure! 

Am I coming back? Oh, you bet I am. Can&#39;t wait for them to open up for lunch!"

I was really excited to try this place because 1.) it&#39;s authentic Chinese food NOT in Chinatown, 2.) it&#39;s more upscale than the Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, and 3.) I heard great things about their soup dumplings. Yes, it&#39;s definitely pricier, but you&#39;re also paying for the location, the ambience, and the experience.

Between the 2 of us we ordered the Shanghai and the peppered beef (a special that day) soup dumplings, beef brisket hand pulled noodles, London duck, and wagyu oxtail fried rice. I REALLY loved the refined presentation of each dish, which you often don&#39;t get in Chinatown. While everything was quite delicious and something I would definitely order again, the soup dumplings were my absolute favorite. The skin is made very tender and thin, and there&#39;s lots of flavorful soup inside. I also have to say that the beef brisket was extremely tender. Kind of just melts in your mouth and releases the soup that got soaked into it. SOOO GOOD. 

The only thing I didn&#39;t like was that the kitchen is an open kitchen that is separated from the dining area by small pane of glass. It is really cool to watch them make the hand pulled noodles, but when they&#39;re making them, the chef will slap a stretched out piece of dough onto the counter top making an extremely loud firecracker noise. We were not sitting by the kitchen, and it was pretty disturbing and made me flinch every time. I looked back a few times and saw the girl sitting next to the kitchen literally turn her back to it because it was driving her crazy."

The atmosphere and service were great and the food was amazing. I got the Lost in Translation drink- a little strong but def worth trying.

We live close by so there was a lot of anticipation for this place to open. The venue is quite beautiful and you can tell a lot of attention to detail was paid on the decor. If anything it&#39;s creative and interesting to visit. Also, you can see the noodle masters working on their craft with the open kitchen concept. Very cool. 

The food is good but not great for upscale Chinese food. The best dishes were the lamians - I&#39;ve tried three kinds: Char Siu &amp; Wonton, Braised Pork Belly, and Beef Brisket. The noodles were very good, great texture and fresh. Flavors of the broth also complimented the noodles well. We also tried the xian long baos (Shanghai and Crab) and although the filling tastes good, they are not as delicate as they should be.... and three is just not enough! Compared to Din Tai Fung, the xiao long baos just fall short in dumpling quality.  For dishes, we tried the sea bass and the black pepper beef. Portion size was decent and the flavors were pretty authentic. 

I expected a very high level of service for this type of establishment and found that it was hard to flag down my waiter at times. He seemed to have many tables and was running around quite a lot. Also of the two times we went, we saw the management team visit tables around us but did not stop to talk to us. This place is expensive and the type and level of this establishment does fill a void in the Chicago downtown market, however the service needs to improve to warrant such prices."

It took a lot of coercing to even get me in the door, However I Loooved this place. This is not your typical fried, Covered in some sauce, Chinese food. Oh no. Every dish packs a ton of flavor and spice, without all the grease. I had a party of 8 and everyone unanimously loved the food. Note: I&#39;m not saying this is healthy food by any means, but it&#39;s Chinese food done really well.

Yes it&#39;s expensive. Yes it&#39;s loud. Yes this is that restaurant on hubbard that has been 2 other restaurants in the past 5 years. It&#39;s a nice, more casual and relaxed alternative to say stk or rpm, but with very competitive food. 

Everyone loved the garlic chicken. Venison puffs. Chicken wings. Noodles. Fried crab. Highly recommend those. If you don&#39;t like spice. You probably won&#39;t appreciate this place. Try it out.

Yes they have valet."

This is an absolutely incredible place for Chinese food.  The decor is excellent, the food is nothing short of incredible!  Check out my other reviews, I rarely give 5 Stars. This is every bit as good as the finest restaurant you&#39;ll visit of any cuisine.

I started withthe Xiao Long Bao.  Now, if you&#39;ve had bao from other places, it pales in comparison to what you&#39;ll have here.  The server teaches you the proper way to eat it.  It is first taken out of it&#39;s bamboo steamer at table you place it in your spoon, puncture it and let the broth drain, then drink the broth and eat the bao.  It&#39;s spectacular and not &#34;bready.&#34;  The Gruyere bao is stunning as is the Spicy Szechuan.

I then had the braised pork belly la mian.  The pork was delicious and plentiful and full of incredible flavors.  The noodles were made fresh to order, and one could tell (not just by the authentic artist behind the kitchen counter) but by taste.  The beef broth also very fresh and all the tastes were distinct but harmoniously in concert like a Mozart symphony (good one, eh?).

The drinks were amazing and unique.  This is not your typical Chinese place. This  is authentic cuisine in a fun, hip atmosphere in a great part of town (River North).  I think the curse is broken at the corner of State and Hubbard.  The two previous restaurants failed, the last being Centro.  One won&#39;t be able to get in here in a few weeks.  

I&#39;ll be returning soon to try the other menu items I simply had not room to eat."

This is sadly not a good choice for people who frequents Chinatown and values food quality over ambiance. The xiao long bao we so looked forward to were just ok: wrapper not delicate enough, not juicy enough and the crab one I tasted was way too salty. The venison puffs, however, were amazing.

Lamians are their saving grace. We tried minced pork, beef brisket &amp; charsiu and wonton, all three had very interesting &amp; distinct broth flavors with excellent noodles. However, stick to the soup ones. The stir-fried beef lamian was a yawn and is on par with $8 stir fry noodles you can get at any Asian/pan-Asian restaurants in town, yet it was priced at an exorbitant $16 with half the portion size. I get this is river north which has a different price range, but it really doesn&#39;t add anything new or exciting for diners that are familiar with authentic Asian food and not afraid to venture out to the neighborhoods. I think the clientele will be mostly tourists that want Chinese food near Michigan Ave and don&#39;t mind paying a premium. 

To their defense, the drinks menu looked interesting so I&#39;ll likely come back for that. Also heard they have a great tea selection, which the waiters don&#39;t hesitate to push on us multiple times. Other than that, service was warm &amp; friendly."

I really enjoyed it! Firstly, I was really happy to find out that it was located right across the street of my hotel which allowed me to drink a little bit more than the usual lol. 
I was welcomed with smiles, I even received compliments about my outfit (Yeah I know... but it&#39;s always nice once in a while). I was seated not too far from the entrance, the room was half full and not noisy, I ordered the Hot Garlic Chicken with Asparagus, their Shanghai Sunset as well as their Salted Egg Bao for dessert....

They went away but now Imperial Lamian is here to lay claim to the vacated crown. 

I&#39;m pleased to say that Imperial Lamian is all around excellent. They really shine with the soup dumplings (conveniently color coded as to their contents) and noodles, both are house made. In fact everything we had including several varieties of soup dumplings (dumplings with a brothy filling if you are not familiar), several dim sum selections, jasmine tea ribs, seafood fried rice and car siu wonton noodles were excellent. 

The noodles (after which the restaurant is named) have a perfect balance of chewiness while still remaining tender and the dim sum (such as the siew mai) are as good as you will find stateside. 

I have been to China several times and while far from an expert I do think that I understand great Chinese food from the run of the mill American version that is ubiquitous. Imperial Lamian is not exactly authentic and has certainly been modified to appeal to Americans but nonetheless veers towards what one might find in Shanghai as opposed to the mall. Regardless of what it is it tastes great. 

The space is quite nice looking with large abstractions of traditional abacuses serving as dividers and bird cages as lamps while an open kitchen runs the length of the dining room. The floors are elaborately tiled but regrettably the designers neglected the ceiling  leaving a bare industrial steel canopy in full view. 

Service was efficient and good but not overly friendly, thou to be fair these servers have a lot to do. Each table typically orders many small plates and keeping up with that must be a chore. The dumplings and dim sum come out of the kitchen very quickly. 

I had a Singapore Sling which tasted nothing like any one I have ever had. Not good or bad but not what I expected. 

The downside is the cost. I hate to factor that in too much but when they charge $3 for a small bowl of white rice I feel that I should mention it. A fairly normal meal for two can easily hit $200 after tip which is very expensive for noodles. The prices can be deceptive as they appear reasonable but portions are generally small and you will order more than you think you will. 

All told however I am excited to return. Although virtually all of the menu appeals to me next time I think I will simply have some soup dumplings and a bowl of noodles (here served something like ramen but with less broth) and forego the shared plates. It&#39;s a great addition to the area and offers some much needed diversity of cuisine as well."

This was a group lunch selection I went along with because one guy was so excited and the rest of us were starving after a bike ride. I didn&#39;t have hopes for anything more than mediocre food when I saw how upscale and Asian-y the decor was though (bad past experiences with fancy Asian fusion places) - but I was proven wrong, so wrong. Note the decor was impeccable! You walk into a lobby which has been made to look like a fancy birdcage, stunning.

Shanghi soup dumplings (xian long bao) to start: Truffle one was to die for. Cheese (Gruyere) was good. Crab was edible but I wouldn&#39;t get it again - nothing  special. All dumplings came out at the perfect temperature which is a black magic I&#39;ve not experienced anywhere else. They were definitely hot but the soup didn&#39;t burn your mouth like they do at all other places I&#39;ve gotten them at, what?!?!? Talented chef in the back. Dumpling skin wasn&#39;t dried out like I&#39;ve seen at other restaurants. You need to order these!!! 

Got the pumpkin duck dumplings (puffs) which were visually stunning: shaped like little pumpkins on a bed of lettuce. Fried to a gorgeous color. My partner got a nice piece of fatty duck in his filling but my piece was all pumpkin filling, YMMV.

Mushroom bao were shaped like big fluffy white mushrooms. Complete with stem, dusting of brown color for character, and defined gills, wow! Great heavy mushroom flavor.

Zhao ji (dumplings) had the most stunning presentation I could imagine. There are pictures in other Yelp reviews of the fried lattice and 3 dumplings in the middle. Good tasting but I wouldn&#39;t make a trip here just to eat them.

Beef lamain: fantastic flavor; beef perfectly cooked and fell apart in my mouth. Noodles were really out of this world. Only regret that because food came out whenever it was ready, we ignored the bulk of the noodles until the end of the meal and the noodles ended up a bit soggy - not the fault of the restaurant, but this is a pro-tip for all patrons: eat all the noodles as soon as they come out; do not let them linger in the broth! Get this noodle dish!!!!!

Spicy lamain was worth taking a few bites of but if I had to eat a whole bowl by myself, I&#39;d be ever so slightly disappointed. Slight Schezuan spicy-hot, but muted.

Eggplant (vegetarian) dish (forgot the name) came with chunks of turnip cake which were really yummy: tasted just like my mom and grandma&#39;s recipe (mmmmm, scrumptious). How they did that without meat is a delicious mystery.

Shuimai was good...but ultimately just &#34;okay&#34;, not the centerpiece of the meal. Not dried out and made the traditional way with chopped pork.....but something kept them from blowing me away. I would skip them here and go to an authentic dim sum place. I am snobby about the taste of shiumai though.

This place was so pricey!!! $12 for 3 Shanghai soup dumplings?!?!? Yikes! But service was impeccable, and there were dishes cooked so perfectly a miser like me couldn&#39;t complain. I&#39;d come back here to eat in a heartbeat.

Summary: get beef lamain noodles, eggplant dish, and truffle shanghai soup dumplings. Probably worth paying for a plane ticket to eat these here again."

My friend and I shared:
Shang Hai Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings)
London Duck - pulled crispy duck, momo wrap, cucumber, scallions, hoisin
Wagyu Oxtail Fried Rice - XO sauce, asparagus, egg

We started off with the shang hai xlb. Sadly, the broth came out of one of the dumplings. The next one I ate had plenty of broth and great flavor. 

Next came the duck. It was crispy and delicious. I would definitely order this dish again. 

Lastly, we ate the fried rice. It had a nice spicy kick to it with chunks of oxtail. The finely cut asparagus added great texture.

We also ordered the crab xlb, but since dim sum service was a little slow that night, we cancelled the order. We were already full from the duck and fried rice that we didn&#39;t have room to eat more dumplings. 

The space was beautifully decorated. I also like the open kitchen where you can see everything being made. It&#39;s definitely more expensive than if you went to Chinatown, but you get good service and a beautiful atmosphere. My friend and I are already talking about coming back here soon!"

The dumplings (dim sum) was super hot and average.  The big draw is their hand pulled noodles.  You can watch the chefs making them through a window in the dining room which is pretty cool.

The duck entree and half chicken was very tasty.  The prices were a little high for what you were getting.  

The place started emptying out around 8:30 so I think it&#39;s a great spot to eat after work before going home."

When, I went to rave about this place on Yelp I was shocked, that they are not reviewed better! I see most of it has to do with the price point vs portions. I am guessing it is because we - as a society are used to the Chinese food being more affordable. As a proud foodie, I learned to shake off any stereotypes- I will happily pay premium for uniquely prepared dishes with exotic ingredients! This is exactly what you get in this place! 

I must say our experience was greatly improved by our AMAZING, passionate about the food waitress, Maria! She didn&#39;t just know all the dishes on the menu she had her favorites and made us feel at ease about some of the ingredients we didn&#39;t know! Maria shared with us that she celebrated her own birthday at Imperial. I think that speaks volumes of the place when someone chooses to spend their special day at work! 

We shared a variety of dishes, even my miso soup was the most interesting version of its kind! We shared a sampler of Xiao Long Bao and SPICY SZECHUAN (!!!) and Gruyere were out of this world, the later remind me of Vietnamese Colonial cuisine, Peking Duck was, beyond words and Shrimp fried rice although more traditional but solid, prepared with herbs which added extra layers of flavor! We also had a Dessert Bao Trio filled with egg-custard, so yummy, I had a tough time sharing (even though I really like my friend Ally)

I must add that this place has a perfect ambiance for it&#39;s location in River North. It is incredibly elegant with unique details that leave your eyes occupied throughout your meal. The tables are either facing the windows, ideal for a romantic evening, or have a fascinating kitchen view where you can see how all of their fabulous dishes are made! From marble inlays in the floor tile to ancient Chinese calculator-inspired booth separators the decor is remarkable!

I must return!!!"

If you&#39;re expecting cheap, large quantities, you are in the wrong place. It&#39;s a bit pricey but high quality food and service. Two of us went and spent $130 together. Caveat, we ordered 9 items and one drink because we wanted to try a little of everything. Warning: long review!

I&#39;ll go through our food items:
Crab &amp; duck soup dumplings (xiao long bao): I am thrilled that I can get delicious soup dumplings in Chicago now. You can actually watch the chefs make the soup dumplings by hand in the open kitchen layout. 3 per order and I would go back for these. 

Braised pork belly lamien: again, like the dumplings we got to watch the chef hand make the noodles, which was awesome. The noodles were fresh and and broth was flavorful. I would just say for 14 dollars, I would expect to see more than one piece of pork belly. If you go you have to try one of the lamien dishes. 

Clay pot chicken: not very memorable. I was too into the lamien to pay attention to this one. I didn&#39;t think much of it, but it wasn&#39;t bad. This dish became leftovers. You have to order rice on the side, and we got the jasmine rice. It&#39;s just regular rice. 

Crispy pork belly: self-explanatory. It comes with 9 small pieces with mustard. It&#39;s delicious, but a bit too salty for me. 

Egg tart- a normal egg tart. You get 3 of them on one order. 
Salted egg bao- YUM, salty, sweet and fresh out the steamer. Also get three per order. 

Lastly, drinks. We got a jasmine tea that was very high quality and fragrant. We steeped three pots of tea and it was still good! 
Lantern four 9ine: Great! Not too sweet and the first time I&#39;ve had sparking sake which was delicious. 

I also took a tour of the kitchens and prep areas that aren&#39;t part of the open kitchen. It&#39;s extremely clean and organized everywhere I went. Thanks for reading."

The decoration is fancy. Combined both oriental and modern style. You can watch the kitchen as they prepare your food, which makes it better.
The xiao long bao is the best I&#39;ve ever had in American. The most authentic Shang Hai style xiao long bao. They did some innovation by changing the color of it. Taste really great.
Lamian is also wonderful. The noodle itself is LanZhou style but the soup is actually not. Still, taste great.
For the dessert, we ordered Lunar Blossom. Which literally looks like luna! Inside is ginger cake covered by cream, on top of which is vanilla icecream. Wonderful idea. 
All in all, we had a wonderful dinner in this place. will be back."

The place is hip and not your typical Chinese restaurant.  We shared a lot appetizers and had couple of the noodles dishes. The minced port and short ribs. We also had couple of enters.  Some of the dishes are very good and some are just ok. That why I am giving them 4 stars.
imperial-lamian-chicago,Eric Y.,jL-qSB8CAKrAdF6fKJNCxQ,"La Grange, IL",0,1,0,43,73,VP7bOu5aSgnS9fhkWf0EkQ,4.0,2016-10-30,"This cool place is different than the typical Chinese restaurant.  First, it&#39;s located in the hip River North area.  Second, the decor is upscale and modern, with nice Chinese touches like giant abacus room dividers, bird cages and ceramics.  The kitchen is on display and you can see the lamian (hand-pulled) noodles being made.  The menu and service are Western, with real waiters and bus-staff.  There&#39;s specialty cocktails, beer and wine - nice.  The clientele is a mix of Asian and non-Asian.

Niceties aside, it&#39;s still about the food isn&#39;t it?  So let&#39;s get. down. to. it.  The must-eat items here are the xiao long bao (XLB) or Shanghai-style soup dumplings.  I&#39;ve waxed about these in the past but the ones here are nearly perfect.  The skins are thin and chewy, and strong too, with nary a leak to be seen.  The broth is abundant and the filling is properly porky and gingery.  The vinegar is spot-on too - Chinkiang-type black vinegar with slivers of ginger.  But here&#39;s the interesting twist - those are just the standard Shanghai dumplings.  There&#39;s also duck, crab, spicy Szechwan, gruyere and truffle.  What the heck is going on here?  Now duck, spicy and crab are within the XLB canon but gruyere and truffle?  I think Yan forgot how to cook this one.  The crab variety was really tasty, all sweet crabby goodness.  The gruyere ones were surprisingly delicious too - think of them more like some of the tastiest agnolotti you&#39;ve ever eaten - that&#39;s how you get the FUNK out!

The other thing this place is known for is lamian or hand-pulled noodles.  The noodles are made in full view in the display kitchen.  It&#39;s quite a show, all that pulling, stretching and pounding.  Anyhow, the noodles are served either in soup or stir-fried.  We tried the beef brisket soup noodle, which is their take on the iconic Chinese nu rou mein (beef noodle soup).  While the beef was tender and flavorful, the soup was cold and the noodles were too thin for my liking.  A long blond hair in the soup was an unfortunate find (but it improved our tab for sure.)  The stir-fried lamian with shrimp was tasty but was not anything special.

Other items we tried included squash dumplings made to look like little pumpkins - beautiful and delicious, fried turnip cake - delicious, mushroom spring rolls - ok, stir-fried Chinese broccoli - ok.  The stewed pork belly with preserved vegetable (mei cai ko rou) is a pleasant surprise to see on the menu; it was decent but not spectacular.

Our desserts were great.  The star dessert is the lotus sphere.  This is dessert and a show.  A sphere of white chocolate is presented and then hot chocolate sauce is poured over it in a radial pattern, melting the white chocolate where it has been poured, causing the sphere to open up like the petals of a lotus flower, revealing a cube of ginger cake topped with vanilla gelato and raspberries inside.  Wow, and it tastes good too!  The salted egg bun is a play on an egg; a steamed bun filled with a decadent liquid &#34;yolk&#34; of sweet and salty egg-custard-caramel.  Also quite delicious.  The egg tarts (dan tat) are small but tasty as well.

All in all, this is a very impressive place.  Can&#39;t wait to have more XLB!"

My husband and I strolled in pretty late after shopping in the area.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating (with our bags). We were seated almost immediately and our server made some great recommendations.  

We ordered about 5 dishes to share including the soup dumpling sampler (highly recommend) and char Sui and wonton lamian. The prices are a little steep for Chinese food, but the quality, taste and ambience definitely makes it worth it. 

I hope I&#39;ll be able to go here one more time before leaving Chicago."

We were seated at the tables next to the kitchen window. Great view since they make all from scratch. Noodles, dumplings etc. Services is super friendly and excellent. We had the soft-shell crabs, the dumplings mushroom, pork-belly buns, ribs, pork kind of taco so good... Kind like a Mexican carnitas taco but made in China.

The only thing that didn&#39;t like was a weird machine noise that comes from the kitchen.... Don&#39;t know what it is, but they got to fox it.

We started with crab and duck xiao long bao, and three dim sum selections: char siu (lightly baked crispy dough) pumpkin puff (almost too cute to eat), and the seared turnip with egg and sprouts (that and a bowl of rice would&#39;ve have been a great lunch).

We then had the clay pot chicken (mild spice and sweet), London duck (an easy play off the classic, served with pancakes), and two kinds of La Mian (pork belly and beef brisket).

Everything was amazing, fully flavored, and generous in portion.  Even though we were stuffed (with to go containers to enjoy the next day), we still ordered dessert: egg tarts, pineapple cake, and salted egg bao.  Mmmmmm, sweet, custardy eggy goodness.

I have to mention the fantastic service again.  Just perfect."

I made reservations for 1 at 9:15 PM and was seated immediately when I arrive. The restaurant looked relatively empty considering it was late at night.

Breaking down my rating:
Service: 2.5 Stars - My waiter was VERY awkward and did not know how to upsell the menu (or sell the menu at all for that matter). Another waitress came over and picked up his slack. I ordered the mushroom Lamian with a Soy Egg, and after I was done, he came over to ask if I wanted any hot sauce for it.

Food: 3.5 Stars - The Lamian broth was amazing. The noodles are all made in house which was really great. I got to see the chefs making the noodles since their kitchen is open. I was totally full on half a portion of Lamian. 

I did find everything extremely salty though. I also ordered the dessert with a &#34;caramel like&#34; custard in the middle. It was extremely doughy on the outside but the inside was nice. I was able to eat 2/3.

Ambiance: 4 Stars - The lights are dim and the decor is nice."

Décor: The vibe is Asian, which shouldn&#39;t surprise you, but it&#39;s very nicely done with a modern feel to it. There are a bunch of tables and booths, that do not feel crammed together, that are able to accommodate any size group and there is even a private room in the back (separated by a curtain). There are a few smaller tables that are in front of the kitchen (that is nice and open to the dining room). Lighting can be a bit low in the evening but the abundance of windows help provide a decent amount of natural light.
Bathroom: clean, well looked after, and carries the same vibe as the main dining room.

Staff: We had two waiters and they were both knowledgeable about the menu, laid back, and friendly. They provided good service and were backed up by a solid crew of bus boys.

Food: Wow, we had a little bit of everything so I&#39;ll point out the highlights. The Stuffed Chicken Wing was AMAZING, the Hot &amp; Sour Soup was very tasty (and they provided where you could increase the hot or sour to taste!), the Xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) is pretty solid (a bit small, but very tasty - we had Shang Hai, which was our favorite, Spicy Szechuan, and Duck), Fried La Mian (tiger shrimp was very good and a decent sized portion), and some entrees. Everything came out hot and fresh and tasted excellent. They spaced the courses out pretty well too so the table was not over loaded.

Value: It&#39;s a new spot in the middle of River North so the prices are a bit higher, but they are by no means out of this world.

I&#39;ve been needing a place to get my Soup Dumpling fix ever since leaving NYC and this spot will tide me over for now..."

Must tries include the xiao long bao (especially the truffle and spicy szechuan), the pork belly la mian and the yang chaofan. The cocktail list is great as well- I loved the Lost in Translation.

I took out one star because the service was a bit slow.

My wife brought me here for my birthday dinner and Imperial Lamian definitely was 5 stars and lived up to the anticipation.  

Food:
Pumpkin Puff: they look like cute little mini pumpkins and are filled with roast duck and butternut squash.  The crispy texture/crunch of the outside is perfectly complemented by the flavorful and piping hot filling in the middle. So good.
.
Seared Turnip: one of my favorite dishes of the evening! I&#39;m not even a fan of turnip, I&#39;m a carnivore, but I would order this every time.  Seared turnip with XO sauce, egg and bean sprout.  My god...
.
Shanghai soup dumplings: flavorful soup and tasty dumplings, reminds of soup dumplings I had in NYC.  There are multiple types, will definitely try others next time.
.
Beef Brisket Lamian: hand pulled noodles! Perfect texture.  The bone marrow broth was tasty and definitely not too greasy or heavy which was nice. The soy egg was a nice touch as well.
.
London Duck: pulled crispy duck (perfect amount of crispiness), with momo wraps, cucumbers and scallions and hoisin.  The flavor profile is a nice mix and the momo wraps come out steaming hot! Which is a nice touch compared to other Asian joints that give you the plain old rice paper type wraps.
.
Jasmine Tea Smoked Ribs: OH MY GOD.  Best Asian ribs ever.  In all honesty, you can tell they put so much TLC into prepping the fall off the bone meat and the smoky jasmine flavor profile.  I wish BBQ joints would put such thoughtfulness into their rib preparation.  Will come back and get 2 orders next time.  Probably my favorite for the night.
.
Salted Egg Bao: our meal ended with a divine dessert.  You hear the word egg and dessert and get puzzled right? The outside of the Bao was so light and airy and the inside salted egg mixture tasted like sweet cake batter with a hint of salt.  We were so glad it came with 3 baos!!!

Decor: trendy, industrial, modern, meets China. 
.
Service: not sure what the reviews here are talking about. Service was excellent from start to finish.  Our waitress made several recommendations that were home runs and things we would have never tried before and Peter the manager I believe, was so friendly and welcoming and checked in on us several time throughout the evening with smiles and pleasant conversation.  

Was an amazing birthday dinner and will definitely be coming back again."

However, it seemed that it would take FOREVER to get a table. We were a group, and waited there without being notified how long we would wait. All I was told was &#34;as long as the table is set up&#34;, &#34;in a few minutes.&#34; What is even worse, we felt we were forgotten by the waiters, even though they were busy walking around. 

So dining suggestions would be: Do make reservations or call before you arrive to see how long you would wait. Enjoy!"

Cocktails are still heavily diluted and the lamian this time is a bit off. Consistency on the food is lacking and consistency on the poor drink is sadly consistent.  It would be hard to pay this place a third visit.

No consistency translates to sad customer."
imperial-lamian-chicago,Tiffany L.,Ei2f6sclQvm-uzi3Dks3Vw,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,245,11,gABQ2RCyn_HxLeMFRHlk0g,3.0,2016-03-29,"Imperial Lamian, with their many locations in Southeast Asia, has decided to expand to the US and their first expansion is not, as one would expect, in New York, but actually in Chicago! Comparisons will inevitably be made to Chinatown restaurants. Yes, you will pay much more at Imperial Lamian. Some dishes will probably be better in Chinatown. If you bring your Asian parents here, you most definitely should NOT show them the bill. But the ingredients are going to be better quality. You&#39;ll eat on fancier plates. You won&#39;t need to inspect your chopsticks and potentially clean them in your tea. And service will be much, much better. Overall, I liked my experience here and I would come back again.

The vibe here is trendy Asian and the decor is lovely. Two large murals are done by a local artist. One reminded me of Minnie Driver, judging you while you slurp down noodles.

In true Chinese superstitious fashion, dim sum dishes are served with 3 pieces (the Chinese word for &#34;four&#34; sounds like the Chinese word for &#34;death&#34;, so it is considered unlucky to serve anything in 4s). This always makes it very annoying to dine in parties of 4 and you will need to order an extra piece of anything from the dim sum section. The price they charge for that extra price almost makes it worth just getting another order. For example, they charge $7 for the shanghai xiao long bao, which comes with 3 dumplings, and to get an extra one they charged $3. The &#34;I-need-to-get-the-best-deal-possible&#34; side of me would probably just get a 2nd order. The XLB is probably the best I&#39;ve had in Chicago (then again, I really haven&#39;t had a good one in Chicago), but they&#39;re not perfect either. It seems they still need to work on the consistency of their skin -- 2 out of the 6 we had were broken and therefore all the delicious juices had already leaked out. Major no-no. Also the pork was a tad on the dry side. We could all learn a thing or two from the OCD-ness of Din Tai Fung, the ultimate master of XLB. The pork was a little on the dry side as well. The spicy szechuan XLB is SPICY. Too spicy for my tastes. Those szechuan peppercorns are abundant and linger on your tingly lips and tongue.

The Beef Brisket noodle was my favorite dish of the night. My fiancé, ever the oxtail connoisseur, immediately commented on the richness of the broth and how it must be made with oxtail. We confirmed with our server that indeed that is why it was so tasty. A proud moment. If I&#39;m going to be picky, I wish the noodles were a little thicker and more al dente. Texturally, I could not tell they were handmade -- honestly they reminded me of those red box dried Chinese noodles from my childhood that my mom used to use whenever making a noodle dish. The beef was good, I personally would prefer it with more tendon -- but it&#39;s probably a good balance for the customer base that would visit. I would recommend adding an egg as well. Definitely the best beef noodle soup I&#39;ve had in Chicago. UPDATE: Came back again for the beef noodle soup and it was not the same. Consistency issues.

Other dishes:
Golden Mapo tofu - A little overly breaded and fried.  Wouldn&#39;t order again.

Tiger Shrimp Lamian - Great wok flavors. Shrimp really well cooked. A little on the oily side.

Ox-tail Fried Rice - Great wok flavors. Very tasty. Rice cooked really well, fluffy and not oily at all. Would order again.

Green Beans - Delicious. I want a jar of that ground park to eat w/ rice.  Would order again.

Jasmine Tea Smoked Ribs - Delicious dish, ribs prepared very well, very flavorful, fall-off-the-bone, but small portion for $26. I think there were 6 ribs.

Egg Tarts - Bite size, flaky dough, custard part was good, but flavor hidden by the dough. When they&#39;re this little the dough to custard ratio is off."

Salty egg buns: this is what I asked for literally the moment I sat down. I was told that their salty egg buns are the best, and indeed, the buns lived up to my expectation. The fillings are authentic salty egg yolk, so I would definitely recommend this item!!

Combination Xiao long bao: these Xiao long baos are quite on par with Lao Sze Chuan&#39;s. With more flavors (such as truffles, duck, crab and cheese) as options, I would say the classics are still the best. In other words, stick with Shanghai xiaolongbao or the crab ones, and forget about ordering the combination. The yellow one (filled with cheese) is not so worth your money...

Asparagus: small portion, but very flavorful. Order it to accompany with all the carbs-heavy buns. 

Crispy pork belly: decent dish because the meat is not so fat/oily. Order it if you have never tried it, otherwise there are better pork bellys in Chinatown.

Char siu: I loved their char siu buns!!! They kind of baked the buns from the outside, which made the texture different from the char siu buns that you typically get from an Asian supermarket. 

Beef brisket ramen: according to my friends, their ramen is a hit or miss. I, however, happened to enjoy their beef brisket ramen--it definitely doesn&#39;t give you the flavor from a Japanese ramen place, but the beef brisket is well cooked, and the noodles is okay too.

Overall, order as many dim sum buns as possible. Ramens are decent, but avoid the special flavored Xiao long baos!!"

This is pretty authentic food. We had pulled noodles, a variety of dim sum dishes, sesame seabass and the ribs. All of them were very good. 

We were seated at a table right near where the kitchen is, which makes for a great meal being able to see the various dishes put together. 

The decor is really nice, and I am one that does not care at all about the insider of a restaurant as much as the food tastes good going down and plays well inside. 

Only downside may be that it is not a cheap restaurant, but I cannot complain too much considering it is in River North."

One of a few things I never tried in the US was a classy, upscale Chinese restaurant. Well, when I heard that this restaurant was about to open, I was excited. Upscale and authentic Chinese? That&#39;s certainly different.

So, we headed there during their soft opening and had a great dining experience. We went there once more for Easter dinner and, once again, we had a great dining experience. Service was on par with River North type restaurants. Ambience was great. Lighting was perfect. And the restaurant was decorated very nicely with modern Asian setup. Even the dining ware and plates were very nice (just be careful with the sharing bowl since it can tip easily).

Now let&#39;s talk about the most important thing: the food.

There are plenty of options in the menu to order different kinds of food if you plan to go there once a month. I certainly haven&#39;t tried everything, but the ones I&#39;ve tried were either good or great. For this review, I will just list my favorites:

Appetizer:
1. Stuffed chicken wing: If I can only order one food from this restaurant, this is the one I will order. It&#39;s jumbo chicken wing stuffed with tiger shrimp and fried to perfection. Nuf said.
2. Softshell crab: This is my second most favorite. Deep fried and mixed with crunchy almonds. Yum!

Soup: I&#39;m not a soup kind of guy... I don&#39;t order soup.

Salad: I&#39;m 95% carnivore. I will eat free salad though.

Xiao long bao:
I ordered all except the veggie one for the obvious reason. I loved everything I ordered. My son loved it so much, he ate 8 of these on his own. He&#39;s 7 years old by the way. My favorite from this category are the spicy Szechuan and duck.

Dim sum: I haven&#39;t had a chance to order this yet. So no comment on this for now.

Lamian:
My favorite is the fried shrimp lamian. Like I said, I prefer something not soupy. My wife ordered the braised pork belly and loved it.

BBQ:
I only tried the roasted duck so far. It&#39;s good, but nothing can beat the stuffed chicken wing, period.

Fried rice:
I ordered the Ox tail... and I had trouble eating it because of the veggie... LOL. Next time, I&#39;ll ask them not to put veggie in it. If you like veggie, you should find this dish tasty.

Entree:
By this point, I was usually very full already. I did order the Jasmine tea smoked ribs and it was really good. I want to try the prawns and scallops next time.

Sides:
Really? You don&#39;t order sides when you go to River North restaurants. You order the good stuff you can&#39;t cook yourself.

Desert:
My poor tummy couldn&#39;t take anymore food. Maybe next time... maybe...

Drinks:
My wife and I love their mixed drinks. We&#39;re not much of beer drinker, but I can see they have tons of beers you probably can&#39;t find anywhere else. If you&#39;re a beer drinker, you should try their specials."
imperial-lamian-chicago,Jennifer G.,CxxPUsjExKIQWu7I_XTJug,"Chicago, IL",1,1,0,14,50,dtE_gVTbZGInqkR-YdH0Jg,3.0,2016-04-18,"I wanted to try something new this past weekend, so we went to Imperial Lamian for dinner Friday night.  The inside was nice and welcoming, and our server was good.  Unlike some places, she openly told us what her favorite dishes were.  That was much appreciated b/c the menu is a bit large and we didn&#39;t know where to start.

We started with the Spicy Szechuan Bao - which was different than I expected.  I was picturing Wao Bao where the inside was stuffed with meat.  While the Spicy Szechuan Bao was stuffed with meat - there was also a broth so it was helpful that they explained how we should eat them - so as to not get burned.  In our eyes - they weren&#39;t terribly spicy.  I think they need to kick up the spice a bit more.  We also had the Pumpkin Puff Dim Sum - filled with butternut squash.  We really did like this one in terms of presentation and taste.  The starters were the highlight of the meal.

For our entrees, we had the Roasted Duck BBQ (something our waitress told us they were known for - their duck) and the Crispy Prawn Wok Dish.  My husband found the duck dry in flavor - whereas, I found it very messy to eat.  They came with momo wraps, but the wraps quickly ripped when you tried to grab them.  The Prawn&#39;s dish was good (my husband liked it more than I did), but it was a bit too creamy for me.  

For drinks - I had the Imperial Punch - very sweet, but lacking in &#34;punch.&#34;  I didn&#39;t feel any of the alcohol in it and for $13 a punch, I didn&#39;t think it was worth it to get another one.  Which leads me to price.  Yes - the restaurant is pricey.  Each of our entrees were about $24, and for the prawn&#39;s dish, there was maybe 7 prawns - so to me, that dish certainly wasn&#39;t worth the high price.  

Would I go back?  No.  It&#39;s a bit overpriced for what you&#39;re paying and there are so many more Asian/Chinese restaurants in the area that are better tasting and more reasonably priced."

Their xiao long bao are out of this world. It is difficult to find good handmade soup dumplings in Chicago. I&#39;ve only found one more place in the city that can compare. Everything else I had was delicious, I just was a little disappointed when I left still hungry and out of money."
imperial-lamian-chicago,Kaman T.,jsnZXgtUgLsbllkMXX1gNw,"Chicago, IL",1,1,1,307,337,SHES6XAwaqZPATcur3dyyQ,3.0,2016-03-05,"Atmosphere is really nice. Loved the interior design and ambiance. Very &#34;River North&#34; and does not feel like a typical Chinese restaurant at all. Open kitchen so you can see (and hear) the chef hand pulling noodles and banging it on the table.

What we ordered:
-Shanghai style soup dumplings: Came with 3 pieces. Delicious! Skin was good, soup was nice and sweet, and meat was great as well. Although, I did wish it was more piping hot and only came with 3 pieces for $7 when I can get a basket of 10 in Chinatown for same quality. 
-Har gow: Presentation very pretty. Also just came with 3 pieces. Shrimp was bouncy and you can really taste the cilantro and white pepper. Again, tasted like your typical har gow at any dim sum place at a premium price.
-Braised brisket lamian: One of my favorite dishes of the night. Soup was rich and flavorful. Tastes like the ones from Hong Kong. We added an egg which was delicious. You can taste tea and soy in the egg. The noodles had such a nice texture. Nice and chewy and really took on the flavor of broth. Beef, on the other hand, was a little dry for my liking. I am used to it being fattier, more tender, should almost fall apart when you pick it up and melt in your mouth.
-Yan Chaofan: Basically, your typical &#34;yang chow fried rice&#34;. They got the taste and everything right. Don&#39;t get me wrong. It was delicious, but the presentation was not authentic and also such small portion. Came in a stone bowl. Again, I could get the same exact thing for half the price and triple portion elsewhere....
-Jasmine smoked ribs: Amazing! Fall off the bone tenderness. Had tea leaves incorporated with the ribs. Sweet and smoky with hints of tea leaf flavor. I thought that this dish deserved its price, because it was something unique and I can&#39;t get it in Chinatown.
-Beef stir fry lamian: Small portion. Came with crispy wonton strips on top. As my party and I were eating this, we all agreed that it tastes exactly like lomein from PANDA EXPRESS. LMAO!
-Salted egg yolk buns: Dessert. Really good steamed buns with creamy salted egg yolk inside. Again, delicious and executed well but I can get two orders of this in Chinatown with same caliber of taste and quality.
-1000 Miles drink: Loved this. Had great yuzu flavor and the jim bean apple crisp was delicious. Wish it were stronger though cause it&#39;s $14. LOL.
-Yue Lao drink: Also delicious but needs to be stronger. 
-Hot sauce: YES I LISTED THIS. Why?! Because they charged us $2 for a tiny ass saucer of hot sauce. WTH? lol. Did not inform us that it&#39;s an extra charge. I know it&#39;s only $2, but it&#39;s a condiment at authentic Chinese restaurants just like salt and pepper is on every table at American restaurants. Embarrassed for them to nickel and dime us for hot sauce! 



Service was overall good, but need to still work out some kinks. We found that we had to ask for refills of water quite a bit. Food came out with long periods in between dishes. Waited a while to get our receipt to sign. 

Overall, we found that the food was delicious and executed well and tasted authentic. The presentation and experience was not authentic. We also found the food to be overpriced for what it is. If it were more unique (like the Jasmine tea smoked ribs), I wouldn&#39;t mind paying the price that they charge. Most of the items we ate tasted exactly the same as Chinatown, only at a premium price and smaller portion. This is a perfect place for Americans that aren&#39;t comfortable going to Chinatown for authentic Chinese food and would like a fine-dining experience. My Chinese parents would be pissed if I took them here. LOL."

Management was very attentive and checked with every table to see if everything was okay.  It&#39;s great to have addition of a &#34;GOOD&#34; authentic Chinese restaurant in Chicago area. Regards to the menu, there is a good portion of traditional authentic Chinese food and few items that is contemporary Chinese. Everything was good, but few were exceptional and I would probably ordered it again. (shrimp dumpling, oxtail fried rice, crab soup dumpling, fried softshell crab, crispy prawns). The other entrees are good, but is also available in other Chinese restaurants at a less premium price. Overall, the Chinese cuisine served here is very refined in flavor and presentation. It could be on par with some of top rated Chinese restaurant in the West coast/Toronto/Vancouver, however this is at a much higher price tag. For Chicago standard, this is probably one of the better or best! 

Crab soup dumpling $12 - All the XLB is 3 dumplings per order and made fresh to order. This particular XLB would be my favorite. It was very juicy and mouthful of crab. 

Gruyere pork soup dumpling $10 - Interesting combination of gruyere (FYI-it&#39;s cheese) and pork. For cheese lovers, you will enjoy this juicy dumpling. For those unfamiliar with cheese, might taste more like spoiled pork dumpling. Verdict - I ate all 3 dumplings for the table and I enjoyed it. 

Shanghai pork soup dumpling $7 - In comparison to the other XLB, this was the least favorite because the dumpling was on the drier side. BUT, the dumpling is still better and more refined in flavor than most places in Chicago that serves XLB. The dumpling was NOT completely dry, but just damp. The pork flavor was delicious. 

Spicy Szhechaun soup dumpling - I heard it&#39;s pretty spicy.. 

Shrimp dumpling (Har gow) $8 for 3 - One of my favorite! I&#39;m not usually a fan of shrimp dumpling, but the shrimp was crispy, fresh, and very flavorful!

Beef brisket hand pulled noodle $15 - Imperial Lamian is known for the hand pulled noodle which was presented and made by the executive chef inside the open kitchen. The flavor is tasteful, but not too rich. Braised Beef brisket was tender and flavorful (the usual good beef brisket from a typical bowl of beef brisket noodle). Noodle was enjoyable. I rather spent $15 on this bowl of noodle that is made with care then a bowl of ramen. 

fried soft shell crab $16 - Loved it! The batter was light and it was flash fried soft shell crab placed atop bird&#39;s nest (taro?) with shaved almonds (seasoned/stir fried)

Wagyu Oxtail fried rice $16 - Very impressed, the fried rice was not greasy! It was flaming with flavor! Full of &#34;wok hay&#34;. Portion size of a ~6inch stone pot. 

seared turnip with xo sauce $10 - not your typical stirfry turnip!  It was cubed and soft to bite, stirfried with scrambled eggs and scallion. Plenty and plenty of flaming &#34;wok hay&#34;

Roasted Duck $30 for 1/4 of a duck - a good duck with crispy skin. It reminds me of the roasted duck from the old &#34;phoenix restaurant.&#34; It&#39;s good, but you paying for the location of where you are consuming the duck. 
 
Crispy prawn with wasabi aioli sauce atop with passion fruit and mango $23 - My favorite! It&#39;s the Refined and glamourized version of walnut shrimp. The jumbo shrimp (16-20/lb) was lightly batter and mixed with a light wasabi aioli mayo sauce. Very nice presentation!

3cup claypot chicken $20 - Tender and delicious chicken in claypot. It was okay and I think my mom would like it more than I would. Served in ~6in stone pot.
 
Wagyu Osso Buco (veal) $34 - This was our last entrée after 2 hours of seating. It&#39;s served as a shank with tender meat. It was tasteful, but we were too full to enjoy it. It was okay. 

Braised Pork Belly $23 - Good and tender served in a small tea claypot. Probably comes with 2 pieces? It was good and I didn&#39;t think it was anything special or amazing.  Comparable to most places that serves a &#34;good tender&#34; pork belly. 

Scallops with xo sauce $34 - compared to other entrees, this is quite a generous portion of scallop with at least 8 pieces of large scallop (don&#39;t forget that scallop shrinks in size when it&#39;s cooked). Cooked just right and not overcooked. 

jasmine rice $3 bowl - the usual white rice

egg tart $8/ 3 tarts - Good and you can get about 1.5  generous bite out of it. Served warm and flaky crust. 

Sesame ball with red bean lotus paste - Good and could also be found at most dim sum place for half the price. 

Total bill for 6 ppl - ~$400

I would come back again and would order my favorite entrée as mentioned above. Overall service was attentive, although not perfect, but they were very open to feedback. It&#39;s awesome that the 3 chefs are Asian decent which makes it more legit."

Har gao is also fresh and delicious. The atmosphere and decoration are classy Chinese. They have opened kitchen so you can see they make fresh dumpling and noodle-that&#39;s nice. Only few cons are the portion of the food is quite small, lack of attentive service, and the lamian dishes are plain."

The restaurant was darkly lit, incredibly loud, and had weird décor. It was all right I guess. The food was decent but pricy, but they ran out the beef brisket la mian at 7:30pm on a Friday. That was disappointing.

In light of the beef la mian running out, my girlfriend and I shared the peking duck and a bowl of pork belly. The noodles were tasty but the Peking duck was expensive and slightly overcooked.

I&#39;m not going to weigh this into my rating too much because it may have just been a non-representative bad egg but my waitress was also rather unpleasant and awkward. I ordered my beef la mian and asked for a simple substitution of including some vegetables in my dish. She was like, huh that&#39;s weird but I guess I could ask, as if hoping that I would say don&#39;t worry about it. I remember there was a long pause after that and she was like yeah I don&#39;t think we can make that substitution, because of the line handlers couldn&#39;t make the customization. I was like uhh ok, I&#39;ll just get it as is. She disappears for about 10 minutes before coming back and telling me that they had run out of beef brisket. She was unapologetic and cracked a joke saying I could order another dish so that I could get my veggies. I wasn&#39;t amused. She presented other unpleasant qualities, but I&#39;ve ranted enough.

Long story short, Imperial Lamian is all right."

First, the dim sum: I ordered the pumpkin puff and the mushroom, both blew my mind with the unique presentation and the taste. The clasic items, such as the siu may and the xiao long bao were also really tasty. We ordered duck, crab, and original. The xiao long bao were especially good, with juicy filling, aromatic broth, and perfect skin. VERY RECOMMENDED!

The other menu was also brilliant. The lamian noodle had great texture and the broth was very rich in flavor. We also tried the lobster fried rice and oxtail fried rice. The fried rice were a savory goodness!

The dessert made a wonderful finale for our meal. We tried the sesame ball, salted egg bao, and the egg tart. The salted egg bao was my favorite dessert with the perfect filling. 

Our meal was made complete with great cocktails. My favorite was the imperial punch, my boyfriend had the thousand mile journey. We both enjoyed them.

Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. The ambiance of the restaurant was also chic yet cozy. Overall, I recommend this restaurant!"

Read the other reviews on Yelp came in with very low expections but i have never seen anything like this. The open kitchen is a sight to see, love the fact how everything is freshly made and not greasy like your typical chinese resturant.

The Xiao Long Bao was tasty and delicate. The skin so thin and the filling sweet and succulent. Havent seen anything like this in Chinatown.  The Lamian Dishes was great. I love how the noodles were cooked aldente and the broth was so flavourful, the waiter later informed us how the broth was cooked for over 8 hours with no msg no wonder i didnt feel leaving extremely thirsty like i normally do when I eat in Chinatown.

The only dwnside to this place is on the pricey side but i guess it being in River North, with the quality of the food, location and the ambience all in all I&#39;ll say worth every dime.  Cant wait to go back there again and try the wok dishes."

We had a bowl of noodles + black chia siu + two orders of soup dumpling and Jasmine tea short ribs.

Before we started, I asked the waitress if we could mix and match the bao -- I will admit the entire reason we were there was because I wanted a picture of the colorful bao. However, she did not know the answer and had to ask. This really irked me because if it&#39;s advertised as such on the website (in picture form), why wouldn&#39;t she know the answer? Even worse, the answer was no -- I would have to pick only one or two (to complete the picture would have been 60+ dollars). The bao did not come out the same as the picture, I felt like at a fast food restaurant, where the pictures are better than the food.

In terms of the rest of the food, everything was ok -- the Jasmine tea short ribs was incredibly inconsistent. The first piece we had was burnt and too crispy with no taste. However, the middle of the rack was better and made up for the bad first piece. Black chia siu was literally the same thing you could get from Chinatown but twice the price and half the size. The bowl of noodles was actually pretty good -- I would consider coming back just for a bowl of noodles. It was pricey but I&#39;ve paid similar prices for ramen but the meat, noodles and broth were all quite good.

Overall, I would not suggest the restaurant in the future to my friends that are obsessed with Asian food like I am. You can go to Chicago&#39;s Chinatown and get similar tasting food for 1/3 of the price. I would admit that the service was better and it felt cleaner than some of the grittier restaurants in Chinatown but alas, I do not recommend paying that price for mediocrity."

Recommended: spicy soup dumplings, seafood fried rice, salty dumplings for dessert and of course ANY of the Lamian.

I had the duck xiao long bao soup dumplings, and these were my favorite.  So good and savory.  I tried the mushroom dumpling, and I thought it was decent, and the har gao shrimp dumpling, which I wasn&#39;t very fond of.  It had a very overpowering seafood flavor and lot of texture going on.  I guess I was expecting something more delicate.  I tried the beef brisket la mian, too.  It was very flavorful and delicious."

We ordered the wonton noodles with pork, fried lamein and crispy shrimp.  The noodles in soup was the best. The broth was nice and complimented the fresh noodles nicely. The fresh noodles had nice texture. 
Ask for a table near the noodle pulling station. It&#39;s dinner and a show.
We stayed away rom the soup dumplings. They looked over priced and didn&#39;t look so authentic. After growing up with Joe&#39;s Shanghai and having soup dumpling at Ding Tai Fung, we shy away from multicolored dumpling which the skin looks a little too thick. 
They pride in serving Shanghainese dishes, but I only saw lamein, soup dumplings and braised pork. 
The crispy shrimp had an interesting twist. The mayo was wasabi flavored. Aside from the mayo sauce, the shrimp would have been well done with a little crispy exterior. I don&#39;t think they were prawns, more like jumbo shrimp. 

All in all, it was nice experience; the wait staff was nice and the noodles were great. (You can get the same stuff for less than 1/3 the price in NY&#39;s Chinatown."

It&#39;s lively, with good ambiance and a visual into the kitchen where you can hear them smacking noodle dough onto the counter. 

I&#39;ve had the pumpkin puff and jasmine tea ribs, both of which are probably among my favorites and very popular here. I&#39;ve never had the noodle dishes but that&#39;s more a personal thing - I&#39;m positive they&#39;re as delicious as everything else. Go in a group; a group that&#39;s hungry. Aside from smaller dimsum that you can order and try many of, the potions on the entree type dishes are relatively generous so you would have lots to try.  The front of the house team seemed knowledgable and friendly, capable of gauging what you have and if it&#39;s enough for your table or if your table will collapse from too many dishes. 

Important to remember - they tell you that everything you order will come out when it&#39;s done, not when you&#39;re ready or when you think it should come because it&#39;s dim sum, not a noodle dish, for example...so plan accordingly. It&#39;s not a gesture meant to make you feel rushed, but it makes for a fun time trying to find room to put everything on your tiny table."

Atmosphere: The space looks cool when you walk in, but it has a lot to be desired as a fun place to get together. It&#39;s cavernous and loud, and not entirely comfortable. We were seated at a two-top next to the waiter&#39;s station in the middle of the dining room, and it&#39;s a space that definitely shouldn&#39;t be a table. I kept getting bumped by waiters.

Food: The noodles were incredible, though! The hand stretch them in an open kitchen. The broth I had was tasty. The Xiao Long Bao have a gimmicky dyed dough situation, but it was fun to see them when they finally came out (more on that later). I&#39;ve had better soup dumplings for half the price, though. The lamian are the star of the show. We also had a couple of vegetable starters. Nothing special, but nothing gross either. 

Service: Man, was the service a real detractor. Our waiter was smug and acted like I didn&#39;t know anything about Asian food, but dude was the white guy in the equation. I&#39;m cool if you want to explain the menu to me, but the muttering during my dinner choices was a passive aggressive child&#39;s move. Plus, he chastised me for ordering the combination xiao long bao because it was a combo (duh); I guess he was so busy tut-tutting my decision that he completely forgot to put in my order, because he brought us the bill before we got them. I had to remind him. To his credit, he comped us, though. Our waiter was also kind of gross- unkempt and dirty in a stained uniform, but not in a cool way. Just unhygienic. I&#39;m glad the super friendly girl shadowing him brought us our food. 

Overall, go for the noodles if you happen to be in River North, but don&#39;t expect great service. Better yet, just hike it down to Chinatown for the real deal. I mean, if I&#39;m gonna get brisk and borderline rude treatment, it may as well come with a discount and and authenticity upgrade. Or, if you&#39;re in for a more Westernized experience, hit up Duck Duck Goat. It&#39;s way cooler, has a much better bar list, they also make their own noodles, the service is friendlier and the space is 100% cooler."

How does a restaurant &#34;run out&#34; of ingredients on probably your biggest night during high time? They didn&#39;t have spring rolls, a few other appetizers, and they even ran out of ginger beer for my amaro mule haha. 

The food we did order was good though, the mushroom dim sum and clay pot chicken were solid. Waitress was horrendous, slow service and had to remind her twice about drink orders.  I guess this is what you would expect from a new, posh river north restaurant. Probably won&#39;t come back."

The traditional Shanghai soup dumplings (xiao long bao) were probably the best I&#39;ve ever had, and you can taste a difference in quality compared to the cheaper soup dumplings in Chinatown. We also ordered the Char Siu &amp; Wonton La Main, a pork bun, the Spicy Szechuan Xiao Long Bao, and a couple other dishes. These were good but not amazing. Overall the difference in quality isn&#39;t enough to offset the very high prices. I would go back for the delicious Shanghai soup dumplings but nothing else."

For the love of God, I read some of these reviews and I can&#39;t help but laugh at the level of pickiness and whining. This is a NEW restaurant, yes they will have some hiccups here and there so you have to take that into consideration. (I personally didn&#39;t experience any)

Although my Yelp profile doesn&#39;t show it, I&#39;m the HUGE Chicago foodie, I can tell that I&#39;ve tried them all from best to worst. Here&#39;s what I think of this place:

Food: Downtown Chicago was missing a gourmet Chinese restaurant. The level of detail involved in creating some of this food is amazing! Trust me, if you like any type of Asian food, you&#39;ll love this place. 

Prices: I saw so many complain about the prices, the reality is that you&#39;re at busy downtown Chicago area, so if you want to dine on a dime I suggest a restaurant outside of river north. The menu has prices on it, so if you see that it&#39;s too expensive don&#39;t order. The last time I went there I was with 3 other people, we ordered A LOT of food and we each had a drink, total was $210.. I think that&#39;s a deal for the meal we had!

Service: very friendly and extremely professional. 

Overall this place is awesome ! If you want good food, good service and a fun atmosphere.  Go here and I promise that you won&#39;t regret it!"

Not your typical kitschy Asian decor, industrial and open. Surprisingly not loud either for a very busy Saturday night. Although the food was a bit pricey, it was well worth it as it was all excellent. Service was superb as well.

--hot &amp; sour soup; spicy and unique--mustard greens(?)
--jasmine spare ribs are a MUST. So tender, it fell right off the bone.
--baked pork bao was delicious; it was the bun that made it
--Xiang Gu mushroom filled dumpling was a terrific surprise in a translucent noodle; have never had this before and loved it
--the sioa mei was not unique, but was nonetheless delicious
--Terrific wine selection. Had a bottle of a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc that was a delight
--coconut sorbet with pineapple cake for dessert was perfect portion to share

One of which literally explained everything on the menu to my friend and I. However, the quality of the food we ordered was just average. My friend and I split the Bom Bom salad, Kung Pao chicken, and Salmon. The quality of the chicken was really poor as the chicken was extremely fatty. That was disappointing considering this a more upscale chinese food restaurant. Overall I think this place is over rated."

If rating this just for food alone I&#39;d give our meal a 4-4.5/5, but the service left a lot to be desired.  Although friendly, it seems they haven&#39;t quite worked out the kinks and there were some mix ups where food was delivered to the wrong table, etc.  Great decor, great take on Chinese cuisine, and good drink selection, but the service needs to improve.

I have been to Henry&#39;s before in that past for some alumni events to meet and greet, and overall Henry&#39;s is a great place to chow down on some appetizers and enjoy some drinks while networking. And I&#39;ll say that Henry&#39;s lower level Rec Room was probably one of my favorite spots in River North. BUT hard to say I&#39;ll be back after an incident that occurred Saturday evening. 

So this past Saturday, I had suggested to my friends visiting from out of town that we check out Henry&#39;s and the Rec Room. We were having a really enjoyable time here drinking and dancing, when I got trampled by this tall lanky dude with thick glasses. Stumble over me and step on me kicks once, no big deal. There was no pushing or shoving going on, but I simply put my hand out to keep him from stepping on me because he was clearly drunk as a skunk bumping into folks left and right. Security was already in process of escorting out tall drunk lanky glasses dude AND two other guys that apparently had some sort of argument with him, and in this process since I apparently was protecting myself from having him trample over and step on me again. Security grabbed me and told me I needed to leave. What infuriated me the most was that tall drunk lanky glasses guy obviously was associated with the staff and security there at Henry&#39;s because as soon as we all got kicked out, they let him stay in. I spoke briefly with the other two guys that I got kicked out with (no affiliation what so ever) but just trying to get more info on why they were kicked out. And as it turns out, tall lanky drunk glasses guy stumbled all over them too. They were definitely more heated about it, but I was more upset I got booted from my friends. I tried to talk to security while outside to find out who tall drunk lanky glasses guy was, but they kept a vow of silence and told me to get lost.

What was an excellent night, ended up turning sour for me. I had tried calling management to discuss the situation, yet they were being rude about it. It was a good run Henry&#39;s, but probably won&#39;t be back anytime soon. &#39;Til next time."

The Hubbard area can be known for pricey drinks and pricey food. But this place doesn&#39;t come close to both. Drinks are affordable, food is great. The problem with the drinks being affordable is that I always end up ordering to many shots and drinks and it does not suit me well the morning after.

It&#39;s a fun place. The location is great, because after dinner you can grab a drink. Be mindful that it&#39;s usually crowded on weekends, but we&#39;ve always managed to hunt down a seat somewhere. They have couches, tables, bar stools, and high tops. 

It&#39;s an entertaining place! The vibe is sort of new-age, vintage-hipsterish, as well as general. So, it&#39;s a good mix of folks. They have a pool table, Uno cards, and tableside campfires. LOL You can make your own s&#39;mores with a mini-camp fire grill!

$12 (Some cocktail off their regular menu)
$2.50 to $3.50 (sliders)

First of, the food was incredible. I tried the blue cheese and the kimchi sliders and they were both amazing. I&#39;ve never had kimchi before, but their slider was amazing!

The place has nice decor, and it&#39;s definitely one of the classier bars in Chicago.

I rated this place 3 stars on the sole fact that my bartender told me the price of the cocktails is by the hour you order it. I ordered it at 6 so I thought I&#39;d pay that much and not the full $12 price.

Well, I checked their wall and if you order Monday to Tuesday, happy hour prices are 5-7, Wednesday and Thursday it goes 7-9... or something like that. MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THE WALL (I went on a Thursday)!

The drink was good for $6, but definitely NOT worth the $12. I wouldn&#39;t really mind paying that much either really, but at least know your menu. That&#39;s the least thing you could do as a server."

The slider menu is AWESOME.  Fun, creative combinations that include gyro meat, chicken, and beef.  Try the Kentucky Hot Brown and the Merkts Cheddar--yum!  The best part?  Each slider is between $2.50-$4 so you can try an eclectic variety at an adorable cost.   

The cocktail list reminds me of something you might find in a speakeasy and the options are delicious!  The Swingin Doors is my favorite.

Went on their Wednesday night 90&#39;s night, which consisted of Friends episodes running on the big screen and a 90&#39;s playlist that brought back good memories of grade school, except for the drinking. Good happy hour special running with draft cocktails (normally priced $11) for whatever the hour from 5-8pm. i.e 6:38 = $6.  Draft beers are included as well, but those are almost all 6 bucks so not much of a deal. Sliders were also all $2.  Bar was pretty busy, especially during happy hour time. So much so that it was pretty hard to hear the people sitting at your table, everyone had to shout, but whatev&#39;s I guess it&#39;s the cool place to be!

Food wise we all really like our sliders, we tried an assortment and the burgers were probs the fav. We also tried the Merkt cheese fries and is maybe just go with the regular next time, these were mush city USA. To top off the meal they gave us some &#34;love&#34; (as they coded it on the receipt) and comped us some s&#39;mores that we toasted at our table. Super fun!

Cocktails wise, we tried a couple of the drafts, I liked the Killing Floor which was watermelon with spicy tequila.  Good aftertaste hit of spice. All the drafts were quite sweet though and maybe not particularly strong. To end the night I decided to get my trusty standby, an old fashioned, and was kind of disappointed. Haven&#39;t been to a cocktail bar in a while that doesn&#39;t do an orange peel around the rim!

First I ordered the swinging doors drink, next I had top hat and finally I tried pocket watch. I would like to note that as we drank, the waiter said &#34;oh, you literally ordered the last one of those&#34; which was nice to hear. That means they do change up their draft cocktails. In fact, I went late March, and they were already prepping the fall menu for drinks. Each drink was fairly strong, but went down easily. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the top hat, but it was still drinkable. It was just too spiced for my taste. L

As far as food, I tried the Kentucky hot brown, pretzel &amp; fries. All of these items were tasty. The Kentucky hot brown had melted cheese that really was melted and gave the sense of gravy more than cheese. I would like to note that it was a single serving, meaning, there&#39;s no fries or side salad served with this. If you want a full meal, you&#39;ll either have to order more food, or go elsewhere. With he pretzel, I&#39;d seriously recommend getting a double order of cheese instead of cheese &amp; mustard, but that just because it&#39;s a brown mustard that is quite strong. The pretzel itself is wonderful, it&#39;s crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside. The cheese is so velvety. The mustard is well, mustard-y, I mean its great, but I&#39;m not a mustard fan, so I can&#39;t judge. The fries were also good, same cheese as the pretzel, but just lathered on top with green onions.

I give Herny&#39;s 3 stars for 1 reason: Service. Service was very very slow. It literally took 5-10 minutes to get a drink. We all ordered draft beer or draft cocktail since that was the special, so I&#39;m not sure what took so long. My to go pretzel took over 15 minutes, it also didn&#39;t come with a bag, silverware or napkins. When I ordered my final drink I ordered my finally drink &amp; check. Total time from that moment until I relieved my check was 20 minutes. That&#39;s quite a long time.

The atmosphere of Henry&#39;s was really chill. I could go back time and time again."

Even without being a bearded-tight-jean-wearing-bicycle-riding-Logan-square-type, Henry&#39;s delivered. There&#39;s a modern vibe that is eloquently meshed with a chill, speakeasy atmosphere. Top that off with the vampy sexiness of burlesque dancers, stripping down to their skivvies, and you have the makings of an unparalleled drinking environment.
And boy, did we drink. I think I had 5 of the Hemline, which was the perfect combo of tart and boozy. It was a sipping drink, smooth yet sassy, which mimicked the feel of the bar.
In retrospect, I wish I dabbled in their food offering, outside of the creepy staring/drooling I was doing from a far. They had this s&#39;mores platter complete with mini flames to roast your mellows while you sip on your beverage. It looked like campfire goodness. Mess and all.
I recall a conversation (or parts of one) where my bestie and I teased a table of burley dudes as they mauled down a massive platter of nachos. It was a heaping mountain of chips, cheese and toppings.... And somewhat intriguing to witness four dudes straight up devour.
There&#39;s a photo booth. Because alcohol always makes a photo booth an optimal idea. Plus- it was less than the cost of a drink, and (at the rate we were sipping those down) lasts a hell of a lot longer.
So Henry&#39;s is definitely a great avenue to spend an extraordinary evening out with friends- if you&#39;re down for the hipster scene transplanted, you must venture in. 
Come thirsty, and prepare for flesh and follies remnant of the prohibition era. 
Actually looking forward to visiting again!"

They were playing a great mix of music and there were a few people playing pool in the front (which is fun b/c usually pool tables are in the back). I quickly ordered some food.

Both the intoxicated and sober ate them right up! Everything was super tasty! I loved the slider which was really an open-faced piece of toast with tuna salad and cheese on top. The tamale was so good that when my other friend joined me I insisted that he order one.
After the snack I ordered my friend a Lyft and we helped her into the car. Everyone was cool.
I stayed there by myself for a bit and it was perfectly ok. Great music, The Blues Brothers on tv, and an attentive bartender. I can&#39;t wait to come back!"

Nikki C. even popped over to sit with us for a bit.  
Yvonne had a gift certificate treat for 4 cocktails and a GIANT NACHO. 
The giant nachos were as described - GIANT! we did not have it in us to finish them. 
I also ordered 3 of the sliders: kentucky hot brown, fried chicken and elvis!
They were all really good but my favorite was the fried chicken. 
We had the semifreddo version of the mezcal mule due to it not being completely frozen but they were good. 
Yvonne also tried a phosphene dream and I had another candy says.  The drinks and the food were both great.
Service was on point as we arrived early and were one of only a few tables. 
I will definitely be back to try out the downstairs rec room area."

I&#39;ve been here a few times, and will definitely be back.  They have a happy hour special now, where their &#34;regular&#34; cocktails are priced based on the hour ($5 at 5:00, $6 at 6:00, etc.).  The cocktails are very creative and try different combinations.  

If you have any bit of a sweet tooth, get the table-side s&#39;mores.  How often do you get to have (let alone cook) s&#39;mores at a bar?!  I&#39;ve also done the big-ball challenge, which was mind over matter because they tasted just like any other fried appetizer if I didn&#39;t think about the fact that I was eating testicles.  But you do get $2 off your bill for eating them!  I&#39;ve had many of the sliders too, some were better than others, but all were pretty good, especially for the reasonable price.

The one big downside for me is that it&#39;s very loud in there.  Hard to have a conversation at all, because the music is turned way up and then everyone talks loud over it.

They also have a photo booth in the back, which is pretty cool as well.  I definitely plan to make this a regular hangout."

It has a significantly younger, and more low key vibe than most of its neighbors on Hubbard and lacks the pretentiousness of the higher end cocktail bars in the area.
Got to Henry&#39;s Saturday night around 8 pm with a group of 6. We seemed to be in between the dinner rush and the late night rush so it was a great time to snag a table (everything is first come first served). The bar is just one huge open area, with small tables and chairs in one half with the bar itself while the other is more lounge-y, with couches and a pool table. Our server was very attentive throughout the night and very polite. 
Henry&#39;s has a great cocktail list, with some of them bottled, as well as a solid beer selection. I started with the Sarsaparilla Sling, which was an easy to drink, whiskey based cocktail. They have some pretty amusing beer and shot combos if you&#39;re looking to party. There&#39;s also more of a dance bar downstairs too if that&#39;s your thing.
Great drinks, great vibe, great place to hang out with friends. I would expect nothing less from the DMK guys. Will definitely keep coming back!"

There never is much of a line, which can be a novelty in this area. Most of the time there are seats available at the bar or on the comfortable sofas in the front, where the large windows are opened up on comfortable summer/fall evenings. 

I&#39;ve never eaten here, but who needs food when they have the Killing Floor on their drink menu. This is the most amazing jalapeño infused tequila and watermelon drink! Yes, watermelon and jalapeño sounds like a strange combination, but go there and try it and then tell me it doesn&#39;t work! Damn, it&#39;s good! 

The music can be LOUD so make sure you&#39;re sitting close to those you plan to talk to. The walls are plastered with topless playboy cutouts and there may be half naked go go dancers walking around depending on the night. It has a very laid back vibe, but you can never know what to expect, but I guarantee that with enough Killing Floors you&#39;ll enjoy it!"

The gin fizz was very delicious, and had a nice creamy texture and the milk was a great twist. The sage/gin drink was also really delicious - sweet and savory, but not overwhelming of either flavor (you&#39;d just not have to mind the flavor of sage). And knowing that it is an unusual flavor, my bartender was ready to change out my drink.

We also got a deck of UNO cards from the bartenders to play while we were there and the first floor was a mash-up of tables, chairs, sofas, pool table and bar seating. Definitely a hipster vibe and cool black paneling and wood all over. Didn&#39;t head downstairs but heard its a dance floor on the weekends."

I came here 2 nights in a row two weekends ago (the night before my birthday and the night of my birthday) because the drinks and food here are that damn good. The prices are UNBEATABLE. I dream about the s&#39;mores... I dream about the $3 oyster sliders (they&#39;re all good, trust me!) It would&#39;ve been three nights in a row but they&#39;re closed on Mondays.

The people that work here are super friendly! My friend and I got free shots for my birthday, my friend has gotten free s&#39;mores for hers, and they also do industry nights where people who work in the industry get discounts.

I talk about this place to my friends a lot because even though it&#39;s not a dive bar or a sports bar or a pool hall or a hipster-scene underground speakeasy, it really has the best elements of them. It&#39;s a cool and hip place with TVs to watch sports, a pool table or two, fun and creative drinks, and really great food. It&#39;s comfortable without being dingy, edgy without being intimidatingly alternative.

We paid $12 for two tiny, mediocre sliders there which caused us to leave as I realized I could come here and get way better sliders for $2-3 each. We ordered one of the burgers and one of the chicken sliders and they were large and delicious. We also got an iceberg salad that was a good portion and decent for only $3. Overall we finished our dinner for $10 while enjoying good music and super friendly servers. 

Highly recommended for drinking, hanging out or eating. Great servers, low prices, cool atmosphere, and delicious food make Henry&#39;s a big winner."

I had no idea what was in store for me prior to coming here. The menu is fairly straightfoward and easy to navigate. Note the burgers are &#34;bite sized&#34; but you can get really full on just 2! Order with caution haha

We loved the onion rings, tamale (SO SPICY), Kentucky Hot Brown, Roast Pork and Kimchi. My favorite was the fried chicken with wallflower honey - so tasty. 

Food comes out pretty quickly and you will be stuffed! Come hungry and ready to have some fun!

Servers are very nice and prompt with orders. Recommended for groups of friends.

We decided to go on a Sunday night because I&#39;ve heard it gets busy and loud and I wanted us to not have to yell at each other.  We walked in shortly after they opened and were able to take advantage of their happy hour- draft cocktails and beer are the price of the hour.  We definitely took advantage of this with three of the four of us going the cocktail route.  We had the scarlet begonias, swingin doors and top hat mag.  I had a taste of each and they were all good!  We started out with an order of Merkt&#39;s fries and onion rings, which we devoured while we were trying to decide which sliders to try.  I cant even remember what everyone ordered, but everyone was happy with their choices.  We also did the balls challenge, which was actually chicken gizzards the night we were there.  Our server (Lauren I believe) was excellent.  She made sure we had everything we needed just the right number of times.

PROS: 
Tried a couple beef sliders and the kentucky chicken slider which were all flavorful, moist and delicious.
House carbonated cocktails come in a cool cola-style glass.
Music and ambiance was great for casual eating n drinking.
Check out downstairs during the weekend for a basement-style house party


CONS: 
Not great for vegetarians (basically a grilled cheese and a pretzel).
The draft beers came in 12 oz cups, not pints...? maybe i ordered a special one.
Random 70&#39;s porn on the screens?  i guess this could be a pro if you&#39;re into that.

I have been treated well here on multiple occasions including at the bar and sitting at a table in both sober and not so sober states. In particular, the server Danny and manager Jason were great! 

Henry&#39;s has an excellent cocktail menu with happy hour deals, cheap shots if needed, and a decent beer menu. I have always enjoyed my drinks here, I think it is great they have their own bottled cocktails as well.  The food is good in itself and great for the price. It is hard to find a place in River North that is all a la carte where you have the option to pay just a few dollars if you want one taco or one slider. I&#39;ve never been disappointed in the food here, and have particularly liked the pretzel, buffalo slider, merkts cheddar, and some type of poblano pepper goodness on rye bread. The servers are always happy to provide recommendations as well! 

Overall, Henry&#39;s has higher quality drinks/snacks compared to the surrounding area and is slightly cheaper with excellent service. Great for groups at anytime in the night, very chill yet fun atmosphere!"

The blessing? You bring a nice relaxed feel to the tour trap that is river north.  The one huge projection TV is great for having some sports in the background and the mixology/cocktail list is impressive.  I even like the sporadically lit Christmas lights and eclectic random couch placement acting like hybrid booths.  

The curse? You can&#39;t escape the douchiness.  Trust me, we still ran into it. 
But let&#39;s be honest, just being in river north puts your douche-o-meter at a 4 out of 10.  At least you only register like a 5 out of 10.   Can&#39;t blame you for the environment.  Streets raised you.

But back to business.

::Food (aka Sliders)::
80% of the menu are sliders, but they give you the international range of sliders.  From Italian Cold Cut to Greek Lamb to Viet Banh Mi to Wisconsin Cheddar.  Everyone&#39;s invited.  Get some fries and onion rings with that, and you are good to go.  Although next time I do want to dabble in the big-ass tamale.

::Booze::
This is really where Henry&#39;s starts to set itself apart.  They offer great cocktails for $10 (which is great for River North).  And these cocktails aren&#39;t just vodka lemonades with a fun name.  
I had the Burma Shave, since I&#39;m a sucker for good tequila cocktails.  Great spice, mellow sweetness, and still get the refreshing jalapeno-infused tequila undertone.  One of the better tequila cocktails I&#39;ve had in Chicago. 

Next time I make the way to river north... the suggestion will be Henry&#39;s."

Great vibe and great drinks. 

They have a good list of unique cocktails.  I liked the one that was jalapeño infused. 

The food is mostly small bites but it&#39;s set in a way so you can order much or as little as you want and get your variety. it may not seem like much but things can add up quickly. Im sure the place gets a great profit margin with the menu set up with mostly sliders. The oyster slider with arugula was good and the pulled pork was okay too. I would probably try the lamb next time after having heard some good things.

I came in around 9:30 this past Saturday evening with my friend and we easily found seats at the bar. Henry&#39;s was the opposite of other places on Hubbard (packed with long lines and girls dressed like they were heading out in Vegas) and I couldn&#39;t have been more glad it was. 

I tried a few of their cocktails while I was there: the Mezcal Mule, Sangria, and Sugarfoot. 

The Sugarfoot was probably my favorite. It was light, bubbly, and refreshing. Definitely a great choice to cool off with on a humid summer night. 

I also really enjoyed the Mezcal Mule. The flavor can be quite jarring when you first try it but the flavor really grows as you enjoy the drink and had I not wanted to try other things I definitely could&#39;ve had more than one. 

The Sangria was a bit sweet for me but I really like that they add tequila, definitely gives it a much needed punch. 

For food I went with the Kentucky Hot Brown and Merkts Cheddar sliders. Both of them were outstanding and came on some of the freshest bread I&#39;ve ever eaten a slider on. You can tell that while the food at Henry&#39;s is inexpensively priced they do not skimp on the quality. Portions work and the food is delicious. 

I cannot wait to come back to Henry&#39;s to enjoy the casual ambiance and try out more of their amazing sliders. This place is a must try."

We tried a variety of sliders- we ordered enough that the waitress threw in an oyster slider to round out our smorgasbord! I particularly liked the spicy lamb and the honey chicken, and my fiancé loved the pork kimchee and the merkts cheddar. We also had the poutine, which was good but not great. I love DMK&#39;s fries, but these are crinkle cut and waaaay below expectations. Please use your normal, delicious, hand cut fries, DMK gods!

Burger- patty was big for a slider and cooked well.
Fried chicken w honey- crispy and lots of honey! 
Fish taco- soooo good! Crispy! The waitress didn&#39;t like seafood but I&#39;m glad I ordered it anyways.
Pork bahmi w Kim chi- it&#39;s the same bread as the sliders but taste Asian. Meat and kimchi blended well
Lamb- meh.... I&#39;ll try again next time but it was way too tart. I think it might be the sauce is off
Oyster slider- my bf fav out of all. Light and crispy
Chili fries - tasty and flavorful but not overloaded
The fucken tamale- today was a special w the chili meat and not the listed chicken but dammmmn it was good! And giant!!!! It is literally 4 times the size of a reg one for $5!!! Amazing!

This isn&#39;t even &#34;small plates&#34; -you craft your meal slider by slider. The slider selection is well crafted, highly varied, and not your standard beef patties. Try the sweet but crispy fried chicken slider with wildflower honey. Other highlights include the truly Giant Nachos for a very reasonable $14. 

Henry&#39;s Swing Club is an incredibly special place in River North. We&#39;re talking about a place where you can absolutely FEAST for cheap. The central location, good beer selection, and more-than-reasonable prices. The only slight downside is their dark, loud, sports bar atmosphere - not the best for conversation."

I dunno, guys. Not sure how this place is SOOOO much different than any other place in the area. It&#39;s crowded. It&#39;s relatively small. The drinks are still pretty spendy. The pool table is awkwardly placed. And...it&#39;s just another cocktail bar. Perhaps the beauty of it is in the food, which we did not order.

I love places that have draft cocktails because you can sample a few before committing to anything. If you want something refreshing but not &#34;girly,&#34; swingin door is great, but if you need something stroooooong, you can&#39;t go wrong with a brooklyn. Is it wrong that $10 for a cocktail sounds super inexpensive to me? Because that&#39;s what we&#39;re looking at here.

Their menu is so fun, as is trying all the different sliders. I didn&#39;t care for Italian hero or new mexican hatch, but the spicy lamb and the fried chicken with honey were very good. Their sliders aren&#39;t tiny; you can get full on two or three. I just wouldn&#39;t recommend trying to split a slider with more than three people (for those of you &#34;let&#39;s order everything and each try a bite!&#34; types)."

I&#39;ve been to Henry&#39;s about a dozen times at this point, and every time, the wait staff are super friendly and helpful. They&#39;ve even given us drink vouchers for drinks on the house when they first opened--so super cool!

The reason Henry wins for best hospitality, though, is the drunk eats are some of the best in town. They have absolutely DELISH sliders that range from fried oysters and pulled pork to your more standard honey fried chicken and beef. They also have tacos (why not??) and $2 off your bill for trying to cow testicle sliders... (no, I am not kidding). The GINORMOUS nachos are some of the best nachos ever. They literally just throw the kitchen sink at these things and serve them on a platter the size of two heads.

Once described by a friend as &#34;upscale hipster&#34; or &#34;a bit of Wicker Park in River North&#34; for all you locals, Henry&#39;s is a breath of fresh air in a neighborhood of pretentious nightclubs (and that&#39;s coming from a regular guest of Paris Club and Underground) and boring bars lacking personality. 

The staff is welcoming, knowledgeable about the menu and attentive. I&#39;ve been to Henry&#39;s on weekend and weekday nights and can always grab a table. The menu is mostly composed of small snacks (a bunch of slides and some pretty awesome tacos), which means if you&#39;re not hungry you can get full off $6-7 or feast for $20. The crispy whitefish taco and the giant nachos are my favorite (I&#39;d recommend passing on the fried oyster sliders). I cannot comment on the cocktails but the beer list and bourbons/whiskeys are both on point.

I keep coming here with groups of guys (I&#39;m a bro) and we buy a $2 deck of cards and play drinking games a la the good old college days. Everyone I&#39;ve brought here absolutely loves the vibe and has a great time. We&#39;ve gotten a couple of rounds of shots comp&#39;d and free s&#39;mores (score!), which is always delightful.

They were busy, but it wasn&#39;t packed by any means... the bartender took a while to get over to us, but she apologized for the delay &amp; offered us bourbon-of-the-day shots on the house (who says no to that?). I ordered the Shake Appeal, and it was de-freaking-licious.

I wasn&#39;t 100% sure what to expect from Henry&#39;s, I think I was expecting something more swing-y... I guess in my head I had pictured something very 1930&#39;s/big-band-ish? but that&#39;s not at all what it was. I was loving the 1960s/70s soundtrack &amp; vibe.

I can assume after a certain time of day it has a douche-factor, but the bartenders were super friendly &amp; not River Northy at all. Big fan.

Place was a madhouse. Instead of being able to grab a table and order some delicious sliders, fries and beers, we wandered around by ourselves looking for an open table. Any table. Most folks weren&#39;t eating but were drinking. 

Still, I saw no waitstaff. Some folks were just hanging out at tables or standing around tables like you would at a club. Didn&#39;t this used to be a restaurant?! Nowhere to sit, and we hung out for 25 minutes waiting on the last member of our party to show up. STILL no host, and I saw one server in all that time. They don&#39;t take reservations.

Our server was amazing.  She actually sat down next to us to have an actual conversation about the menu.  She also made some killer recommendations for us.  

Food: You must get the Merkt&#39;s Burger!  Its is pure cheesy deliciousness and I found myself sad when it was all gone.  The Kentucky Hot Brown is also something of a must to get while here.

I love all jalapeno infused tequila drinks and the combo of watermelon and lime with it was perfect. (Just a tip don&#39;t get the jalapeno cocktail from South Branch--- first time I didn&#39;t like a jalapeno infused drink) My girlfriends loved my drink so much they each ordered one for themselves. Had the frozen strawberry margarita too, which wasn&#39;t bad but not as good as Killing Floor. 

Ordered the sriracha ginger oyster slider and the aioil oyster slider--- both were pretty legit. I wish there was no bread though so I could enjoy more of the oyster. But I guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s a slider! Had the fish taco too---- SO MUCH FISH for $3.50. LOVED IT. 

I would definitely come back for more food. It&#39;s really loud in here though. But our waitress was awesome-- very sweet and helpful with suggestions. Also, there was a huge group of drunkies at the table next to us. Witnessed the birthday girl fall out of her chair, followed by the guy next to her fall out of his chair. I doubt it was a furniture defect. They ordered the s&#39;mores plate which included a tiny grill so you could make your own s&#39;mores--- not so sure it&#39;s safe to serve that to drunk people. I was surprised though that the staff didn&#39;t kick out those two drunkies though... I also think the birthday girl puked because I saw them using a lot of paper towels to clean up the floor later.

But how nice is the staff then if they don&#39;t even kick out people that drunk? I mean, sucks for them to have to put up with that shit, but that&#39;s how good their customer service is! I think they felt bad that we had to sit next to the drunkies, even though it was a good show, so they sent us some free shots. So nice of them. Love."

Too young to remember that reference? I thought so.

Henry&#39;s is one of the newer additions to the River North bar scene. I was skeptical at first to try it as I dismissed as just another trendy River North bar that caters to its twenty-something denizens.

Well, it definitely *is* that kind of place, but that doesn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t like it.

What&#39;s not to like about delicious sliders and drinkable cocktails at completely reasonable prices (especially by River North standards)?

Nothing.

A little bird who frequents this place advised me to try the &#34;Bartender&#39;s Whim&#34;  - a frozen concoction (changes daily) created by the bartender. Our server told us that it was a strawberry jalapeno margarita which sounded right up my alley. Then the server informed us that the bartender wouldn&#39;t serve it for another hour at least because it &#34;wasn&#39;t up to his standards&#34; as it hadn&#39;t frozen enough at that point. Dude&#39;s got some integrity about his cocktails. I can respect that.

Anyway, I rebounded with a Picket Fence and I enjoyed it very much. It was a lovely shade of pink and very tasty. Gin, raspberry, lemon, and kina make for a mighty-fine drink.

For sliders (there are way too many fantastic choices) I went with the fried chicken and then the spicy lamb. Both were terrific, and bigger than I thought. The chicken had a great crunch and was well-seasoned, and the lamb definitely had a spicy kick (it&#39;s nice that when something is referred to as &#34;spicy&#34; it actually delivers on the spice) which was tempered by the tzatziki. Two sliders are plenty, especially if you add a couple sides.

Which brings me to...

The portobello fries. Get these! Big fat strips of meaty portobellos in a crunchy batter. So, so good! We also got the onion rings, which were fine, if not remarkable. But whatever you do, do not miss the portobello fries.

After we finished, we wanted a little something sweet. The aforementioned little bird warned me to skip the chocolate fondue (which was hard because the server made it sound really good) and go for the s&#39;mores instead. We got the half-portion, which was plenty. They bring you several marshmallows, graham crackers, a Hershey bar of milk chocolate, and a sterno pot to toast everything. I thought it was kind of cute/funny that they bring you straight-up non-gourmet chocolate and grocery-store marshmallows completely unapologetically. There are no pretenses about what you&#39;re getting and it&#39;s refreshing.

Other than being SO loud in there that today my voice is hoarse from shouting across the table at my friend while trying to carry on a conversation, I loved Henry&#39;s. If it was this loud on a Thursday, I can&#39;t imagine the decibel level on a weekend. This is probably not the best spot for a date unless you really don&#39;t like talking to each other because you probably won&#39;t be able to hear a word either of you are saying.

My only legitimate complaint is that it&#39;s not open for lunch, but that&#39;s for purely selfish reasons."

No....I don&#39;t mean that they&#39;re down to get busy with a slew of random customers, but they are more free spirited, fun, and all around interesting than the likes of many of the entitled, &#34;I&#39;m-hot-so-I don&#39;t-have-to-be-nice-to-you&#34; wait staffers in this neighborhood. It&#39;s totally a breath of fresh air. 

Combine the staff experience with a Logan Square-like interior vibe, a menu of awesome cocktails and beers, and DMK/Fish Bar foods served tapas style and this is my new haven in an area that I normally cringe at the thought of going out in. 

Get an oyster or lamb slider, Portobello fries, and a strong cocktail. Then chat up the cool folks that bring the food your way and I dare you not to agree that this is one of the best places to hang out in River North."

We came on Saturday night around 12:30 and surprisingly found an open table to sit down at and a server helped us right away! I got the NIghtengale drink, which I wouldn&#39;t get again, but  I just prefer different flavors in my cocktails. My boyfriend ordered redbull vodkas so those are hard to screw up. 

The ambiance in this place is really cool, they have a pool table, movies on the large TV, GREAT music and a photobooth in the back corner. We didn&#39;t get to try any of the food but next time we will. Deff a good time, and a plus for not having a line or cover to get inside. 

Would have given 4 stars if I didn&#39;t spend $50 on four drinks... But hey it&#39;s Rivernorth Chicago."

We couldn&#39;t order anything from the tap because they were out of gas for the bar (how???) but ok. Our waitress was really sweet and made the best out of the situation.

For a Saturday night, it was slower, being it was slower, service should have been prompter.  Every drink took at least 10 mins to be delivered!

Second, I hate this area for going out.  D-bags abound.  Rockit, Moe&#39;s, Social, Hub, Paris.  On and on, they all suck . This place, you can actually hang out and talk and meet people who aren&#39;t total cheese.  I will definitely be coming back.  

Atmosphere: Never got too crowded, front area full of comfortable chairs, windows open to the street.  Good music, wasn&#39;t too loud.

Food:  Mostly sliders, I had the buffalo chicken, the roasted pork with kimchi, and the New Mexican natch with green chili and fried egg.  $2 and $3 each, and I was happy to pay that.  14 people in our group, the only complaint I heard out of the whole bunch was one guy wished the Kentucky Nut Brown (chicken. bacon, cheese sauce) was a sandwich sandwich instead of open-faced.  Big whoop.  If that&#39;s the worst thing that was said out of a group that size, I&#39;d say the kitchen is doing pretty well.  

Drinks:  So, over the course of the night, I had Lizard Boots, Pocket Watch, Picon Punch, Pisco Punch, Mezcal Mule, Rio Grand, Dogwood, Old Fashioned, Dandelion and Brooklyn (also had a few beers and shots, but no one needs a review of Lagunitas or Tallgrass, but I will say the selection is pretty good for being a cocktail place) and there was not a disappointment in the bunch.  If I have to pick favorites, I am going with the Mule, the Pisco and the Dandelion.  Bartenders were all friendly, seemed to know their stuff.  Seems like Henry&#39;s really tried to hire quality behind the bar.  Which leads to...

Service:  This is where they came up a little short.  Maybe we just drew the short straw that night, but our server was neither proficient nor enthusiastic.  You have to either be a really good server with an average personality or an average server with a great personality.  We got meh and meh.  Once we got done ordering food, most of us started going to the bar for drinks.  I would by no means let this influence anyone&#39;s decision, as the other servers I saw appeared to be well above meh and meh.  

Overall this place is a winner, and I applaud them for appearing to have their act together so soon after opening.  I&#39;ll definitely be going back."

While this isn&#39;t my favorite neighorbood to be in... I love DMK, so I came to check it out the night they opened.  They didn&#39;t disappoint. 

The drinks were great. I&#39;m a liquor person, so I got a few cocktails.  I started with the Pocket Watch, followed by the Picket Fence.  They were both really good.  After that I decided it was tim to move into spicy cocktail territory. I got the Killing Floor.... which was dominated by the jalapeño flavor.  I love spicy stuff, so it was perfect fit for me.  Loved the drink.

I love the sliders concept!  It&#39;s great having so many small delicious options as it gives you an opportunity to try many different things.. like tapas.  I had the sriracha oyster slider.  Didn&#39;t know what to expect, but it was great!  Tried the fried chicken slider and that was really good as well.  The only slider that I wasn&#39;t as fond of was the Elvis.  It was basically a half sandwich on rye bread.

I&#39;m still trying to decide what I thought of the decor of the place.  Dim red lighting... with those old timely restaurant candles on each table.  I do however think that it&#39;s really cool that they dedicated some real estate to a pool table in the front of the bar.

My server (Aylah) was awesome.. so friendly and also made sure to keep checking up on me.  Didn&#39;t really expect that when I walked in on an opening night. 

The prices were also really reasonable.  The few times I&#39;ve come out in this neighborhood before and paid more than $10 for a simple mixed drink.  At Henry&#39;s I was able to get craft cocktails for less than $10.  It&#39;s also really hard to spend a ton of money on food as well, as most of the items like sliders are just a few dollars.

Anyway, suffice to say, I am enamored with another one of DMK&#39;s establishments."

Sunday we finally made it in for a snack.  Had a double cheese and fries.  It was amazing!  Service was helpful and quick. As other have stated, definitely reminds me of Small Cheval - easily as good as them (though Small Cheval is delicious, it unfortunately does not hold up to the original Au Cheval).  Also, the fries - they were fresh fried and golden.  Nice and crisp!  We loved them.  

As for those who complain about price.  All the stuff is made in house - and it&#39;s grass fed beef.  Parts &amp; Labor curlyfries are limp and cold half the time, their burgers they make in house but use pork to cut down on cost (also, not trashing them, like their place its just like comparing apples and oranges on quality).

The fact is, if you want a $3 or $4 burger, go to Mel&#39;s, or just hit up corporate fast food for that matter.  If you want quality quality and deliciousness then stick with these guys in LS, and Small Cheval in WP.

The one thing I&#39;d say we would enjoy is for them to get a liquor license so we can enjoy a beer while eating!

This place is actually 5 minutes from our place and we it will now be our goto when craving a quick burger.

One of the people in the back kitchen came back to tell us she was in the bathroom then walked away. We gave him a weird look...shouldn&#39;t you step in and take our order? So he offered it up. When we asked what kind of dipping sauces they had for their fries (this is their schtick), he had absolutely no idea. We ordered, and the cashier came a few minutes later to charge us. No hello, how are you doing etc. she was busy texting/snapchatting when she finally got back to her post, and asked us a minute later what we had. Rang us up with piss poor attitude. The food finally came and they threw it on the table and walked away. Overall the service was extremely poor, and the food was bland. I can&#39;t wait to see what opens here once this place is forced to close their doors, which will not be long.

You&#39;ve got Owen and Engine, Small Cheval, Parts and Labor, and a handful of small fast food restaurants all viciously competing against one another for our burger dollars. I tried Small Fry&#39;s double burger with the works and fries to see what might set this newer place apart from the others nearby. I&#39;m sad to say that the answer is not all that much. 

The patties in the double burger weren&#39;t seared/browned in any way. Think of a grey hockey puck with a pink center, with a similar consistency. The toppings didn&#39;t add any crunch or other notable flavors. They were out of their fry seasoning add-ons at the time, and seemed to be trying to promote their &#34;awesome sauce.&#34; it&#39;s just another version of a thousand island sauce, and mostly only okay in my book. 

For positives, I will say that the fries were crispy and notably good. The service was nice for a counter service type format, and I liked the neat graffiti and punk ambiance inside the shop. It&#39;s a perk that they stay open until midnight during the week, too.

If I&#39;m in need of drunk munchies after a night out along that stretch of Milwaukee, I&#39;d consider stopping in again, but only for their fries or poutine. This place is fairly new, so maybe there&#39;s time for them to work the kinks out and improve. I hope they do so."

I visited SmallFry a couple days ago with some friends, and I ordered a single cheeseburger (I know - how boring probably) and a chocolate milkshake. The cheeseburger had a special sauce on it and was super yummy in my tummy. I would say that it is comparable to a Shake Shack burger but A TAD MORE DELICIOUS.

ALERT ALERT - There are freakin&#39; GUMMIES in their milkshakes. Yes, gummies. Well, gummies/Sour Patch Kids (I think) which are pretty much the same thing. Let me tell ya&#39;...that was quite a pleasant surprise. 

Also, back to the cooler ranch fries...they have a bunch of different seasonings and sauces for their fries, but the cooler ranch seasoning was THE BEST by far. Am I eating Doritos? Am I eating fries? Who knows!

I love all the wall art throughout the small fast casual restaurant - makes for fun looking around while you&#39;re eating.

Coolest food item at Small Fry - Their corn dog! There are actual corn pieces in the batter. Why everywhere doesn&#39;t do such a cool little trick, I don&#39;t know. For whatever reason, I feel like it makes the corn dog taste ten times better! Loved their corn dog, om nom nomz.

The burger we had seemed slightly overcooked but the flavor was tasty with their special sauce. It was oozing with ingredients! 

Triple deep fried fries sounds monstrous but they are pretty darn good. You can get seasoning with them or a dipping sauce and we did the truffle mayo dip which was the best possible option to go with the fries. I absolutely loved it and the fries were awesome dipped in it. Highly recommended!

They played good 90s alternative music the whole time we were in. This made me happy as I sang along to the songs like a freak. Their tables are soooo wide. Maybe slightly too wide because we were stretching a bit. They have one high long table, one low long table and a few counter seats along the window. Food takes a little while to come up so speed could be improved upon ever so slightly. Overall, good, cheap new addition to the &#39;hood.

And, I want a slightly lower price point, especially if the chickens aren&#39;t organic, free-range birds, as I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re not, given the lack of description as such.

The spicy chicken sandwich is buffalo style, which they should make clear, and depending, it might be hemorrhaging sauce such that the entire sandwich falls apart, making it impossible to eat. The Asian-style version was pretty bland except for the slaw.

The milkshakes are solid. Loved the cold brew, but HATED the styrofoam it was served in. Styrofoam is EVIL, find another option, or at least serve the shakes in pint glasses for those eating in."

It was honestly one of my favorite burgers I&#39;ve had in Chicago lately, and I&#39;ve tried almost all of them.
I would compare the burgers and shakes most closely to Shake Shack. They are very similar in proportion, flavors and for that matter, price. The chicken sandwich and corn dog (with homemade corn, jalapeño batter) are really great too. 

It IS a tad on the pricey side for what it is. And not unlike Shake Shack, the burgers are on the smaller side.
 Order a double if you&#39;re hungry, because it&#39;s not that big. Not like Portillos or Au Cheval size doubles. The prices compare to those, but this also isn&#39;t downtown off the Mag Mile, or the West Loop. However, I don&#39;t mind paying a little more if it&#39;s really good.
 The shake was unexpectedly good, and I am picky about hand scooped shakes.

I&#39;m only leaving one star off because both times I&#39;ve been in, though not busy, it&#39;s been pretty a little slow. (After the first experience, we were comped a free meal, so not a big deal. And it redeemed itself. )
Also, maybe we could use a little more in the way of accoutrements. Like more than one roll of paper towels for the whole place to use. Or a ketchup and mustard bottle on the counter, just in case. The little things."

Based on the positive reviews thus far, something must have been going wrong when we came to visit yesterday, July 22. The place was not extraordinarily busy, yet from the time my friends and I placed our order, it took about 35 minutes for all of us to get our food. 

The food also came out over a span of 20 minutes rather than all at the same time. What resulted was one friend who was nearly completely done with her meal when my other friend was just getting his food. Yes, she could have waited, but we urged her to eat, because honestly, not much is worse than a cold burger and cold fries.

The food was actually pretty good -- it is just a shame that it took so long to get and we couldn&#39;t all enjoy it at the same time. I understand that SmallFry is still a newer restaurant, so they are still working out the kinks, but honestly, with a such limited menu (cheeseburger, veggie burger, chicken sandwich, poutine, fries and shakes), it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to pump out food in less than 20 minutes, and all at the same time."

I get it. Sometimes a new business needs the help of some friends in order to boost their &#34;cred.&#34; But this is unbelievable. 

This place is a total ripoff. The food itself isn&#39;t bad but it&#39;s certainly nothing out of the range of mediocre. A cheeseburger is $6 and a double will run you $9. A chicken sandwich will cost you $8 and - keep in mind - none of these come with fries. So make sure you tack on another $3 for a small order of fries. 

The cheeseburger itself (despite these bogus pictures on Yelp) are roughly the size of a Wendy&#39;s Jr Cheeseburger. They also taste very similar to a Wendy&#39;s Jr Cheeseburger, except these are running $6 instead of 99 cents.

So what does this all mean? It means that the self-labeled late night greasy burger joint of Logan Square doesn&#39;t even let you out the door for under $10. A cheeseburger, fries, and a drink is $10 BEFORE TAX and that doesn&#39;t include any of the seasonings or sauces they tote. At these prices, why not just go to Small Cheval and get a significantly more bang for your buck?

Maybe I was there on a bad night - maybe not. But it only took one time to get scammed out of $26 before I&#39;ve decided not to return. Again, there was nothing particularly bad about the food, but to charge $10+ for a Happy Meal is a joke. Apparently people will pay literally anything just to say they&#39;ve been to the new, trendy joint."

I asked about the veggie burger and it sounds like the main protein is beans and farro along with around 30 other ingredients. I got the veggie burger with cheese and although it falls apart pretty easily, it tastes amazing. The cheeseburger tasted like an upscale mcd&#39;s hamburger. Onions, pickles, sauce and patties but all better than a standard fast food joint. Looking forward to trying the milkshakes and chicken sandwiches. Definitely going back. 

I would recommend lowering the lighting slightly (if they are on a dimmer) to accentuate the christmas lights on the ceiling and allow the green neon to give the place more of a beetlejuice lounge feel. Love the floating shark and casual vibe in here."

Issues:

Soggy buns
Overcooked fries
Little seasoning on cheeseburger meat, but awesome sauce is a good concept. 
Chicken sandwich was soggy and not crispy as other reviewers have said about their sandwiches
Downright pricy!!! 

If I am paying $6+ for a sandwich it should be well done and well presented. 

Alas, my first and my last. This is a place to go when you&#39;re drunk off your head. 

Farewell SmallFry

smallfry-chicago-8,William S.,T4v7qgTIhDFoDYxTMus5Yw,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,0,7,LteFjVuPYASRmbQGw7G46A,3.0,2016-08-20,"The positive: The food was good.  I would say it&#39;s on the level of Small Cheval or Parts and Labor.  It&#39;s not better than either of those, but not demonstrably worse.  The burger was solid, without a lot of extras getting in the way of the bun and the beef.  That said, I like some extras if done right, but this was definitely a burger I would order again, and the fries were very good as well.  

The negative: A little pricey compared the combo at Parts and Labor.  A few bucks extra for the combo, especially considering you get a soda instead of a beer.  The person who took our order, a perfectly nice guy, apparently dropped our ticket and took a half hour to get our food.  People who arrived after us received and finished their meals before we got ours.  In his defense, he offered to give us our money back, but mistakes happen, and we didn&#39;t want him to lose any money over it.  Still, we were hungry and frustrated.  And it was pretty slow when we went in, so it should have been kind of obvious that the kitchen guys weren&#39;t cooking anything while there were people sitting without any food.  

Bottom line, the food was good.  If I lived within a five minute walk or so, I could see going there quite often.  We live a little further away, and have at least one burger joint that&#39;s just as good, much closer, and cheaper. Difference maker might be their Poutine, which looked terrific, but we didn&#39;t order.  It&#39;s a burger place, and for our first visit, we wanted a burger.  Maybe next time."

The spicy chicken sandwhich was smothered in really solid habanero sauce. Also got the Korean BBQ seasoned fries, completely hit the spot. Really cool vibe in there with really nice employees. Excited to have a cheap option for a quick bite. Also it&#39;s BYOB so the perfect spot for a good night cap."

Came in with a group of friends and ordered one of just about everything on the menu to try.

Service: guy was nice but very slow. Brought food out in sections. Also, asked for ketchup and was given 2 small containers for 2 burgers and 2 orders of fries. Asked for more and got a strange look and was given only one more for the two of us eating.

The cheeseburger and fries were pretty good, but not great.  I just don&#39;t necessarily agree with the value of what you pay for and what you get.  I don&#39;t mind paying for great food that would bring me back time and time again BUT I think their prices should be a bit more reflective of what you&#39;re getting.  SmallFry seems to be trying to get into the niche of fast casual trendy gourmet burgers, but it falls short of that. In my opinion, they don&#39;t beat out Five Guys on price, quantity, or quality and that&#39;s a shame.  If they are in business 1 year from now, I would be surprised by that news if they don&#39;t change something and make improvements to earn repeat business.

The veggie burger is ok - small but the bun is tasty. The texture was a little crumbly, which didn&#39;t bother me too much but is a little annoying because it means it&#39;s a little messy to eat. The only thing I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of was the pickled slaw on top of the veggie burger. If you&#39;re gonna order it, I&#39;d suggest nixing the slaw and adding cheese if you&#39;re not vegan.

Burger was perfectly sized for a meal that is not going to leave you in a food coma at the end. Cooked so that it was still juicy and the signature house sauce is fantastic. The crowning jewel was the fries though. I chronically leave about half of my fries uneaten at restaurants, but this is not the case for fries coated in the delicious dorito inspired cooler ranch seasoning. Ate every last scrap of fried potato goodness and then processed to empty the rest of the seasoning in the bottom into my mouth in true dorito bag fashion.

I&#39;d stick to fries if you aren&#39;t a meat eater unless you&#39;ve got a big appetite.

The fries are legit,if heavy on the grease. They were a little too heavy for me, but that&#39;s as advertised and would probably be lovely after a night at the bar. Crispy and soft, and a decent portion size. I was disappointed that there was no ketchup? I understand they&#39;re trying to push their sauces, and I believe they had an in-house BBQ for an upcharge, but if I&#39;m coming somewhere for the fries, I&#39;d like the option for just some Heinz ketchup. Everything doesn&#39;t have to be artisanal and hand-crafted when it comes to a burger and fries. 

Which is kind of the odd thing about this joint - it sells itself as simple grab and go/late night indulgent food, right down to its pegboard menu. But the prices are a bit high ($6-7 for burger alone) and the details slightly elaborate and expensive ($2 for cheese - but its house-made American [why?]). Its kind of like shake shack pricing without the same payoff. 

That said, the fries are quite good, the staff was nice, and the food was hot and came out pretty fast. I wish I was eating beef to give the burger a try, although I think the food in general is a little too heavy to be a regular stop."

I&#39;m slightly biased because one my roommates works there, but even that doesn&#39;t explain why I go there ~3x a week. The fries are amazing, burger&#39;s on point, and shakes are ridiculous. And they&#39;re apparently experimenting with using cereal milk(like milk that&#39;s had cereal in it) to make shakes, which I&#39;m pretty sure I thought of when I was like 6.

The customer service is fantastic, the guys working the counter are happy to walk patrons through the menu and willing to give advice. The staples are chicken sandwiches, served one of three ways, cheeseburgers, single or double, a veggie burger, and of course hand cut fries with a great selection of seasonings and sauces. 

Went with the chicken sandwich, served bahn mi style. In spite on what the hater said below, the bun was soft and ridiculously fresh and the fried chicken was extremely crispy and juicy. The slaw, house made pickle, and sauce put this up there with the best chicken sandwiches in Chicago.

The fries are perfect -- crispy, hot and golden brown. The cooler ranch seasoning is a fun change of pace and the awesome sauce is exactly what you&#39;d expect, awesome. 

The vibe in this place is incredible, from the dudes working the counter, to the local art on the wall, to the 10 foot great white hanging above the tables.

I asked for the fries to be double fried as opposed triple as I don&#39;t like them super crispy. Like the burger,  they came out perfect. Finally, I tried the Vanilla shake again.

Definitely a South American vibe on the menu including Peruvian style rice. The garlic bread sticks are a delicious side dish and the mashed potatoes as well. 
Was not too crazy about the wings but it&#39;s nice to try them with all the different sauces they offer. Staff was friendly and the facilities very clean. I thought the prices were a bit high for what they are offering. $14.75 plus tax for a half chicken with 2 sides.  A little much for a fast casual restaurant where you have to stand in line to order."

I have to be honest and say that the staff here is really sad. I&#39;m not mad at them but I&#39;m furious at the management for not properly training them about customer service. If you want to see perfect customer service wall across the courtyard here to the Canadian based restaurant on the ground level. It is like worlds apart. 

When you walk into a restaurant the staff can make or break a location. It&#39;s the difference between me ever coming back again or never setting foot in here again. The two workers behind the counter were very unhappy and didn&#39;t even want to be there. 

I almost wanted to leave but I had already placed my order. I ordered a half of chicken and they pulled my chicken from a metal container full of precooked chicken. I understand that grilled chicken properly done takes a while to cook but when I see the process they use here I feel like I&#39;m eating a frozen dinner or leftovers. Honestly I could do this at home if I wanted reheated chicken. 

The restaurant was not crowded at all. There was a single table of 4 people dinning. The room is huge but very dark. It felt very depressing and I was glad that I was carrying out. At least I could enjoy my chicken in a happy place...my home. 

When ordering my chicken the girl at the counter scared me about the level of heat. I decided to go with medium and I&#39;m not happy I did. Medium was more like mild. For all I know, I didn&#39;t even get the right sauce. The cook threw my pre cooked chicken on the grill and walked away. The cashier made several comments to him about my grilling chicken. He didn&#39;t respond or even come over to check on my chicken. She then picked up a spatula and flipped my chicken. She then took the spatula and pressed it hard against my chicken on the grill. I cried a little as I watched all of the juice from my chicken run into the flames of the grill. When I saw this I was kind of done with this place. Are they trying to be fast food? Because they are acting like it. 

I think this franchise is growing too fast without the proper staff or managers in place. I don&#39;t see them making it long term. There are too many places that cook fresh food with fantastic amazing customer service. This place isn&#39;t one of them. 

I haven&#39;t even talked about the chicken. It was okay. I honestly make better seasoned grilled chicken at home. I probably won&#39;t come back here unless I&#39;m trapped in group fun and everyone is making me come here. I&#39;ll do my best to redirect them across the way. It would be even better if we went to the grocery store at New City and let them grill our meat because at least it would start out raw and fresh. 

I never like writing a bad review but with an unfriendly staff and precooked warmed up chicken I would rather spend my money elsewhere with a business that appreciates good service and great food."

I had heard great things about Nandos but the food seriously exceeded my expectations. I got the half chicken and peri chips (suggested under their first-timer section) with lemon herb sauce. While waiting for my food, I went and sampled some of the sauces and all of them were insanely flavorful. The sauce isn&#39;t too think but not too funny, and the lemon one that I got to go with my food had a slight kick to it, but was still a perfect balance of lemon (but not too sour) and herb (but not overwhelming). 
My chicken was cooked to perfection, the skin was flavorful, the meat was tender, and you got tons of it too. The peri chips (fries) were crispy and I absolutely loved the seasoning. Without the food even, the decorations and interior are really cool, and the upbeat music they play makes you want to stay and hang out even when the meal is over. Great meal, I&#39;ll be back!"

I tend to skip a restaurant if I can&#39;t figure out how to order. That&#39;s the reason I&#39;ve never returned to Baja Fresh. But Nando&#39;s makes it easy and even assigns you a table, which I thought was weird at first. But it does control diners better and prevents the two person party from taking up a booth designed for four. I had the chicken breast wrap with medium spice with peri chips. I also opted for extra chicken in the wrap. The wrap was quite tasty with just the right amount of spice. Love the peri chips but didn&#39;t care for the peri mayo on the side.

Menu is fairly large so I&#39;m looking forward to going back and trying more items. Overall, a great somewhat quick lunch spot."

In a nutshell: Walk in and get seated by a host(ess), with a number on a stick matching a table number. Sit down with menus and decide what you want. Go order and pay at the counter, telling them your table number (you don&#39;t give them the stick, that goes in the holder on the table). When your food is ready, it will be brought out to your table. When you&#39;re done, simply leave.

Now that we have that out of the way, I have only tried a couple things here, but the food is pretty good. On my first visit I had a boneless chicken breast which was tasty, but the skin was soggy and not appetizing, so I picked it off. The description on the menu said the skin would be crispy. The chicken thigh sandwich (Thigh and Mighty) was quite good (it comes with &#34;PERinaise&#34;, their mayo-based special sauce.. I say skip it, it doesn&#39;t add anything but unneeded calories). The macho peas, which I&#39;ve had twice, are great and just a bit spicy.

They do serve alcohol, though I&#39;ve not partaken. They have Coke freestyle machines, which may be the best part!

It can be hard to find this place; while the inside is spacious, the entrance is narrow and tucked in a corner, next to the King Bowl entrance. There are a few tables outside as well."

You will be in for a treat, for sure. I ordered it as medium spicy, but you can order it to your liking. The rice was a great choice as the side cuz it was very flavorful and different, but I think I would have enjoyed some garlic bread or corn as well.

My boyfriend got the wings and loved, loved them. I got to taste the butternut squash and also really good. The best thing is that Nandos has so many hot sauce choices, so I basically tried every one to see which went best with my meal. The verdict? Wild herb. Delissh.

Love the decor, love the music. They also validate parking, so wins all around!"

Beginning with my first exposure to Nando&#39;s in the UK in 2011, I was a fan. A chain that specializes in elevating chicken to something juicy and flavorful without deep-frying it? It seems too good to be true, but it is the real deal. 

I&#39;m embarrassed to say that I find the medium-hot almost too hot, since I&#39;m a fan of spicy food! But I always try a bit of the hot sauce to test my limits :) 

The sides are great, too. I also love the atmosphere at every Nando&#39;s I&#39;ve been to - very cool interiors. My friend does not love spicy food and found her meal slightly spicy, but she still liked it, as she did her sangria."

Place was busy of course on opening week and so awesome that they teamed up with After School Matters, donating 100% of the proceeds!

While the line was long, it moved quickly. Super well staffed, friendly, and efficient.

As noted in my other review, they are almost full service. They give you a table number and you order your food at the front and they bring it out to you. You also grab sauces, utensils, etc. at the self-serve area. However, the staff will check up on you and will certainly get these things for you if you forget. 

I got the half chicken in extra hot sauce with macho peas and corn on the cob. Food came out pretty quickly. Gosh, their chicken is sooooo good. So much flavor and so juicy. While it is spicy, it has so many other flavors going on. It doesn&#39;t even need additional sauces. Didn&#39;t think peas could be anything spectacular but proven wrong here. Drizzled some of that garlic sauce on my corn on the cob and I was elated. 

Pretty good value imo in terms of quantity and quality relative to the price.

Love the atmosphere here as the décor makes you feel like you are in South Africa and definitely feel the Portuguese flare to it. Great place honestly for any occasion. 

Nando&#39;s is one of my top go-tos.

It was just one of *those* restaurants you miss when you move to a new city.  

Well, great news.  Nando&#39;s has followed me here to the Windy City.  &#39;Tis true.  They opened a location in Lakeview, West Loop, this one, and as of about two days ago, a location in the Loop.  Yay.  Nando&#39;s Sauce is back in maaaaa life.  

I&#39;ve visited all of the location except the newest Loop location and they&#39;re all darling.  

This one is large, warm, welcoming, clean, bright, beautiful, unique and creative in true Nando&#39;s fashion.  I took lots of pics (for yoouuuu, yelp) of the dining room.  The colors are fun and bright and it&#39;s just a happy artsy place.  We dined on Saturday night around 7-7:30 PM during the first snow storm of the season and it wasn&#39;t crowded but I hope it will soon get busy and buzzin&#39; soon.  Line out the door, yo!  You&#39;re all gonna want some Nando&#39;s Sauce!  Everybody say it with me now, &#34;Nando&#39;s Sauce!&#34; 

We had an exceptionally friendly waiter, the chicken was delicious as always (juicy as always) and the garlic bread was buttery as always (two sticks of butter per piece of bread is the recipe, I think...yesm).  The garlic mashed potatoes were melt in your mouth creamy delicious.  

They have the usual suspects too, like nuts, corn, fries, wings, and somewhat boring plain desserts and they have those fancy soda dispensers (I don&#39;t drink soda but had way too much fun pressing the touch screen buttons!!!).  

Okay kids, go to Nando&#39;s Peri Peri.  It&#39;s good stuff.  All my friends in DC, we love us some Nando&#39;s Peri Peri.  The SAUCE!  (My fave is the lemon).

After dinner, you can wander around this darling little plaza.  There is a parking garage (not sure if they validate your parking ticket)."

The chicken was INCREDIBLY over-cooked. It was absolutely disgusting--so chewy and tough, it was almost inedible.

The &#34;hot sauce&#34; on the chicken had no flavor whatsoever.

Both the french fries and chicken were completely cold when I got them.

It&#39;s a bit hard to find initially as it&#39;s tucked into the &#34;New City&#34; conglomerate, but there&#39;s a clean and bright welcome once you do. My gal pals and I had a fun round table near the door and we happily ordered our food and sat down to wait for the delicious chicken to reach our grubby little hands. The staff was extremely helpful in helping the newbies order and settle in by bringing us forgotten silverware and sauces. 

I tried the lemon herb chicken for the first time and was delighted to find that this is a bit spicy as well. The potatoes are still one of my favorite sides and I tried my friend&#39;s custard-filled pastry and found that dessert is a must here as well. A friend brought her toddler and was happy to discover they have a children&#39;s menu as well, with unlimited yogurt! I will undoubtedly be returning to this and all of the other locations.

Food: 
Chicken - Tasty and grilled perfectly. Served as is, I think it needed more sauce, but luckily there was plenty on the side. 
Peas - I&#39;ve never had peas like this before, and they were sooooo good! They had a lot of flavor and had a slight crunch on them.
Liver - Don&#39;t let the name scare you, this was by far my favorite dish of the night! It was SO flavorful and served in a hearty gravy. 
Naughty Natas - this is like a deep fried chinese egg tart with puff pastry for the crust. i never knew this was a thing before coming here and now I want it all day every day. 

Service was quick and the food was very affordable. They offer a MYRIAD of sauces, some better than others, but I appreciate the variety. My favorite was the spicy garlic - I was pouring that ish on everything."

It has it&#39;s own parking garage which is nice in the bad weather but it&#39;ll cost you a couple dollahs - be sure to validate!

The Nando&#39;s way -
1. Let the team know how many are in your party &amp; they&#39;ll assign you a table.
2. Get in line/look at a menu
3. Order at the register.
4. Get your fountain drink, find your table, chill out.
5. Servers deliver your food.
6. Eat and enjoy! Wahlah!

It&#39;s a little different than other spots, but it&#39;s nice not having to worry about holding tables and all that nonsense. Staff is all incredibly friendly and very accommodating, willing to help with anything you need!

I&#39;m way weak with spice and Nando&#39;s is not exactly for my kind of weak-blooded peoples. The spice is strong with this one! Even the most mild flavor still had my mouth on fire so I sadly think I&#39;m going to have to stick to plain &amp; then pile on my own flavors. Even the fries are spicy! You must get the mayo with the fries...because mayo makes everything better! Love their mushy peas but those too have some kick to them thanks to chili! All that being said, the chicken is quite yummy, all ingredients are fresh and no dry meat here! Their Natas dessert is nice and served warm, but I&#39;ve had a much better version of the Portuguese tart at Fat Rice so there&#39;s no looking back from that.

Prepare your tastebuds for an explosion of spice and flavor &amp; head over to Nando&#39;s PERi-PERi to try chicken the Portuguese South African way!"

Like the previous reviewer said, &#34;I&#39;m getting sick and tired of these &#34;hostesses&#34; and their flippant attitudes!  Right on bro, it&#39;s Nando&#39;s Peri Peri way of training... hire anybody off the street, pay them minimum wage, make sure the customers pay first before tasting the food or getting any service so nobody skips out without paying!!!

When I placed my order with the dippy cashier/manager I got fake-nice responses to questions I asked about the menu, especially about the sauces.  It seemed as though this was her first day on the job and I was her first customer ever. Kind of like, the glass half empty or half full.  

So what kind of service did I get..... the server brought out the meal and that was the last I saw of him!  There&#39;s no can I get you anything, there&#39;s no bringing water to your table, they don&#39;t show you where all the extra sauces are, the extra butter, etc.  I had to get up twice and ask where the butter was, it&#39;s carefully hidden AWAY from the condiment section.  Once again, that dippy manager seemed beside herself when I asked where she moved the butter. 

Although the chicken I ordered was tasty, it was puny.  I&#39;ve never had a half a chicken before that was more like a few pieces of wings.  It&#39;s not filling.... and this is from someone that doesn&#39;t eat large portions.  The corn on the cob was good, but that was it.  After I left Nando&#39;s I was STILL hungry! 

The END -- After leaving (hungry) I passed by the cooking area and all of a sudden these mini bottles came flying out of nowhere almost hitting me.  So what does dippy manager say, NOTHING, ignoring it like it didn&#39;t happen and walking away.  When I confronted her she pretends not to hear me and then I yelled at her reminding her what just happened and she just walks away, no apology, nothing!  Are you kidding me?  Who hired her?  I&#39;ll be talking to the general manager about this location.

This place is a joke.  No wonder no one was eating there."

however, my experience at this specific nando&#39;s was SO HORRIBLE.

i walked in to pick up my take-out order. I had to pay for parking bc there wasn&#39;t any free parking available at the time - but i was willing to pay in order to get the yummy food!

the host greeted me, took my money and I asked how long it would take because my order confirmation had said 7p. He then walked to the back (restaurant was practically empty, mind you!) - came back and said &#34;they ran out of chicken..&#34; - no follow up of what that meant or what I should do.. he barely made eye contact and shrugged his shoulders. i then explained to him that my confirmation said that my food would be ready by a certain time to which he said &#34;i&#39;m just the messenger!&#34; and walked away.. 

at 7:02 (which, is totally fine, time wise to me.. i am not picking at a 2 min delay in food!!) - the manager himself comes out hands me my food and mutters under his breath &#34;7 o&#39; clock on the dot!&#34; with attitude and walked away. 

first: you don&#39;t tell your customers you&#39;re out of the food you specialize in AFTER their order has been accepted WITHOUT an explanation like &#34;but they are getting more&#34; or &#34;we apologize for the wait, it may be just a little longer&#34; 

second: don&#39;t passive-aggressively mutter something under your breath when it was YOUR employee who told your customer that you &#34;ran out of chicken&#34; 

all this to say - customer service was horrendous. I did not appreciate their service and unkind gestures. It was enough to make me never want to go back to their restaurant. it&#39;s sad - because the food is pretty amazing.."

This fast casual spot offers tasty chicken dishes with the famous and tasty PERi-PERI sauce. I ordered 1/4 of a chicken breast (on the bone) with two sides for around $10. For sides, I tried the macho peas (peas with a delicious mint and chili sauce) and the garlic mashed potatoes. Both were delicious! You can order your food with mild, medium, hot, or extra hot spices. I love spicy food, and the medium was definitely spicy enough for me. You can also grab tons of extra free sauce bottles to bring to your table while you eat. Will definitely be back!"

My friend was hungry and wanted to try this place. The seating is confusing and complicated for no reason....just let people sit where they want! I got the chicken sandwich plain and the mashed potatoes...it was alright. My friend got the 1/4 chicken and rice...he ate it all despite confusing their mustard sauce for not being spicy...which it was. Again, I think these brand is alright but I am not going to run back here again. It will do if you are not into the other places in this center."

My husband has gone to the other location for lunch several times and raves about it so I wanted my turn! 

Guys. It was so good. The chicken was well seasoned but still tender, and the sides are delicious. The butternut squash one I went home and immediately googled how to recreate it at home (it won&#39;t be quite the same without adding a few dashes of their yummy sauces but will do in a crunch!) The garlic bread sandwich my hubby had looked even better so that will be my next try. In terms of the flavoring, I found even the Lemon Herb to have some heat so if you don&#39;t like spice I would stick with the lowest level!

The only downfall was the sangria. It seemed like wine with sparking water or something bubbly added, then fruit added as an afterthought. Not impressed, and it wasn&#39;t cheap either! I heard another table discuss this with a worker too, so maybe it will improve. 

Another potential worry is about parking when all of the businesses open (especially Marianos!) and parking is paid so be sure to ask for validation to reduce the price down to $2 for us when we ate there, if you do carry out and leave right away it might be free with validation, maybe?? I also just foresee lots of trouble with the paying to park situation in general here but we&#39;ll see how it goes! It&#39;s also a short walk from the red line North Clybourn stop so that&#39;s an option :)

Oh and there&#39;s patio seating! Woohoo!"

I didn&#39;t love the chocolate spoon cake as much as I expected but it was fine.

We arrived here for lunch and were seated promptly. The restaurant is beautifully decorated. You get a few sauces at your table to try out, which I liked. You order your food at the register and the servers bring it to your table. I personally liked the food because it was very flavorful. Ordererd a lemon chicken wrap with a side of rice. The rice was good but needed just a touch more seasoning. 

My first qualm about this place, was a lack of menu options. 

Second complaint, was for my credit card being charged twice for one meal. I saw a double charge on my bank statement and had to call the restaurant about this matter. 

Overall I still enjoyed the food and atmosphere here, so I&#39;ll give this place another try if I&#39;ll be in the area. Cash only this time."

Despite first impressions, this is not a sit down restaurant, but actually a kind of &#34;serve yourself&#34; place. Even more convenient place to fill up on delicious food if you are seeing a movie after; you know, to avoid buying the rip off $7.00 barrels of popcorn from ArcLight theatre.

My party and I shared the chicken sampler which came with two sides. The deal is, like I said, you order from the counter and then sit anywhere you like. Oh, and for drinks, you go over to a drink station which has every kind of soft drink, fruit juice or tea you want. I had a meltdown when I saw they had Mr. Pibb (didn&#39;t know that was even made anymore) because I had sworn off soft drinks for years. Update: I had 5 glasses of Mr. Pibb here. :-O And there are free refills!! And while you&#39;re over there, pick up the four sauces to top your chicken with (Hot, garlic, herb, lemon.) 

Now for the chicken....it is DELICIOUS. Tender, fall off the bone tender! Now get busy and douse it with one of the awesome sauces and you&#39;ve just entered HEAVEN. Service people are pleasant and efficient!"

The restaurant&#39;s ambiance is the first captivator because it had fantastic Afro/Latin beats pumping around the clock and a fantastic design and color scheme.  Beautiful wooden seating under dim lighting with color and fabrics everywhere, made for a sensory experience.  This location in particular is beautiful.

Now onto the food!  Not expecting fire-griled chicken, I chose the double chicken wrap special.  It arrived in a large wrap with clear grill marks on it.  The wrap was stuffed with fantastically marinated and cooked chicken with a hefty amount of romaine lettuce and sauce.  The chicken spice I chose was the Lemon Herb, lower on the heat scale, but the flavor was slightly acidic, a well balanced savory level and a delightful flare of heat here and there.  It was a heat that reminded you of its presence occasionally, but never overwhelmed you.  The wrap was coupled with fresh romaine and a nice peri-style sauce.  The wrap would have benefitted from more veggies though, great base ingredients but the flavors demand more textures (crunch).  The &#34;chips&#34; were perfectly cooked and well seasoned with a hint of spice.  Honestly some of the best fries I&#39;ve had and the peri-sauce was a great addition (who need ketchup!).  I look forward to returning to sample the larger menu.

Nando&#39;s also offered great service with a friendly and attentive staff.  Now my final reason for 5 Stars... they had a handsink in the dining room, right next to the beverage and silverware station!  I know that doesn&#39;t sound like much but the former-health-inspector in me appreciates the role of hand washing and raising its accessibility like this (in a casual and well designed way) is extremely important.  I&#39;ve never seen that and can&#39;t wait to see that design element spread.  Saúde!"

First off the service was really good.  Very welcoming  staff and when I asked for suggestions they were happy to give them.

I had the half chicken with two sides, those being garlic bread and fries.  I ordered my chicken hot and it had a lot of flavor.  The sides were great.  My mouth was not on fire but there was a nice lingering heat.  My friend had a chicken sandwich and he said it was one of the best he&#39;s had.  He also had the mashed potatoes which were really tasty.

The peri peri sauces are great, I sampled a little of each and I must say the garlic one was my favorite, so much so I bought a bottle to take home. 

Great decor and a big mix of people for a Tuesday night, lots of ethnicities and great African-Esque house music.  We will be back!!"

The manager came over 3 times to make sure that we knew we had to pay for them. He had his hostess interrupt our dinner to bring us a bill and ask if we were ready to pay for the sauces, total $11.04 while we had food in our hands! We told her we would pay for them after we ate. The second my husband took his last bite, the manager came over with a second receipt asking us to pay for the sauces!

We were told they would comp the parking fee but when we left, they only stamped the ticket for $6.00 and parking was $8.00. We are seasoned adults and were completely insulted that the wait staff who are probably 20 years our junior, thought we would steal 2 bottle of sauce that they had on display!

substantial options for us veggies in the land of the famous chicken, thank you. i&#39;ve had nando&#39;s overseas and have thoroughly enjoyed their veggie burger. i should&#39;ve stuck to that. i branched out and tried the veggie wrap and it tasted like pickled goat cheese on a wheat tortilla. it also tasted like it came straight from the refrigerator. not what i was after. the mushy peas are the best, however, especially because i just don&#39;t care for their fries - not crispy and too chunky. also, the glorified bread sticks are exactly how they are described. it&#39;s toast, people. pass.
my friend loved her chicken breast and was intrigued by the different sauces. we both loved the laid back atmosphere with wine/beer offerings - perfect set-up right before our movie. pretty sure the management was there from overseas probably to get this new location off the ground. hoping the remarkable service remains once they leave!"

She asked how many for a table and we said we called for carry out. I was in the middle of explaining that she left us on hold for so long, but she completely ignored me and just moved on to the next customer.

Almost couldn&#39;t find the place because it&#39;s so small and they didn&#39;t have a sign. I asked if they just opened,  but the lady said they&#39;ve been open for a few months. 

Was very good...fresh and juicy made with Chinese broccoli! I get so upset when places make it with American broccoli...yuck! This place serves it with a hot sauce which I&#39;ve never seen before. I didn&#39;t eat it though because I like the sweetness of the pad si ew and didn&#39;t want to ruin it by burning my mouth up! Just wish they gave bigger portions because I like leftovers. 

It&#39;s very small... you get your own utensils, water, and clean the dishes off the table so there&#39;s really no service.  The only con was they didn&#39;t have a bathroom and I like to wash my hands before I eat so that&#39;s not very good. Plus if I had to go to the bathroom, they recommended starbucks a block away lol. 

Overall, cute little place. More for take-out though."

Amongst the sweaty vendors, fragrant flowers and tourists who were ruining my lunch hour..I found Rock n Roll noodles. A perfectly quaint vendor with lunch to go, Anna was slinging pad thai, pad see ew and various other dishes with ease. The pad thai was ****/****

Check the address, not the map!

I was happy with my visit to Rock &#39;n&#39;Roll Noodle Company for lunch this afternoon.  The location is great (right under the Montrose brown line station, and near the Industrial corridor on Ravenswood for all of the office drones to come by) and the decor is fun and funky.

The owner, Anna, was behind the counter herself, taking orders and running back to the kitchen.  It was a little hectic with the lunch rush, but not bad, and you always get a break when you&#39;ve only been open for 2 weeks.  I misread one of the menu items and ordered incorrectly, and Anna insisted on comping it even though the misunderstanding was ultimately my fault - I tried to pay, honest!  She was super nice.

The food was overall very good - stand-outs included the super-tasty egg roll and the pad kee mao, which comes with skirt steak.  Order it spicy! My coworkers who ordered the pad thai did say that it was strangely bland and one-note - perhaps it was an off day, or maybe it&#39;s just better to order more adventurously off the menu!  Also, be sure to grab one of the cane-sugar sodas for a bubbly pick-me-up.  Or, the thai iced coffee looked amazing too.

I am definitely looking forward to coming back and trying the massamun curry (made with beef cheek) and the incredible-sounding rice pudding."

We came during opening week, on a Saturday afternoon. 

The dining room walls are covered with hand painted murals and a cool decoupage area, great for I Spy with the kids while waiting for your food.  Vintage cash register and music played from a record player round out the atmosphere.  

The highlight of our day was of course the food.  We ordered lemongrass chicken, basil chicken, massamun curry, pad thai, fresh pad thai spring roll, fried rice, and sticky rice pudding.  My 2 favorites were the basil chicken and the sticky rice pudding.  Wonderful!

The chef / owner Anna Abbey checked on us and chatted for a while.  Another member of the kitchen staff came out and was also really sweet.  

We left with full, happy bellies and even a few leftovers. We are looking forward to returning and eating our way through the rest of the menu.  If you are not into sticky rice pudding, Margie&#39;s is across the street.  I&#39;ll take the pudding over ice cream any day!"

The food was good. I tried the Pad Thai dish on my first visit. They use an interesting rice type noodle that you don&#39;t see a lot on this dish. This paired with a can of Hansens soda and tip was $20! I&#39;m not saying the food isn&#39;t better than competing Thai places, it is....but not double the price, especially when it&#39;s order at the counter.

The decor is cute and gives it a definite sense of place. Great that it&#39;s right off the train. 

I might come back and bring a friend to try it out again, but I wish the prices were a little more competitive."

Think of it as a guide from a customer that could lead to future sucess. A yellow brick road where you might encounter some Lions, Tigers, and Bears but eventually you end up seeing the Great Wizard.

There were some very imperfect parts of my dining experience that I think could be improved with a little time and experience. Starting with service. I was there for quite some time maybe an hour or so and outside of when they initially brought me the food I never heard from them again. That didn&#39;t seem to be the case with the other review so there seems to be some inconsistency. The plasticware in my opinion should be replaced with silverware. I just think it  makes things  little more legitimate. Plasticware works at the farmers market but it shouldn&#39;t be present at a legitimate Thai spot. The idea of using Mashed Potatoes as an option with Massannamon Curry is brilliant, I love it. However by the time my food came out the potatoes were barely luke warm even somewhat cold in spots. Being a Mashed Potatoe fan I know how quickly they can cool off. There has got to be a way to keep them hot when they arrive at your table. Lastly my Curry dish along with a Thai Iced Coffee was almost $20 a little steep for a casual spot in Ravenswood. Again I am not critiquing my experience I&#39;m just pointing out a few things that could improve as they begin their what hopes to be a successful journey. 

The good points include an extremely flavorful bowl of Curry. A very interesting flavor combination made everything dance in my mouth. The Mashed Potatoes is a brilliant alternative to rice. The sounds of Motown provided an interesting and comfortable vibe. 

Overall I understand it&#39;s just their first week open so imperfections are bound to happen. Hopefully I provided a few areas where they could improve. I do love to support mom-and-pop spots and so much want them to be successful. I will be back and encourage as many people as possible to check them out and support them."

I had the lemongrass chicken bowl on a bed of greens and a Thai iced coffee.  The bowl on a bed of greens was basically a salad with very good portions of meat, herbs, and pickled veggies.

Food - I ordered a noodle dish (the one with sweet potato noodles) and it was completely bland.  I finally asked for some hot sauce (I was surprised the standards were not on the tables or out by the water)

Another reviewer commented about the plastic utensils - I found them tacking since I was eating In.

Owner / waitstaff / employees - I went got a late lunch on a weekday.  When I got there only one other customer was there. He was standing at the counter speaking to the other but not about the food.  This went on a while &amp; it took her a while to barely acknowledge my presence &amp; take my order.  There was at least three &#34;employees&#34; there but not one picked up the garbage at a vacant table until a couple came in and asked if the table was occupied.  I also got the privilege of hearing one of the employees Skype conversation (both ends of the conversation). Super annoying &amp; unprofessional I found it.

We absolutely LOVED it and loved their array of hot sauces. 

We ended up getting the whole chicken with two large sides. We got the hottest choice they had, and it wasn&#39;t as hot as they claimed, but still delicious! We love heat, though, and honestly it wasn&#39;t spicy or hot at all. It tasted like normal chicken with spices.

The side that I chose was the rice, and while it was decent, it wasn&#39;t anything amazing. The mashed potatoes were pretty good, though! They looked bland to me, but it packed a lot of flavor!! I really want to try the coleslaw and peri peri fries next time. I&#39;ll keep y&#39;all updated!

The lemon herb sauce was amazing mixed with the extra hot sauce. I dipped my chicken in it, and even some of my rice and mashed taters.

We were full but still got dessert. The raspberry cheesecake is pretty good, but it isn&#39;t something I&#39;d get again unless I really, really wanted cheesecake and I was already there.

The staff was friendly and helpful. Loooved it. I&#39;ll definitely be back!"

I was more impressed with the location on Delano. I had the same wrap here and found it smaller, less chicken and not as much lettuce. This time I ordered the coleslaw as a side, I was hoping for it to be a bit different, however it was pretty standard. 

Having lunch with a friend of mine this time, she just ordered a side of veggies, the cashier who I believe looked as if he was the manager should have suggested that I just place the one order with two sides, instead of mine alone with one, and her order. It would have been a buck or two less. Not that it&#39;s their responsibility too, however when I was a server I used to make suggestions like this all the time.

Since I really haven&#39;t eaten Portuguese food, the flavors were full and interesting - giving what would have been a very normal chicken sandwich a completely different flavor profile.

For dessert, I decided to try Naughty Natas, which is a Portuguese tart, and I was sorry that I didn&#39;t get more than just one. Do it!

The place itself looks unique/vibrant with the decor, oversized hanging lamps, cool chairs in front.

The food is fresh and wholesome. I usually get a 1/4 chicken with 1 or 2 sides. (Try the peas!) But I&#39;ve also tried 2 of their salads, which were delicious. There is plenty of seating.

Even the chicken pesto wrap from a recent Amtrak diner car was better than the chicken breast wrap at Nando.  For the prices and inflated healthy aspect of their chicken, the wrap isn&#39;t up to the hype.  A few smallish chunks of chicken and a bunch of lettuce in a grilled medium-sized, food service tortilla that almost fell apart.  Where were the tomatoes?  Maybe some avocado.  Maybe some Parmesan or melted cheese.  Nothing.  Just the few pieces of chicken and some romaine lettuce.  The sides weren&#39;t imaginative.  Mashed potatoes and coleslaw.  Seriously?  Sure, they were tasty but potatoes and slaw are not the best complements for a wrap.

The employees were super friendly, and the interior design is spectacular.  It&#39;s obvious I ordered the wrong thing here, but I&#39;m not feeling the magnetism to venture back anytime soon."

After going in London she insisted that we HAD to go and that it was the best restaurant ever. I told my other friend that went to college overseas I was going here and had high expectations, she laughed at me and told me this was the Panera of the UK. ...... She was right.

I ordered 1/4 mild chicken, fries and a pitcher of sangria. The chicken had a tangy flavor to it I liked that there were a ton of different sauces to try on my chicken. My fries had seasoning on them, i liked it, no complaints there. The sangria was good too...but I found my pitcher to be rather small for the price I paid. 

Overall my meal was ok, nothing to drag me out of the burbs for. Its rather expensive for what it really is and the smaller portions that are served. Id be much happier eating chicken from Chapala in Streamwood for less then half the price of this meal."

It eventually wondered it way to Europe and finally Washington D.C. in the US. Now in Chicago I decided to give it a try. Actually I have a friend who works here so I get to sample many of their menu items. The chicken is quite good actually I like it better than pretty much all fried chicken places in Chicago. However the other day I had some of their Lemon &amp; Herb wings and whoa! the lemon citrus-y flavor was just too much. Not an enjoyable experience. It&#39;s gotta be a subtle flavor not &#34;hey you want some chicken with your lemon juice&#34;. The other times I had their chicken I had plain and medium sauces. Both were very good. Tastey juicy chicken that melts in your mouth. I was quite impressed.

Inside the decor is quite interesting. State of the art Coke Machine that is pretty cool but unnecessarily complicated. It takes a few minutes to figure it out. The seating is interesting as they have these swinging birdcage seats by the window that offer great people watching in a bustling area of Lakeview/Lincoln Park. However away from the window the seating can get quite cramped if it&#39;s really busy. You might get an unwanted body part rubbing your back when it&#39;s busy. Never saw erotic massage on their menu.  I&#39;m just saying.

Overall the Chicken is delicious and the decor is quite interesting to look at. However a few quirks need to be improved such as inconsistency amongst their flavors and cramped seating. Customer service still needs a little work depending on the server. They have only been open 3-4 weeks now so some quirks are to be expected. They deserve 3.5 stars but since Yelp does not provide half stars I will round up to 4 because I really do like their chicken. Hopefully soon they will DESERVE 4."

Kidding aside, I first had Nando&#39;s in the UK and then again in Toronto. When I learned they have multiple Chicago locations, I was in!

It&#39;s so fresh and the food is so great. The way their dining works is you come in, they ask you for the size of your party, they give you a table number and walk you over to your table. After that, you look over the menu and make your way to the cashier to order. Then they bring you your food.

To be honest, I don&#39;t really understand the purpose of this! It&#39;s too confusing. I just thought I&#39;d throw that out there.

The food is good but the price is a bit high. It&#39;s great if you&#39;re looking for a casual spot for tasty chicken, salad, or wraps. The portions are comfortable but are not really worth the price you are paying. The rice and mashed potatoes are a safe option for sides but if you are adventurous, I&#39;d recommend trying the Macho Peas as well. I got the flame-grilled chicken breast with Medium sauce and my friends enjoyed their Country Salad (very generously portioned) and Halloumi Wrap. Be wary that the Medium spice is comfortably spicy so do not try any hotter unless you are used to Habaneros and Jalapenos. They also have sauces on the side so don&#39;t be afraid to experiment with their various garlic, herb, and citrus sauces.

Nando&#39;s is great for larger groups. Be sure to take advantage of their loyalty card rewards or order take-out if you are in a rush. It&#39;s truly a unique offering in terms of food."

So I get home, realize my $11 sandwich is absent, and call Nandos.  I explain to the girl on the phone what happened, to which she replies the sandwich is there waiting for me.

My coworker who has had Nando&#39;s overseas was so excited about Nando&#39;s coming to Chicago that she wouldn&#39;t stop talking about it for weeks. Then when it finally opened I had to go. The Randolph location is really nice but it&#39;s far for me to frequent since I live in LP. When I noticed that they were opening across from Trader Joe&#39;s and next to Kuma&#39;s I couldn&#39;t be happier! 

Today was their grand opening and it wasn&#39;t as packed as I expected. There was a consistent line but it moved quickly. The service is great considering it&#39;s mainly a self-serve kind of place. I hope they stay friendly and helpful even when it&#39;s no longer new. 

I ordered the 1/4 chicken leg and thigh with 2 sides. I can&#39;t eat spicy so I got the lemon herb seasoning and for my two I got the Portuguese rice and Macho peas. For me the peas were a tad too spicy (but I am sensitive to spicyness). The chicken was great, just like the Randolph location. It&#39;s juicy and the meat falls off the bone.

On my second visit to Nando&#39;s Peri-Peri I was less than impressed again. I decided to give them an additional try since the first time was later in the day and they were very slow. 
  Walking into the restaurant you are greeting by a super friendly individual who spoke to me for way to long about all their sides/samples/specials. The person at the door gives you a metal chicken on a stick to coordinate with your table. You have have to chose your table before even seeing it. 
  I ordered a chicken sandwich with a side of Brussel sprouts, fries and a drink. I was never offered any of the samples the individual at the door spoke about. My total came out to $20, I filled my drink and waited for about 20 minutes. I was sat next to the kitchen window so I noticed that my brussel sprouts came out of the microwave. 
  The chicken sandwich was ok, their chicken is properly cooked and juicy. The fries were insanely salty and since they say in window under the heat lamp for a while waiting on the brussel sprouts to be microwaved they were a bit soggy. The brussel sprouts were worse than green giant microwave pouches. I can&#39;t believe they are charging a premium for them over other sides. Ick. 
  My consensus is that I&#39;d rather frequent a locally owned roasted chicken place or even Boston market. Their peri-peri peppers must be made of gold if they are charging $20 for lunch."

The flavors are really good but the portion sizes leave much to be desired. I&#39;m a small girl with a medium appetite but this place definitely does not fill me up in the least. I ordered the 1/4 chicken breast and wing with a salad ($9). The mango sauce is where it&#39;s at! I like that they have a large variety of sauces for the chicken which are really delicious but for the pricing, it&#39;s super disappointing. My dining companion ordered the 1/4 thigh and drumstick with rice and salad and was still starving at end of the meal. 

Both of us left hungry and ended up at crisp. Maybe I&#39;ll try the 1/2 chicken next time but it&#39;s overpriced so probably won&#39;t come back."

I wish I ordered a bigger piece of chicken. I could eat the PEAS (no joke) for every meal. All the sauces are good (put the garlic sauce on the mashed potatoes, for real). The staff is awesome, they gave me recommendations and coupons and a punch-card. Good beer list, next time I&#39;m going to try the sangria (it&#39;s pretty).

It&#39;s portugese but I&#39;ve been to Portugal and didn&#39;t have quite this style of food.

That being said, the chicken&#39;s fantastic. The sides and extras are also great.
My first time there, my gf and I split the chicken breast sandwich as well as the mediterranean salad. The chicken breast sandwich was good, the sandwich somewhat disguises the chicken so you can&#39;t fully enjoy it as pure chicken, but I liked the sandwich. 
But to be honest, what stole the show was the mediterranean salad. It had dates, chicken, and some other stuff in this mix next to your salad greens and pita slices. Man, it was fantastic. I&#39;d get it again in a heartbeat.

I went back again recently and just got a chicken breast with a pair of sides. The chicken breast was good but smaller than expected and for the price I paid, I would&#39;ve thought the chicken breast would be a bit larger.

For those who don&#39;t know, peri peri is apparently a Portuguese style of cooking. The chicken isn&#39;t remotely dry and has great flavor to it. I like to add the different sauces they have which have a very unique flavor to them. But they are quite salty, so be prepared to drink plenty of water after the meal."

I&#39;m not sure what they did to it but the mashed potatoes are so creamy and delicious. I usually don&#39;t even like mashed potatoes. The garlic bread is amazing as well. I can&#39;t remember how I ordered my chicken but I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be spicy, however it was. I didn&#39;t mind because it was the right amount of spice. It complimented the chicken. Not set your face on fire. I really like this place. Next time I go I wanna try the butterfly chicken breast and macho peas.

Walked in on a late Sunday afternoon (~3pm). It was pretty empty, so we were immediately seated by a friendly hostess and told to go up to the counter when we were ready to order. 

I read all the yelp reviews about their chicken, so we ordered a whole chicken full platter w/ corn on the cob and rice. All their sauces are house-made, and you can choose which sauce you want cooked with the chicken. I was worried the hot sauce might be too hot for me, so we did half hot and half medium. 

After you order, there&#39;s a separate section to pick up silverware and bottles of hot sauce in case you really like to drench your meat in sauce (as I do). They even had a sink in that area so you don&#39;t have to walk all the way to the bathroom to wash your hands!

Order came out in ~10-15 min. The chicken was DELICIOUS- juicy with just the right amount of crisp on the skin. I wish I had the recipe. The sauce was also delicious but not overpowering. It was hardly spicy so I definitely added a lot more. The corn was sweet, even without the added butter they give you on the side. The rice was the right amount of savory, but the portion was not enough for two people (the only bad thing I can say).

Bill came out to ~$30 before tip.  I can&#39;t wait to go back!"

4 stars on the cool soda machine and good iced green tea.

Sadly, food was only 2 stars for me. The &#34;peri chips&#34; were just seasoned fries that were very salty and coldish (definitely not crispy). &#34;Portuguese rice&#34; - sigh I&#39;ve had much better from a Zatarain&#39;s box. The rice was hard, not very well flavored, and again kind of coldish. I tried a medium spicy half chicken and a lemon basil chicken. The skin was soft, fatty and again not crispy! The sauces were ok and helped with the flavors, but overall it was overpriced grilled chicken that you can get much better (and cheaper) from a Mexican place (think pollo express)."

Interior is decorated pretty cool too. Our party of 5 shares the olives (amazing) and a bottle of red. I had the boneless chicken breasts, hot sauce, with a side of peas and the butternut squash/corn. Chicken was so tender and the seasoning/sauce was phenomenal! Just enough heat to make me wanna get those waters down. I dipped my chicken in the garlic hot sauce too- loved it. The peas were honest to god the best peas I&#39;ve ever had.

I can actually say now that the Chicago&#39;s Nando&#39;s is not the same, the portions for one thing is definitely smaller here in Chicago. I had ordered two .25 dark meat chicken with mango sauce with a glass of peach sangria. The two chicken legs overly salty and felt like I did not get enough chicken for the price. The peach sangria was half filled (last cup of the pitcher), was good but should have ordered an IPA.

We almost were lured into Kuma&#39;s by their patio siren song.  But then remembered that we had both been there separately and thought it kinda sucked.

Grilled chicken was what we were craving.

The menu was overwhelming, but the cashier helped us navigate through it.  We were so hungry that without her we would have ordered essentially an additional dinner that we didn&#39;t need.

I ordered the butterflied breast with medium sauce and a side of fries.  Of note - I wish I would have gotten the hot sauce for more flavor but was glad that I got the peri sauce with the fries because there&#39;s nothing better than a flavorful dipping sauce for my frites.  Also appreciated was the garlic sauce available by the Coke machine.

Fiance got the breast with hot sauce (yum) and garlic bread as his side.  We split the cucumber salad.  He loved everything.  I thought the garlic bread tasted like those loaves of pre-schmeared garlic bread that you make in the oven.  Lots of garlic flavor, though.

We sat in the basket seats in the window and made plans to attempt to recreate this back home.  We will fail miserably, of course, but we&#39;re up for the challenge."

We dined in at 2:00 we were greeted to a smiling face and the decor of the restaurant was nice very Afro Brazilian. I like that you don&#39;t have to worry about being waited on by a waiter. Also loved that the water came in glass containers.

My mother and I decided that we would share a whole chicken because it is a cheaper option. We got the whole chicken half lemon herb half mango lime and ordered the Portuguese rice and Butternut squash and corn salad and also the pea slaw and a side of olives.  ALL OF THE FOOD was GREAT. They had very helpful wait staff.  The chicken was juicy and succulent and most important flavorful and the side dishes created a melody of flavors to compliment the chicken. 

The only negative and it&#39;s not really a negative is the sauces, they aren&#39;t really needed but they will add a different flavor to your chicken they have a lot of sauce flavors.

We chose to order the Portuguese rice and macho peas. You can choose the level of spiciness of your peri peri sauce, and you can add other sauces that are available at the self-serve condiment bar. The total came to $29. 

Considering the cost of the meal I would say the the experience was largely underwhelming. The chicken and the sauce were just okay. There was not a lot of meat on the chicken, and it was not as &#34;fall-off-the-bone&#34; delicious as others described. The only meat that amounted to more than a few nibbles came from the breast. The macho peas were the only highlight of the meal. We found that the Portuguese rice was forgettable.  

The restaurant seems to have and identity complex--it can&#39;t decide whether it wants to be an order at the register place or a restaurant with a hostess and servers. Instead, it seems to retain a confusing combination of both service styles. It is difficult to gauge whether you were being served or serving yourself. 

Overall, this experience does not inspire a return visit."

The answer is: reasonably well.  The portions are a little small and simple for what you get, but on the other hand you do get some flavorful and moist chicken and a range of plausible vegetable sides.  They are not afraid to amp up both the acid and the heat in their sauces and marinades, which is a very good thing.

I&#39;m positive that it&#39;s not the comparison they&#39;d be looking for, but for me the real question is how it compares to the Chicken Hut up the street on Broadway.  The Chicken Hut is faster, and has more flavorful skin but less flavorful flesh.  The Chicken Hut is also much closer to my house.  But Nando&#39;s has real vegetables, which is the thing I most wish you could get at the Chicken Hut.  And for that reason alone it has now earned a non-redundant place in the Lakeview chicken market.  That&#39;s no small achievement.  (Nando&#39;s is also nicer, so it becomes a place where you could plausibly go on a casual date.)

Worth trying."

I&#39;ve heard about Nando&#39;s for years from SAfer friends and it&#39;s opened up in the DC area which is my home town. We went here early on and saw the wave of people. Our first visit was a little disappointing considering there are sooooo many people on staff here. Seriously there have been at least 10 people aside from those in the kitchen working at any one time.

We were ignored on our first trip by the 3 young ladies working at the door who offered a menu and whatever other directions to everyone but us so we were disappointed when we got to the register and realized we should have received a rooster to claim a table. Ok, so to explain it another way you choose which cock to sit on. You don&#39;t put in your order and pick a table, you choose your table initially. So anyways we get our table.

Our food and drink is delivered. I really like the medium sauce, it&#39;s not hot it&#39;s just most spicy. I got the half chicken with the chili sweet potato side. He got the fries and chicken something with fries (chips). The sides are awesome, the fries are good, surprisingly the chicken is the missing link. The drinks, well don&#39;t ever order wine from here. Our tab was $49 which is pretty ridiculous. The last time I went I had a quarter chicken with the chili sweet potato side and my friend got the chicken wrap with chips. Again, it&#39;s fine but just pricey.

The chicken itself was amazing. It was so flavorful. There&#39;s a multitude of different flavors including lemon herb, mild, wild, hot, and extra hot. Each flavor offered something different and the extra hot wasn&#39;t so hot that it scalded my mouth.

Can&#39;t wait for the 3 location to open and see if they match up to the current 2 spots."

Everyone was so nice. The manager came out and asked us how everything was and personally took our order.

Phenomenal chicken with many sauces to choose from to amp up the flavor. I love the hummus with the peri peri drizzle.  Very unique food for the price range.  Its a necessity for the neighborhood, no good food options around there besides Nandos.  And they serve alcohol.

Definitely recommend sitting in the hanging chairs.  Cool vibe.  Incredible food."

Nando&#39;s has kind of a Carnivale-like vibe to it--except Nando&#39;s has way more of a crush to it due to close quarters and is way more frantic, structured and regimented in its churn and burn approach. 

The system at Nando&#39;s is almost a scientific formula and ends up having the feel of arriving at the concentration camp for processing. 

Upon arrival, you&#39;re greeted by the host and handed a menu, which is extensive and will need to be studied, and a table number. Pro tip: review the menu online prior to arrival to avoid being caught up in the system. You&#39;ll have zero control over your table and will be pointed in the general direction of its location. 

While you&#39;re studying the menu in the sluice area between the host and the order counter the employees will direct you to &#34;move over to the booths&#34; on the left rather than stand on the wall to the right. This happened twice. It&#39;s your first indication you&#39;re in their system. 

Once you decide, you approach the counter and place your order and pay your damages. Nando&#39;s isn&#39;t cheap. Pro tip: stay away from the cheap wine, especially the cabernet sauvig-NON! 

After you order and pay you go on your journey to locate your temporary barracks, er, table by walking in the general direction pointed out by the host and then matching your number with the number on the table. And then you wait for your soup and your slice of bread, er, your chicken and sides. This place is so regimented the wine was already on the table prior to arrival. Those guys in central Europe several decades back have nothing on these guys. 

As to the most important part:

Chicken breast sandwich...pretty darn good, but I&#39;d rather it were pounded thin.

Mashed red skinned potatoes...O&#39;Delicioso.

Grilled corn on the cob...very good sweet charred taste.

Vino...non, non, non.

I&#39;d say the food was pretty good and a return visit is warranted. I can&#39;t say I like the whole overly structured system employed or the organized chaos of the place. It might be better suited as a lunch place. 

It&#39;s 3-1/2 clucks. And they&#39;re somewhat pricey clucks."

BUT: their &#34;quarter chicken&#34; was more like a &#34;quarter cornish game hen.&#34; NO WAY was that one fourth of a full grown chicken and NO WAY was that a filling meal. Your plate comes with nothing else -- and if you want, for example, a piece of (oh, I don&#39;t know) BREAD with it, that costs another $2.75! 

ALSO, unlike some other reviewers, I DON&#39;T LIKE the sauces -- the hot &amp; extra hot are just that -- hotness -- with NO FLAVOR. And the lemon&amp;herb and wild herb taste like salad dressing! not good on chicken.

ALSO, the other sides don&#39;t taste good, AT ALL. Peas with mint &amp; chili? Squash with 
cranberry, cilantro, &amp; chili? I do not like them."

She gives u a table number and u order at the counter find ur table number and sit down and then food comes out to you! 
I did not like the girl at the register at all, it was a young African American girl with a mono tone voice and straight face! She didn&#39;t look or sound like she wanted to be there working. Loll anyway, I got a sangria so that came out right away! We went up the the sauce counter to get couples of bottles of dipping sauces and fork knives etc. our server was super sweet!! She came out in about under 7 mins and was like enjoy your food etc etc! I got the boneless chicken breast bc I hate boned chicken and two sides. Got the rice and mashed potatoes! My husband got half a chicken and two sides rice and peas. We wouldn&#39;t get the peas again that&#39;s a waste of $2 for an extra side! Portion is more than enough and food was amazing, loved the flame grilled chicken!!! To change things up it would be nice to get a second side that would be worth the $2.

Came with a group of 5 and we got one of the sharable platters with some sides. With 5 hungry climbers, we devoured the platter and still had left over. The medium spice chicken wasn&#39;t that spicy at all. Next time, we will go for the spicier one. Everything was delicious!! The staff were super friendly, and there&#39;s a ton of seating inside and in their semi-upstairs patio area.

You can pick from mild, medium and hot Peri-Peri sauces or none. I love that it is flame grilled. I had the 1/4 chicken breast-medium, mashed potatoes and garden salad. They were really good. Mash heaven. My friend ordered french fries, mushy peas, the lemon herb chicken and Sangria. She really liked it. Red Sangria had flavors of cinnamon and orange. Killer. I also like that they have a nice selection of sauces in bottles that you can take to your table. The ambience is causal and modern. Customer service is friendly and attentive.

Unfortunately, the menu items aren&#39;t the same and the price is insane. I got one chicken breast and a leaf salad to go, for $13.73!

As an additional bummer, I got the order for take-out and didn&#39;t realize until I got home that they didn&#39;t include any kind of dressing. The other Nando&#39;s I&#39;ve been to include dressing and a few packets of peri-peri sauce by default. Not here.

The food is pretty good and the portions, while small, are probably about what we should be eating. But they&#39;ll need to up their game and lower their prices to get more stars."

Now they have a hostess seat you with a menu and your number but your number still has to match the table.  A couple of old people were offered a booth.  They said they wanted a table.  She took them to the back, right by the kitchen and they said it was too hot.  They pointed to several open tables in the middle of the restaurant and the hostess gave some lame excuse so they decided to leave.  What?  Does it clash with your attempt to be hip by having some senior citizens sit up front?

As for the whole numbering junk, Culvers has you order, gives you a number and then you sit down.  Somehow the folks who bring you the food at Culvers has no issue finding your number.  Let people sit where they want like a fast food restaurant OR have waiters.  Nando&#39;s hybrid system at an attempt of upscale fast food is inefficient, confusing and in the case of the older couple straight up rude.

Anyway, I ordered a chicken breast sandwich that somehow took nearly 20 minutes to get.  I cook chicken at home faster based on the number of staff members standing around not doing a damn thing, I guess one of them could have joined the kitchen staff since, you know, it was lunch rush.

Then that price.  A sandwich, fries and a soda...over 13 bucks.  I asked for mayo and when she rang it up she asked if it was for the sandwich or the fries.  I said fries.  Bang, that counted extra so 75 cents added.  Before it showed up on the register for free.  I should have said &#34;It&#39;s for my sandwich but can I have it on the side&#34; and seen what happened.

The sandwich itself is okay.  The tangy mayo is nothing special.  In fact I make something similar at home all the time.  It is just mayo+hot sauce.  Whoopdy do.  The fries were overly salted and not very many considering the sandwich was 6.85 and the &#34;with one side&#34; was 2 bucks.

I was amazed the place seemed more chaotic than before and the food showed zero improvement and they still charge too much.  I mean nickle and diming costumers for mayo, really?  This isn&#39;t baseball, Nando&#39;s isn&#39;t getting a third strike from me.  I&#39;m done."

However, the greeter did get us seated very quickly.   You order your food at the counter and wait, which the food came out timely.  

If you don&#39;t like spicy, order your chicken plain. However I do, so the medium was perfect and I loved all the dipping sauce.  The peri peri wings were good, the corn was really good, and so were the fries.  I also loved the peas.  I was with a large group and we shared a bunch of food."

Now, 2 parts of the chicken wing are typically served, the wingette (2 small bones, not a lot of meat, lots of skin) and the drumette (yes, the small drumstick with more meat).  Guess what, I got 12 wingettes!?   Now, if you think this was just bad luck you are probably wrong --- for the mathematically inclined the chance of randomly grabbing 12 wingettes is (1/2)^12,  or less than 3 in 10,000.    Are you kidding me?!  

If that was not bad enough they were undercooked, pale, soggy --- I had to put the scrawny things in my oven for 10 minutes.   They didn&#39;t taste bad after that, but I was still hungry.

Perhaps it&#39;s a regional thing, but it disappointedly do not stacked up. The Nando&#39;s I know was very flavorful and comes with very delicious, crispy skin. The chicken here has very soggy skin, and the meat tastes bland. Not sure if they really marinaded it for 24 hours.

We have been to Nando&#39;s in the UK and love the food. The food was great, however, the restaurant was like an oven. It was hotter in the restaurant than outside, and that day it was above 90 degrees fahrenheit. The stifling  restaurant, combined with hot food (both temperature and spice) was too much to bare. My boyfriend got so hot he had to wait outside... In the 90 degree temperature... in order to escape the heat in the restaurant, and we took our food to go.

I assume their AC was broken...?"

I found that the chicken wings all tasted the same, and I could not distinguish the three different flavors of the large family plate that we ordered. This may just be due to my American nature of not appreciating subtlety and drowning everything in sauces my whole life, so who knows.

Hubby had tried it in London and thought it was good.  We took his mom here with our baby for Sunday lunch.  I think we had a split of the medium and the lemon herb full chicken platter.  The chicken itself was good.  It can stand alone, but better with a little sauce.  It doesn&#39;t seem to matter the choice of marinade for the chicken since there are so many dipping sauces to choose from that you can just drown the meat it in if you didn&#39;t like what you picked.  Although I thought the sauces were all on the salty side.  The corn and coleslaw were good sides and the fries were just okay.

I don&#39;t think people really appreciate this almost perfect blend of flavorful food+healthy good for you. The restaurant has a unique/colorful/bright setting. I&#39;ve only been to the Diversey location but they&#39;re opening another in Lincoln park. The peri peri chicken comes in different spice levels I get the hot but for flavor sensitive eaters the medium will also work. The red skinned mashed potatoes are really good. Also don&#39;t forget to use the sauces usually placed by the pop dispenser. There&#39;s extra hot/garlic/wild herb experiment and find your flavor because the chicken itself is dry rubbed. 1/2 chicken is usually good for 1 person and only 500 calories can&#39;t beat it!

We both got the grilled chicken breast and added our sauce at the table. The chicken was good, but nothing I couldn&#39;t whip up at home. All the sauces tasted the same. Super citrus-y and lots of herb. they were just okay.

 Seating is at the outdoor patio, inside on chairs and tables or in rattan swings at the front window. I do not particularly care for the blue plastic chairs, but all the other seating is fine. As others have mentioned, you tell the host which area you want to sit at and they give you a rooster to put in a holder at your table. That&#39;s how they find you to,give you your order.
The chicken has been marinated and flattened before cooking. It is not a fried chicken. It&#39;s grilled. I got the quarter chicken (breast) marinated in medium sauce and then add the wonderful sauces located for self service.  Its very tender and juicy. I get it with one side- the Portuguese rice- which has a beautiful turmeric color and small chopped vegetables in it. I was not impressed with the cole slaw, however. Skip it- it&#39;s small and tasteless. The soft serve ice cream can take out the burn from the sauces.
I think Nando&#39;s has a winning formula."

Pitchers on pitchers on pitchers. 

All day, erryday.

Have it coursing through my veins.

Practically half margarita, half human.

Okay, I&#39;ll stop, you get the point. 

Cafe El Tapatio delivers. Their margaritas are the perfect balance of strong and not too sweet. These bad boys will get to you after one pitcher.
Obviously doesn&#39;t mean you should stop there.

Their shrimp ceviche is fiiiiirrreeeeee. I swear I could live off of their ceviche, it&#39;s so fresh. Steak quesadillas are a little more on the greasy side, but were still fairly tasty. 

So just like Trump would, grab those margaritas by the pitcher (hahaha no?) and order some awesome ceviche. 

Get it, get it!"

I was deeply impressed with the enchiladas--the mole sauce is to die for (well, not literally but in the metaphorical sense). Went there feeling a little blue and came out of there feeling rather happy and festive!

This is not the place to go if you&#39;re on a budget, though as the tacos will run you around $8 with refried beans and rice. The only less expensive items on the menu are the drink specials. To get a margarita of that strength and potency for right around $5 on a Friday was truly quite amazing. I was buzzed after having only one, and I weigh 240 lbs."

I wanted to revisit this place, as it is cute and has nice margaritas, from what I could recall. What I totally forgot was how super whitey gringo suburban transplant this food is, as it does not qualify as real Chicago Mexican food in my book. It wasn&#39;t bad, but rather a bit bland. Seemingly tailored for the mainstream sort of transplant resident typically found in Lakeview. Service and atmosphere deserve a better rating. I was just very disappointed in the food, and that stupid boring neighborhood."

Got a table for 2 around 7 pm on a Thursday. I think we got the last table, which shows you how busy they are even during the week. For drinks we opted for the $5 mojito special they have on Thursdays. They can add fruit too if you want!

Dinner I went with the sincronizada de papa con chorizo. All of the ingredients were sandwiched between two tortillas with rice and beans on the side. It was really good, a little different than your typical enchilada-like dish which made it fun. My friend&#39;s shrimp tacos looked amazing as well. Their prices are on the higher end for casual Mexican dining in the city but they have really huge portion sizes, which in my mind, combined with the quality justifies the price.

Really enjoyed Cafe El Tapatio! This will definitely be my go-to Mexican place in Lakeview moving forward!"

They had a good flauta - a top notch carne asada burrito, and their adobo chicken gringas were fabulous.

Then we heard about their choice to expand. I thought &#34;as long as nothing changes, it&#39;ll be okay.&#34; Things have changed and it&#39;s no longer okay.

They seem to be transitioning to a new menu, since they dropped 2 in front of me. There are similarities on both menus, but there are significant differences like the a la carte taco section. I ordered a carne asada taco, a chicken adobo taco, and a jumbo pineapple margarita. My wife ordered her favorite: the chicken gringas with chihuahua cheese and a jumbo lime margarita. The drinks came out and they were a shadow of their former selves. The glass was at least 30% to 40% smaller than they used to be - I was OK with that until I discovered they&#39;re $17 each! For a roughly 16oz margarita? The food? They used to serve it with care, now the gringas had very little cheese (all clumped on one side) and the chicken was inedibly dry. My wife couldn&#39;t eat it. My tacos: the chicken one was passable, but the &#34;carne asada&#34; one had ground beef in it that almost tasted like boiled beef tongue and pickled onions - I literally spit it out.

It seems they&#39;re trying to finance their expansion by giving lower quality food and smaller drinks, and it saddens me. My wife and I were loyal customers here, but I can&#39;t support anyplace that makes me feel like I&#39;m getting shafted on quality and price."

The only thing I can think is that people in Lakeview have no idea what good mexican food tastes like. If you want the real scoop, check out this guy&#39;s review: https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=eQsSEnmUtP5Xz7Lf0a6s8g

I&#39;ll cut to the chase: the chips were cold and slightly stale. In their defense, both the waitress and the manager (who came to our table to explain without our asking) told us their chip warming machine was broken. The service was slow (which also was not a real big deal, honestly). The food, however, was bland and sort of luke-warm. This would be enough to trigger a below-average review, but the real kicker here was that it gave my mother diarrhea and vomiting early the next morning. Yes. We ate there around 8pm (had nothing else to eat afterwards), and *very* early the next morning my mother woke up with very clear food-poisoning symptoms.

This was our first (and last) time to try El Tapatio. Maybe we just happened to catch a bad night, but when you give my mom diarrhea and vomiting, it&#39;s an automatic disqualification for me. One strike and you&#39;re out."

The food never disappoints, they have a nice outdoor seating section in the spring/summer, and the service is fabulous. I will say, it gets busy on the weekends so you may have to wait a bit for a table, but it&#39;s worth it! Plus the restaurant being packed just goes to show how good the place really is.

I&#39;ve had just about everything on the menu but a few personal favorites are the ceviche, the Coctel de Cameron and the enchiladas. The shrimp cocktail is the biggest I&#39;ve ever seen, it comes in a HUGE Margarita glass and is smothered in yummy tomato cocktail sauce. They also have giant cocktails served in a 32 oz. terra-cotta pot if you&#39;re looking for some extra fun! They&#39;re great to share with a few people, and definitely get you feeling good.

Lastly the service here has always been particularly great. Twice that I&#39;ve been there now the owner has given my table free tequila shots just because.  That&#39;s my kinda place!!!"

Although they don&#39;t take reservations and the small space fills up quickly, there&#39;s a conveniently located Irish pub (complete with real live Irish bartender) that will furnish you a beverage while you wait for Tapatio to call you with your table&#39;s status. 

Now let me start off - if you&#39;re perusing their menu online and are shocked by their prices, let me reassure you this is NOT your run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant. The food is fresh, high quality, and delicious rather than something to soak up the booze at the end of a long night.

From the start of the meal with homemade chips and salsa, prepare to have your expectation of another greasy Mexican joint shattered. The fresh salsa has just the right amount of spice, and the chips are fresh from the fryer. I also recommend the guacamole which comes with delicious pickled red onion on top.

As for entrees, I have had the Tacos Del Mar and the Tacos De Mar De Cortez and have never been disappointed. The fish is fresh, the corn tortillas are warm, the rice is flavorful without being overly salty. I especially LOVE the Tacos De Mar De Cortez - HUGE beer battered shrimp are crispy and delicious.

They also have awesome margaritas here. If you don&#39;t like to be overpowered by sour mix, I would recommend going for the Rolls Royce which is much too big for me to drink alone (I did so once and don&#39;t remember much else about the evening) but perfect when shared. At $18 it seems pricey but it is a shareable sized marg with premium liquor. I would rather pay a bit more and not drink well tequila, thanks.

The staff is also friendly and amazing. The owner floats around making sure everyone is satisfied. This place is truly a gem!"

We ordered margaritas and the bowl drink (I can&#39;t remember the name). Margaritas were delicious but pretty expensive. The bowl drink on the other hand is the biggest steal in the city. Seriously, order this. It&#39;s delicious and boozy and everything you could want. 

For an entree I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos. I was very impressed. Even better was the rice that came with it. It&#39;s no ordinary white rice. I can&#39;t explain it. You&#39;ll just have to try it.

As far as service, I&#39;ve ordered both carry-out and ate in-house a few times, and every time it&#39;s been great. I live around the block and the pick-up orders are lightning fast. The service in-house is really great as well, considering how pretty crazy it can get on a given night. What&#39;s really great too is, if the house is full, that they&#39;ll recommend a local bar across the street (McGuiggan&#39;s) and give you a call (or even come into the bar) when you&#39;re table is ready. I&#39;ve spent many a night at McGuiggan&#39;s as well and you can tell they both try to support each other which is nice to see.

For the food, it&#39;s all been great. One of my particular favorites was the Beef Short Rib in Tomatillo sauce which was quite good. The usual suspects are all great though as well, especially the queso fundido after a few margaritas! One area that is particulary great are their Al Pastor taco&#39;s... the Al Pastor has been on point everytime I&#39;ve eaten it. I only wish they gave you more than two tacos per order!

The food, service, and atmosphere was great back then, and I&#39;m happy to report it is still GREAT.  I ate here earlier this year on a business trip to Chicago.  I hadn&#39;t been to this restaurant in over fifteen years.  I went by myself for late lunch on a Saturday and sat at the bar.  I ordered the chimichanga because I firmly believe this restaurant has the best chimichanga I&#39;ve ever eaten in my life.  I was elated to find that it was just as good as I remembered.  I had my own mini-Proustian moment eating the chimichanga because it tasted EXACTLY as I recalled it tasting 15+ years ago.   I also spoke to the owner/manager of the restaurant while I was there.  This restaurant has remained under the same family ownership for 15+ years.  I told him that I used to come to his restaurant years ago and that the food in his restaurant was just as good today as it was then.  He told me that he has had the same lady cooking the food in his restaurant for 15+ years.  I realize this review is a bit sentimental and that I may have an idiosyncratic love for this restaurant, but I have recommended it to numerous people and they have enjoyed it as well.

Went to Cafe El Tapatio for the first time on Sunday around 9:30 p.m. with my girlfriend and her friend. The place said it was open until 11 p.m. and it was full when we got there. After waiting for a few minutes we got a seat and ordered within minutes of sitting down. I ordered a full pitcher of Margarita for the table and each of us ordered a full meal. While waiting for the meal, we finished one portion of the chips and another one was brought. Fast forward to 10:30 p.m. I barely finished my meal and I was chomping on the chips when suddenly the lights came on and staff started to clean up. This is fine except that we were basically getting kicked out at 10:30 with a half a pitcher of margarita left (~$30). One of the staff members tried to grab the chips off the table with my hand still in the basket-so I stopped him. Minutes later, when I turned my head, another (maybe the same one) staff member swooped by and took the chips of the table so that we would leave.  That is not a way to treat customers.  If we were told that the restaurant was closing early that would have been fine. If we were asked if we minded leaving because the staff would like to go home early it would not have been a big deal. Rather, the behavior of the staff left a bad taste in our mouths. It is a shame, because the food was very tasty."

Unfortunately  the waiter forgot to put in our appetizer order for empanadas, which are delicious, so we ended up taking them home. My daughter had the vegetarian enchiladas rancheras and really liked it. I had the sinchronizada de papa chorizo which was a bit heavy on the onions but otherwise very good. The rice and beans are always very good but could be larger portions"

I was a little skeptical when we waited for 40 minutes and I thought this food better be worth the wait. Well it was definitely worth the wait!! Excellent fresh tasting Mexican food. The service is quick and food is delicious. Plenty of options for vegetarians and they are very receptive to modifications. I think we found our new city spot when my parents come to visit.

We decided to try this place but we had seen it before from the outside it looks a little too funky for me. But I must say that the yelp reviews were so terrific that we figured we would give it a shot and it&#39;s spectacular. Do not let the outside of the building fool you. The service is great, food is fabulous, and we will bring the girls back with us One night when we can have some margaritas.
Want to try something unusual but really great? Try the fried shrimp taco dinner with a fresh salad and some rice. It freaked me out because it was so good."

With a small and intimate setting, this restaurant is ideal for a first date or a casual night out. But, if you are looking for more of a party, they do have a back room that is available to reserve which accommodates about 10-15 people. The atmosphere is relaxing and fun, a great spot for any day of the week. Plus, the staff is very friendly, welcoming and accommodating. We even had the opportunity to meet and shake hands with the owner who thanked us for coming by.

Before ordering, they serve some of their house chips and salsa, which is awesome! The chips have just the right amount of salt on them and the salsa has a good bite to it. For a meal that will really get your taste buds going, I highly recommend the Guisado de Res beef shorts ribs, which are cooked in a verde salsa and served with potatoes, rice and beans. All I can say is...SO damn good. My husband enjoyed the Carne Asada, which includes an 8 oz. skirt steak char broiled and topped with grilled onions. It&#39;s served with a cheese enchilada, rice, beans and tortillas. Let&#39;s just say he was smiling after one bite into that!

When the weather is nice, be sure to take advantage of their outdoor seating! There&#39;s nothing better than sitting outside on a sunny day and enjoying a frozen margarita or a Corona. You do, however, have the option to order take out (for the nights you just want to hang at home!) or you can even get on your laptop, ipad or phone and place your order right on their website and it&#39;s delivered right to your door step in minutes! Now that&#39;s service.

Whether it&#39;s the cold drinks, great food or neighborhood vibe you&#39;re looking for - Café El Taptatio is where it&#39;s at. It was definitely my go-to Mexican spot when I lived in the city and I can&#39;t wait to go back next time I&#39;m in town!"

My very first order was a taquitos and a steak taco dinner. The taquitos was very good; they maintained their crispness through delivery and I was pleased with that. I was however disappointed that my my $11.00 taco dinner included two tacos and a tiny side salad. TWO tacos and a side salad. There was no detail on the menu so I should have called, but it never crossed my mind that  anyone would sell two tacos for $11.00. Not cool."

This friendly neighborhood joint will easily became a favorite and I would not mind coming here on a weekly basis- at all.

Their complimentary salsa &amp; chips was the perfect prelude to a fabulous dinner.  The tomato-part of their salsa was pureed very smoothly (which was new to me- Im so used to chunky salsa) but it was SPICY and definitely had a chile-infsued bite to it.

No worries because to wash down the spiciness our table of four (seated outside on their lovely patio) ordered a pitcher of their blended strawberry margarita, which we were told was the most popular flavor.  It was the perfect balance, the alcohol was not too strong but definitely present, and it was also fruity and delicious.  They have adorable glasses to serve the drinks and and each glass was garnished with a lime wedge, and then anchored by two mini black straws.

When it was time for the second pitcher (mhmm) - we went with the blended mango-tamarind which was a much thicker consistency.  Think mango-lassi but a mexican version.  It was really good and my favorite of the two.

This restaurant is where you can lazily linger over a relaxed dinner: from the minute you sit down until dusk.  They don&#39;t take reservations but I came here on a weeknight at 7pm and was seated immediately on the patio. We never felt rushed, the food came out in a timely manner and if they had turned on their heat lamps when it got chilly after dark - you would&#39;ve had to drag me to leave this place.

There were families with kids, diners who bring their dogs to the outdoor seating space, couples on date nights, birthday parties (they will bring you a sombrero) etc. Overall El Tapatio was THE place to go to see a snippet of everyone- from young to old. There is no way you cannot leave this place feeling happier, your stomach fuller and your soul more content.  El Tapatio has that effect.

I didn&#39;t go into too many details on the food because it speaks for itself!  I had the Tapatio Combo, which comes with a burrito, rice &amp; beans, a taco and a quesidilla ($11.95).  Now their service was beyond what I&#39;d expected because there was a small hiccup with our salsa-- our server was apologetic and to our surprise, at the end of the meal he gave us a complimentary dessert crepe, stuffed with fresh mango cubes and smothered in caramel and topped with powedered sugar.

They go above and beyond here, and I think the owner/manager even stopped by our table and asked us how we were enjoying our meal. Four stars for now, but easily a five when I come back... probably next week or so!"

Let me explain something important here.  Anyone here who rates this place 5-stars has absolutely no idea what good mexican food tastes like.  I grew up in Houston, Austin, San Antonio eating authentic incredible mexican cuisine.  Sorry, but this place ain&#39;t it.

I can remember being in College Station in 1982 when I had this &#34;new&#34; dish called Fajitas.  Honestly, it was one of those moments in your life when you realize just how good food can be.  They came out on this cast iron skillet just sizzling hot and piled high, not like you get in most places these days.  The skirt steak was marinated and grilled over mesquite wood.  

The beef was sliced in very thin strips along with equally thin sliced grilled onions.  The server would squeeze a lemon wedge over it, but the skillet was so damned hot that it evaporated in seconds imparting a just hint of citrus in a perfect balance.

As you can probably tell, I love this dish.  When it&#39;s done right, it&#39;s truly a work of culinary art. Which is why I give this place just 2 stars.  My wife ordered the chicken fajitas.  She has some food allergies, which is why she likes fajitas.  It&#39;s just marinated chicken breast, grilled over a wood fire and sliced.  Nothing fancy.  Easy, plain, delicious.

When her dish arrived, it was... I don&#39;t know what the hell it was.  Chicken slices with a tomatoey sauce covered in some soupy spice mix.  I mean, you needed a spoon to eat it.  Still remember the poor waiter&#39;s face... so proud of it.

Yet again, Chicago seems to have failed us in our quest.

My dish was awful.  It was one of the saltiest meals I&#39;ve ever had.  I really tried to eat it, but ultimately had to send it back and ordered the skirt steak... medium.

It came back...  super rare.  The meat in the middle was barely warm.  I&#39;m gonna send a meal back twice?  Knowing it wouldn&#39;t kill me, I stomached it down.  Both dishes were mediocre and amateur... all the way.  NEVER going back.

Look, I know what some of you are probably thinking...  This fool writer must think anything not from Texas is garbage.  He doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about.  Not true.  I&#39;m the firs to say that Smoque Bar-b-que is on par with if not BETTER than the best barbeque I&#39;ve EVER had... in or outside of Texas.  

If food tastes good, it is good.  I call it like I see it.  This place ain&#39;t that good."

I believe it was actually Eat24&#39;s fault because I ordered delivery again, but directly from the restaurant and there were no issues.  

The food was really good.  The only thing I would change if I order delivery again is to ask them to not put sour cream or lettuce with the taquitos because they get soggy.  Otherwise, they are really tasty.  I enjoy the salsa and sauces that come with the order.  The tacos and quesadillas are good too!"

Good atmosphere, reasonably priced I feel for the quality of the mexican food (this isn&#39;t your terrible cheap mexican place). 

First time I got chicken enchiladas in a mole sauce. It was fantastic, it was a poblano mole sauce which was really nuanced and tasted great. The enchiladas were cooked great and full of flavor as well. I would highly recommend the dish. 

One other of my favorite dishes there are the crepas de pollo. Pretty much 3 chicken crepes / enchiladas smothered in this absolutely delicious chipotle creme sauce. That sauce is the highlight of the dish and is truly fantastic.

As with any nice mexican place, one of the big deciders is the chips and salsa. They&#39;re great. The chips aren&#39;t oily at all, decently thick, and the salsa is wonderful. Though I hate when Mexican places charge for chips and salsa. The first to baskets of chips and salsa are free, but it&#39;s then an additonal $2 for more chips/salsa. I recently went with a large group and we went through quite a bit of chips and salsa, charging the extra $2 just seems petty and unnecessary. 

But I&#39;ll be going back, really like it and really convenient location."

As for the food... I can&#39;t believe I spent $50 for the most bland Mexican food I&#39;ve ever eaten. I didn&#39;t even know that was possible, 

I ordered the fabulous combo which was carne Asada, chile relleno, and a flauta. The carne Asada was alright, tender. My flauta was not crisp and I did not like the picadillo filling. I also HATED the chile relleno and could not eat it, which is a shame because it is one of my favorite things. I asked for no sour cream and it was definitely loaded on there. It was bitter and I also could not chew it. So that, $17 combo was a dud. 

I did not know that they added sour cream to the guacamole or else I would not have gotten it. It was runny and took away much of its substance and natural flavor. Plus it was a very small portion. Not even 1 avacado&#39;s worth. So $7 later... 

My spouse had the tapatias enchilada. He said that they were alright but only ate the stuffing. 

I&#39;m really disappointed but it happens. Not coming back here."

My only complaint was the big dollop of crema on top of the enchiladas of which I am not a fan. In addition, my friend ordered the shrimp tacos and requested the sauce be served on the side, which it was not. She was not a fan of the sauce and found that it completely overpowered her taco. Service was attentive, but it did take a while to get the check after the plates had been cleared from the table.

I&#39;m from Arizona, so I have a hard time finding Mexican restaurants that remind me of the brand of Mexican food in AZ.  Cafe El Tapatio is one of the few places that does.  I really enjoy their margarita selections and they are mixed well together.  But their food- I love.  I recently discovered the enchiladas de platano.  It&#39;s plantains rolled in corn tortillas with mole sauce on top.  It was amazing and hit all the flavors- the mole was a little spicy, the plantain was sweet.  It blew me away.  I also love their chips and salsa.  The salsa is delicious and the chips are always hot and just keep on coming!

The space is a bit of an issue.  I&#39;ve been here in the summer and in the winter and this place is definitely better in the summer.  The rooms are small and difficult to navigate.  But when it&#39;s summertime and they have their patio seating, it&#39;s much nicer.  I would definitely recommend sitting outside when the weather permits."

So, this weekend we mixed it up a little and tried Cate El Tapatio. I&#39;m vegetarian, my husband is not, and our kid is selectively picky. But, we all ate harmoniously. The patio area is great, and a pleasant spot for lunch or dinner. The vegetarian selections are plentiful- and the enchiladas de platinos were the bomb- sweet, caramelized plantains smothered in a creamy mole sauce. Yum. Serious yum. 
Husband had pork rib and potato tacos- he cleaned his plate in record time. We also tried the shrimp in coconut milk, served over pineapple; and it was one of my more memorable appetizers to date. 
Drinks were good- sangria was a little weak, but that&#39;s really my only complaint. Great atmosphere, attentive service and delicious food. Glad we ventured outside our comfort zone."

Make sure to try their tortas- they&#39;re not your run of the mill torta, bread is substantial but light and oh so good!

The side dish of rice, guacamole and beans was bland and meager at best. The water tasted and smelled so awful I wasn&#39;t able to drink it. Really bad tap water with a lot of ice.

It is typically filled to capacity for dinner so it is best to go early if you expect prompt seating, though at that time you may cross paths with screaming baby families. Everyone is welcome here. We come back for the fresh food and great drinks, but really enjoy the people more than anything. It has a family owned vibe which reverberates in the comfort food.

This beats Garcia&#39;s in Lincoln Square IMO, and is about equal to Campeche for my personal fav Mexican within Chicago. Better than El Tipico and That Little Mexican Cafe, but lol both places are an easy bar to be better than anyway. Great margaritas(and even beating out the ones at Garcia&#39;s slightly), and the food has never disappointed me here, unlike sometimes at Garcia&#39;s. I wish I didn&#39;t have such a bad record, when it comes to persuading and talking people into places I really want to go to, since I&#39;d do it a lot more with Tapatio. If only could finally persuade at least 1 or 2 of those infrequent times someone wants to go to Wishbone, to come here instead for a change of pace.

Belated New Year&#39;s resolution: At least put my foot down a lot more for coming here(&amp; over Garcia&#39;s, and etc.) when it comes to Mexican restaurants for family gatherings. And that includes even if I can&#39;t sway my sometimes reluctant friends into better places to eat."

Favorite dishes include the burrito suzio, which is bigger than my head, and the crepas de pollo.  The combination dinners also never disappoint.

We have searched Chicago high and low (well actually only in areas close to Lakeview) no tortillas was left unturned every salsa was tasted and as hard as it was we sampled every margarita we could. I had been to El Tapatio years ago and my memories about it had been mediocre, finally the day had come to go back and give it another try. I am not sure if my taste buds where out of town on my last visit or El Tapatio has changed either way I was impressed. The staff was very nice and service was great the atmosphere was just how I like it  the walls painted with numerous bright colors,  I think Martha Stewart might call it kinda cheesy festive.

The food overall was very good and the menu offered a nice selection containing all the standard mexican dishes plus a few unique extras I had never seen. Much like a egg role is a barometer of a good chinese place I think chips are a good indicator of how good a mexican place is. I am happy to say the chips were served hot and crisp a perfect thickness not to thin not to thick. They brought out two sauces to dip in one is a standard salsa but it had little garlic taste and a nice kick to it and one is a milder ranchero sauce they bring out warm. We started with the nachos and ordered the carne asade and the chicken enchiladas with mole for our entrees. The Nachos where excellent I normally am a queso fundido guy but I&#39;m glad I strayed this time and swung with the nachos I hope the queso was not to jealous.They put the nachos under the broiler for a bit and everything comes out as a bubbly hot gooey mess of good stuff. The guacamole on the nachos had a hint of lime lots of avocado flavor I&#39;m sure ordering the straight up guacamole would be a great call. The carne asada was a good portion of meat, cooked to a perfect medium still pink in the middle with a nice charred flavor. The dish came with tortillas  I asked for a mix of flour and corn unfortunately they where all stuck together and tore apart so it was hard to make a taco with them. The tortillas did not seem like anything special  and kind of a let down. The chicken mole was awesome great flavors if you like or wanna try mole this seems like the place to order it up.

The pitcher of margaritas seemed a little small for the price and they seemed more like fizzy lime then a real good margarita but other then that I have to say I was pretty happy.

Went back again second Visit

Quick update we went back with a few friends and the food was awesome once again the margaritas seemed better this time and the service was right on. We had to wait to be seated but they said we could wait at the bar across the street and they would call when table was ready. We even got to bring our drinks with us when we were called over. Pretty solid place 4 1/2 stars."

Full disclosure--I had brunch at Takito Kitchen earlier in the day yesterday.  I had their version of a Paloma cocktail and it was amazing.  The $8 version at Tapatio was garbage, literally untaste (I just made up a word).  I got the tilapia with the chile rub, and the fish was very well prepared, with a good amount of it to boot.  But the rice and vegetables were also untaste; just crazy bland filler.  Service was fast, but for me, it was actually a little too fast, at least for the prices, if that makes sense; if I&#39;m going to drop $15-$25 per entree, I don&#39;t want the food brought to me eight minutes after ordering.  If I wanted fast food, I would just go get it...but sadly, this is a thing with many American restaurants, and I&#39;m used to it by now.  For many people--especially those who are showing up hungry--food super fast is a benefit.

I drove farther to eat at Mixteco last week, and now having been to both places, Mixteco is the place I will go back to.  In Tapatio&#39;s defense, my wife thought her shrimp tacos were pretty good."

Can I get some chips with my salsa please? Yep, I could drink their homemade salsa it&#39;s so good. I could eat here every day if I had the fastest metabolism in the world, it&#39;s so good. Their food is awesome. Much higher quality than some of the other Mexican joints in the area. Every Thursday evening they have half off margaritas. WOW. They have the most savory dishes. I recommend their enchiladas rancheros or crepas de espinacas. OH WOW. So creamy and bursting with flavor. 

I don&#39;t know what else to say. It&#39;s just so good.

I just didn&#39;t give it five stars because sometimes the service people are rude, but that does not stop me from coming to the BEST MEXICAN RESTAURANT in CHICAGO."

We ordered the guacamole to start and enjoyed the warm chips. I ordered the plantain enchiladas which were incredibly heavy and rich. The steak dishes my parents ordered were more appealing. The beans on the side were delicious. Go for the margs as the main event.

We finally got our chance to dine in and really enjoyed our dinner there. It was the 3 of us and although they are kind of family friendly (lots of highchairs available), the space is kind of tight so I am glad that we went during early dinner hours so it wasn&#39;t that crowded and we were seated immediately. 

My husband and I split the beef and chicken fajitas and enchiladas.  Both were really good, although I enjoyed the fajitas a bit more--the meats were tender and flavorful and the peppers and onions were also cooked just right and not super soggy or mushy. The corn tortillas were fresh and the guacamole was well-made and creamy too. I also tried sips of his Michelada--it was a HUGE serving--but delicious and refreshing. 

They didn&#39;t have a kids menu but I asked if their quesadilla could be made with just cheese (their q&#39;s have cheese, chicken and peppers).  Our server said it wouldn&#39;t be a  problem and would I like a small serving of rice and beans for the kiddo. How perfect was that? They have horchata too so the kid got one of his favorite drinks as well. 

Super service, fresh food. Next time we&#39;re patio bound!"

During my last visit, the salsa was so runny I couldn&#39;t even put it in my mouth, our appetizer and my entree were brought out first and my husband had to wait, our food was cold, and the burrito in the combo was awful.
