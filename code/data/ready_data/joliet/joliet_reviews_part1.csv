I was a little hesitant, because setting up an event seemed to be a bit hard with actually getting a hold of someone. I am glad we were persistent though. 

The brunch buffet for our event was amazing &amp; delicious, lots of options, which I love! Our waiter was fantastic, give him props for dealing with 20 people pretty much by himself, they were very accommodating, and the price was just right! I can&#39;t say enough great things! 

Will definitely recommend! Thanks river view diner!"

I should say we have only been there one time for this meal, but the service was good, the quality was good, and the quantity was more than adequate. I found it to be a very enjoyable meal. 

However my previous reviews on the other menu items, remain as stated.
I think the menu is 5 times larger than it should be, and I think that the owner would do better training his cooks to prepare a few meals well, rather than to assemble many, many Items poorly.

On another note, he has recently added a very large, a very bright; almost blinding, sign that when traveling past it at night, is annoying and almost dangerous.

I think that the owner would have done far better to use that money on hiring a consultant to downsize &amp; improve his menu."

The new building is really nice and very comfortable and clean. Even though they were slammed for Sunday brunch, we were quickly seated. The bussers were fast and attentive, presenting us with cups of coffee and water immediately and keeping both topped off. Our server came and took our order quickly, but we never saw her again until she dropped off the check. If it weren&#39;t for the bussers, we would have been parched through our meal.

The food was better than average, but nothing particularly special. My wife and I agreed that we have had better pancakes, although these were good. The portions were sizable, but they should have been, since our bill was $29 for my wife&#39;s pancakes, bacon, and juice and my eggs, bacon, hash browns and coffee. 

Not a bad experience, but with all the other choices out there, the folks here might consider stepping up their game a bit, at least in the wait-staff department. I&#39;d eat here again, but it definitely isn&#39;t my first choice."

Friday&#39;s a fish fry heaven for those who look for a chuckload of fried favorites. Really good homey and traditional cabin dining feel plus you got a view of the fox river.

They serve breakfast the entire day and the price are very reasonable. Tried majority of the skillet combinations and they&#39;re very good. Just don&#39;t order for the pasta dishes since majority of the staff and maybe the cook are latinos unless you want your spaghetti tasting like salsa and taco spices. Eveything else is awesome though and did I say free dessert choices for any dinner orders (go for the pies)? Friday&#39;s are FishFry AYCE. I can only have enough fish and chips per meal, but you could substitute for a mash/bake potatoes if you want to mix it up. Some of the choices are cod, walleye, and perch. You can&#39;t switch to a different fish for every plate though and would need to stick with cod if you initially ordered cod. My personal favorite is perch, I find it more flavorful and lightly breaded. The broasted chicken is also a must try. Enough balance of crunch and moist on the chicken to go along with the mashed potatoes, the veggies are a little overcooked and not lightly steamed as I would prefer it.

The service is fast and they&#39;re very attentive to order details. Everyone&#39;s very friendly, like every knew each other. One time we accidentally left my son&#39;s ipad and they found it while cleaning up our table. The hostess kept it safe and I got it after an hour when in most cases it won&#39;t be returned. Kudos to your honest staff. I&#39;ll keep on going here and so far have really good dining experience."

Never had a problem with any of the staff, whom are doing a great job. The food has always been excellent. The prices are in line with most diners but those deserts that are often included with meals are absolutely fantastic and an extra bonus. Need I say more?

The host staff did an excellent job managing the wait.  Our server was great,  she had the cutest hello kitty tatoo.  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and did have great suggestions.  I had prime rib which I ordered medium,  it came out closer to medium  well or well done.  Since it was my first time I got both brown and chicken gravy to try,  brown was for sure the better of the two.  Wife and daughter had chicken fried steak with brown gravy,  both were excellent.  Mashed potatoes are from scratch and we&#39;re great.  Son had a meat breakfast skillet and pancakes all excellent.  We got 4 pieces of pie to go,  they look good.

The restaurant was recently rebuilt and is very nice,  my daughter said the restroom wad very clean.  For 4 drinks, 4 entrees and 4 desserts it was $72.00.  Over a great experience except for the overdone prime rib otherwise I would give it a 5."

Don&#39;t be fooled, they call themselves a diner, but there is nothing &#34;diner-ish&#34; about this place. It is a family restaurant through and through. But we love those so we still ate. Sunday afternoon, packed, which was a good sign.

First thing I noticed was how much real estate was wasted in here. They could easily fit a handful more tables and booths to ease with the wait times, and the counter (which has about 7 seats) was not being used. Why not? 15 people were waiting for a place to sit.

Prices are fairly steep, and this is the first time I&#39;ve ever had to pay to get fries with a burger. 

Speaking of, I got the &#34;Island Burger.&#34; Which they say is &#34;smothered&#34; in thousand island dressing. Sign me up! Turns out &#34;smothered&#34; here means 1/4 of my bun was lightly patted with dressing. How disappointing. Burger was average, fries were pretty good. The creamy chicken and rice soup was very good.

Before we got our food, we were planning to travel here again to try the breakfast, now we will pass."

Heaven forbid if we had a problem with our food since our server didn&#39;t even bother to come back around and ask us how everything was.

Its really hard for me to write this review because this was my favorite place to eat and now I don&#39;t think I will ever go back, seriously. They moved to a new building which is very beautiful but seems to have affected their food. Although the service is still great. I took my family out to eat which was about 8 of us. No one was really happy with their food but of course it was breakfast so we ate it and just decided not to go back. The home fries are cooked weird now, they are very hard on the outside and potatoes just aren&#39;t done on the inside. The pancakes that use to be amazing have changed and now they aren&#39;t as good, not nasty, just not that good. My brother asked for medium over easy eggs and he says they were barely cooked and he could barely eat them. I even stopped ordering my favorite chorizo frittata because the potatoes were hard inside and it just wasn&#39;t good and it was too expensive to order it and not eat. Im not sure if their griddle is messed up because the time before this we went they were having problems with their griddle so we gave them a pass on the food that wasn&#39;t very good, although they didn&#39;t offer a discount. I wish I was comfortable enough to complain but im just not which is why I wont go back. I can&#39;t help but wonder if other loyal customers feel this way. I use to come here almost every week. Sad to think I wont be going back. Oh well.

Moved to Montgomery and a few people said go to Riverview.  We went for the Friday fish fry (AYCE) walleye/cod.  The batter was crispy, which is good in my book, however the walleye fish itself was a bit mushy inside the batter.  The cod was dry inside the batter.  The hash brown side with onions we ordered were good (I&#39;d come back for those).  They did have malt vinegar for the fish which was a plus.  Wait staff really have no personality to speak of.

We are  minority family of six adults. We cancelled our order and went elsewhere.  I felt as though we were treated like second class citizens and we would Never dine there again.

I know having omelettes so huge they&#39;re practically falling off the plate is a selling point in 2014&#39;s America... But for those of us with a normal body mass index, I wish I could pay less and just get a normal amount of food. This seems to be a common problem across most (all?) midwestern diners.

The reviews on the lower end of the spectrum are pretty on point with what I&#39;ve experienced. When you&#39;re making omelettes this huge, you&#39;ve got to overcook them. It&#39;s simple physics, as to get the inside of a 6&#34; wide omelette cooked you&#39;re going to have to overcook most of the outside. Again, back to normal sized food, and being able to cook it, well, normally.

I&#39;ve never tried anything outside of the breakfast menu, but know this is the kind of place that has EVERYTHING. Want some Chinese? They got it. Pasta? Got it. Seafood? Got it. This might contribute to why everything is so resoundingly mediocre, as how do you be a restaurant that has great stir fry, pasta, breakfast, steaks, salads, and more? If a chef exists that can knock each of those respective cuisines out of the park, chances are they wouldn&#39;t be working at a converted Pizza Hut in Aurora.

You can tell the clientele who go here truly don&#39;t care about this kind of stuff as they just want two days worth of food for a small amount of money. If that&#39;s your thing, you&#39;ll absolutely love the Riverview Diner.

I&#39;ve only had breakfast here and I can tell you that this is another classic example where Huge portions dominate and &#34;doggie bags&#34; are a way of life. People love BIG portions and often will compensate this for flavor. Omelets are consistently overcooked, dry, bland and the opposite of fluffy. You&#39;ll need an extra glass of water to get this one down. Experience tells me the Chopped Steak cooked medium rare is the way to go!

If you must, get here very early to avoid a congested dining area where your conversation is overheard by all neighboring tables as well. I don&#39;t mind that so much, it&#39;s just too much information for me to hear everyone else&#39;s B.S. The seating in here is tighter than a package of sliced bacon!

The building is old and quirky with local businesses advertised all over the tables and coffee mugs. I ordered the patty melt with fries and a side of thousand island dressing. It was all cooked to order and tasted good. The thousand island tasted homemade and was really good. Troy got the 2+2+2 which was just 2 pancakes, 2 eggs &amp; 2 pieces of bacon. It looked average but the scrambled eggs did look nice and fluffy.  Alyssa got a salad (with no lettuce) that was brought to the table in a silver mixing bowl. I&#39;d never been here so I thought perhaps that was a quirky trait of theirs but apparently this was an error by the server who had &#34;just came back&#34; and she quickly returned it to the kitchen to be properly plated.
As for our server, she was attentive enough but extremely eccentric. Honestly, i think she was on drugs but she did a decent job so, to each their own.
My meal was only $8.58 with tax and I had some to take home so i&#39;d say I got my moneys worth.

New place is very nice, feels very comfortable &amp; clean and just a lot nicer than the old place that was in an old Pizza Hut location. Not that it matters as the food &amp; service is the main deal....but the new, much larger restaurant just is a lot nicer.
On the food, the breakfast&#39;s that I&#39;ve had are all very good---you order 2 eggs with any dish &amp; you get 4 when it&#39;s served! Anyway, I use a standard entree that I love to gauge these types of restaurants against each other--- BLT club. I have probably had this choice maybe 6 times at this place and every time--- it is just flat-out delicious. Fries are perfect (great, traditional fries--not the &#39;double-crispy&#39; ones that a lot of restaurants have gone to for some reason that I HATE!) and always very hot &amp; fresh and the soups are equally tasty. As I said, breakfast&#39;s are always done very well and the only negative I could come up with here is that they only offer canned corned beef. But most places like this don&#39;t make fresh corned beef and I don&#39;t hold that against them since when you ask, at least the servers have always been honest about it &amp; tell you flat out---which is a major plus in my evaluations of places. You want fresh-made corned beef, you have to go to specialty restaurants like Walker Brothers up in northern Chicagoland or Buttermilk in Geneva--- which excel at their homemade corned beef.

For this type of diner-type restaurant, I highly recommend giving Riverview a try as I&#39;ve always been pleased when leaving after a meal here"

A short update. As I dig the fish here, I have often remarked to Eleno the owner, that a &#34;Fish and Eggs&#34; special for breakfast might be a winner, as I have had that dish a bunch north of the Cheese Curtain. The problem is that I usually forget to order it, in favor of the other temptations on the menu. But recently, I went for lunch and as I walked in, one of the waitresses brought out a plate of fish and the lightbulb went on.

My folks and their whole circle are faithful regulars. Came home to visit. We ate dinner there and I was pleasantly surprised by the wide array of menu options. I opted for their prime rib and it was a good 13oz lean thick portion above value. The sweet potato side was an excellent option for we health nuts, but their vegetables were canned. It would be ok to raise the price $1 or 2 for fresh vegetables. Also for the server to offer the horseradish sauce. I had to go to the front to request it. The place was half full and moderately busy. However, there were 3 servers and 2 other staff members/managers. Rounds for water, coffee, and checking up on customers was minimal. If the owner/manager can get their staff to be a bit more proactive, with a couple tweaks, this place will have a 5 star rating when I return in 4-5 months. Along with the new addition they are building, I have great expectations for them if they can get all of their staff up to speed with proactivity. That being said, I have noticed many from the older generation only tip 10% (or less..a dollar or 2!)...Folks, it&#39;s 15% nowadays, 20% for great service! Servers must make a living in 2015!

For the chicken and cod, it&#39;s $9.95, for the all-you-can-eat walleye, it was $12.95.  I went for the chicken, my best friend went for the cod.   Both were fantastic.  Next I will try the walleye.  

When he re-ordered the cod, the 2nd plate didn&#39;t come with two little bits like most places.  It was 4 or 5 nice thick pieces.  

It even comes with soup and a dessert, of which they had about 10 choices of pie (delicious), ice cream, and I think it was rice pudding.  Even the potato choices are insane...fries, baked, mashed, hash browns, sweet potatoes, home fries, maybe even another option or two.  Or you could even opt for mac n&#39; cheese!  There was a guy sitting next to me that had the mac n&#39; cheese and it looked delicious.  

I would recommend this place to Jesus, Mary, and Joseph if they found their way out to the SW burbs.  

Certainly a place that doesn&#39;t care about the bottom line.  It seemed to me like their biggest concern is repeat business.  And the line out the door this past Friday spoke volumes to that effect.

Our bill for the 2 all-you-can-eats and a pop and an iced tea was $23.  I was so satisfied with the experince and our wonderful waitress (wish I would have gotten her name for you fine folks, very friendly young hispanic girl if you go there, you know who to ask for) I left an $8 tip, which isn&#39;t the biggest tip, but for a broke MF like me, a 35% tip means something."

This place has one big honkin&#39; menu.  Everything from breakfast stuff to sandwiches to chinese food to mexican food.  I haven&#39;t had all the ethnic stuff, but I will tell you, this place has some killer burgers.  HUGE burgers.  I am a member of the clean-plate club, always have been.  But...

I have a confession to make.  Rarely do I leave a lonely french fry on the plate.  I&#39;ve been known to eat the parsley on the side of the plate.  But, here goes.  I, Tommy M., hereby confess that I left one or more bites of my burger on the plate, as I could not finish the meal due to its massive size.

Burger, 1.  Tommy M, 0.

I ended up coming to this restaurant on an accident when I was hungry just patrolling the area. It looked a little run down but had a beautiful view of the river so I gave it a try. Best find I&#39;ve had based off an impulse. The food was great and offered such a large variety I&#39;m not sure how they stay in business! The service was quick and very friendly even for me coming in around 8pm! The waiter went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of. I started my river view expense with a Reuben and have back several more times delighted that the quality of food was a theme. The best items on the menu are their chicken and their French onion soup. Amazing place.

Typically, the mexican steak, the &#34;King&#34; burger, and the build your own omlette with refried beans, mozzerella cheese, chorizo, jalapeno, and homemade salsa are the top contenders. All absolutely delicious. Tommy M was right on the money when he talked about portion size. If you leave hungry... or even not completely stuffed, it&#39;s by choice and choice alone. Very good local business, extremely well priced, fast, fresh, good quality food. And every one of the employees are very nice and will go out of their way for every customer.

We stopped in around 8pm Friday night, and it was packed! Mostly families and older folks which, to me, is a good sign. We were seated promptly and presented with an enormous menu - American, Chinese, Italian, and Mexican - oh my! Lots of tempting choices, but we were on a mission: All you can eat! We settled on broasted chicken (not all you can eat) and fried cod (AYCE). After a short wait, our massive portions arrived and all convos ceased - we meant business. I tore into the chicken which had crispy, flavorful skin with juicy white meat. My fries were standard fare, but delicious nonetheless. The cod came with homemade chips, and was replenished until we just couldn&#39;t take anymore. Dinner was followed up by rice pudding that was warm, fresh and sprinkled with a perfect dusting of nutmeg. Full stomachs, leftovers in tow, our check came to $22! Riverview is completely non-glamorous, but I&#39;m giving it &#39;5&#39; stars for the family vibe, tons of choices, solid food and unbeatable prices - but mostly for the feeling you get while you&#39;re there - it&#39;s a true community place - and those are hard to come by these days."

New restaurant in one of those strip malls behind the Walgreens.  Got 3 tacos, chicken, &amp; pork @ $1.79 each, steak $2, Pork burrito $5.59, Horchata $2, and a Flan $2.99.  

Didn&#39;t like that the tacos had lettuce &amp; tomatoes rather than onions and cilantro, which is expected in Mexican eateries in caucasian areas.  The girl there said that onions, cilantro, and cheese were also in the tacos, but could barely make them out as it felt I was eating salad tacos.  

Pork burrito was a little better but was just average at best.  The flan and horchata ended up being the highlights of my meal.

Wasn&#39;t impressed overall, but might want to try their grilled chicken and steaks as its in their title as it might indicate that it might be what their known for."

But that&#39;s my fault, not theirs.  The food was good, and what I got would feed two normal human beings.  I ate it all and didn&#39;t want to die afterwords, so that&#39;s a good sign too.  I would recommend the chicken.  I&#39;d go back for that.  Employees were nice, and the place was super clean.  Since I work around the corner, if I need lunch again, I&#39;d go back and try other things.  I&#39;m sad I didn&#39;t read this first and get the horchata.

The shakes came out much better when they were remade. My son said the burger was good and I liked the onion rings. They need to open their drive thru though.

I began to scan the area as i waited boy did it look filthy!! Tables that had food on them and dirty plates spilled pop on the tables. Then the young lady directed us to our table, as I walked behind her I had stepped on something it felt like a pile of dog poop!! It was a half a burger on the ground! !

It took another 5 min. For our waitress to take our order for drinks.  I decided to hit the restroom to wash my hands and I seen that they had a warning sign up for wet floor not sure why until I went into the men&#39;s room. I walked into flooded bathroom and almost slipped and fell ! The girls restroom was the same according to my daughter. We notified the manager that it was unsafe for any patron to go into those bathrooms. He said they were aware of it , but that&#39;s just the way it is around here. He mentioned that he is a new manager and that he&#39;s doing as much as he can.

We walked in and it said wait to be seated so we stood there. A few associates were talking and hadn&#39;t waited on us so we found our own seats. One waitress came over at that point asked us if we wanted drinks we said yes water is fine. A few minutes pass still no water. Another waitress comes over and asked if we were ready to order we said yes. She listened to our orders but did not write it down. We knew something wasn&#39;t going to turn out.  When our food came my fiancés food was wrong. They took it back and brought him what he actually ordered. Then we didn&#39;t have any napkins or silverware so I got up and found someone to get us some. The fries were horrible. The ketchup bottle was so dirty on the outside I had to us a napkin to pick it up. As people were leaving no one was cleaning up the tables. The restaurant was dirty from floor to ceiling. The manager came out to talk to us because she heard that we weren&#39;t happy there. She proceeded to tell us that she has teenagers working for her and with her being on the fryer she couldn&#39;t watch them. She apologized and told us our meals were on her. That was seriously the worst experience at a steak and shake I&#39;ve ever had.

The Steak Franks are 100% beef, chunks of sirloin, and are offered in varying styles, including &#34;Chicago&#34; (mustard, diced onions, sweet pickle relish, tomato slices, pickle slice, and sport peppers); &#34;Chili Cheese&#34; (Genuine Chili, shredded Cheddar &#39;n jack cheese, and diced onions); &#34;Carolina Slaw&#34; (mustard, diced onions, and creamy coleslaw); &#34;Cheesey Cheddar&#34; (grilled onions and smothered with loads of melted Wisconsin Cheddar).

Steak &#39;n Shake makes frequent references on their menu to &#34;Genuine&#34; chili, and I have no idea what that means, do you?"

After waiting a while we decided to seat ourselves. A waitress walked right past us on many occasions yet never spoke to us. After 15 mins of no service, I ask this waitress if we can have some menus. She asked who our waitress was..... we got mad since all of the employees saw us sitting there and didn&#39;t do anything, so we left to do drive-thru instead. This was another mistake. We waited over 20 mins for our food with only 1 car in line in front of us. We counted about 8 employees between the people in the front and back. There were only 6 customers seated inside eating.

It does look like they tried to up their game from old saltless fries to offering a variety of different spices that can be added, as well as expanding their combos with a big $4 meal menu.

But, even with all that, it was pretty lackluster.

I will say our server, Alex, was pretty good. Got everything right and got things out as quickly as the restaurants pace allowed.

Probably won&#39;t return for at least another 5 years or so, if they are still around."

I ordered the Chili Mac Supreme, the dish came out overflowing with noodles and all the fixings but ONE issue. There was a teaspoon full of chili in the actual dish. I asked the girl to maybe add a bit more, she did and the manager told her to tell me it would be extra.

Now I&#39;ve eaten this dish dozens of times because it is what I enjoy and I&#39;ve never had issue with the amount of Chili they put on it until today. The manager wouldn&#39;t budge so I asked her to take it off the receipt and I wasn&#39;t going to be eating dinner.

I&#39;ve used my two most recent visits last week to rate them. One visit was for breakfast and another for a late lunch. 

Our breakfast was fairly disappointing with the only good thing we ate was pancakes. For an extensive menu I would think there would be more consistency and a qualified breakfast cook. Service wasn&#39;t too bad and we were in and out in about 40 minutes. 

Our lunch experience was trouble from the start. Even though there was a clear line of customers waiting to be seated and we asked if they were taking names (rude response of &#34;No!?!&#34;) only one of the waitresses was seating customers and she would point to a random person in line and say &#34;how many?&#34; Then seating the party at a dirty table not yet cleaned from the previous customers. Truly unprofessional. It took forever for our waitress to show up and tables seated after us had ordered drinks and food so I went to find a manager. The manager was running the drive thru and quickly asked where we were seated and said &#34;OK&#34; as she turned and walked away. No &#34;sorry&#34; and she never checked back on our situation. I don&#39;t know what it was her job to manage but she clearly wasn&#39;t managing a thing in the dining room or paying attention to the lines of people waiting to be seated or those waiting to pay at the register. Our food was awful. My chili was actually cold, watery, and the cheese never melted. When I mentioned this to our waitress she said she&#39;d take it off the bill. As the chili was my substituted item in place of fries we only saw a $.70 cent savings. She never offered to replace it with a hot one or offer one to go. Others at the table had an overcooked but cold Frisco melt, warm but greatly undercooked fries, and cold onion rings. The service was so slow I did see one set of customers leave after waiting too long for their food (they left without paying for their drinks or complaining) and our total time in the restaurant was a long hour and twenty minutes. 

The restroom was fairly clean on both visits and the entrance and parking lot were clean on also. At this point I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll bother getting off the expressway and visit this Steak &amp; Shake again. There are others we pass on our road trips that have been much better than this one."

The only downside to the Steak and Shake experience is the extra wait time as a result of &#34;made to order&#34;.  But this is not really a downside as that is why the food is always fresh.

Their shakes are killer!  Heath is my favorite!  

The Chili is very good, I like mine a bit more watery, but the taste is spot on!

Then our food took forever to come out and the restaurant was not even busy. When our food was brought out, one plate was missing the side of fries and the waitress forgot to bring silverware for the taco salad that was ordered. The waitress brought out the side of fries five minutes later, and still no silverware. She brought out the silverware after another five minutes and she only brought out one and never gave our table any napkins. Because she barely stopped at our table, we had to use the one napkin the set of silverware was wrapped in for both of us. We then sat at the table with completely empty dishes for at least 15 minutes before she asked us if we wanted any refills.

Tells me that &#34;sorry the other fry was for a different order.&#34; Which wasn&#39;t true, I have a feeling that the employees are making a game out of it and seeing how many people they can do this to. On top of it i never even received a receipt for my order."

I say &#34;tried&#34; because someone said they&#39;d take my order and then disappeared for a good 5 minutes or more.  I said &#34;hello...&#34; a few times into the intercom to no response.  I thought the clerks might have been pranking me, but then someone eventually took my order.  I pulled around and saw two cars in front of me.  One got their food and left and the next one pulled up to the window.  They got one bag of food (only part of their order) and at least 10 minutes went by, probably closer to 15.  I finally got annoyed and pulled out of line, without receiving my order.  I drove up to the Chick-fil-A in Bolingbrook, where I was in and out of their drive-thru in under 2 minutes, happily gobbling my chicken nuggets.

I get that Steak n&#39; Shake probably isn&#39;t recruiting from Stanford these days, but is it too much to expect even a modicum of competency here?  Chick-fil-A seems to think so.  Experiences like these sometimes leave me to wonder if the service sector we&#39;ve constructed within this country to instantly satiate bourgeois desires isn&#39;t destined to crumble into a fiery abyss of cynicism, revulsion and revolution."

Seems as though they had made the milkshakes but forgot to hand them out. No idea how that can even happen. So I pried open the drive thru window and started asking for my milkshakes.

I keep going back because I&#39;m hopeful each time they can turn it around (and, to be fair, the service and food we have received dining in at this location has always been good. For some reason, this location treats its drive thru as second rate customers)

This most recent experience involved placing my order, paying for it, being given only 1 of the 2 drinks I ordered and then asked to pull forward to wait for my food. 15 minutes later (with no other cars ever appearing in the drive thru line) my food finally came out as I was getting out of my car to go in and find out what was taking so long. 

And then I got the food home and found out it was not even what I had ordered. (The wife eats a Chili Mac, they gave us a Chili 3 Way. I&#39;m not familiar with these and cant tell the difference, but apparently there is quite a significant difference between the two.)

The service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and I&#39;ll be sure we get back here soon!"

Service was awful. Our waitress took 15 minutes to return to our table to take our orders after initially greeting us. She brought soup...no crackers or bread and it took a total of 10 more minutes to receive those items after asking.

We saw several individuals who had come in after us receive their food, but our waitress never stopped by to say anything to us concerning how we were or where our meals were. 

After almost an hour we asked to receive our food in to-go containers (from the hostess, because our waitress was not around, again) as lunch was over for us. Upon actually tasting my meal, it was terrible (soggy chicken Caesar wrap and cold fries) my friend also stated his simple breakfast was poorly put together.

I will not be returning. Horrible service and lackluster food."

In the 10 days that I was visiting family, we ate there three times.  On our first visit, it was three egg vegetable omelet, bacon, fruit and a turkey reuben.  Second time, was a breakfast burrito with onions, sausage, cheese and peppers and eggs benedict.  Lastly we sampled the belgian waffle and roast turkey panini with avocado, bacon, pepper jack cheese, spinach and chipoltle mayo.

The sides like the hash browns and fries were excellent.  Hot, not greasy, and nicely crisped.  The russian dressing on the reuben and the spicy mayo on the panini, were especially good.  It was nice that both came in separate containers so that you could control how much of the spread went on.  It just makes such a difference when you use fresh ingredients, and have a chef that cares about what he/she is serving even if it is your more basic comfort food items.

We had Emily as our server on our first and third visits.  Even though the place was full she never rushed us as there was a lot of catching up to do with my dining companion.  She was patient, friendly, accommodating and helped seal the deal push my rating to a five star experience.  Thanks Emily!"

Oy.  I&#39;m so done with this place. Silverware had caked up food on it.  

I had a tuna melt which was drowning in mayo..I couldn&#39;t even taste the tuna.

Good service..

The soups are very good, but not enough to make me come back.
 


**************************
Sigh...
Cooks still don&#39;t know what MEDIUM  RARE means..
STAY AWAY FROM THE PORK CHOPS, unless you like them flat, tough and chewy.

I traded them in for a chicken on pita..
Good soups. I had the tomato Rosa marina, and my husband had the  cream of vegetable.

********************************
Ugh.
The noise level in here is ridiculous , &amp; it can be fixed, by simply putting felt tips on the bottom of the chairs!
GEEEEEEEEEEEZ! !

Our server took 7 minutes to approach our table.  She brought the soup,  but no crackers..when we were completely done with our soup, we had to ask a hostess to find her, as she had disappeared.  Server claims they ran out of rolls, and they just got some in...she cocked an attitude as well.

Don&#39;t get the fried chicken,  either. Bland, dry &amp; overcooked."

Almost awkward how loud and fast she was talking. Well we placed our order and as she left she told us she was also the owner so don&#39;t me mad if some else serves your food!! WTF!! While waiting for our food we were just people watching and we saw go to another table and tell them the same thing. Again maybe just me but weird. We got our food about 25 minutes later. So not the quickest place in town. Omlete had the wrong ingredients. Ugh!! Here we go. Never got our side of bacon we ordered. Just a mess.. Not very professional at all. We I asked about our kids juice which is suppose to come with the pancake. I got an attitude and a older lady with short hair placed it on the table and left. WTH!!! Is going on at this place. Not one employee looked like they wanted to be there... Food horrible, service even worse!! Suggested...... Don&#39;t go here . Owner lady... Instead of telling people you are the owner.

They don&#39;t use mayo and mustard like other sandwich places and honestly I don&#39;t think it needed any of that anyway. Just meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato and a little oil to top it all off.

My garlic bread I got with my dish was burnt one time.  Another time I asked for pizza by the slice and they went to warm it up and left it in too long and burnt the crust.  The pizza sauce and the subs are pretty solid, but the lack of a little TLC for your orders is enough to make me go to Mangia much more often."

I came here expecting 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag Joe Pesci and got Casino De Niro.  I mean wow, just blown away.  You wouldn&#39;t think that this unassuming place (which despite their good effort still looks like a gas station) would have one of the best Italian subs this Yelper has had in quite some time.

I had the underboss, and it did not disappoint.  The sandwich was as perfectly crafted as the Sistine Chapel with the perfect ratio of meat to cheese to toppings to oil to I&#39;m salivating now just thinking about it.  There were a minimum of six other sandwiches that I NEED to try and a few others that caught my interest.  They have hot sandwiches too, not just the awesome deli ones.

There are also some good looking sides/salads.  I had a broccoli pasta salad that was simple yet tasty.  But there were a couple others that looked just as good.  

There were a couple cannolis there, but literally a couple.  Two wrapped together in plastic wrap.  I didn&#39;t get one, but if they have better packaging next time I&#39;m there I won&#39;t be stopped.

The only thing to note of this place is that you have to pull into the right side of the building when you pull into the parking lot.  You can&#39;t park in from and they don&#39;t have it blocked off.  Depending on the time of day it can be a pain to pull around to the other , Proper, side of the building as you can&#39;t pull through.  But that is a minor complaint once you get this food in your face."

If they did deliver we&#39;d probably order the pizza more often. I have to say I&#39;m not sure if that is still the case since I no longer even attempt to place a delivery order. The subs are the real winner here. They are always fresh, amazing, and authentic. Definitely the best I&#39;ve had. The subs themselves are worth the visit.

Madeleine (&#34;Mad&#34;) is an enthusiastic experienced chef and focuses on fresh ingredients. While she has a featured menu (www.Madwhatsfordinner.com) she also has daily specials. We tried the Turkey Cutlets and the Cabernet Beef. The Turkey Cutlets were generous portions of turkey, sweet potatoes, thin stalks of asparagus and a sauce for the cutlets ($11) The Cabernet Beef, marinated chunks of beef (tasting like sauerbraten almost!) came with barley/mushrooms and asparagus ($11). I loved this dish and my hubby loved his turkey cutlets. The dishes quickly reheat in a microwave and are packaged in compostable containers. Some may get two meals out of one dish--but I ate every bit of the Beef! Each dish comes with a dessert of three French madeleines (cookies). 
I would definitely recommend Madeleine&#39;s. Call ahead and order or stop in. Mad is open to suggestions and also does catering. She is definitely an asset to Lisle&#39;s food scene!"

   I always look to the off menu items...the specials.  Sometimes they&#39;ll last a week, a month...or a few days.  I recommend getting the special soup and the special entree/sandwich.  What you&#39;ll find is properly made, well balanced meals by a respected chef.  My recommendation is to come for a number of soups, and a number of specials in order to get a feel for his cooking, his execution of proper technique and his interpretations of flavors on food (ie: choice of homemade buns, flavor in homemade sausage/protein).  Really, where else in the area are you going to find a properly made demi-glace!  I mean, really!  Come in...and give it a good chance"

Not being packed on a Friday night, I was glad to easily get a seat. The bar had a really great seat to table height ratio; short women rejoice. I asked the barmaid for her favorite food choices, as I usually do for new places. Some just give me what everyone else likes, some actually tell me their personal favorites. She listed too many and I just settled on pizza. They have a huge window for half priced pizzas on Fridays; 4-10 PM. Which I also found out its for dining in only, unless you order a beer. 

I got my 14&#34; pizza with mushrooms and bacon, as you have a choice from 12 or so toppings. Pay per topping. It was thin crust and pretty tasty. The only weird thing (to me) was they cut it in squares, which I&#39;m not exactly a huge fan of doing.

Plenty of beers to choose from including both bottled and on draft. The only reason I&#39;m knocking a star off is because the quality of the pizza changed in the last few months. I used to be a regular when they would have their pizza specials because they were so delicious, but more recently they have become somewhat tasteless. Besides that, the staff are very friendly and attentive and the restaurant itself is very clean and inviting."

Fries are nothing spectacular and neither is the pizza. It&#39;s nice that they have so many handles but honestly didn&#39;t have a great selection. I&#39;m noticing the trend that places are installing many handles for impression sake, but true craft beer lovers know the difference between many handles of average beer and that of quality. They had Californian Laguanitas, and 3 Sheep from Wisconsin. They also had beer from a nearby brewery in Lemont. Other than these, nothing else very interesting. They did have a nice Whiskey selection. We went on a Tuesday night and it was semi-noisy. I would go back for a quick lunch for the burger but unless I see advertisements for some more stately brews, the ambiance is not enough for me to go back."

We&#39;ve been back maybe a dozen more times as we live about 5 minutes from here. The hours are a little odd because they don&#39;t open until 4PM. The same people own the Southern Belle breakfast place right next to it.

The food has always been consistent. The service has always been great with the exception of one server who gets confused pretty easily. The bartenders know what they&#39;re doing and are usually willing to give samples if there are any questions about certain taps. The beer selection started off really varied and interesting but has since devolved into a hop lovers paradise with not much in the way of lighter brews (pilsners, lagers, etc.). That&#39;s fine for me but my wife isn&#39;t a fan of bitter beer (her words) so she&#39;s hoping they come around.

There are about 15 seats at the bar, maybe 6 hi-tops that seat 4 each and 8 or 9 low tables that can be pushed together for groups. 22 large screen TVs mean everybody gets a view if they want to see whatever sports game is showing. Restrooms are clean and large. Like every other place in Joliet and Crest Hill there are 4 or 5 gaming machines along one wall.

The pizza here was a nice surprise as are the wings, stuffed jalepenos and mushrooms, and grinder sandwiches. all excellent. The burgers, wraps, salads,etc are all good. We haven&#39;t tried the pasta dishes.

We&#39;ll probably be somewhat regulars as long as they can make it with those limited hours..."

Drinks: come for the great beer and whiskey selection.  24 rotating mostly American microbrews and 100+ in bottles. Extensive collection of whiskey: at least 80 bottles of bourbon, rye, Scotch, Irish and the like. Tasty cocktails too if that&#39;s your thing. 

Food: the food is probably my favorite pub food in the area, but can lack consistency. The burgers are a generous 10oz with tons of choices for toppings. My favorites: Ring of Fire (spicy and delicious), Like a Rolling Stone (can&#39;t go wrong with bacon and a fried egg) and Revolution (cherry peppers, avocado and onion straws). Wings, apps and pizza are great too. 

People: staff is (mostly) great. Seen a few good and not so good ones come and go since the beginning, but overall I love these people. Especially the bartenders and manager/owner Nick. 

Overall: sit at the bar, ask for a sample or two and try a new craft brew, order some wings and a burger, and enjoy. 90% of the time, it works every time."

It was my first time here and probably my last as it definitely is not worth the drive from Aurora. Cool interior but the food was just average. Thought the meals were overpriced for what you get. The grilled cheese for $10 was a total joke and maybe worth half that. Very small and something out of a cafeteria. The steak sandwich was tasty and better. The half price pizza is a good deal but they screwed up our order. The fries are mediocre. Drinks are fine. This place definitely needs some help in the kitchen as the meals are very inconsistent.

We also tried the saganaki bites which are fried. These are worth checking out as are the Greek fries which are fries drizzled with olive oil, oregano, and feta cheese.

Of all of the mentioned accoutrements, the sport peppers have the most flavor.  This is just an average hot dog on its best day.

I ordered the #6 meal, which comes with a large plate of gyros on a pita, along with a generous helping of fries and a drink.

The gyros were good and the fries were just how I like them (hot and fresh)! Very friendly staff as well. Will definitely have no problem coming back for the gyros here! 

Did try the saganaki squares, but was not overly impressed...I&#39;m just used to flaming saganaki so I have overly high standards. Some people may love these, I&#39;m just spoiled. They do taste good, but I like my cheese more melted, that&#39;s all. 

I found this place by typing in &#34;best gyros&#34; in Yelp as my boyfriend and I were driving around....this is the top place that came up! Definitely happy with the find :)"

Only difference is I got the combo and the Italian sausage was the only thing that saved the homemade beef to add any flavor.  I hadn&#39;t eaten here since the 70&#39;s.  I think going away from Scala&#39;s beef was a way to control food cost but it just doesn&#39;t taste how I remember it.

Food both fries and combo came out SUPER hot so little chance of any foodborne illness here.  I wanted to try the saganaki squares but wasn&#39;t that hungry.  Plus an abundance of salt on fries kept me from eating many as my sodium levels probably went through the roof.  The air conditioning is clearly failing as it was over 80 degrees inside on a 89 degree day.

Very nice people here and I want to like them more.  At least they are getting an award from Vienna next week.  Maybe I should have just gotten a dog.

So my area rankings still have Portillo&#39;s #1 and Little Joe&#39;s in Countryside a close second."

I was tired of the nearby KFC and McDonalds. Of course I read the reviews online before I came. I was concerned because the restaurant was crowded and I only had 30 minutes to get my food. The line moved pretty fast, and the workers has their stuff together and in order. I ordered the gyros meal. I was pleasantly surprised when I checked in on Yelp with the 10% off order coupon. It&#39;s not much, but it helps. I was in and out in 10 minutes which is also good. I was anxious to see what the good reviews were about. The gyros was very good! Seasoned just right and not a lot of salt. It&#39;s rare that you find a gyros that&#39;s not salty. They used more seasonings and less salt. Very good and very smart move! The fries on the other hand was overcooked. I could barely eat them and had to pick off the overcooked pieces. They would&#39;ve got 5 stars, but the overcooked fries ruined the potentially perfect rating."

I was on my way home from visiting a friend and decided to stop here for lunch. It looked like a cool, divey burger joint and I thought there was no way the food could be bad. I was actually pretty excited. Perhaps my excitement is why this place is only getting three stars. It just didn&#39;t live up to my expectations. I got the burger and looked furiously for the burger. It wasn&#39;t easily seen and there was supposed to be 2 patties. When I bit in I was relieved to find they in fact did NOT forget my patty, but honestly it wasn&#39;t all that impressive. It was mostly just a big hunk of lettuce with mustard and ketchup and I&#39;ve had a million better burgers at little burger joints like this. While I don&#39;t expect them to be Portillos, I do expect to be satisfied after ingesting those calories and I was not. The fries were tasty, but the burger is supposed to be the main attraction. 
The ambiance was pretty nice. The counter area was a little chaotic but the dining area was spacious and had tvs on the wall you could watch. Outside was very pretty with umbrellas and well kept trees. The staff was also pleasant, although I didn&#39;t have much interaction with them so I don&#39;t know how they would act given a problem, but still, I like a smile when I walk up to the counter and they delivered. Overall, it was just way below my expectations, but not so terrible that I wouldn&#39;t give them a second chance."

I ordered a Beef &#34;dipped&#34; to test the waters. Upon delivery, the weight of the Beef was heavy as hell. The sandwich was jam-packed with beef and gravy to the point that the bread literally was screaming for help!

I needed a &#34;Bib&#34; for this one. A lot of gravy ended up on my sweatshirt.

The sandwich itself was a hefty representation by volume, however the gravy was the epitome of mediocrity.

In Chicago (back in the black and white days) I would get my food and sit on the curb in between two parked cars. This is a pretty big upgrade.

Good beefs. I ordered mine with hot and Lisa&#39;s with hot and sweet.. also a couple of orders of fries. When I say good, I mean they taste good, but unlike Portillos.. they actually fill the bun with meat.  This is not my first rodeo at Flips so I&#39;ve got some familiarity with the food. They forgot to put the hot peppers on Lisa&#39;s beef, she was a little disappointed, but I was already home. They have OK fries.. kind of your standard frozen fries, cooked crispy.

I&#39;ve never tried their Gyros and thought their burgers were good, but not special.

I don&#39;t know what it is about that sign that flippin bugs the crap out of me. They&#39;ve selectively covered over a part of the sign on Roosevelt... I dont know if used to say &#34;Scala&#39;s&#34; Beef.. or what. And if they used to use Scala... now what?**

Also.. it&#39;s tight when you get in the door.. the order window is right there and there is little space for a line.

Pretty good menu selection and I really need to go back and try other things.

They currently have a Yelp check in offer.. and I also get coupons from various locations.

I would really give a solid 3.5 stars, but I&#39;m going to try some other things and see if that won&#39;t edge up a bit.

I ordered the Ruben which came on not rye bread but that was ok. There was a ton of meat on the sandwich and the thousand island was nice n sweet but not over the top. The kraut was perfect.

On my very first day on Yelp I put up a whole bunch of reviews from collected notes of visiting hot dog stands throughout Chicagoland. One of them was Flips Beef &amp; Hot Dogs in Glen Ellyn. Since I put up that initial review the way I&#39;ve been writing has changed, and I figured this would be a good place to revisit and see if the food quality had improved since my first review and to provide a more in depth analysis of the food.

First off let me go over the establishment itself, Flips is a small little restaurant with a few tables set up on the inside. There are a few TVs so customers can watch ESPN while eating, and for when the weather is nice some outside tables with umbrellas. There&#39;s also a ledge with stools set up to eat at right across from the main order counter. The main order counter is where you can see the menu board, and place your order, and even see your food prepared if you&#39;re so inclined. In visiting Flips again I decided to go for a hot dog and fries.  

The hot dog I received on my most recent visit came on a somewhat dry non-poppy seed bun. There was a pickle spear on it that was fairly thick though not particularly sour. There were two somewhat wet and mushy tomato slices on the dog along with two sport peppers that combined in length were not long enough to cover the entire hot dog itself. This meant that I didn&#39;t get sport pepper flavor in every bite. There was a decent amount of mustard on this dog, the onion and relish were a little light. The sausage itself was a skinless frank, it was well heated. The overall taste was decent but the bun was dry and the tomato and pickle flavor really overpowered the rest of the balanced. I wound up having to take those two items off to finish the second half of the dog. 

I also decided to go for some fries here, they have thick and greasy fries. On the positive side, they&#39;re very crisp on the outside with a nice potato paste inside. On the negative side they are super salty and greasy. Ketchup almost has to be used to sweeten up the incredibly potency of the salting of these fries. 

Overall my experience with Flip&#39;s left me feeling it&#39;s still slightly below average. The time to get my food was more than one might expect, and the food was a little below average. I&#39;ve had some other items here over the years such as burgers, gyros and chicken sandwiches, but I haven&#39;t had them recently enough to detail my experience properly to incorporate into this review. I&#39;m going to stick with my original rating of two stars, but it&#39;s possible a second updated review may come along at some point touching on the gyros, subs or something else there."

From 2002-2004 they were still very good, in 2011 the gyros salad and plate were still great as well, but the burger was no longer good, nor was the hot dog or the beef. 

That being said, when I was there last year in November the service had really gone down hill along with the rudeness of the cashier and the cleanliness of the place. The bathroom was out of toilet paper and there was leaking water in there, the table that I sat at, had not been cleaned under-neath the table, there were fries, relish, and pickle under-neath the table and the top was sticky from who sat that before, yes they have surveillance cameras in the restaurant but the person who does the cleaning was not paying attention to the inside of the restaurant or to the bathroom, It was the middle of the afternoon and there were no orders ahead of me and it took way to long for a gyros, the person at the table next to me said his hot dog was not good and that his wife hated her burger and they will not be coming back. 

I ordered a gyros with fries, the gyros was dried out, the pita bread was stale, the fries were over-cooked on the outside, and very mushy on the inside, greasy and way too salty, I will not be coming back here and I will stick to eating my gyros at Jester&#39;s in Elgin whose quality has not diminished over time."

I&#39;ve hated Flips three times.  Which is very sad, because I want to LOVE Flips.  Their service is TOP NOTCH.  Like the kind of cashier that makes me want to open my own restaurant, so that I could subsequently steal her level of amazing.

First time I got a combo, and didn&#39;t like their sausage.  It just didn&#39;t taste good.  The spice just threw off the flavor, and the meat was dull.  It just wasn&#39;t anything spectacular. 

Then I came back for just a beef.  That was good.  Not great, but good. 

I would have been fine never coming back, but I was in the area and had a craving for crappy fast food.  Got a chili cheese dog and a gyro.  Had to go get gas, so it just sat there in the bag, in my car.  Baking in the hot sun, that crappy food smell just radiating.  You get that fake cheese sauce smell, mixing with that chilli, with that spiced gyro meat.  It was heavenly.  

And then I actually ate it.  Not the worst hot dog I&#39;ve ever had, but for sure in the bottom third.  The gyro was equally bad.  

It&#39;s a independent fast food joint with burgers and combos and gyros and hot dogs.  The service is awesome, the place is clean, the bathrooms are pristine.  I just hate the food."

The beef  is definitely not a hidden gem like someone else said, but a little above average.  Not even close to being as good as Johhnie&#39;s, Portillo&#39;s, or Mr. Beef.  I guess some people can&#39;t tell the difference between a good Italian Beef sandwich and a great/amazing one, or they own the place and are lying to get business.  I might be back to try other items on the menu, but I&#39;m not in a hurry.  I hope I just forget about this place.  The Gyro sounds good from reviews, but the beef sounded great in many reviews also.

There are 2 different listings for this business.  I think the other listing has more accurate reviews.  This listing has too many people commenting on how good the Italian Beef is.  The other listing talks mainly about the Gyro&#39;s.  I&#39;ll try the Gyro someday.

My Top 5 Italian Beef Sandwiches:

1.  Mr. Beef &amp; Pizza (Harlem and Irving)

2.  Mr. Beef (Orleans Street in downtown Chicago, not related to Mr. Beef &amp; Pizza from my knowledge.) 

3.  Johnnie&#39;s (Elmwood park, Arlington Heights)  

4.  Portillo&#39;s (Great flavor, but I don&#39;t like the aftertaste, something about it, has slowly been making it&#39;s way down my list)

5.  Al&#39;s Beef (It keeps growing on me every time I have it.  I did not like it the first time because it was different.)

Consolation Prizes:  These places all have above average beef sandwiches in my mind.  I will list as many as I can remember.  Duke&#39;s Beef, Coach&#39;s Corner, Bub&#39;s Subs, Chickie&#39;s, Joe Boston&#39;s, Frannie&#39;s, Pop&#39;s Italian Beef and Sausage, Tony&#39;s Deli, Nana&#39;s, Nottoli&#39;s, Tommy&#39;s, Buona, Capt&#39;n Nemo&#39;s, Joseph&#39;s Elegante, Augustino&#39;s, Rammy&#39;s, Teddy Fabs, Gina&#39;s, Mr. A&#39;s.  

There are definitely places I have missed and places I have not been to yet.  My list always changes, depending on if these places and my taste buds are having good days or bad days."

I&#39;m sure it&#39;s undergone a couple of ownerships (at least one) since then.  To date, my favorite gyros, other places skimp on meat (in a Gyro sandwich).  This place&#39;s sandwich is more like a Gyro plate as one needs to fork out some meat before one can consume it in sandwich form.  Although maybe it&#39;s just for those who consume it onsite, have never gotten it to-go.

Their service is pretty fast (even during peak times) and the staff is VERY friendly. They normally have ESPN on TV while you wait (nice touch I&#39;d say). Food is very good as it relates to fast food. While it is small, it&#39;s also clean. Parking can also be at a premium during peak times. This is another place I&#39;ve heard students (college) speak well of so that&#39;s another good sign. 

1. The place is pretty small so things can get tight during peak (lunch &amp; dinner). 

2. As far as the eats:
a. Cheeseburgers are very good. One thing that gets me is when places put more lettuce  on the burger than meat. That&#39;s not the case here. Made fresh and fast.
b. While not one of my top gyros, it&#39;s still very good. On some of my recent visits, I noticed that people put the sauce on the side. Not a deal breaker but worth noting. 
c. SOLID patty melt (I&#39;m a bit fan of grilled onions on my burger). 
d. I had the roast beef sub once and I may want to try it again. When I&#39;ve gone here, I&#39;ve been in the mood for a hot sandwich. I liked it. 
e. The beef sandwich is a hidden gem. 

3. One minor complaint (and it&#39;s minor). One trend I&#39;ve noticed is that places are going the McDonald&#39;s meals route of #1, #2, etc. Flips does the same things. As a rule of thumb, I don&#39;t eat fries often (I try to limit my high glycemic food intake). If you take the fries out, I want to say the price drops about $.50. Not much of a drop pricewise. 

All and all, stop and enjoy a meal. If you&#39;re not looking for it, you just might miss it. Burger rating: Monster."

Flip&#39;s looks like your typical divey burger and gyro joint, but they were pretty damn good. The outside decor is kinda fun and offbeat: they had sculptures of lions and deer on the outside with really funk and mismatched patio furniture, which I thought was fun. The inside has a long counter you can eat at and a few tables, but it really is a small joint, so don&#39;t expect to find seating for a huge crowd.

Tonight was the first night that my boyfriend and I had ever been there: I got the polish sausage meal and he got the italian combo. I loved my meal, although it was little on the charred side. My boyfriend;s combo had a nice spice to it, but it was a little overpowering. The fries were pretty good too.

The lady who rang us up was a total sweetheart: she was very nice and polite. The cooking line amazed me with how fast they got us our food and seemed like nice enough guys.

They didn&#39;t have a single patty hamburger, or a crispy chicken sandwich. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, and it was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before. I did like the spicy option, and the sauce was very good, but the chicken itself was gyro style. It was chopped up in slivers and served on a bun, and I&#39;m not sure how I feel about that. Their chocolate shakes are pretty gross. Very little chocolate, and I&#39;m pretty sure I took a lot of wax from my mouth while drinking the shake. It had an abundance of waxy chunks.

Flip&#39;s is basically just your average Chicago style hot dog stand. I&#39;m a connoisseur of Italian beefs, and I like to try up different spots. When I took a bite, the first thing that came to my mind was bland. It was pretty juicy, but it just lacked bite and spice, and honestly tasted like it was pre-packaged. The fries were pretty decent, but I don&#39;t come for the fries. 

I&#39;d still give Flip&#39;s a shot in the future, but I&#39;m gonna give it a 2/5 simply because the beef was so tasteless, I&#39;d rather get a pre-packaged, oven roasted beef sandwich from Rosati&#39;s.

Time of my visit: Dinner

I have been coming to this place for a while now.  This is by far my favorite shawarma joint!  Today did not disappoint either!

Today, I order shawarma with fries and a drink, as well as an Israeli (it might be called something else now) salad.  Let me start with shawarma, it was excellent, the meat was perfectly cooked, moist and soft chicken!  I took it in the pita.  Usually they put Israeli salad inside as well.  It was a perfect ratio of meat to salad!

The fries looked like home made chips, which I personally prefer!  And they actually made it home with me without getting too saggy.  Delicious!

The Israeli salad was actually a nice size for a side salad and had plenty of different veggies in it!  Definitely worth the money!

Overall an A+ experience!

Side note: I know this is a chain and normally I don&#39;t like to review chains, but this chain is limited to a small geographical area and each restaurant prepares things uniquely, at least in my experience."

It came with a side of &#34;fries&#34;, which are more like chips, but were quite soggy. Also, after ordering, I was told it would take 10-15 minutes to get my food.

It has a similar concept to Chipotle.  You choose to start with either a pita, rice bowl, or salad bowl then choose your meat (chicken shawarma, steak shawarma, or falafel), garnishes (chopped salad, purple cabbage salad, sumac onions, and/or pickles), and sauces (tahini, garlic, amba, s&#39;khug, and/or harissa).  

I tried their salad bowl with chicken shawarma.  I really love the flavor of the chicken.  It was fresh, tender, and juicy.  The crunch of the salad was a great accompany to the meat.  If that was enough, the side a pita they provided was heavenly.  It was soft, warm, and had a nice chew.  The portion sizes here are very generous, so come with a hungry tummy.

During lunch time, the lines can be a little long.  But don&#39;t fret, it seems to go by fast.  The staff here are extremely efficient and friendly.  I can&#39;t wait until my next visit."

I crave the Chicken Shawarma (also love the Beef Tenderloin) Five stars just for this. My wife and I are hooked.

The fries are good, The Falafel is sometimes outstanding and sometimes just good, lentil soup is excellent and the Baba Ganoush is babaganoushy. I have a high tolerance for heat, so I don&#39;t find their hot sauces all that spicy, just really tasty! 

Prices are reasonable, right around $20 for two meals. If you want Tahini sauce and it isn&#39;t on your tray.. just ask. 

Bright and lively atmosphere. The place get&#39;s packed at lunchtime.. we find that if we get there 20 minutes before noon the lines aren&#39;t bad, otherwise we shoot for closer to 1.

I have had the Kefta Pita which is a freshly made pita stuffed with very well seasoned ground meat, hummus, chopped salad, and sumac onions.  The combination is very delicious, but messy as the garlic sauce drips.  Be prepared to wipe your hands periodically.  I received one side dish and decided to get the Naf Fries.  This was awesome.  It&#39;s even better with the Tahini Sauce.

The cashiers are all very pleasant to talk to and very patient when I asked them what is good.  I have been advised that questions such as, &#34;What do you like to eat here, or what is good here?&#34; are all very annoying questions.  So, when I asked those questions to them, they were prepared with an answer and how they answered was in a friendly tone.  I&#39;m impressed by their willingness to entertain my questions.

I ordered the chicken schwarma plate (add a couple falafel) and he ordered the falafel pita. The prices were a little higher than I remembered, however I went home with a huge amount of leftovers for the next day. The plate will run about $12 depending on which one you pick. The plate comes with your choice of protein, rice, cucumber/tomato salad and a pita. There are also a few sauce choices that are left out so you can pick and choose. My favorite was the green. It had a little bit of a kick but the cucumber salad cooled my mouth down. 

The food is fresh so it&#39;ll take a few minutes for it to cook. Ours took about 15 minutes. You&#39;ll get a beeper and they&#39;ll buzz you when it&#39;s ready. 

The dining room is pretty big and I imagine it gets pretty packed here during peak times. There were quite a few people here, but still lots of places to sit.

NafNaf is to middle eastern food what Chipotle is to Mexican food. 
It&#39;s a healthy alternative to fast food for sure.  It&#39;s good quality and everything on the menu is safe for just about any person&#39;s tastes.  Just don&#39;t get too excited about this being any sort of authentic experience, it&#39;s not.... 
Somewhere like Pita Paradise in Carol Stream is much more authentic and the dishes will all have better depth to them while staying in the same price range. 
But, if you&#39;re an average suburbanite looking for something different for lunch, or if you&#39;re looking for something &#34;ethnic but not too ethnic &#34; then NafNaf is great.

I know Naf Naf&#39;ers would toss me out if they heard me say that, but it&#39;s true. You can branch out from the shawarma and order other things, people. And first on the list should be the beef tenderloin. --You can cut the steak with a plastic fork. And what to order with a plate of dead cow? It only makes sense to order the vegetarian feast. ;) --Purple Cabbage, Hummus, Tabule, Baba Ghanoush (tahini, eggplant, lemon, garlic, and olive oil) and 4 Falafels. I can&#39;t eat it all and I never reheat steak or falafel. It&#39;s terribly wasteful I know, but the combinations are just so good together, I just don&#39;t care.
 
Not much of a wait here. Even when it&#39;s busy it comes out fairly quick. Not immediate, but not long. 5-7 minutes. Not even on a Fri night do you wait much.

Ok but who am I kidding, most of the food is here probably great for you and you definitely won&#39;t get sick of it ever.  Some of the best pita ever.  Check.  Perfectly seasoned and grilled meat.  Check.  Lentil soup, which is probably one of the healthiest (disregard sodium) and tastiest soups you can get anywhere.  Check.

Its like a fast food restaurant but better food &amp; more healthy :)  (maybe healthy lol)

It can get busy but not much of a wait time.  We been there several times, even when its busy, food comes out fairly quick.  

Option of food, not much to pick from, chicken, steak, potatoes/fired food....

Food:
Pita is fresh! But on the thicker side I guess I should complaint...?!?!
Lentil soup is delicious highly recommended!!
chicken shawarma is delicious!
Potatoes chips are super super super good!!!

I know Naf Naf&#39;ers would toss me out if they heard me say that, but it&#39;s true. You can branch out from the shawarma and order other things, people. And first on the list should be the beef tenderloin. --You can cut the steak with a plastic fork. And what to order with a plate of dead cow? It only makes sense to order the vegetarian feast. ;) --Purple Cabbage, Hummus, Tabule, Baba Ghanoush (tahini, eggplant, lemon, garlic, and olive oil) and 4 Falafels. I can&#39;t eat it all and I never reheat steak or falafel. It&#39;s terribly wasteful I know, but the combinations are just so good together, I just don&#39;t care.
 
Not much of a wait here. Even when it&#39;s busy it comes out fairly quick. Not immediate, but not long. 5-7 minutes. Not even on a Fri night do you wait much.

I ordered chicken schwarma which was a giant portion (at least 1/2lb of meat) - it was nicely spiced and not oily. My meal came with 2 sides so I picked salad (fresh and tasty) and rice (again, a giant amount). I didn&#39;t realize how much food I&#39;d be getting so I ordered a cup of lentil soup which was way too salty, so not much got eaten. In addition to all of the above, they sent me home with two big pieces of pita too.

I have never gotten anything else but a pita here, but trust me when I tell you I have eaten here at least once a week (no joke) for the past 6 months (not exaggerating), and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ever going to get sick of the food :)

I was here on a weekend vacation and stayed with local family and we came here for my last dinner before departing and oh my goodness it was so so spectacular! My uncle ordered the falafel on the plate, I got the beef tenderloin on a plate, and my aunt got the Israeli salad with a side of hummus. All meals come with your choice of two sides (hummus, fries, Israeli salad), yummy garlicky tahini, and a basket of warm, delicious, soft squishy made-fresh-on-site pita. I was blown away. I think of myself as a Mediterranean connoisseur and I&#39;ve never had squishy fluffy pita. I&#39;ve always had the flattened kind that&#39;s unleavened but this was. Ah. May. Zing. 

Green spicy sauce for the taking along with homemade pickles. They look like typical dill pickles but they&#39;re not. They&#39;re a nice salty palate cleanser. So good. 

Would love if this small chain would explode and open branches to replace every single Taco Bell and McDonald&#39;s in the U.S. but yknow, life can&#39;t make that much sense right? Ha! 

Two entrees, side of hummus, and main size Israeli salad with side fixins- Our meal was $30 with one medium drink.

Not only is it noisy when there&#39;s more than 5 people, the employees are incompetent too (order foul ups on 2 consecutive visits). I&#39;m only one of three people in the place, but the counter woman who barely speaks English runs around looking for a beeper to give me. I convince her that it&#39;s not necessary and apparently that derailed her train of thought because she screws up my order. After getting my order corrected I proceed to eat a very mediocre meal that&#39;s way over priced. A pita sandwich with 3 small chunks of tenderloin, small order of humus, extra pita, and drink shouldn&#39;t cost $15. That amount and quality of food should be $7-8 at most.

Naf Naf once was a star in ascension, but it&#39;s clear they&#39;re in a downward spiral. I give everyone a second chance, but Saturday&#39;s experience was strike 3."

But when I have the opportunity to stop in here&#39;s how it goes down.  I&#39;m going to try to keep this brief because I could go on and on.  So.  For those of you that haven&#39;t been here this is the deal: 

1. Enter the establishment.  
2. Get excited but try not to look like a spaz.  
3. In a calm and collected fashion order the chicken shawarma, chopped salad, and basmati rice.  And some hummus.  
4. Find a place to sit down and enhance your calm.  
5. When the food is ready, smile and thank them.
6. Now eat.  
7. Savor it.  
8. Taste it.  
9. Let it become a part of you.  
10. Try not to freak out from the insanity.  
11. Write a yelp review.  
12. Then come back and thank me.  

That&#39;s all I ask.  Go.  I beg of you."

Years ago it was located in a tiny space within walking distance from where I live, and years into the future, it is still as tasty and delicious as ever! While I was working in New York over the summer I craved 2 things (1) Jimmy John&#39;s (2) Naf Naf

I don&#39;t usually eat vegetarian, but for EVERYONE I highly suggest getting the Falafel pita (or Veggie pita...it use to be on their old menu) at least ONCE. The few times that I have gotten the chicken breast pita or beef kabob pita, it is always juicy, seasoned and grilled perfectly.

I have never gotten anything else but a pita here, but trust me when I tell you I have eaten here at least once a week (no joke) for the past 6 months (not exaggerating), and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ever going to get sick of the food :)

What are you waiting for? Go get Naf Naf!"

All perfect words to sum up this jem of a spot! I was here on a weekend vacation and stayed with local family and we came here for my last dinner before departing and oh my goodness it was so so spectacular! My uncle ordered the falafel on the plate, I got the beef tenderloin on a plate, and my aunt got the Israeli salad with a side of hummus. All meals come with your choice of two sides (hummus, fries, Israeli salad), yummy garlicky tahini, and a basket of warm, delicious, soft squishy made-fresh-on-site pita. I was blown away. I think of myself as a Mediterranean connoisseur and I&#39;ve never had squishy fluffy pita. I&#39;ve always had the flattened kind that&#39;s unleavened but this was. Ah. May. Zing. 

Green spicy sauce for the taking along with homemade pickles. They look like typical dill pickles but they&#39;re not. They&#39;re a nice salty palate cleanser. So good. 

Would love if this small chain would explode and open branches to replace every single Taco Bell and McDonald&#39;s in the U.S. but yknow, life can&#39;t make that much sense right? Ha! 

Two entrees, side of hummus, and main size Israeli salad with side fixins- Our meal was $30 with one medium drink. I even asked for taboule salad AND Israeli salad instead of hummus or fries (trying to stay away from carbs... Except that damn tasty pita!!!) and they happily made the exchange! No problem! 

Naf Naf you are fab fab."

The chicken, steak, falafel. It&#39;s all delicious. All fresh, and all perfectly seasoned. The pitas are fantastic. The cucumber salad is light and refreshing.

Having traveled across the U.S. extensively for the last decade, I have learned that the same cannot be said for anywhere else here.  I was usually disappointed by even more expensive establishments.  As a matter of fact, I could frequently be heard as saying, &#34;this Baba Ghanoush tastes like slug slime!&#34; And &#34;Who puts potatoes in tabbouleh?!&#34;.

You can imagine my surprise when I stepped into Naf Naf grill with low expectations, and ended up having one of the best falafel sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had, and great hummus to boot.  I was wary of the meat (because I thought Naf Naf was a big fast-casual chain, and I&#39;m weird like that) but after this experience, Yelp reviews, and reading the story of their small, local beginnings, I have no doubt the meat is fresh and delicious too.

Being a vegetarian stinks at times, but Naf Naf grill I may never tired of. Their falafel and pita bread are the best around. I can honestly say no other place compares. The falafel is always fresh and the perfect texture. The pita bread is like little clouds of heaven. The pita bread is so fluffy and soft, I&#39;d gladly make myself a life size pita blanket :) The garlic sauce is so good. I&#39;m not sure what they mixed together to make it, but I dip everything in it when I&#39;m there.

My big irritation though is their fries. Before I proceed, they are not fries, they are like chips. Simply put, they are soggy chips. It&#39;s like they dipped them in warm oil, dried them a little and threw them together. My way around this is to ask for them extra crispy. Once they get the extra crispy memo they are perfect though! 

What&#39;s even better, is my husband and I can split the falafel pita meal and both eat for less than $9."

The falafel that I ordered? Well, I&#39;ll have the shawarma next time. It&#39;s not that it was bad, it just didn&#39;t have much flavor to it.

The staff was friendly and helpful and the bathrooms were clean. We&#39;ll definitely be going back for lunch some weekend."

- Food is fresh and made to order, always love places that hide nothing - all cooking done in front of you
- Staff all seemed nice and had a sense of urgency to get you your food quickly and accurately
- Priced well, you&#39;ll spend more than typical fast food but the value is there for the money (~$12 a platter)
- The shwarma is great, but takes a bit longer so if you are starving get something else
- Hummus is excellent, and the bread is fresh and tasty"

The pitas seriously cannot be missed, sort of like eating a heavenly cloud of carbs. We love to pickup a six pack of pitas to go for an easy dinner the next night, feels like eating out again at a fraction of the price. Or throw them in the freezer, they heat up nicely in the microwave or toaster.

My personal favorite is the veggie feast, with its crispy crunchy falafel partying with the creamy rich hummus, it&#39;s a winning combo. I always sub out the tabule salad for the Israeli salad

I always get the same thing: chicken shwarma on a plate with double Israeli salad, and a balklava. The chicken shwarma is this absurdly flavorful spit-roasted chicken that is always moist and tender, cut into strips. Then you get pitas which are warm, pillowy perfection, AND tahini, AND this weird hot pepper mix that I don&#39;t dare eat, AND the Israeli salad which is a cucumber-y delight! My mom loves their fries (which are potato chips. Right?! Why are these called fries?) but I can&#39;t get past that unusual and delicious salad. 

The baklava is packaged and ready to go at the counter, but tastes fresh every time, and is an incredible sweet ending to a delicious meal. Also, it looks really hard to make and like something I couldn&#39;t possibly recreate, so props to them.

The food is so fast and even with a drink, is in the $10-$12 standard lunch fare in the area range. I never eat there because they desperately need more space and the place is horrifically claustrophobic, but I generally like going to these types of places for &#34;to-go&#34; orders, anyway.

The hot and tahini sauces were both great too. I love Mediterranean food and this was some of the best, especially considering the price and speed.

SERVICE: 5 stars - This is an order/pay and get your food at the counter type of place. They get 5 stars for service because they seemed to be very efficient even though it was extremely busy. They also give a buzzer so you know when your food is ready at the counter thus helping lessen confusion. 

ENVIRONMENT: 4 stars - The acoustics and space could use so work but a loud, packed place is somewhat expected for such a busy, fast paced place."

The surroundings were pleasant if somewhat bland, both on the outside (strip mall) and inside (aside from some amusing signage, kind of like a Noodles &amp; Company).  The food was what shone though.  Meat dishes were juicy and seasoned just right.  My wife enjoyed the schwarma and the kids liked the chicken thigh pitas.  I went purely vegetarian, and all in our group had hummus and pitas.  Everything tasted fresh and flavorful, and portion sizes were generous.  The available desserts, like baklava, were a nice conclusion to the meal.  Prices were reasonable for quick-service, and the staff was friendly.

My friends got a pita (pretty good size) and the veggie feast and they were happy with their food too.  Both of the stars in this review are for the food, because the rest of the experience was not so great.

For starters, the restauarant is crowded and noisy as can be.  I guess this could be seen as the spoils of victory, as this is a popular lunch spot.  

But the deal breaker was that it took forever to get the food.  We did not ask for anything special and it took almost 20 minutes to put our order together.  During this time we watched as the dine-in customers that came in after us got the exact same items that we ordered served to them in less than 5 minutes.  

We were frustrated by this, and it is enough to keep us from returning.  They probably will not miss the business though, because they have plenty of customers and can afford to alienate a few..."

Most times when a place has a diverse menu, they don&#39;t do a good job because there&#39;s no focus. Chuck&#39;s isn&#39;t like that! I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a bad thing on the menu. I recommend the po&#39;boy or one of the salads. Chuck has his own garden, so a lot of the veggies are locally grown and fresh.

I really do wish I could give them a better review but I can&#39;t. Overall, their BBQ is &#34;famous&#34; because, well, they&#39;re the only BBQ place around being that Darien isn&#39;t exactly (ok or even close) to the BBQ capital of the world. 

Inside and out this place is confusing. Is it an old VFW hall? A former funeral home? Obviously they&#39;re just as confused since they call themselves a &#34;Mexican, Barbecue, Southern&#34; restaurant. More like none of the above. Their breakfast is great I&#39;ll give them that. If you&#39;re not here for breakfast well I&#39;d suggest taking your money and appetite elsewhere. 

As for lunch, dinner, and their so called &#34;late night menu&#34; everything I&#39;ve tried is bland and boring to those who don&#39;t live within a three mile radius of this place. My most memorable experience here was when I ordered from their &#34;late night&#34; menu (it was 10:15pm that&#39;s hardly late night but whatever) and I ordered the wings. The wings come with celery, which I can&#39;t stand, so I asked if I could have some carrots instead. Our waiter did the best he could so no offense to him BUT THE KITCHEN DIDN&#39;T HAVE CARROTS! How does a kitchen that specializes in not one, not two, but three cuisines fail to have carrots? Especially when they&#39;re supposed to be in your salads! I think that sums up their culinary skills in a nutshell. 

Lastly, be careful when it comes to the popcorn machine during football season. It&#39;s germ city and the employees could care less!"

I had the rib combo, having tips as my second part of the combo. Average at best, a bit dry and chewy on the ribs, they were also barely warm... Not very appetizing.
I went with the Mac and Cheese and baked beans as my sides, Nothing special with either of them. 

We both had the chicken and rice soup, which was delicious but the food came out so fast, within minutes of getting the soup I didn&#39;t get a chance to finish it. 

Service was great, but it wasn&#39;t enough to sway my thoughts. Probably won&#39;t be back for quite a while."

The restaurant also boasts an extensive beer list. Many beers on tap are brewed locally. For example, they have beers from Miskatonic, Buckledown, Pollyanna, Lagunitas, and Revolution to name a few. 

My past few dining experiences at Chuck&#39;s have been positive. My go-to entree is the pulled chicken sandwich. It is always tender; you could basically eat it without teeth. A while back, Chuck&#39;s had a fried mac and cheese appetizer, which was outstanding. It came in the form of big fried balls. For some reason, this is no longer on the menu. I would really like to see the fried mac and cheese return. Uncle Bub&#39;s, a BBQ restaurant in Westmont similar to Chuck&#39;s, has the fried mac and cheese balls and they are a favorite of mine. When I had Chuck&#39;s fried mac and cheese, I found it considerably better than Uncle Bub&#39;s. So I recommend bringing it back. 

The dining area is spacious and classy. There is plenty of seating, from booths to tables to the bar. They also have a nice electronic board that updates the beers on tap. This is situated in the dining room. On the walls are logos from breweries, including many that are local.  

In sum, if you are searching for some good BBQ and you enjoy craft beer, check out Chuck&#39;s Southern Comforts Cafe."

Listen, people, I&#39;m a recovering food addict (no joke, I&#39;ve lost over 110lbs), so I&#39;ve eaten A LOT of barbeque in my days. This ex porker knows her food; I know a good ole&#39; B.B.Q. joint when I see one. 

This place makes my heart happy, my tummy full, and my taste buds yearning for more every time I go.  My top two recommendations are - 1. pulled pork (perfection) 2. ribs (bae) MUST. get the combo too and try both; no one&#39;s judging. I personally didn&#39;t care for the brisket but I don&#39;t think brisket is my thing, tbh. I&#39;ve never liked it that much. :( Amateur move, I know. 

As for the sides - 1. Mashed potatoes 2. Mac N Cheese 3. Coleslaw. I&#39;d skip the green beans if you don&#39;t like spicy food - they have quite the kick! but when I read they were made with bacon I had to try them out. Nah. I&#39;ll be skipping these next time. 

As an added bonus, they have an EXTENSIVE beer list, cocktail specials on Thursdays, and a patio that is insanely spacious to accommodate all the people looking to get their arteries clogged like me, yay! Ha.

We were given a generous amount of drink tickets, good for sample pours of beer from local breweries (Goose Island, Urban Legend, Ten Ninety, Church Street, Buckle Down, Gordon Biersch, Exit Strategy, Lagunitas, and more!) and wine from Cooper&#39;s Hawk.  This event was a beer snob&#39;s paradise.  My favorite beer of the night was the Apricot Ale from Ten Ninety Brewing, located in Glenview.  I also used a lot of my tickets on the Sparkling Almond Wine from Cooper&#39;s Hawk.

A generous amount of food was served buffet-style by Chuck&#39;s including pulled pork sliders, chicken tenders (spicy and Korean style), two soups (corn chowder and a green chile soup), and staff served passed trays of mini chicken and pork nachos.  The corn chowder was my favorite, served with cubes of Mexican cheese and dusted with a sprinkling of chili powder.  Everything was very good.

We ate at the other Chuck&#39;s location, in Burbank, and I wasn&#39;t impressed, but I really liked the food served here, so I wouldn&#39;t discount Chuck&#39;s for another visit.

The event was held in the banquet hall which is much more impressive inside than it is on the outside.  The hall is lovely, really mostly a blank canvass for your creative mind, with elegant chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.

We really enjoyed ourselves at the event, and now I look forward to heading up north to Ten Ninety brewing sometime and returning to Chuck&#39;s for a meal."

Even though we&#39;ve moved out to Arlington Heights, Chuck&#39;s is still one of our favorite places to go (and not just for drinks!!!) The staff is always so friendly and great with suggestions! I&#39;ve tried multiple items here. My favorite for breakfast would have to be either the Bananas Foster French Toast or the Cajun Cakes Benedict. I can&#39;t even begin to tell you my favorite lunch/dinner options because everything I&#39;ve tried has just been incredible! You can tell that they really put love into each meal. The barbecue is to die for- especially the Korean sauce or the honey chipotle sauce. The stuffed prawns or stuffed mushrooms? You better believe they&#39;re life changing. They come drenched in cheesy, garlicky goodness. If you can- try to check out a tapas Tuesday so that you can try a little bit of everything!!! 
Main point- if you like southern, barbecue, or Cajun food, this place is a MUST HAVE. So glad that they expanded from their Burbank restaurant to Darien and I can only hope that they&#39;ll also move to the Northwest suburbs!!!"

We first visited the Darien location about a year and a half ago.. it was OK but I thought that we needed to give it another try to see if that just OK experience was indicative of the location.. or just a blip on the radar. Obviously this experience kept us from rushing back.

We walked in just before noon on a Sunday.. I was having a &#34;man-date&#34; (his daughters terminology, not mine) with my old buddy Mark who was in town for a couple of days.

We walked in at 11:50 and they said that they wouldn&#39;t be seating for lunch for 10 minutes.. no biggie... Mark and I have a lot of catching up to do.. half an hour later.. we are still the only people waiting so we check with the hostess.. they forgot about us and seated us right away.

I&#39;m not a big fan of their gumbo, it&#39;s more of a seafood chowder to me, that doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not good.. I just prefer a style more similar to Heaven on Seven.. with a thick roux, Andouille and a small mound of white rice. So I got their Chucks Red which is a really tasty chili and worth the trip.

Mark got the gumbo, thought it was OK.. wished he&#39;d gotten the Chuck&#39;s Red too. He made the gumbo one of his three choices for the BBQ sampler. He thought the ribs were really good and the Hot Link was excellent when it was hot (I tasted it, yum) but lost something as the temperature cooled.

It was Sunday and the special of the day is Mexican pot Roast... you don&#39;t have to ask me twice!

When it came out, I was a bit disappointed.. it&#39;s not the prettiest dish in the world. Fortunately, I approached this with an open mind.. because it was pretty damn delicious. The potatoes were mashed with cheese in them (yum) and the mixed veggies were more like stuffing veggies. Everything was swimming in the Au Jus and was terrific as is.. BUT! I had me some fresh tortillas and when I made some Pot Roast/Mashed Potato Tacos.. that pretty much sealed the deal! Also, as a side note there was virtually no fat on the meat.

So, Mark was a little disappointed in his food. Mine was quite good. He was shocked that my food was quite a bit less expensive than his.

I don&#39;t love the atmosphere at this spot either, it&#39;s not indicative of the style of food. But I think that&#39;s a function of the location doing a lot of catering and events.

Hot sauces (had to ask for them) are the El Yucateco brand, good sauces.. they brought out all three and I immediately went for the Hottest one (That&#39;s the one that is NOT brightly colored) I like these and they are acceptable.. it would be fun if they offered some sauces to try that I can&#39;t buy at the local Jewel."

I mean fried chicken, BBQ and so forth. Well, Chuck&#39;s Southern Comforts Cafe is here to deliver, with a range of southern and Cajun treats to nourish you. 

Oddly enough, the feller and I didn&#39;t even go with the most southern stuff on the menu. Well, we did start out with a special of some sort of Cajun-spiced shrimp, which were indeed spicy as advertised, and we retained the plate to keep mopping up the sauce with the little twisted footballs of bread that were provided. 

He went more southern than me and got the gumbo, which did indeed have okra in it (a point of contention among gumbo-eaters: I lived in New Orleans and have listened to this argument many times -- is it real gumbo without okra in it?! Well, this was real, and really tasty, according to himself.)

What appealed to me that night was the Caesar salad, with an unusual jalapeno-lime dressing (again, spicy!), with grilled chicken added. usually a Caesar is just a Caesar, but the dressing added a fun zip that was different and memorable. 

Our waitress Ariel was friendly and fun and took good care of us. We had a back booth that was quieter as it was tucked away from the more bustling area of the restaurant, overall it was pretty busy.

The restaurant is very big, and they also have a banquet hall on-site (and do catering too), so this place is no secret. So the next time you need a shot of southern comfort, look to Chuck&#39;s!"

This place was pretty empty for lunch so I&#39;m curious as to why everything took so long. However, the wood paneling and low, yellow lighting gave the place a southern feel authentic enough to convince someone who has no real experience of the south (me).

Everything is super down home southern comfort food so if you&#39;re on a diet, congratulations you played yourself. The menu enormous so we asked the waitress to suggest something to us and she proceeded to recommend like 20 dishes. Thanks bro. She also wasn&#39;t great with describing the food to us; we were pretty new to the world of complex meat orders. It took us maybe ten minutes to decide what we wanted, eventually opting to split mozzarella sticks and a BBQ combo of a half rack of ribs + pulled pork. 

The mozzarella sticks arrived in good time and were delightful as deep-fried cheese-centered sin bombs always are. The main order took some time. We both ordered sides of Mac &#39;n&#39; Cheese, and it was like a sticky cheesy little bowl of heaven A+. I don&#39;t know what possessed me to pour barbecue sauce over it but it happened and I have regrets. Pulled pork was decent but the portion was rather small. I will admit to knowing very little about ribs, but these ribs were AMAZING and I couldn&#39;t get enough. gooooooood shit, but only a half rack :( that combo meal definitely did not last as long as we had hoped, so we looked at ordering some more.

 We had some questions about the rib tips since neither of us had ever had them, and the waitress again proved less than useful, rattling off information that was already on the menu and clearly insufficient for meat noobs such as ourselves. She also failed to tell us anything relevant about the barbecue sauce, saying the North Carolina sauce was a vinegar-based sauce in which the vinegar could not be tasted. we had already tried the sweet mesquite sauce, and she vehemently described the mild sauce as &#34;mild&#34;. We went with the NC, which, for the record, was quite vinegary. Also, rib tips are good but super fatty, even in comparison to the rest of the food here. 

The damage at the end of the meal was around $21 for each of us. pretty steep.

tl;dr delicious and rich food (RIBS), largely unhelpful service. I&#39;ll probably come here again though bc omggggg the ribs"

I got the beef brisket dinner and while the brisket was tender , juicy and just the right amount of smoke the sides were ehhhhhhh ok.

As for food, it was good, but I&#39;ve had better BBQ at Q in La Grange. I had a pulled pork sandwich with potato salad and mac n cheese. The pork was tender, but I found the sauce too sweet. The mac and cheese was creamy, but it tasted like it was made with some kind of cheap american cheese or something. The potato salad was a little sour, I like mine a little sweeter.

At first the night started off fine. The bartender seemed attentive. I ordered a beer and was served immediately. I finished that beer and waited 10-15minutes for the bartender to return and see if my friends and I needed another drink. This wouldn&#39;t have bothered me as much but there were two employees behind the bar and exactly 8 patrons sitting at the bar. To add to my frustration I had to sit there parched as I watched these two employees eating behind the bar right in front of everyone. I really don&#39;t want to complain because I like Chucks. The food is good and beer selection is excellent. Towards the end of our visit the bartender returned and felt compelled to tell me how she felt about my mustache. She asked me why I was growing a mustache to which I explained that it was November and I was doing it in an effort to raise awareness for prostate cancer. She didn&#39;t like my mustache, no big deal, but she explained, and I quote, &#34;you look like a pedophile&#34;! That was it for me. We left shortly after that. Between the terrible service and being ridiculed and harassed, i will never support Chucks in Darien again. It&#39;s a shame because I liked this place and have been there many times.

We had a bridal shower for my daughter here and I&#39;m so glad we did.  We were allowed in to the room early in order to decorate.  We had plenty of tables for gifts and other decorations and the seating was perfect.  The banquet room is HUGE but they have dividers that section off your room according to the number of people you have.  They started serving right on time, bringing out the salads first, followed by mashed potatoes, smoked chicken, pulled pork, mac &#39;n cheese and warm rolls and butter.  (The Ranch dressing was spectacular.)  The wait staff was very polite and attentive and the banquet manager stopped in often to see how things were going and if we needed anything.  The dessert was apple cobbler with ice cream which everyone loved.  

When we booked this venue, we had many choices for our menu and they can serve it plated or family style.  We chose family style since it does promote conversation.

We were so impressed, that we even hired Chuck to cook for our wedding. We were excited when the Darien location opened - it has a different vibe than Burbank, but still offers the great southern cooking and BBQ that makes Chuck&#39;s great. Recently we enjoyed Tapas Tuesday, where they offer small plates of not only some favorites, but other great selections that are reserved for this event. Not only does Chuck&#39;s offer daily rotating food and beer specials, but there are special offerings for Blackhawks and other sporting events. By far our favorite place for BBQ and other foods!!"

That was a Very Bad First Impression... I don&#39;t know what they call that in the restaurant business. if you look at a regular menu and you see advertising in print for 1/2 price appetizers during happy hour ,one would only expect that the appetizers are half-price.... I guess I was wrong...

The two of us finished breakfast and still the other poor man was still waiting to eat.it is a shame that such a good restaurant has poor service.

I went with their special which was a garden skillet.  The waitress said it had all garden veggies in it.  The dish was good, but not great.  The veggies and potatoes were a little burnt, and I was disappointed that the garden skillet didn&#39;t include any tomatoes.  It was chock full of tasty peppers, onions and green beans though.  The biscuit and gravy side was ok.  I thought the gravy was good, but the biscuit tasted like it was from a can.

The wait staff was awesome.  Everyone had a smile on their face and seemed happy to be there.  Our waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable.  The coffee and water was full at all times, and they promptly cleaned our plates away.

Our food was outstanding.  Large portions that we have come to expect from Chuck&#39;s but piping hot and fresh (unlike past experiences).

We went to Chuck&#39;s again last Friday night during the Hawks game and experienced the same great service and fresh food.  They must have been reading their Yelp reviews because they&#39;ve done a 360.  Keep it up!"

We got here around 10 and the patio was pretty crowded so we sat inside at a hightop close to the bar.  Our server promptly came over to ask what we wanted to drink.  My husband was in awe of their beer menu.  I asked if it was too early to get a bloody mary (Sunday rules) and she said they start serving alcohol when they open at 7.  Apparently since they have the gambling machines, they can serve any time.  Good to know for football season!  They have plenty of TVs as well.  The bloody was good but nothing special.  They don&#39;t have a lot of wine so if that&#39;s what you like you may want to stick to something else.  However I did get a sauvignon blanc that was okay.  The service was good the entire time.  The portion sizes here are huge.  I would recommend sharing.  I got the special chilaquiles that were habenero.  Thankfully I got these as opposed to their regular cause these barely had any spice so I imagine the regular might be bland but I haven&#39;t had them.  The meat was surprisingly tender.  Sure, there were some pieces with connective tissue but this isn&#39;t exactly a steakhouse so for what they are, I thought the steak was high quality.  I would have preferred a bit more cheese, etc. for me but overall, pretty tasty dish.  My husband got the french toast and he finished the whole thing.

We highly recommend this venue. The food is amazing, the staff is professional and James/Jackie are the best team! They have high levels of communication and are intuitive to what the bride/groom needed. The tasting was amazing too! :D

They were both so efficient. James and Jackie made sure to personalize our wedding to our taste. Jackie made sure that a sentimental honoring for my deceased grandfathers would look great! It made my sisters and I cry - of happiness of course! :) They gave attention to all those little things that make a huge impact! They were open to &#39;brainstorming&#39; what the best layout should be for our reception. I trusted that everything would look nice and they delivered!! The layout was beautiful. I remember telling James that I felt like if he was &#39;David Tutera&#39; when he showed us the room for the first time! It looked THAT GOOD!!! 

Chateau Orleans includes amazing food, beautiful facilities (including bridal suite), table/chair linens, organized staff and more. Ask and you shall receive direction on everything. Everything went perfectly. The staff and bartender were so friendly and energized on the day of. James and Jackie were also running around to make sure it all went perfect.

Granted, it is a little strange that when you enter, to the left is a banquet hall called Chateau Orleans Banquets.  Last night there was a wedding reception there, this afternoon, a bridal expo.  Go right.  There is a huge bar area with TVs and then seating that includes high top tables, booths, and regular height tables.  As large as it is, it gets crowded and there might be a wait.  Here&#39;s why.

The food is deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelicious.  The menu is covered in wonderful descriptions of tasty sounding food.  Not only does it read as delicious, it is delicious.  We had the beef brisket that was soooooooooooooo tender, no knife required.  We also got an order of ribs  &#34;to go&#34;  and when I got them home I removed the meat from the bones before putting them in the refrigerator.  The meat literally fell off the bones, just the way I like them.   Our sides were also very tasty:  creamy cole slaw, baked beans, and perfectly done French fires.  There were 5 soups to pick from and they bring the cutest shaped rolls, hot, to start.  I see many visits in our future.

So, why only 4 stars?  They only offer spicy, mild, and North Carolina BBQ sauces.  Only 2 of those choices are available on the table AND the mild had a very vinegary taste to it.    BYO sauce for a perfect experience, unless you happen to like vinegar.

They work for families, couples, larger groups.  Stop in for a great experience."

I will probably try the Burbank locations before I try this one again, BBQ, &amp; Creole are what I noticed on the Main Menu. mixed in whatever daily/monthly special they have going on. I personal liked the Creole side of their menu. If you are a beer lover you&#39;ll love this place I think close to 100 beers and a lot of drafts. It&#39;s in your best interest to check the daily/monthly food special before you go. Chuck&#39;s daily/monthly special is only on the menu for certain days. An example: Thursday is Cajun Meatloaf (although you might be thinking $2 off Thursday night for meatloaf... what it really means is Thursday is the ONLY day you&#39;re probably going to get that item.

LONG Overall review
I feel cheated. The photos you see in the yelp review are amazing. So much so that I didn&#39;t even read any of the reviews (which might have gave me a better impression of what I should expect) I decided to take my mother out as she&#39;s been on a diet and was looking for a &#34;off&#34; night. 

Service:
My waiter pulled a Jekyll and Hyde on me. Let me tell you about Jekyll. In the beginning she was slow and rude. (it was a Thursday around 6pm but was slightly busy possible because it was the day before Good Friday/Easter. With that being said, original set down it was only three other groups in her section. but all of them already had food.) After about 10 min of waiting we order an appetizer but forgot where things were on the menu so Jekyll informs us she would put the order in and be right back. Our waiter didn&#39;t come back to AFTER the appetizer was brought out by someone else. (I&#39;m guessing 15+min) So while eating our appetizer she finally walks up to our table and ask have we decided what we wanted. My mother says &#34;The duck gumbo&#34; (plate)is what she wants for her main dish. We are informed that&#39;s not one of the dishes today but she could order the duck soup, What blows are mind is once the waiter pointed out the soup on the menu. My mother tries to take her reading glasses back out her purse to see what she&#39;s referring/pointing to, but I guess this was five sec to long for the waiter because she say&#39;s &#34;I&#39;ll give you some more time to order and flat out walks away....We tried calling her back (cause hell, we&#39;ve read the menu 60x with all that waiting and knew our 2nd, 3rd and 4th options we were going to pick,) but we felt like she purposely ignored us and kept walking away. 5 min later she comes back and we order.

A 2nd &#34;someone else&#34; brings out the main dish.  Jekyll disappear and Hyde shows up  &#34;Oh how is your dish&#34; &#34;That&#39;s my favorite&#34; &#34;Want anything to drink?&#34; Good choice&#34; She even started talking about the dessert and making  comments about leaving room for dessert as they are really famous for certain dessert dishes. 

Food:
I order the Chuck&#39;s Cajun Cakes (5/5) and the Shrimp &amp; Crab Au Gratin (4/5) as appetizers. Those two things were amazing. These two things have saved this review from being a 1 star.

My main dish the Cajun Blackened Filet Mignon Tail. It was disappointing for two reasons. 1 I wasn&#39;t impressed with the taste of this  2. It wasn&#39;t even what I wanted..... I thought this was the same plate from a photo on yelp but it turns out that particular filet mignon photo was only on TappaTuesday (only on the 3rd Tuesday of the month). Basically I did the same thing my mother did earlier. I picked a dish that was from a photo but because the description in the photo said filet mignon. I made the mistake of assuming it was the same thing that was on their main menu. So although I&#39;ll admit this was more of my fault because the yelp photo does show #tappatuesday at the end of the description and it was something that I should have thought about when it happened to my mother. Jekyll wasn&#39;t really all that friendly to start with. Otherwise I probably would have pointed directly to the photo which I had questions about and asked her had she tried the dish. This is what I normally do when It come to food photos, but didn&#39;t want to be bothered cause Jekyll gave me the impression we was wasting her time and should get out and stop breathing.  (not sure which order she wanted us to do)

My mother choose to get the BBQ Combo (half slab baby back ribs and Beef Brisket)  as her main dish. She was happy with it and I&#39;m a big guy and must say it was a LARGE portion of food. Although she was happy with it. both the ribs and brisket I sampled were extremely fatty. However I thought he BBQ sauce was good and can see why they are popular.

Enjoyed the  two drinks (Grape Mojo (3/5) and the Hoodoo ElixirI (4/5) Both were well mixed and tasted great.)

Location/Decor
the banquet hall, sports bar, restaurant doesn&#39;t blend well as it feels like someone bought Sim&#39;s hotel and Sim&#39;s restaurant expansion package (bar goes here, bar tables go here, family restaurant  goes here, banquet hall goes here chuck e cheese display goes here..."

Never been disappointed with the food.  The chili is advertised as a Texas chili, it&#39;s flavor profile definitely fits that of an east coast/Cincinnati chili.  Service is always good. Inside is nice. Great for families or just grabbing a few drinks with friends. I was there one time and a painting class was going on during the dinner service (a Monday night I believe).

Breakfast is always delicious and decent priced.  Biscuits and gravy are very good.
The beer menu is quite large and always stocked.  You can get a sample to try if you are unsure of a new beer.  Beer flights are a favorite.  
Chuck is friendly and sometimes when he is at this location he may walk around and ask you to sample a new recipe he is concocting."

It is in somewhat of an awkward building which is half restaurant half banquet hall. The restaurant part is very large with a pretty big bar. They also have outdoor seating.

For drinks I had a blue moon mixed with ginger beer which was one of their drink specials...it was ok but a bit watered down with way too much ice. My husband ordered a beer from their very large beer list.

Let me say the BBQ nachos were sooo good! Lots of delicious bbq pulled pork with shredded cheese and delicious guacamole. My husband and I could have probably eaten just this and been full but of course we ordered pulled pork sandwiches too!  The pulled pork was tender and had a perfect amount of bbq sauce (which you can order mild or spicy). For sides I had coleslaw and Mac and cheese. The coleslaw was great! It had the perfect balance between veggies and dressing. The Mac and cheese was pretty good but I am picky when it comes to the perfect Mac and cheese and this one was slightly too creamy. My husband had coleslaw and fries. The fries were nicely seasoned but could have been warmer.

Overall it was pretty good bbq considering we aren&#39;t in Texas! We will be back."

I also had a cup of seafood gumbo to start which was tasty.  Jambalaya was yummy - had a good spicy flavorful kick to it.  

I would recommend this for those who love Cajun southern food, although they do offer a variety of other items on their menu - not to mention an extensive list of craft beers!

Good. Not really great, but good. We&#39;ve visited a few times &amp; nothing I&#39;ve eaten made my taste buds scream. 

I&#39;ve tried the pulled pork, bbq brisket and chicken fried chicken. All were average tasting. Just a little advice though, if you&#39;re getting the chicken, ask for the gravy on the side... it is VERY salty &amp; coming from a self admitted salt addict, that&#39;s saying a lot. Oh, if you like cole slaw, GET IT. It is hands down one of the better ones I&#39;ve had.

Our last server made us feel as if we were bothering her but during our other visits service was pretty good.

First, it has both a conceptual and physical identity crisis. Is it a  southern restaurant, a BBQ joint, or a Mexican place? Turns out none, the food is crummy. Is it a sportsbar, a family restaurant,  or a banquet hall? 

You can see where I&#39;m going with this. Long story short, I paid $55 for a meal they wouldn&#39;t serve you at TGI Fridays.

It began with being given no less than four different menus, and the waitress giving a five minute explanation of all the specials, sides, beers and platters. we felt like we needed to be taking notes.

Next, the BBQ. It was smoked to oblivion. Honestly I think the ribs were rubber bands from Staples and the brisket was cardboard from a Papa John&#39;s box. The hot link was ok. 

Hello??? I lived in Kansas for three years, enjoying true smoked meats and real sauce. This is an embarrassment to the BBQ world.

The sides were store bought crap. Thanks for trying to trick me. I&#39;d rather have Kraft macaroni. A real southern or BBQ joint takes serious pride in their sides. Chuck&#39;s takes their minivan to Sam&#39;s club to purchase their sides.

Finally, the marketing bullcrap was so thick it was disgusting. &#34;Have dinner with Chuck!!!&#34;. Why? So he can tell me how to buy stuff from Schwann&#39;s and overcook it? And what&#39;s all this about Chuck working for Rick Bayless? Granted Bayless is a dbag, but Chuck must&#39;ve bussed tables for Ricky Rocket. 

Pro tip: fire your full time graphic designer and hire a real cook.

Pro tip 2: avoid this dumpster fire. Seriously I would&#39;ve rather gone to Popeyes."

This location has a fairly large parking lot and additional parking next door if the bank is closed.  It looks like it was once a banquet hall.  And, I believe, they still have 1 or 2 large banquet type rooms.
Their bar is within the restaurant (unlike the Burbank location).  They have a really good beer list and seem to use the correct glassware too. They are pretty efficient because this is a busy, albeit large, restaurant.  We&#39;ve ordered lots of items from their menu but my favorites are probably the jambalaya, Korean wings, gumbo and their enchiladas with mole sauce.  I&#39;m not a big fan of their BBQ sauce but they do offer 4 or 5 different types.  We keep going back so they must be doing something right!!"

Over the course of the last 15 years, I&#39;ve seen restaurant-bars come and go from this location (most recently Cornerstone), but it looks as though Chuck&#39;s is here to stay for good, and I for one am very glad.  They have an amazing menu that gets populated with new items seasonally and I&#39;ve only experienced a few blemishes across half a dozen visits.

Their food style is distinctly &#39;southern&#39;, with plenty of delicious side dishes to go with the barbeque items, as well as a handful of &#39;Nawlins-inspired items.  You can&#39;t go wrong with any of their BBQ, but the pulled pork and smoked brisket are standouts.  Make sure you upgrade to the &#34;deluxe&#34; (comes with 2 sides), and get the mac&#39;n&#39;cheese + baked beans.  The jalapeno cornbread sounds better than it actually is (brought out to us at room-temp).

I&#39;m not sold on their Cajun.  I&#39;ve had the jambalaya (surprisingly weak), catfish po-boy (meh), and gumbo (decent, but once found a sliver of bone / hard plastic in the bottom of the bowl.  not cool guys.)  Some may find the cajun to be good, but frankly speaking, I would get it elsewhere--Pappadeux&#39;s and Heaven on Seven come to mind.

If Chuck&#39;s falters with their Cajun, they atone for it with beer.  A LOT of it.  Tons of uncommon brews on tap and an extensive beer list that would rival most other places&#39; wine lists.  The beer flight is the way to go - sample several and find your new favorite!  I sure did - Allagash White, thankyouverymuch.

Breakfast is a whole &#39;nother story.  EXCELLENT choices, but a standout is the bananas foster french toast that&#39;s topped with freshly-sliced bananas, slathered in caramel and topped with pecans.  It&#39;s so good it&#39;s sinful, it&#39;s so sinful you&#39;ll need to head to Confession afterwards.  Once a month on a Sunday, Chuck&#39;s features beignets and cafe-au-lait for a nice change of pace.

The interior is clean, always festively-themed, and generally well-staffed.  Service has been consistently good, save for one time I ate here at an off-hour (like 2pm) and was forgotten about amidst the server shift change.  They&#39;ve got slots and video poker, too, for those of a gambling persuasion.  Good location on Cass Avenue, nice and close to my childhood home in Darien :)

So, long story short (too late), I&#39;m right on the fence with Chuck&#39;s....good enough to be deserving of 5*, but a couple missteps with food bring it back to a 4*.  In all honesty, I&#39;d give them 4.5 / 5.

Would I recommend?  Sure, youbetcha."

I&#39;ve also made it in for several of Chuck&#39;s special buffet evenings with live music and also his monthly &#34;Dinner with Chuck&#34; at 7 p.m. Where he features numerous unique smoked meats directly out of the smoker and he hand carves them before you and always offers wonderful sides.

If you don&#39;t have Mardi Gras plans yet, be sure to check out his website for his next event February 17th. An alternative schedule is available in his Burbank location too.

Not only did my family have a wonderful experience at both locations, but the catering has also been unbelievable when we used it for family parties.
I have also used Chuck&#39;s for our employee appreciation BBQ about a year ago and Chuck himself ran the entire event voluntarily. He truly cares about the experience he provides and even went out of his way to accommodate our vegetarian employees. This was paramount because I didn&#39;t want anyone to feel left out. Chuck flawlessly set up our menu and arrived promptly to prepare everything before the event. He did an awesome job serving 70+ people and absolutely nothing ran low. Some people were confused because their chicken was pink inside and they thought it was undercooked. Chuck promptly informed them that this pink coloration is normal when chicken is smoked and assured that it was fully cooked. This helped some people who were skeptic or unfamiliar with smoked meats. Chuck has delivered a great experience on many levels and I always feel comfortable dining there.
My recommendation would be to try the mac &amp; cheese, pulled pork, and corn bread."

At times in the past I&#39;ve noticed that some restaurants aren&#39;t always on their &#34;A&#34; game for restaurant week. So it&#39;s hard to tell if my experience was the norm or because of Restaurant week. 

Overall my experience was average at best at Chuck&#39;s 

I give one star for service... the restaurant was clean, and nice, had a nice open feeling to it. Our servers were also great, very friendly and funny and attentive 
And I&#39;ll give one star for their Lobster Bisque. It was great. For their Bread pudding. It was delicious and came in huge servings. And for their wide selection of craft beer. 

My main problem is with my main dish... I ordered the &#34;Pasta Magnifique&#34;  It&#39;s not on their regular menu and was one of their monthly specials... which could be another reason for the quality and my issues with it.  Simply put... the  dish was horrible.  I am not a picky eater at all, but the dish was just overcooked and unappetizing.  To start, it was probably the worst pasta I&#39;ve had in a restaurant in as long as I can remember.  The pasta was so overcooked that the fettuccine tasted like mush and had no texture.  On top of that it was served with the largest head of broccoli I&#39;ve been given in a restaurant...  I wish I had taken a picture of it, because the size of it was comical. The head of broccoli was easy the size of a softball, and when the plate was put down me and my girlfriend couldn&#39;t help but laugh about it.  The broccoli was supposed to be steamed... it wasn&#39;t, or at most was only lightly steamed.  It tasted almost completely raw. I suspect that because of the size it wasn&#39;t properly steamed long enough..... I like raw broccoli, but raw broccoli doesn&#39;t go with an Alfredo dish and I ended up just having a softball size garnish on my plate.  When bringing home my leftovers I actually had to re-steam the broccoli myself.  The fact that Chuck&#39;s doesn&#39;t have any other real pasta dishes, and that they spelled &#34;fettuccine&#34; wrong on their website should have been a red flag for me.

Even with the problems with my main dish I didn&#39;t dislike Chuck&#39;s.... I just didn&#39;t have a good first experience and  don&#39;t see myself going back any time soon."

Hadn&#39;t been to a Chuck&#39;s before and was skeptical having been to the previous two failed bar/restaurants at this location. There was a line to request a table which surprised me: &#34;For this place?&#34; I thought. Chuck&#39;s made some mostly superficial improvements using the existing spaces pretty much as they were previously which made me more skeptical. You still have to walk through the somewhat same divey bar area, but now with more tables where you can order, on your way back to the main dining area consisting of ample booths and large-party tables. The place was way busier than I remembered it on previous visits. The new outdoor seating is a very nice addition and was very busy. Any fears related to the previous places ended here.

Our waitress was prompt and friendly.  The beer menu is awesome with a fantastic selection of quality craft beers and ciders. I had the smoked half chicken which was luscious and made even better with the vinegar-based North Carolina style BBQ sauce I had on the side. Fries were done perfectly and ample. Coleslaw was fresh and a perfect complement. The only better complement was the Xingu Brazilian schwarzbier. Wide selection of apps, entrees, sides, and deserts.

The breakfast changec all that, they have one of the most immpresdive breakfadt menus i have ever seen.  Their coffee is great, and you mus try the spicy brisket hash skillet, it is unlike anything you have ever had, especially when paired with a pancake."

The soup. Chuck offers like 6-8 soups a day. If it has the word chowder- it&#39;s not a chowder- it&#39;s like a bisque that the angels kissed. I have tried several corn, crab, jalapeno, poblano, scallop, some variation of this chowder and again- so magical I would come just for soup. 2. Extensive beer menu and fun bar specials- come during a bears game- you will not be disappointed. 3. The food is pretty darn good- I love the Mexican pot roast, his chilaquiles, banana fosters French toast, and the pulled pork is phenomenal. The menu is extensive and has comfort/ southern/ BBQ/ Hispanic/ creole items. He has so many specials daily and some day I&#39;m going to have off on tapas night.... I hope. 

Okay, so here&#39;s the thing... the servers are friendly, but sometimes not my favorite part of the meal... and I served for years... one told me about the time she was slipped exlax. Truly. That and I expect someone who cooks everything so well to make amazing mac and cheese. This is possibly the worst mac and cheese I&#39;ve ever had in my life (it&#39;s a processed fake cheese and it makes me sad). So- yes, there are 2 things I didn&#39;t love, but the soup more than makes me want to go back and my server can tell me all kinds of horrible things as long as she brings me my soup."

Since I stuff my face until I cannot breathe and practically lick my plate it, technically is my favorite lunch place too because I am too full to eat for hours.

My Breakfast Review: 
The seating is not tight which makes it very family friendly. Breakfast stops at 11ish....so get there early! Each guest I go with loves their breakfast. French Toast is a good choice and any of their skillets. I always order Huevos Rancheros or Huevos Montulenos (scrambled). Both plates are 5 stars! Coffee is great and their Bloody Mary&#39;s are very good. 
Overall this is the place that I want everyone to come with me for breakfast/brunch!

My Lunch Review: 
I wanted to show off this place to my friend but I realized that breakfast ends early! We ordered Cornbread which is a great way to start lunch! It was just perfect! There was also an extensive beer/drink list for lunch and dinner. I don&#39;t like cajun food so I ordered the Chicken Wing Dinner and I really liked my potato salad. The wings were great also but too greasy for my liking. I still enjoyed them though. 

Service is great..the price is right it is a very casual laid-back place with a big bar area and tvs. There is nothing to say about the decor...but this place is really all about the FOOD!"

They were serving a special 4-course meal for Chicago Restaurant Week, so we both went with that. 1st course,soup or salad, had their super caesar salad.  Never had a spicy salad before, it was great.  2nd course we got a tamale casserole.  Loved it, was spicy also (like the salad).  3rd course was a cajun filet tail with cajun green beans.  Both very good, beans were spicy (like the tamale casserole &amp; the salad). Last course dessert (brownie with scoop of vanilla ice cream (not very original or spicy...haha). 

Pros:  Food was quality &amp; tasty, waitress gave us time between courses &amp; we were not rushed.
Con:  Maybe change your &#39;spicy&#39; spice up a bit so all the food doesn&#39;t taste the same.  It got old after the 2nd course.  Just because you put 1 spice in food, doesn&#39;t make you a cajun restaurant."

Our power was out, so we decided to make the most of it and go get dinner somewhere far away. Bien Trucha it was!

With the menu running relatively cheap, and becaude these were only a dollar more than soda, my wife got a limonada and I got a mangoneada. Both were bright and fresh, and the mangoneada in particular was quite thick, like a smoothie (mango water is not a good description for this menu item). The rim of chili-based seasoning provided a familiar heat with the drink as well. 

I also ordered esquites, which was grilled corn with lime and cotija. I&#39;d definitely get this again, and it went well with my Atun tacos, or tacos with breaded tuna cubes.

It&#39;s pretty easy to describe the ingredients, but the thing that stands out is the balance of the ingredients. It would be so easy for any of the ingredients on the tacos to overwhelm, and you won&#39;t see me argue against having a fistful of fish on my plate. But no; each bite has the creaminess of the avocado, a little bit of fish, a bit of pickled onion. This is taco perfection.

I&#39;m pleased to say my wife&#39;s Bien Trucha was treated with the same care, only including skirt steak.

I&#39;m hoping to get a trip back here before winter sets in, because the things they&#39;re pulling off deserve the attention they get."

The star was definitely the corn. Both taco types lacked flavor and did not taste as authentic as my cheap local taco joint. The menu felt disjointed with very limited options if you didn&#39;t want tacos or tortas. 

Ok so the service was attentive, but food was lacking any real flavor. I guess it&#39;s catering to the Americanized Mexican pallette... But this non-amateur eater left greatly disappointed. This place is extremely overhyped and overpriced. There are so many better places to get your taco fill."

It had just rained outside by the time we got to dinner, so the patio was all closed up. However, as our dinner went on, they slowly opened it back up and had a great waiting spot for people outside. It was probably my favorite thing about the unique set up of the whole restaurant! Tables are a bit crowded together and voices carry/echo throughout, so don&#39;t plan to come here for a quiet dinner.

We started off ordering drinks at the bar, as we had to wait for our (previously reserved) table. House margarita, watermelon marg, and I had the strawberry marg. Our bartender did not skimp on the tequila! They were fresh and very tasty drinks. 

We then got to our table and promptly ordered the guac of the day which had mangoes in it. Real tasty, but I cringed knowing that we paid $9 for the lump of it that we got. We also ordered the Bien Trucha and Pollo tacos, both of which were good. The Pollo comes in a fried tortilla, which I was not expecting. The BT tacos were pretty standard steak tacos with cheese and some sauce drizzled over it. 

All in all it was perfect for the occasion we were there for, and I&#39;m glad to have tried it, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t become a regular here. I&#39;d be bankrupt on my third trip!"

Tacos were on the smaller side but ok I liked the al pastor more because it had more favor and sauce, as for the steak a bit bland. I didn&#39;t enjoy the vanilla flan it was too sweet.

This meant my parents were mashed together on the booth half of a small table and their elbows were basically on the neighboring tables. I know it&#39;s a small place but c&#39;mon, it was not that busy. 

Instead of chips and salsa, they drop off chips and beans at the table.....I&#39;m not sure I have ever heard of this before, but it was not very good. So I asked for salsa to go with the chips (standard and complimentary at 99.9% of places) and the waitress told me she could not just bring salsa, but I would have to order the salsa platter for extra $. 

After that things were pretty average. My tacos al pastor were solid, but the chicken tacos come drenched in a cold sauce that immediately cools off the tacos."

My buddy and I had a reservation last night. I arrived a couple minutes early, and sat at the bar. Ordered a corona, and I was handed a can of it. $5. Not a great first impression. 

Once my friend arrived, we were seated at one of the 10 tables there. No joke, not a huge place. They have a sister restaurant attached, which is only open for lunch. They may seat folks there once they are full, as it&#39;s the same ownership.

We had the tacos, and tortas. We also had some corn appetizer, which was phenomenal. Can&#39;t remember what it was called (Lo Siento, mi espanol es no bueno) but it was a must have. The tacos were great, tortas were nothing special. The meat on the skewer was tough. 

A bill for the two of us was $50, plus tip. While the food was great, it wasn&#39;t worth that much. If they brought their prices down by 20% or so, or increased portion size, it&#39;d be a great spot.

My favorite thing to get there is the pork tacos which have pineapple and a type of salsa on them. I also love the corn dish esquites which is similar to elotes. It has cheese, peppers, mayo, and a few other things in it. 

The staff is fantastic. 

The only thing I don&#39;t like is that it is served tapas style. So you cannot go with a group of people and just get your own thing. They should let you order your own dishes if that is what you want to do.

I love the fish tacos and chicken rolled tacos. I&#39;ve tried almost everything on the menu but these are my go-to. This is the only Mexican place in Chicago area that serves authentic rolled tacos. (If you know of others, I always looking for reminders of home do msg me w/ locations, please). I make them at home but nothing compares to well made ones + the delicious (slightly spicy) sauce + cheese they pour on them, YUM! 

The potatoes bravas are delicious as are the beans. You could easily share a guacamole app + each a taco entree. Tacos will more than fill you up since they come four to a serving. I usually end up taking one home. 

The patio in spring/summer is awesome, reminds me of a Miami lounge vibe when they&#39;ve got the DJ going and strawberry margaritas are being sipped. Certainly don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m in Illinois! 

Staff has always been super attentive. On a busy night, keep an eye on the bar seats for folks waiting for tables and slide in there for a shorter or no wait. 

Only downfall is the spot is first come, first serve - no reservations."

At about 4:20, I sidled up to the end the line outside of two rather unobtrusive buildings that one would otherwise mistake for a home on a main street. As it turns out, they are both part of the unique location that entail a primary dining room, a beautiful outdoor bar and dining space, and a separate bar with kitchen service.

Friendly well trained staff greeted us in line with an ipad to arrange our reserved seating, and informed us of our seating options, whereupon sitting outside was deemed the best available. I do appreciate the well organized line management, as it saved us from several would-be line cutters!

After what turned out to be a very short wait after opening, I was greeted with a flurry of professional service by a team of knowledgeable servers, led by both our server and a contentious manager.

Two excellent margaritas later; the guacamole, salsa flight, swordfish tacos with fried taco shells that were so yummy the table next to us tried to steal them, and tilapia fish tacos with home made chips had me longing for a beach in Baja at sunset; and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.

At this rate, they should consider purchasing the vacant lot next door...

The meal that I had today at Bien Trucha was seriously one of the best experiences I&#39;ve had in a long time. I was in the area running an errand, so the fiance and I decided to check this place off my bookmark list. So glad we did! We walked in around 1:00pm on a Thursday afternoon and were seated immediately which seems unheard of based on the reviews.

We ordered the limeade and hibiscus iced tea to start and both were refreshing and delicious. We were also given complimentary chips and a bean dip -- both very tasty. Our waiter mentioned the special guacamole that day had pears in it -- we were intrigued and had to order it. Yum! We also ordered the cazuelitas de camarones and bien trucha tacos, which are supposedly the best items on the menu. For our sides, we decided on the esquites (corn) and arroz poblano (rice). EVERYTHING was SO GOOD! As soon as I took my first bite, I was in heaven. I wish we had known about this place sooner so we could impress our friends who come to the suburbs to visit. Believe me when I say it is worth the trip to dine here. My fiance and I are from San Diego, land of the best Mexican food, and we were both very impressed with everything here.

I would be eating Mexican every day if this place was closer to my neighborhood.  Start with the Margarita&#39;s... fresh.  They muddle the limes with the tequila for one awesome drink. Tasted the strawberry as well and .. wow!  OK, on to the food.  Chips were good - the serve with some type of black bean dip.  Different, but decent.  

The plates are meant to share.  The tacos are 4 per plate so, if you come with 4 people, that&#39;s ideal (you don&#39;t want more because the place is small).  We sampled the lunch menu and had the following tacos... A La Diabla (spicy shrimp); Pescado (beer battered tilapia); Pastor (marinated pork); Pollo (crispy chicken - more like flautas than tacos)  And I love that i could sample one of each!  I would rank them, but I can&#39;t .. all a tie for first.

Service also was among the best I ever experienced.  The waters were constantly filled and the chips were constantly refilled.  As I am not often in Geneva, I hear there is a sister place with the same menu in Glen Ellyn which is a bit more drivable for me called Toda Madre... I cannot wait to check it out!"

I went here for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. I was surprised the restaurant was still pretty busy. There was about a ten minute wait but we decided to eat at the &#34;chef&#39;s table&#34; and we were seated right away. 

Our server (Lucy) described the handmade margaritas and I decided on the De Lujo margarita. The drink was not too sweet. $12 seems a little high for the size of this margarita but it had a great taste. 

I was very satisfied with the food! We started with the Bien Trucha tacos. The steak had a unique flavor and the roasted tomatillo salsa was perfect on top. 

The server suggested an order of Esquites (grilled corn, epazote butter, lemon aioli, queso cotinga, chile piquin). This is a great choice and will go with any menu item. We also ordered a Capitalina Torta. This is a sandwich with pork, cheese, pineapple, avocado, beans and aioli. 

Overall- They offer tasty food and I would love to go back if I&#39;m in Geneva. Heads up- they close at 3:00 and then reopen for dinner at 5:00. I would recommend getting there early if you&#39;re going for lunch."

Had the following

Ceviche of the day
It had lobster in it. Very good citrus flavor and the spice really sneaks up on you. Nice fresh starter

Guacamole traditional
Basic guacamole. It was fresh and the chips were nice and crispy

Bien Truca Taco
The steak was very tender and I loved the cheese in it. Full of flavor and definitely could have ordered some more of these

Pollo Taco
The tacos are fried into rolls and it reminded me of an eggroll with the crisp and texture. An unexpected dish. More like southwest eggrolls. Enjoyed this one as well

Barriga de Puerco
Pork belly with a lot of flavor. Solid taco. I would say I liked the above 2 better

The tacos here are very small about 2-3 bites and you are done. If you are going with a big group definitely recommend sharing if you like a variety of food. I do appreciate the creativity of this place with tacos and the food is full of brightness and flavor. Way better than some of the fancy mexican that I have had in the city

The only drawback was the crampness of the dining area and how the tables are so tiny. For a restaurant that focuses on small plate there needs to be table space to share that food."

We ordered three taco dishes for the three of us: Hongos (mushrooms), Pescadillas (sword fish), and (Pescado). We also got a side of rice. Each taco platter comes with 4 tacos which were plenty and we were quite full by the end!

Not this one! It totally lived up to every expectation I&#39;ve ever had. The first time I came here, I was starving and I ordered everything I can stuff in my pie hole. Everything was great and super tasty. So I went back the second time just in case I was just hungry the first time, I surely didn&#39;t want to give a place 5 stars for a possibly skewed review because I was starving. Oh man, the second time around was even better! 
Let&#39;s talk taco: bien Trucha, arrachera, and pescado tacos were very good. Bien Trucha and arrachera were made with the most tender and well marinated skirt steak. Pescado is made with breaded tilapia with red cabbage topping. All 3 were soooooo good! You&#39;ll get Turnt Up For Taco guaranteed! #TUFT
Pièce de rèsistance: shrimp cazuelitas. Oh. My. Gawd. To die for. MUST HAVE for sure. The explosion of flavor in this dish is to die for . Totally worth the drive wherever you&#39;re coming from. Best dish I&#39;ve ever had in my life!!! 
Sides: the rice and corn sides were amaze balls 
Drinks: too sweet for my taste. I recommend their sipping tequilas vs their sangria and margarita. 
MAKE YOUR RESERVATION! The wait is no joke. The place is super small and waiting at the bar is not the most ideal. 
Bien Trucha you really are on top of your game!"

The hype is real folks. The hype. Is. Real.

My husband and I came here for Cinco de Mayo this year. I of course have read amazing reviews on Yelp, so I decided what better time to check it out. I know Bien Trucha gets hella busy, so I made sure to make a reservation online. It was the morning of cinco de mayo when I checked their availability and luckily we were able to snag their last rezzy! I guess it was meant to be.

Although we arrived right on time (6:45 p.m.), I don&#39;t think we were actually seated until about 7. I kind of was prepared for this though, being the holiday and all. What I wasn&#39;t prepared for was the shuffle between two separate buildings. Thanks to Angela P.&#39;s review, I knew A Toda Madre was connected to BT and is basically the same thing so I wasn&#39;t too concerned. It was rather annoying though how the hostess at BT told us we&#39;d be seated faster next door, and then that host sent us back to where we originally were.

When this shuffle calmed down we still ended up sitting at the bar and ordering a drink until our table was ready. They had a $5 classic margarita special, so that kept me calm, cool, and collected while we waited. About 15 minutes later we were sat at a quaint 2 person table in the side room. Our waitress greeted us right away and was super helpful.

I love the ambiance of the restaurant (although pretty small). A wine bottle-esque pitcher of water was on the table, along with a candle, stylish plates and a simple menu. The scene is perfect for a date night or a girls night out.

We started with their classic guacamole and were also given complimentary pinto bean dip. Both were delicious and addicting. Their homemade tortilla chips stood out to me. I&#39;m not sure what it was, but they had the perfect crunch and were not over-salted. It&#39;s safe to say we accidentally filled up pretty well on these pre dinner snacks.

Their food is served basically tapas style, so we were instructed to order a few different things to share and they would come out one after another. I really like this concept, however when all was said and done the hubbie and I agreed that we ate too fast in anticipation of the next delicious item coming out!

We ordered as follows:

Cazuelitas de camarones -- sautéed shrimp, red onion, garlic, cilantro-chimichurri, and chihuahua cheese served with tortillas (this was basically a make-your-own quesadilla and it was amazing!)

Bien Trucha tacos (4) -- grilled skirt steak, chorizo, chihuahua, roasted tomatillo salso

Pescadillas tacos (4) -- shredded swordfish, epazote, crispy tortilla, avocado-habanero pico 

Everything was absolutely amazing. I&#39;m talkin every time either of us took a bite we did that like full mouth &#34;mm hhmm, that&#39;s really good&#34; nod to each other. I literally can&#39;t wait to come back. These are fresh and unique Mexican flavors I&#39;ve never had before. It&#39;s a modern Mexican menu so sure, I&#39;ve had more &#34;authentic feeling&#34; entrees, but Bien Trucha is something special.

Definitely go check &#39;em out. Like, NOW!"

Great outdoor seating although we sat inside to get a break with the air conditioning since we were out in the afternoon enjoying Swedish Days. The tacos came in miniature across a wood plank and my wife and I shared the tuna and swordfish tacos. The swordfish were spicy in a crunchy shell where the tuna was wonderful in soft shell with salad garnish. It was very busy but wait staff very friendly and attentive. We had fresh guacamole with chips while waiting for our entree. Everything was provided timely but never felt rushed. My wife enjoyed the mango water with her meal.

Since whenever we happen to be in their area it&#39;s lunch time but they don&#39;t take reservations for lunch and the line is usually down the block...and places with a lot of &#34;OMG you MUST go there!&#34; hype tend to disappoint me.  A few years later the planets aligned to a rainy Saturday where we would be in Saint Charles.  I hoped the rain would work in our favor keeping the throngs at bay for a bit so we could give them a try for lunch.  We arrived right before opening and we were rewarded with immediate seating.  The place filled up within an hour of their opening, however - but there wasn&#39;t a line to get in so a crummy weather day is a good time to give them a try if you can&#39;t make it for a dinner rez time slot. 

I&#39;d say the food was 4 - 5 stars and the service was 1 - 3 stars so I&#39;m going to settle on 3 stars.  It&#39;s tapas style but they have teeny tables so plan on just ordering 1 - 2 things at a time.  We tried the Esquites (roasted corn - amazing &amp; my dining companion who normally doesn&#39;t like corn gobbled it up!), the Bien Trucha tacos (skirt steak &amp; chorizo) &amp; the Atun tacos (tuna) - both tacos were delicious.  We also tried 2 of the margaritias (the melon, a special that day, &amp; the avocado) &amp; the sangria - all were tasty but they really don&#39;t give you much at all and they don&#39;t give you much &#34;kick&#34; if you know what I mean, either.  If I&#39;m paying $9 (sangria) - $11/12 (margaritas) each I would like it to be a least a bit stronger.

Our server was kind and explained the menu to us and she checked on us regularly.  We had 2 gripes with the service.  One was right after our margaritias arrived my dining companion picked it up  to move it to the side and make room for the food and the glass just slipped right out of his hand.  I&#39;m not sure if it was a bit of grease from the tortilla chips or what but he picked it up &amp; the glass immediately slipped out and spilled all over the table &amp; him.  Now this occurred when a bus boy was watching 2 feet away &amp; our server was at the next table taking their order.  Not a single person came over to help clean up the mess and we had to ask the bus boy to bring us new napkins &amp; plates.  That was a rather irritating start so I&#39;m glad the food was delicious to even out their star rating.  The second gripe was regarding the small basket of tortilla chips &amp; a bean dip they bring you when you sit down.  We finished our chips &amp; still had half the bean dip left.  The bus boy took away our empty basket for chips &amp; left the bean dip but never brought any more chips.  I did overhear another table asking for chips so perhaps you have to ask? Just not sure why they wouldn&#39;t ask us if we wanted more chips (most servers at other places ask), especially if they are going to leave the bean dip on the table. 

After all is said and done I probably wouldn&#39;t bother going back.  Good to give them a try, at least, though."

i made a reservation, which was nice so we did not have to wait (i don&#39;t think this place is worth waiting for). we  had the cerviche, which was delicious. i also had the sangria, which i highly recommend. we ate the pastor and diablo tacos which were outstanding. we had the flan for dessert, which was a nice way to end the meal. 

overall though, i wouldn&#39;t be in a rush to go back here. at least during busy times. i prefer el molcajete instead - you can get the same quality of food, without the pretentiousness."

We always get the guacamole and the ceviche--whether we get the special of either or the traditional is the only decision.  The corn salad is excellent, and the poblano chili soup is one of the very best.  The fish tacos are next on the list of must tries, and the sandwiches are exceptional.  Really, everything on the menu that we have tried is great."

So when I first crunched into a magnificently, impossibly fresh tuna taco adorned with baby arugula, celery aioli and avocado at Bien Trucha, an unassuming little joint on the edge of downtown Geneva, every expletive I knew shot through my head within a nanosecond. And the bill for guac, twelve tacos and four margaritas came to just about $80. (I wasn&#39;t dining alone, I swear!)

As I munched on house-made totopos and that exemplary guacamole, freshened with the tang of tomatillo, I thought, &#34;Could Rick Bayless somehow be behind this?&#34;

Nope. Turns out Mexico City-bred chef/owner Ricardo Garcia-Rubio, although a decades-long kitchen vet, had never garnered any kind of real attention or seen much success before opening Bien Trucha in 2007. Now, eight years later, after an expansion and much local and national acclaim, it seems Chef is right where he needs to be.

He&#39;s certainly farther away from Lakeview than I&#39;d like; I would eat at Bien almost every week if he were within a five-mile radius. I randomly crave those tuna tacos. Other times my mouth waters at the thought of crunchy tortillas stacked with juicy, epazote-scented swordfish and avocado-chile pico de gallo. Even the skirt steak tacos, slightly overshadowed by the oceanic treats, pop into mind. I even miss the simple but ridiculously addictive white rice, dotted with bits of roasted poblano and creamy-gooey with crema and Chihuahua cheese. 

My only complaint aside from distance is that the margaritas, while delicious (especially the cucumber &#34;Pepino&#34;), are rather small and low on booze. I may prefer my tequila drinks more bracing than most people, but these might not do the job for even the lightest-weight lightweight in your group. 

I suppose that means that, pocketbook permitting, you ought to have an extra cocktail. The experience is otherwise worth savoring."

It was recommended by a friend! We had a bad start to the experience as we had just gotten coffees while shopping and the employee who greeted us at the door told us we could not bring in any outside drinks. In a way, I guess it makes sense, but it&#39;s not like we were bringing in a bottle of wine or vodka. Besides, I think I ordered water anyways so it wouldn&#39;t have made a big deal. Anyways, aside from that our service was good and the food was great! I enjoyed the portion sizes of the tacos as it was just the right amount! It&#39;s tiny inside but the food is a big hit for your taste buds! We&#39;ll be back...I&#39;ll just be sure I save my coffee buying for later!"

After spending a relaxing Saturday afternoon in the area, we decided to venture over to Geneva and try our luck. Without reservations, we got in line around 4:30 for their 5 o&#39;clock dinner opening. Great timing as we were the third group in line. The weather was perfect to sit outside in their outdoor dining area under the canopy. Once 5:00 pm came, the line was to the end of the block. I was just hoping that the tacos lived up to the hype!
Once we were seated, our server got right to work, greeting us and offering information about their specials. I ordered a watermelon margarita for myself and the traditional guacamole for the table. We ordered tacos to share and decided on shrimp, tuna and chicken. The tacos came in orders of 4. 
At first, our food came almost immediately, and I had the feeling that because this restaurant is so busy, we would be rushed out in order to turn over the table for the next guests. That could have been the case but our order of chicken tacos took an extremely long time. That was fine by us as we were there to enjoy the atmosphere and the beautiful weather. 
This place is definitely a low key restaurant with more of an upscale, fine dining feel than one would expect at first glance. I&#39;d say the tacos were worth the wait. Next time, Id love to get a reservation to try more of what&#39;s on their menu."

This place is very small so if you aren&#39;t a fan of siting close together for dinner, I suggest visiting during patio season, there&#39;s a little more room out there. They start off your dining experience by bring a bean dip with chips. The bean dip seems to have a hint of chipotle and is tasty. The pepino margarita they have is too good. It is pricey, but it&#39;s one of those things that you don&#39;t feel guilty splurging on because it&#39;s delicious. The guacamole is a must. They do have a special guacamole (Guacamole del Dia) where fresh fruit is added, by chef&#39;s choice and we always try it and have never been disappointed. The tacos are flavorful and have unique combinations on them.( I would not describe them as authentic mexican tacos at all, but more of a taco with a modern twist) The Arrachera tacos are one of my favorites. It&#39;s steak with onions, avocado and salsa. If you don&#39;t mind paying a little more for a upscale feel, then this is the place for you. But if you&#39;re looking for authentic tacos, steer clear."

The corn is the best I have ever tasted.  I would come back just for that dish.  Tried the skirt steak and pork belly tacos -- both were excellent.

I was treating my daughters to a &#34;girls day out&#34; and the wait time was 15 minutes for a table so we decided to sit at the bar.  We were the only three at the bar the whole time.  The bartender/server placed three menus in front of us and we chose our meals.  He ignored us for the most part and when we asked him for an explanation of some of the menu headings in spanish, he would mumble an answer that none of us could make out.  Two of our dishes came out at the same time and when the third came out about 5-6 minutes later, my daughter said, &#34;oh, I didn&#39;t know it&#39;s fried&#34; and the bartender responded with &#34;did you read the menu?&#34;  Now looking at the meals description of &#34;pollo&#34; under Tacos it says &#34;crispy rolled&#34; which still doesn&#39;t explain the &#34;deep fried&#34; meal that was given to her.  She explained that she is pregnant and has indigestion issues and he walked away.  So, the food was good and the service was ridiculously near non-existent and in your face rude...which is ironic since he wasn&#39;t busy mixing drinks, helping other diners, etc.  He would tell our order to one of the other servers and then they would hand the dishes to him and he would place them in front of us.  Spoke to the manager and she said that if we were coming back that she would like to make it up to us...my question is, &#34;why would I come back?&#34;"

It was quaint, great and amazing.  I went back last night with some friends and I was beyond excited. However, I have learned high expectations can lead to disappointing results. 

We went in, grabbed four drinks (at 50 dollars total... Am I back in bora bora?) and went outside to sit and wait for our table. I really liked having this option as I a quite am a people watcher.  Our table was called on time and we were brought to the building I ate at the first time. 

On to the order! 
They were out of cerviche, which was disappointing but it was also 830, so my bad.  We ordered pork belly, fish, steak, and pork tacos along with the corn and salsa. 

Everything was mediocre and the flavors were not what I remembered. I think what drove me the most crazy was that everything came out at the same time.  Even our chips and salsa. The tables are tiny there and there was no room for anything.  They had us take the tacos off the platters so they could take the platters away right then and there.  Thanks for the rush...   Maybe invest in a larger table? 

The neat thing was as we were leaving my friend spotted a semi famous celebrity couple eating there too."

Though the restaurant interior is a little dark, the pastor tacos are flavored brightly. Citrusy, juicy, oniony, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. The fruit guacamole and chicken tacos were also excellent, but the pastor tacos need more Yelp love. And here I thought I&#39;d only travel to Geneva for Swedish Days and ACK. Way to impress, Bien Trucha.

This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants ever and it is definitely worth the wait. Bien Trucha owns two buildings that are separated by their outdoor patio. One restaurant is for reservations and the other is seated on a first come first serve basis. I would strongly suggest that you make reservations as soon as possible as they get booked fast and sometimes it can take a month to reserve a prime time on a Friday or Saturday. 
We always have a large group and so we usually order pretty much everything on the menu. The drinks are phenomenal! My favorite of them all is the Ahuacatl. They give you complimentary homemade chips and bean dip and a must order is the salsa trio and the traditional guacamole. Another must order are the side dishes of rice and corn and the pescado tacos. I make it my mission to try fish tacos across the country and these are my favorite by far.

They need to change that so i can try different things. Then they need to make more unique tacos still the same ones.

Free appetizer:  its frizoles and chips the chips are fresh not greasy seasoned well the beans are really good i just eat all the cheeze in it then i stop not to get too fool

Ceviche del mes: i ordered this twice both completely different the first time it was really unique sometjing i never had before this time it was more traditional but still amazing its gormea so it has high quality ingredients in it then i love the salad in the bottom its not diluted  with water like alot of mexican restaurants must order!

Cazulita de camarones: this is the best dish here its so good the shrimp are cooked perfectly the sauce is really rich but a lil sour the perfect balance. The cheese underneath is to die for its so good its like a mexican fondue i wish they put more shrimp in it though u have to order this

Barriga de puerco: this was really good the sauce was really good to but i like my pork belly fried and its not fried 

Pescado taco: this was the best taco i have ever eaten its perfectly fried really crispy not greasy perfectly cooked not overcooked or dried seasoned really well the coleslaw is so fricken good adds so much richness to make it so decadent.

Atun taco: its really crispy but not greasy seasoned really nicely the sauce was really good i wish there was more surprised there was alot of tuna fish the salad on top was really good just wish that there was coleslaw instead  really good though 

Soup: crema de chile poblano: omg this was so fucking good i didnt expect anything of it i just ordered it cause it was cheap wow did this have so much flavor it was so rich one of the best soups i ever had it had a lil bit of smokey flavor not alot perfect for cold days comes with bread but i used the chips for crunch. Theres cheeze and potatoes at the bottom needs more though

Brocheta de carne: its a mexican shish kabob. It was cookd perfectly it was medium rare and the vetables werent overcooked wasnt to burned either the dipping cause was good could be better though it needed salt though the seasoning wasnt that good wouldnt order again

Enchiladas: umm this was my least favorite it was way to sweet was more like a dessert. And tasted like the can mole to be honest idk if they used it but tasted really similar to it. 

Mexican Corn appetizer: i love mexican corn but this wasnt really that good it needed sAlt jus had no wow factor i had better

Arrachera taco: this was my least favorite taco it was to plain i tasted almost everything off the menu and this had no wow factor the bien trucha is a way better steak taco i wouldnt order this again

Bien trucha taco: this was my favorite steak taco here its so good. The steak is cooked perfectly supper tender and flavorful. I love the cheese theres alot which is good. Then the salsa on top is so delicous not spicy just the right balance. Then theres chorizo on it which makes it even better not burned! Or really greasy.

Oysters: really fresh really delicious just i wish there was more condiments like horshradish theres just a black sauce and a red sauce needs a wow factor

Churros: this was my least favorite thing i ate here they were overfried and no sugar or cinnamon on any of them i had to ask for it.

Key lime pie: i hate key lime pie i dont really like things really sour but this was so fucking good it wasnt sour at all  the icecream was perfect not overturned not to sweet perfect texture. The crust at the bottom was supper crispy added alot of texture then theres  meringue that is blow torched so good not to sweet. Must order 

Corn cake: u have to order this one of the best desserts of my life u have to order this supper moist and flavorful the sauce is to die for theres tequila in it that really enhances the flavor of the cake its amaizing u have to get it"

When we first moved here, the word on the street was that this was the best in town.  While I will say that we enjoyed our time here, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d go out of my way to go back.  This is because, like other reviewers, I found the place to be a bit pretentious and over-priced.  The food was fantastic, although I would have expected almost twice the amount of food I got for the price I paid.  (More because of the portion sizes are very small).  Also, I would agree that I felt rushed to eat/leave, and don&#39;t even bother trying to bring kids.

I have eaten at this restaurant prior and it is amazing. I was truely dying to go back and was very excited the patio opened. Having said that the first two times I dined there I was pregnant the third my baby was very young and still in her infant car seat. 
On his particular evening we arrived and the hostess said it was 30-60 min wait. Mind you we tried to call for call ahead seating and the line was no response. I did mention this upon arrival and the answer I received was that they only have three phone lines so if all are in use they can&#39;t accommodate. We said ok we&#39;ll wait. I went to use the washroom and when I returned my husband was already seated. So about 5 minutes. Strange to say the least. They brought me to the table my husband and daughter were at. My daughter is 1 1/2. She was sitting on his lap. He said they don&#39;t have high chairs or boosters. (Something they should have told me from the beginning) ok fine this isn&#39;t going to work I thought. We left. I mentioned to the hostess on the way out I&#39;m sorry you don&#39;t have high chairs. We can&#39;t stay. 
There wasn&#39;t this sincere apology or anything of the sort. I almost felt like they were happy. I was truely disappointed and felt like it was because of our daughter. If kids aren&#39;t allowed then have a sign and post that. We dine out with our baby all the time. She is very well behaved. I mean who doesn&#39;t have high chairs. You&#39;re in Geneva not Chicago."

We had the guacamole, special ceviche (tuna), BT, Pescado and Pork Belly tacos, corn and thus amazing cheese fondito with chorizo.

This three star review is simply because of a simple &#34;we can&#39;t do that.&#34; I asked to have a Mojito made without the rum...I even went through the special drink menu to find the drink with the least amount of alcohol to make it uncomplicated. When I asked our waitress if they could make it &#34;virgin&#34; she said that they can&#39;t because they want to keep the consistency the same with all their drinks/food. What?! The funny thing is they would make me another special drink that was nonalcoholic but add mint for $1.00....does that make sense at all?! So you can compromise the taste of one drink but not another?

It&#39;s disappointing because as someone who might not always want a cocktail it is nice to see restaurants be accommodating especially with such simple requests....and kind of stupid when they arent."

If you are in a hurry, this is not your restaurant, as the servings are presented tapas style.   After trying several selections, we would highly recommend the pescado, atun, pescadillas and pastor tacos.   The Limonada, which is a combination of limes, oranges and soda, was the perfect answer for an afternoon in which a margarita was not possible because I was driving."

We called in and they put us on the list. We received a text just as we pulled up that our table was ready. They sat us at the Chef&#39;s table (bar). That was a nice experience as you can watch them cook and interact if you choose. Our waiter was friendly. The menu has great options. Mexican beer for $5 is nice. Glad they don&#39;t up charge the beer too much as an &#34;import&#34;. Margaritas starting at $9 and up to $12. Well, it&#39;s all fresh and mostly organic ingredients so I feel it&#39;s worth it. 

Chips and bean dip delivered complimentary. Very fresh. We ordered the guacamole as I tend to judge a place like this based solely on how fresh it is. NICELY done. We actually watched them prepare it. My wife ordered the special. Yellowfin snapper that was butterflied and grilled. Simply seasoned and perfect. Grilled lemon was a nice touch. Came with a red cabbage salad and tortillas. Delicious. 
I ordered the Pastor tacos. Very, very good. 

The place has a cool vibe. Very clean and noisy for what you&#39;d expect on a Friday night. They even have an outdoor patio area with heat lamps and shade sails. Wife reports that the bathroom was clean as well. A true gem for the suburbs. If you choose to skip this place, great. It&#39;ll just be less of a wait for others that want an authentic Mexican dining experience."

Atmosphere. Deep house music over the PA system. Nice! Outdoor seating with couches while you wait to be seated.

Food. I was expecting a larger menu but it turns out all they do is gourmet tacos and a few sides along with the typical salsas. Everything we had tasted very good.

Service: It was good. Nice, friendly waiter.

What I didn&#39;t like:

It&#39;s a little pricey but hey, it&#39;s Geneva and we just got back from Vegas so we knew weren&#39;t gonna get taqueria or Taco Bell prices. I thought the size of the tacos was OK. They weren&#39;t big but they hit the spot. Ordered a habanero salsa and I got an ounce and a half for $5. Ouch. Was expecting more items on the menu such as entrees considering all the buzz this place has but now I know if and when I go back not to expect more than tacos.

I would go back if I felt like gourmet tacos and wanted to eat outside with a group. I wouldn&#39;t go if i wanted authentic Mexican food in the form of entrees.

Edit. When I got my receipt, the habanero salsa was $2. I must have remembered the price on the menu which was $5."

I thoroughly enjoy every bite I put in my mouth at this lovely establishment. This last visit we started with a salad that was just heavenly: arugula, Granny Smith apples, cheese, nuts and some delicious lemony dressing. We also had the Bien Trucha tacos again and the Pescado and Pastor tacos, which were both amazing. The pork belly tacos were our 4th choice and to me, fell short of expectations since they weren&#39;t as crispy as I typically like. Service was great.

The first time you ride a bike, your wedding day, the birth of your children. Now add to the list, the first time you try Bien Trucha. 

Even with all the food options of Chicago, the modern house-turned-restaurant stole the show.

After being seated quickly my server suggested a few options and I settled on the Bien Trucha tacos (I figured it has to be good if they named the restaurant after it) and the Esquites, a mixture of roasted corn, epazote-butter, spices and lemon juice. It&#39;s hard to live up to the hype of the 29 Zagat score posted at the door and all the other reviews you have surely read below, but I&#39;m here to tell you it was far exceeded. The flavor was amazing. To the point I brought my wife back THE SAME DAY for dinner. Which you better be early to because by the time 5:00 PM rolls around there is a line of 30+ people. 

Regardless of what you choose to get, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE get the Esquites. You can put it on any taco and its guaranteed to knock your socks off. Take a bite, BOOM, no socks. 

Bottom line- Bien Trucha is worth any wait, any drive, and sort of service. It is that good."

Things I suggest if you&#39;ve never been:
Manzana salad: I LOVE arugula &amp; this is one of my all time favorite salads, period.
Bien Trucha tacos: tender skirt steak, great flavors
Pescadillas tacos: swordfish, crispy tortilla, fresh salsa
Esquites: amazing grilled corn (cut off the cob), with cheese
Pica-Pica: bbq shrimp wrapped in bacon w/onion &amp; pineapple 

Only negative- seating is TIGHT, so adjust your expectations on that front.

Their sister restaurant &#39;a toda madre&#39; in Glen Ellyn is great as well, but if I&#39;m picking one or the other..it&#39;s Bien Trucha that takes the cake."

For those wanting to try it out, the pepino margarita is really good, as is the a la diabla (shrimp tacos). Guac was mango today--another winner. 

The place was nearly empty at 5p on a Tuesday, however that didn&#39;t stop the waiter from rushing &amp; the bus staff clearing each plate before we set it down. Rushing with a long wait list on a weekend? Passable. But on a Tuesday when it&#39;s deserted?

The chicken is not tasty. I think it needs to be reevaluated by the chef. The skin pulls apart from the meat too easily. It also just doesn&#39;t taste that good. The sauce is good though. 

My first visit here I ordered a special that included a bit of everything and two sides with two pops. Since then, each time I attempt to order it, there are no sides to order. The first time, I figured maybe it was just a rough day. The second time, a week later, the man said &#34;you have to ask my wife about that&#34; I felt that was very unprofessional. The sides were so good the first time that I wanted to try more but haven&#39;t been able to because, I don&#39;t know, I have to ask his wife. I&#39;d rather them been out of them than just not have any for a random reason. 

Overall, I&#39;d go back because the ribs and sauce are really good. I&#39;d just never order chicken and get lucky if I happen to ever get sides again. By the way, the sides I tasted were cabbage and Alfredo with chicken."

Hard to come by for me, but I was impressed. The portion size was larger than expected. I got six lemon pepper wings and fries for about $7. Extremely reasonable. Ask for sauce on the side.

Best part was that my food was HOT and FRESH. Yep, I had to wait a lil bit, but I&#39;ll take that over some hard, chewy heat lamp food any day.

The wings were huge. I could only eat three. 

The lady behind the counter was patient and very pleasant.

Dining area was super clean. No crud on the tables or floor as with most places today. 

I am eager to return to try the rib tips! The guy beside me had them and they looked amazing! Juicy and saucy and meaty.

The fries had no seasoning, very little if any salt, thus barely any taste. There were a lot of older people, so maybe the taste catered to them. I also think they get a lot of residual business because some have been coming here for a while.

The only reason I have two stars and not one was the service. The cashier was friendly and the food ready extremely quick."

My friend from Lockport took me to Babe&#39;s for their   $1.50 hot dogs. What a mistake! The hot dogs were low quality generic type hot dogs that tasted terrible. Also it was so loaded with mustard that I got a big glop of mustard in my hand with every bite. I had to buy a small soft drink to qualify for the $1.50 hot dogs. At $1.69 for the soft drink, it is a huge ripoff. I can get a much better hot dog for $1.50 at one of the big box food warehouses and that includes a large drink which you can refill. I will not be back. NOT RECOMMENDED!"

I got a couple chili cheese dogs that were as good as most others around, it&#39;s pretty hard to screw up a hot dog, as Well as a Philly cheese steak sandwich for my fiance. The Philly was great flavorwise but I would have liked it to be just a little bigger. I also go fried mushrooms, when I first got them the centers were frozen but about a minute of carry over cooking made them just fine. Now to the reason they got 2 stars. Crazy expensive. The Philly sandwich alone costed over $7 and That&#39;s without fries and a drink. The chili cheese dog was almost $4 dollars a piece. $22 is to much for a small sandwich, 2 hot dogs, and mushrooms. Go to Babar&#39;s for a Philly and Joe&#39;s or Hey Hotdog for dogs and save a couple dollars"

The hotdogs tasted walmart brand and the chili tasted like hormels basic can of 1.75 chili what a coiecidence that walmart is right there, save your self money and go buy some ballpark hotdogs and wolfs chili for the same price but you get better quality and more food also the people are rude as hell and very patronizeing.

Anyway, I mainly come here for their salads and wraps. The salads are massive, fresh, and rival the more expensive ones at Portillos. The buffalo chicken wrap is great too! 

The burgers are pretty good, as well as the pulled pork sandwich. The hot dogs are definitely my least favorite item on the menu.

Quality is consistency, continual improvement, and setting a standard that customers expect and are happy to return to. Asian Harbor is not on course. Tonight, we ordered a variety of items for our family for take out. The proteins were all best described as &#34;jerkys&#34;. The chicken and beef were both over cooked, tough, and flavorless. While the shrimp and rice dishes were good, i can&#39;t tell if they were actually &#34;good&#34; or just good in comparison (oh, and the brown paper bag they overstuffed the takeout order into tore itself apart on the journey to the parking lot).

The challenge Asian Harbor is dealing with is maintaining standards that make it worth returning to. If you recommend a restaurant to friends and family, you want it to be as good as it was for you. But if every time you go, it&#39;s a quality gamble, you&#39;ll eventually stop going. You&#39;ll eventually stop recommending it. Ultimately, it won&#39;t stay open."

And when I got there we were one of two couples in seats and there were 4 people at the bar so there&#39;s no reason that table should be dirty.  And make sure to look all the way down near the bar. They obviously don&#39;t think the specials should be posted near where everyone will see them. I didn&#39;t see the specials until about 5min after ordering. 

And on cold days, leave your jacket on. We sat 1/2 way through the place and every time the door opened you get a strong cold draft. Never had this strong of a breeze in a building like this before. 

But the food is good."

I can&#39;t pass up ordering the Godzilla or Super Crunch roll. Great flavors and has a little bit of a kick. They actually hold up really well if you&#39;re doing a take-out order, too. You can&#39;t go wrong with the majority of the specialty rolls, but the Sunny was my least favorite. 

I&#39;ve also had the Kung Po chicken/shrimp. These can be a little more hit and miss in regards to the spiciness of the dish. If you don&#39;t handle heat well, be clear when ordering that you want it on the milder side.

The dine-in experience can be lengthy especially on a Friday or Saturday night. It&#39;s a smaller place, and groups of 6+ are going to struggle to have comfortable seating. I would highly recommend them as a quick take-out option. Order ahead and give yourself about 25 minutes.

I&#39;ve always had a consistently enjoyable experience. Very solid option."

After getting home I saw the carry out order was incorrect so I called and they were rude on the phone. They would not make  ANY attempt whatsoever at correcting the order. They would not take the food back and make the right dishes nor just refund my money. Over $30 for two screwed up entrees. Will not be back.
The phone conversation was a nightmare as they barely spoke English."

Their Chinese food blows the other places in town away. Just don&#39;t expect huge three day portions to take home. They actually seem to grasp how much a normal person can eat.

Their sushi is good but nothing amazing. Ive never been upset with taste or presentation and am always quite satisfied though they seem to skimp on the fish if you order a more expensive variety.  Their chef specials aren&#39;t quite daring or unique but worth the order.  

Service is good but slow they really do try their best to make you happy."

Let&#39;s get down to the sushi-
Spicy Tuna - Yum.  Standard spicy tuna roll, generous amounts of fish
Angel Hair -  crab on top with apple inside?  Heck yes.  Win
Dragon - Tasty eel, tasty shrimp

Can&#39;t wait to try their other Specialty rolls.  

The regular rolls are super cheap, under $6.00, so it balances out the specialty roll prices.

Also, they do offer an all you can eat sushi option for $21.00/person.

Chinese food smelled and looked great.

The service is slow, but the food is worth the wait.  Why rush through dinner anyway?"

That&#39;s exactly how I felt after I read all of these glowing reviews on this place. Are you guys smoking crack? Abusing prescription meds? Snorting Drywall!?!! I stopped in for lunch with my boyfriend based on the good reviews. The inside is decorated nicely. I loved how they decorated the napkins in cool stand up triangles on the tables.
      I ordered a watermelon smoothie to start. I was so excited that Asian Harbor actually used REAL fruit, and not a smoothie mix. I started with a Japanese appetizer called Gyoza, which was a fried dumpling that resembled a pot sticker. My boyfriend ordered pot stickers, and we actually laughed about how they were similar. The pot stickers and Gyoza were very good so I just knew I would enjoy the rest. I couldn&#39;t have been more wrong!!
     Anyhow lets get down to business. I ordered a Japanese dish trying to be different, and I didn&#39;t care for it. The picture shows shrimp tempura on top of noodles. I got ONE piece of shrimp??!!  #MassiveFailure!  The egg rolls sucked! I ordered pork egg rolls, and I swear they gave me veggie egg rolls. I cut them open and asked them to show me the meat. The waitress said the little pink dots are meat?? Crumbs! The egg rolls tasted like  frozen pre made Manchu wok egg rolls. I tried my boyfriends fried rice, and it was nothing special. The entire meal tasted like something you&#39;d get at a mall food court. #DoBetter

To call the service in this establishment appalling and abysmal is an understatement. 90 (ninety) minutes for service of entrées on a Monday night with a 5:45 reservation. Party of 6. 90 minutes to deliver what turned out to be surprisingly little food. Truly the slowest service I&#39;ve ever experienced. I would have walked out at around the 45 minute mark, but it was my mother&#39;s birthday. P. S. According to our waiter, the sushi chef is off on Monday nights. Apparently whomever showed up to prepare food tonight was also off. P. S. S. A dish on the menu which states it includes 14 pieces of tuna actually has exactly no tuna whatsoever. It does, however, contain eel. This was very puzzling to our waiter."

The service was good and the food got to us quickly. We had the all-you-can-eat plan where you select different sushi choices from a menu. It seems to contain most of the same selections from the main menu. So its just a matter of deciding how much you think you will order. They gave us the same deal for the children at half price and didn&#39;t charge for the 2 year old. The food was excellent. My daughter and her children have been living in Singapore for 5 years and they love sushi. They all enjoyed the meals here.

Soon as Asian Harbor opened I tried it and found my place.  Go here at least once or twice a month now.  My son love the Sushi (he is 8), and my daughter who is pretty picky sticks with the rice options.

I have never tried their Chinese food, instead focusing on their Japanese selections, of which they have a few non-standard offerings for the suburbs.

Their udon is spot-on and delicious.  It&#39;s hard to find out here, and the noodles were actually, well, Japanese.  An excellent example of traditional udon.  The tempura is also perfect.  The shrimp is breaded in panko and done in, again, the traditional style, and the vegetables were also a delight.  It was a pleasure to find somewhere with relatively good Japanese food near Lewis University.

The hibachi though.......left something to be desired.  I came in thinking it was one of those cook at the table chef flinging shrimp deals.  It is not.   But that&#39;s ok, not everyplace needs to be that.  EDIT: I just looked at the menu and they have a picture of the guy at the table cooking method.  Which was not an option that I saw on site.

Unfortunately the &#34;hibachi&#34; meals we ordered were on the bad side of crappy.  The meat was sub-par and the veggies had a smokey flavor to them, which was not terribly welcome.  The real kicker was that everything came out on one plate and lit seemed that they just poured a sauce over the whole deal.  The salad was saddening too, the ginger dressing was more like a ginger/thousand island mix dropped over some iceberg lettuce.  the whole meal was very lack luster and I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.

I haven&#39;t had the chance to try the &#34;Chinese&#34; food yet.  But I am willing and will do an update once I do.  Let&#39;s hope its better than the hibachi."

Unfortunately, our first visit netted average meat sandwiches and a dirty, unlocked uni-sex bathroom door leading to an eyeful of employee deuce-making (Ewww). Anyway, I checked out the Five Star Burger, while my wife tried her hand at the Bourbon Burger. Both seemed to have the makings of a good burger, but fell short in the flavor department. I almost question if the excess of ingredients on both sandwiches were in response to the flavorless meat product they called a burger. Certainly not fresh, almost completely dried out, and void of seasoning. If they called it a grilled onion, sautéed pineapple, and smoked bacon sandwich, I might have left with a smile. But they didn&#39;t, and I didn&#39;t. My wife&#39;s Bourbon Burger was a tad better as ingredients were above par, but again same meat patty was involved. We did grab an order of French fries, which were hand-cut and seasoned well; but ended up almost cold and were obviously waiting in the basket while the burgers thawed away. Bottom line... Five Star appears to be an average burger joint at best.  They do offer daily sandwich and side combos around $5, but probably won&#39;t be returning to check out the rest of the menu. 

And what&#39;s with the old-school Italian music in the background? So confused..."

Another place I was excited to give a review for.  Was getting my car repaired nearby and saw the great pics and reviews on Yelp of this place and decided to try them.  Small place but very clean.  They&#39;ve only been open close to 9 months.  I love supporting small businesses!  What I was impressed with right away was how friendly the staff were.  I appreciated that.  There was a couple that had gotten the Italian Beef sandwich which was huge and the Bourbon Burger.  Once I saw that Bourbon Burger masterpiece, I had to have that!!!  Very interesting combo of food that make up that juicy burger.  The burgers are handmade people!  When I opened my container to see my burger, I couldn&#39;t believe how huge it was!  Piping hot, because it was made to order!  One of the BEST burgers I have ever had!  So glad I went.  Can&#39;t wait to go back.  Want to try one of their shakes.

For the most part I was pretty impressed. I&#39;d actually give them a 3 and a 1/2 rating (but you can&#39;t choose 1/2 stars). I had the mushroom and swiss burger and it was pretty tasty. I really liked the buttery bun that they put it on. They put lettuce and tomato on it which is rare for a mushroom and swiss, but still good. The burger isn&#39;t that thick but it was made fresh to order. It could have used more swiss cheese. The mushrooms may have been slightly overcooked they were a little dark in color. I had a jalapeño cheese pretzel for an appetizer. It wasn&#39;t too bad but, it sounded better than it tasted. I&#39;m a pretzel aficionado so it takes a great pretzel to impress me. One thing that does irritate me about this place is the lack of drink selection. It&#39;s basically Coke or Pepsi.

I was asked several quick questions and in less than 10 minutes, I was served just what I had been hankering for PLUS a side of fresh, hot fries with my own bottle of ketchup.

I had a burger with grilled onions, mozzarella cheese and mushrooms served on a fresh, slightly grilled pretzel roll.

Wednesday is $1 tacos - so call ahead and bring CASH...NO debit/credit accepted.  They have ice cream and a large variety of Jarritos soda.  Dine in or carryout they provide home made hot/mild salsas and limes. The fresh tortillas whether it be corn or flour are moist.

I usually order 15-20 tacos for my family - they are packed 3 tacos per foil wrap and always include onion and cilantro.  We like the steak/potato with cheese, onion and cilantro - but everything I had here is good.

Rockdale is like a quiet movie set for something set in a deserted, wild west town.  Rockdale is just south of Joliet and might as well be a part of Joliet.  I discovered Rockdale when I had to pick up a package from the UPS facility.  Curiosity led me to searching for restaurants in Rockdale, and that&#39;s how I found El Comal.

As I already mentioned, they don&#39;t have horchata.  What the FF?  They do have a variety of Jarritos sodas though, so I got the pineapple.

My husband and I had lunch here on Memorial Day, I was surprised how busy this spot was on a Monday afternoon.  While we were eating, lots of people would come and go, and at one point, all of the tables were full.

The food is good.  I had 2 tacos: one steak, chicken, and pork.  All three were equally good, served on soft corn tortillas with the customary cilantro and onion.  Chips and salsa are complimentary, and there are 3 salsas to choose from.  We also ordered the guacamole, which was served in a styrofoam bowl.  The food is good, authentic, and great for a casual lunch or dinner.

Prices are great too, I think the tacos were only $1.25 each.  Cash only!

If you live in Plainfield, drive the few extra miles to El Comal, because I still stand by the fact that there is no truly good Mexican food in Plainfield, especially tacos."

Huaraches are the way to go here. I didnt get the chirozo as recommended but instead pastor &#34; the marinated pork.&#34; Wife had the asada huaraches.( Steak). I went there to get carryout. Place was mobbed at 6pm on a Monday. I waited a bit. Disappointed no horchata. Carryout was fairly quick. Cashier was a very pleasant girl. Still amazed  at the huaraches which are homemade soft corn tortilla shells. Whats interesting is they are not your standard 6&#34; or 12&#34; but a size different. They are an odd size which makes you realize they&#39;re homemade.   
Food was great! They put onions &amp; limes
on the side. I like that cause you can put extra hot sauce on then cut it slightly w/ the lime. Not sure but feels authentic. 
I want to dine in next time. As previous reviewers stated, its cash only. They do have an ATM there in case you forget that. 
I did also have the quesadillas which were slightly above avg but nothing special. 
The prices are well below average which is nice if you have a group. Wasnt looking for margaritas and didnt see any. Small parking lot on side but plenty of street parking . I&#39;d give it a 4 1/2 of 5 stars. If they had horchata, margaritas, and a better reputation for other menu items it 
could be a 5 but, definitely working checking out!"

El Comal is located in Rockdale, IL on a street that is famous for being in the Guinness Book of World Records for the most bars on one street (or something like that).  So the neighborhood is somewhat sketchy, but if you can past that it is definitely worth a stop. 

It was slammed at noon when we arrived, not an open table in the place.  Quite a mix of blue and white collar workers which tells me that this place is not a secret to those in the know in Joliet.  

I managed to read a few reviews while standing in line and kept seeing comments about the huaraches.  Now I&#39;ve eaten at a hundred different Mexican places and one thing that I thought was odd is that every place has pretty much the same selections on thier menu.    How the hell have I never heard of a huaraches????   

I ordered the Tripas Huaraches and a Mixed Huaraches (steak, pork and chorizo).  I give them both a solid A.   The best explanation I can give you is a really long soft taco that isn&#39;t rolled up and the taco shell is home made and unlike any taco I&#39;ve ever had.

Now, the salsa and the beans and rice leave a lot to be desired.  Had some of the sides been adequate I would have definitely given EL Comal a five star review!!

We went here on a Wednesday as they have $1 tacos (chicken, pork and steak only).  The first time we sat down with our two little ones who devoured the complimentary chips and salsa. We thought everything was great, except the chicken was a little dry.  The next time we visited, we took our order home. They give you plenty of everything to make sure your experience is short of dining in (minus chips). We had all steak tacos and they were delicious.  We will be frequenting this place, especially on Wednesdays :)"

If you feel confident strolling through downtown Rockdale at night without being strapped, I applaud you. Once you get past that it&#39;s all gravy. The food is cheap and relatively fresh,  but their homemade salsas are shwag. It&#39;s cash only, which means one of two things. They are a money laundering operation, or they&#39;re a bunch of rebellious hipsters. I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s the latter. The hours of operation are frustrating, I&#39;ve been left out in the cold  more than a few times with this place.

This looks like your typical hole in the wall, no frills, CASH ONLY taqueria but oh my, it is sooo not run of the mill!!!

The specialty here are the huaraches, which is pretty much a long, HUGE taco.  But what sets this place apart from the others?  FRESH TORTILLAS!!!  They make it from scratch!!!  You can&#39;t find that ANYWHERE!!!  

I ordered a steak (asada) hurache and a gordita with chicharron guisado (stewed pork skins in a very spicy sauce)  All delicious and very cheap!!! My husband had al pastor and lengua and he was quite pleased with his choices.

Spanish and English are spoken here for all my non-bilingual friends. I was being nosey and looked at other peoples plates at I saw some delicious looking omelettes with their fresh tortillas on the side and some very good looking burritos.

Carlos and his staff have truly created a masterpiece. It does not matter what you order because everything is Amazing!The quality of ingredients is second to none. What sets Tacos El Comal apart from the competition is their hueraches, which is hardly found in authentic Mexican cuisine. What makes the  huerache unique is that it is larger than a taco and has a sweet, corn/flour hybrid fluffy tortilla. furthermore, Tacos El Comal is one of a kind because of the salsa. The salsa has flavor that I have never tasted at any other authentic Mexican restaurant ever!!!  Particularly The red salsa has a smoky flavor great with steak.

Carlos, the owner Is a very friendly and is always working alongside his coworkers, and interacting with customers. Carlos takes pride in getting to know his customers and community. Do not be surprised if you are the only individual there that speaks english, which I think is a good thing because you know it&#39;s authentic. Another key feature is that it&#39;s super cheap. For 6 bucks a big guy like me can get full and still have quality. My wife and now live an hour away and still make trips to come here.

Bottom line: if you are looking for quality food and casual dining with a good culture and sense of community than this is the place for you. If you are a Pepes type of person looking for happy hour than this is  not your place.

This is the kind of eatery you&#39;ll find either by accident or came staggering out one of the 10+ bars the town has looking for some cheap, greasy food.

Tacos were above average. (especially when they&#39;re $1.00 each on Wednesdays) Its of the authentic kind and when they say if you want it with everything, they&#39;re referring to adding onions, cilantro on them. 

The huaraches was disappointing but was quite relieved that it was only a mere $3.25.  It was just a long tortilla with some diced steak on it.  However, I found a balled-up styrofoam in my bag containing long onion strips and a jalapeno, which I assume was for the huarache but didn&#39;t make it that much better.

My pork burrito was the real winner here.  If you like your burritos with lots of meat, beans, and cheese and with little lettuce and tomato, then you&#39;ve come to the right place.  I&#39;ve had burritos from numerous places and I rank the ones here right at top.

Overall, I liked Tacos El Comal but the huarache and being cash only prevents this place from 5 stars.  Everything else is great!"

Luckily there are only like two main streets in Rockdale and after a little web searching I found the correct place.Teeny tiny little hole in the wall in an industrial area that I would  never have come across.

Turns out these &#34;big tacos&#34; are known as huaraches and are the specialty here:  homemade large tortillas stuffed with a choice of filling, cheese, cilantro and diced onion. Served on the side are grilled onions and lime. Yum! Boy had the steak and I had the daily special of chorizo and potato. We also shared the guacamole which was homemade and a big step above most Mexican fast food places. Total bill with two drinks was @$12.  We were going to carryout but decided to eat in. To our table we were brought tortilla chips with salsa verde, salsa roja and pickled jalapenos. This was a nice suprise for a fast food restaurant."

We got our entrees first. Then we asked about the appetizer which came about 10 minutes later. ????  We were told the chef had to work on the appetizer and that&#39;s why it was late. I didn&#39;t get that.

My wife ordered the pepper steak tonight and I tried it and it was quite honestly the best pepper steak I have ever had. I love Thai food, this place takes Thai food and elevates the flavor beyond what I have had in recent years. Also the avocado roll appetizer is also amazing. The crunchiness of the fried roll gives way to a burst of deliciousness!!! I was highly impressed by those. From all I have tried here I would say the theme that comes across is balance. In all their dishes, not one flavor overpowers another, they just meld together and are bright enough to complement one another without stealing the show. Seriously impressed!

The restaurant we initially intended on eating at was closing soon, so we yelped it up &amp; found Montri Thai.

Located in a large strip mall in Winfield, IL it looks pretty simple on the outside. Once you get inside, however, it almost feels like you are at a restaurant near a tourist spot with soft music playing in the background.

We went on a Friday evening around 8:30pm, and the restaurant was on the empty side. We were seated promptly and given menus to look over.

I almost always order the Pad Kee Mao (spicy flat rice noodles) when I first visit a Thai spot. My husband ordered a curry dish (Coconut Yellow Curry?). My food overall was pretty decent. A little greasy for my taste, but definitely not overly oily to the point where I can&#39;t enjoy my food. The curry dish was delicious!

And I supposed you can&#39;t please everyone&#39;s taste buds and unfortunately, my taste buds were not a fan.  Everything else was great, and I would certainly come back to try other dishes.  The décor is modern and nice.  The service is fast and friendly.  The owner even came over at the end of our meal to ask how everything was and solicit any feedback we may have.  He also mentioned that they will have a live Jazz band one Friday a month starting in a couple of months.

Thai Iceed Tea $3 - This was very good, not too sweet at all (in fact, I could go a tad sweeter).

Tom Kha Kai $5 - Thai coconut milk soup with your choice of chicken or vegetable cooked with lemongrass, bell pepper, mushroom and lime leave.  This was a tasty soup, but what threw me off were the pieces of green bell peppers.  I love veggies, but this is one of my least favorite vegetables.  I&#39;ve never had that in a Tom Kha before.

Lard Nar with Tofu $9 - Big flat rice noodle with Broccoli and Collard Greens in garlic gravy.  They made this with a very strange twist - the noodles were crispy and the sauce was watery.  Maybe this is the fusion part.  I was expecting the normal soft wide rice noodles with thick sauce and didn&#39;t particularly enjoy this variation.  Also, I didn&#39;t see any collard greens.

Spicy Catfish $14 - Deep fried crispy catfish with red curry paste in coconut milk, topped with a touch of crispy basil leave.  My favorite dish of the night and it was delicious.

There were plenty of food, which we took home as leftovers.  I was particularly touched that even though we only had a tablespoonful of rice left, they had packed us more rice to go with our leftovers."

Finally, great Thai close to home! I have been dying for some great Thai food ever since I ate at Banana Leaf in Dallas and remembered just how great Thai food could be. (amazingly the owner there looked Thai, but had a thick Cajun accent)

Seriously, we eat Thai food a couple of times a month and have been making do with food that is just OK and creeping up in price. Many of these Thai places don&#39;t even serve much seafood... What&#39;s up with that?

Montri Thai has a full menu with all the right stuff. We started with the Avocado rolls and Chicken Satay... followed by Pad See Ew with Beef, Tofu Thai Fried Rice, Thai Orange Chicken and Panang Curry.

Everything was delicious! The Panang Curry is a real treat and the Satay is the best that I&#39;ve had in a long time (looking forward to trying the pork satay) I can&#39;t wait to get back there to try the whole red snapper and some of the other seafood dishes.

Now there is more to eat in Warrenville than just Two Brothers.

Good prices, a nice room, decent wine list, friendly service and great food... an awesome formula for success. Now if only they could work on their Cajun accents"

The portion I was served felt endless, and there were plenty of perfectly cooked shrimp.  I asked for &#34;spicy,&#34; and my dish absolutely was spicy without blowing my head off.  But don&#39;t eat those little red chilies in the dish, because those will make your mouth hurt.  I mistook them for a dried fruit, but I have no idea why I assumed something so ridiculous, so my mouth suffered a little.

The avocado rolls were interesting.  I liked the creaminess of the avocado and the crunchiness of the roll.  But it kind of tasted like guacamole which threw off the whole Thai thing.  Our friends ordered the Angel Wings appetizer, which looked like a giant stuffed chicken leg and deep fried.  I didn&#39;t get to try it, but it looked delicious.

There&#39;s a good variety of Thai dishes on the menu aside from the predictable Pad Thai including red, yellow, and green curries, and quite frankly a lot of other things I cannot recall much less pronounce (Pad See Ew, Kung...tingtangwallawallabingbang...)

Montri Thai is located in a strip mall, alongside a laundromat and thrift store, so I expected a more divey, casual joint.  While Montri Thai is casual, the interior of the restaurant felt intimate and classy with the dark wood tables, booths, and white tablecloths.  The restaurant can definitely accomodate groups, but it was so quiet in here (aside from the Christmas music) that I felt like I had to keep my voice down.

Good Thai food especially if you are looking for something a bit more upscale than the divey take-out joints."

However, I was so disappointed with the food and service here. I ordered Tom yum and pad see Wei. Unlike all the Tom yum I tasted before, it is too sweet and not really spicy. My husband ordered Panang curry, and this is the only dish he eat every time when we go to a Thai restaurant, but it is too salty. I think I just order some common dishes that you can find almost in every Thai restaurant. But this time is the worst."

Hands down, this is it. Whether it&#39;s break ups, work stress, or something else, their cocktails are excellent (both in liquor content and price) and their Rama Chicken makes everything temporarily better. The Rama Tofu isn&#39;t bad either. It&#39;s large enough that if you pick at your food and have a liquid dinner when stressed, the food still tastes good microwaved the next day.

It&#39;s true, hardly anybody dines in. Which makes it perfect to talk to the servers. My favorite is on maternity leave but I&#39;ve since become Facebook friends with her. Yes, this place is that amazing.

Taste was pretty good. The duck was fried and some was hard to eat since the breading or whatnot was extremely tough. 

The prices are about average for dinner and not too expensive. I think my appetizzer was around $6 and my entree was around $18.

Service was fine with no issues.

What I know is, whatever food I tried was good so I&#39;m going to give Montri the benefit of the doubt here.  Really the two major issues were that the service was really slow.  We waited a LONG time just to get our appetizers like avocado rolls and soup.  That was excessive, but again maybe the issue was the size of our group, 8 adults and 6 kids.  The other issue my friends complained about was the sweetness of the food.  Many entrees came out quite sweet, which wasn&#39;t ideal.

I tried a couple of things.  First off, the avocado rolls were great.  Almost like a Tex/Mex-Asian fusion thing going on.  Really nice.  On the other hand, the Tom Kha soup was... not what I expected.  Not that it was bad, but it just didn&#39;t taste like the Tom Kha soup I have almost everywhere else.  I&#39;m all for unique flavors, but this just seemed like a whole different kind of soup.  Really, the soup was my only complaint.  The red curry was great and the Pad Kee Mao was good.  I think we could and should have upped the spice levels on everything we ordered.  Adding in the hot sauce provided the heat we needed.

I would recommend Montri.  I would come back and give them another shot in terms of the service assuming part of the issues were just due to our group size.  We&#39;ll hope for a better experience next time."

We arrived hoping to finish dinner by the closing time we thought was 9 (actually 10) on a Friday.  The place wasn&#39;t too full, but the decor and setup is very clean and modern while still being comfy.  We took a bit of extra time to order since we wanted to scan the whole menu to see what they had to offer, and the waitress was extremely polite and not bugging us, but attentive none the less.

We ordered some Thai Tea that really stuck to your gums.  The very good flavor hung around in your mouth if you let it.  Then we decided on some Tom Kha Kai which came in a plenty large enough bowl to share (but not too large as to leave you groaning).  The flavor was very good but there was an interesting aspect - bell peppers.  It wasn&#39;t bad, but it was unfamiliar for the dish (as well as a couple of others).  Probably just something to get used to.

We also had the Pad See Eiw which was delicious, but the noodles may have been fried too much (unless they started with a different wide noodle than I&#39;m used to) as they were a bit too hard to cut with a fork and or spoon.  We commented to the waiter and he said he would tell the chef and thanked us for our opinion.  The dish also had broccoli instead of collard greens, but the flavor was great either way.

The other dish we ordered was the spicy catfish.  It was a very good mixture of red curry and coconut milk with a spice that I thought I was going to need to spice up at first, but set in to the perfect cruise to spice town.

When the waiter went to wrap up our food he noticed that we did not have much rice and, without asking, packed a nice, full extra container for us to take.  Awesome!


I really liked the lounge-style oldies that were playing the whole time we were there (Beatles, Doors, Steely Dan, etc) and the waiter also noted that they will be featuring live jazz once a month (2nd Friday?) and possibly more often if it is popular.  Cool stuff!"

I have been to Thailand, know the food and even speak it. We ordered some very basic carry out and it was mediocre at best. The pad Thai was tasteless as was the fried rice. Real Thai food uses fish sauce. Especially in pad Thai and fried rice. I don&#39;t understand Thai restaurants owned by Thai people that have lousy food, especially to a culture where food is so important. This did not have that Thai flavor. Crab Rangoon (which isn&#39;t Thai but who cares) was ok. I normally get joy Yees but they are temporarily closed. I will not order from here again. If you&#39;re reading this and are Thai, the food is &#34;juhd cheep-hai&#34;! Which in Thai means bland as hell. Skip it"

For our entrees we had the panang curry with chicken and tofu and the green curry with chicken. Both were flavorful and delicious!! Some of the best I&#39;ve had in the Chicagoland area. The green curry was creamy coconutty goodness with thinly sliced bamboo shoots, peas, and peppers. Both dishes also had just the right amount of heat to balance out the sweet and creamy.

We were stuffed but had to try out the mango sticky rice for dessert since everything else we had ordered was so authentic and tasty. I&#39;m glad we did because it didn&#39;t disappoint! Left happy and stuffed."

We visited Reserve 22, at Village Links, on a Fri nite in May &#39;15. The place was already very busy at 7, not so much with golfers coming off the links, but with diners who made &#34;22&#34; their target for the evening. A loud boisterous crowd filled the dining room, the large bar, and most of the terrace. Video screens covered sports of the day.

Service was very attentive, and there was plenty of staff to handle the large crowd as well as keep problems down and service up.

&#34;22&#34; is not the usual clubhouse dining. A long list of craft and specialty beers, and wines, are offered. They do have typical soup/salad/sandwich menus, but also an interesting list of small plates and sides, from $3 to about $15. A limited list of plate dinners ran mostly below $20. We had chicken linguini w/artichokes and bistro steak w/truffle/parmigiana fries. The steak was no filet but was well prepared and nicely dressed with a savory, slightly tangy sauce. The fries were to die for! I devoured the whole mountain of them. The chicken pasta, a large serving, was very good and included several dried tomato slices. Sides are extra.

The noisy crowd diminished about 9PM and management went to great efforts to move the band, and pull out some tables, for those who stayed for the entertainment and dancing until 11.

While not gourmet dining (3*), and the noise is not our thing, prices are modest,  the food offerings are creative, the mood is up-beat, and service very attentive (management gets a 5*). A good value and fun place. Res. recommended."

But actually we didn&#39;t like it there. Ordered the Montri Starters platter, Tom Yum chicken soup and Pad Kee Mai. The platter was Good. Tom yum was good, but it was totally different from what I used to have. We didn&#39;t like the Pad Kee Mai, it had too much salty. I don&#39;t know if its just our bad luck.

It started first with us walking in...and not be acknowledged. no sign saying to seat yourself, or wait to be seated. We had to go and find someone to ask.  
We placed our order and asked for 2 sodas.   We waited and waited. 15 minutes passed and the waitress never brought our drinks, or even stopped by. 20 minutes passes and nothing.   The restaurant wasn&#39;t even that busy. It seemed that almost everybody was waiting for food. Even people for carry out waited much longer than what seemed necessary.   After 30 minutes with no visit from the waitress, no comment that they might have been short-handed, or anything...we finally just walked out and left. Prior to walking out, I noticed a couple behind us almost walked out as well.  
If you have all night to wait for dinner...this might be the place for you.   The only positive thing worth mentioning is the place has a nice decor. If I could give zero stars for this place, I would, but they get one by default."

Nestled off Rt. 59 in a strip mall, we walked past it going to the hardware store and decided to give it a try. My husband is gluten and dairy free, so I sold him on the rice noodles and peanut oil in Thai food.

We have been back twice and loved everything we have tried. I adore the mango lobster roll appetizers, which are spring rolls with a peanut sauce you can spoon on yourself. I&#39;ve had the baby corn and peapod and trio delight entrees and they were both delicious. My partner had pad thai chicken and some kind of coconut curry with shrimp and pineapple that he raved about. The Jasmine iced tea is refreshing and light, too.

The banana dessert reminded me of overcooked oatmeal, but there is so much delicious food, I can skip dessert. :) I will definitely be going back often and we noticed they do a brisk carryout business, so we are looking forward to having a new carryout place that is on my way home from work."

At any rate, we went in to dine. Yelp, I hate to be the dissenter but I fear that I must say that Montri is carrying on Ariya&#39;s mediocre tradition.

Why? Due to pretty much everything we ordered. For an appetizer we split the Blue Sea Crispy Rolls. For a dish that claimed to contain a combo of lobster, crab, shrimp, and scallop along with carrot, cabbage and bean threads, I have to say that the seafood was almost undetectable. The taste wasn&#39;t bad for what it was, but what it was was pretty much a deep-fried veggie roll. 

For our entrees he ordered the sweet almond beef and I got the mussaman curry with chicken. Mine came in a large ceramic cauldron, a heady broth of coconut milk bobbing with potatoes and chunks of pineapple; I fished around with the serving spoon to locate the chicken I&#39;d ordered until we realized that it had been made with tofu. 

(Servers: this is what an ordering pad is for!! There is no shame in using one!!)

I snared the waitress before she got into the back, and she took it away and apparently they remade the whole dish, because my friend finished his whole meal before mine came back. It ended up being okay, but in the end I should have tried something else initially (had I known). 

His dish was alright but as he said, only serviceable. 

There were a number of interesting sounding dishes on the menu (nutty chicken, coco chicken) and a plethora of seafood dishes (including the hilariously named (Hotty Seafood), but after this experience I&#39;ll return to the safety of Le Siam further south on 59."

Montri has yet to dissapoint. I do go at lunch a lot and the 5 star dish is wonderful. I recently went back and tried the spicy basil chicken- WOW. Excellent job! The starter egg drop soup was much different than expected and was delicious.
I really appreciate a restaurant that makes things fresh and care about what they serve. Montri is small and quaint and makes it&#39;s food a nice presentation which I appreciate, and you can taste the freshness. Try it, you&#39;ll like it.

Called in a pick-up order and was bringing food back to some friends who own a nearby business. Upon arriving, I liked the interior and the people were friendly, but when I got the food back, I was shocked to see what was being portrayed as thai food. Got a few noodle dishes and a bunch of apps. NONE was good and none was remotely close to authentic. One step up from food court sweet and sour chicken at the mall really. Ask for spicy, and you get a 1/2 cup of red pepper flakes thrown in at the end type of crap - and the crazy thing is that people like this junk. Needness to say, I&#39;m still looking for the elusive (and even edible) suburban thai food."

The menu selection was extensive (not just your typical pad thai etc.)

The mango lobster roll appetizers were great but keep in mind they are spring rolls.  For some reason I was anticipating something more like an egg roll but that was my own fault for not reading the description well enough.  

The food had good flavor and the ingredients tasted fresh.

(I normally go to Tusk Thai in Batavia) So I work in Warrenville and came across this place online when searching for a nearby Thai restaurant. I stuck to what I know best which is why I ordered Thai fried rice with chicken. The chicken was very flavorful and delicious! Definitely exceeded my expectations! Now the rice on the other hand didn&#39;t. I&#39;m not sure what ingredient they used too much of but the taste reminded me a lot of the $1 Michelina&#39;s boxed frozen fried rice which I do not like. Price for my order was about $10 and it was a good size portion if only I had liked the flavor more. I just admit I was a tad bit disappointed that it was not as good as my favorite Thai restaurant.

This is a Thai restaurant and all Thai flavor sucks. I decided to give a shot because of the reviews but I was so mad with every single dish. It is the worst Thai restaurant ever. They can even cook a simple curry normally! Even the Tom yum soap! Do you think people don&#39;t know Thai food! You can buy the Thai curry from a Asian supermarket it is way much better than this! When I walked into the restaurant I&#39;m glad  because the waitress are Thai people but when I eat I got so confused. WHAT THE HL is dat! I have been Thailand and I eat a lot Thai food in U.S. But this is so bad can you Thai guys try yourself? HOW you can sell this and it is not cheap. At least you guys should give some real Thai rice because it is famous and normal in Thai food; HOWEVER! The rice is so sticky and slagging I&#39;m sure it is the same rice like super cheap Asian fast food rice. Well, anyone who give 5 stars I hope you guys enjoy. Im would be glad my review could help someone or maybe just one person who gonna try this restaurant.

I&#39;m still impressed. I do think next time we&#39;ll dine in. Tastes much better without the car ride. Nothing beats hot out of the kitchen crab rangoons.

We had the avocado rolls again. I think that is my favorite thing here!
The rangoons were good again.

I tried the chicken satay, and it was good, but again, not my thing. Just the flavoring of it wasn&#39;t to my liking. But it&#39;s good. Again, I hope this makes sense. Just because I didn&#39;t like it doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t. All I could taste was the marinade, not the chicken. not how I like it. It was heavily flavored. There&#39;s the word I want. the peanut sauce that goes with was pretty tasty.

Hubby had the tom kha. He was happy with it. And now he has satay for lunch. 

Our order was ready in a timely manner. And it tasted good. :) I&#39;m a happy customer. And I&#39;m full.

The chicken satay was more chicken than usual Thai places...I loved it had more meat but my wife thought Le Siams was tastier. The garlic chicken and shrimp fried rice were very tasty as well.

Time of my visit: Early dinner

This was my first time at Muscle Maker Grill...  I should note, I did not realize that it was a chain until after I started writing this review.  However, I will make an exception, because of the uniqueness of the chain (it&#39;s mostly located on the east coast NY/NJ area).

Off to the experience, I paced my order for pickup.  It was easy to place it, however, we wanted Warrior Nachos, but sadly they were out of chips/nachos.  I ordered Premier Burger and my girlfriend ordered Penne Romano.  When I arrived the order was ready.  I liked that!

I was a bit surprised by the portions, I guess being too long in this country, I got used to large portions.  The portion was probably right size.  My total was $17 and change, which was a bit pricey, even for this area.

Off to our food.  I could not speak to my girlfriend&#39;s food as she only let me try a little bit, but I would say, I was a bit disappointed...  The side I chose was cucumber salad.  The salad was decent, it was well seasoned.  The burger was interesting...  It seemed that the topics and the cheese over powered the taste of the meat.  The bun was good.

I would give this place a C-.  For the price I was expecting more value for the price.  Service was very good!  I would like to come back and try Warrior Nachos."

I was excited when I found this place offering tons of high protein/low carb options, plus nutrition information that&#39;s posted online. I ended up being pretty disappointed with my meal... I ordered the turkey taco salad, no cheese, and sour cream on the side. The turkey was broken up so fine it was almost like a meat sauce on top of lettuce, and it was lukewarm. The salsa that came on it was like jar salsa. It tasted like there was a lot of sodium in it too (and verified by their online nutrition facts). It was far from wow-ing me, that&#39;s for sure. There are healthier, more flavorful ways to punch up ground turkey to make it fantastic, and sadly, I was wishing for my own cooking as I ate this. I was only able to eat half, and the rest will be in the trash shortly. My guy got their chicken entree dinner- a grilled chicken breast, potato and steamed broccoli. Everything came out piping hot, but we never saw a piece of chicken go on their grill. He said even though the potato was steaming the entire time, it didn&#39;t taste hot, which was strange. He suspected some microwave action in play.

The only saving grace was the staff who made sure we had a clean table to sit at, fresh cups for water, and checked on us once while eating. This place has potential, but we were far from impressed and won&#39;t be back."

I stopped in to grab something light and ended up getting a cheeseburger salad and a chocolate 16 ounce protein shake. Overall, I love the concept since I eat basically a modified paleo. They have a lot of healthy choices for most diets your on. Looking at the menu I didn&#39;t see too many organic options or gluten free however I understand a lot of the foods are inherently gluten free. Great concept, okay price point, pretty good flavor profile."

Since I work in Wheaton, I thought this might be a good place to grab a healthy lunch from.  Yes, I was right.  My first visit here was after a boxing class at the gym, I just wanted a protein shake...they have em! They taste great and are of decent size for the cost, and most importantly, convenient.  
The night I stopped in to pick up a shake, the woman asked me if I wanted food to go along with it, and I said no, because that was big enough for a meal, plus I watch my carb intake.  She pointed out their low carb options which brought me back here last week for lunch. I called ahead for the &#34;Texas&#34; one of their low carb solutions.  It was just perfect (and filling) for lunch.  It was still hot when I brought it back from work, plus the container is great for food prepping at home.  

This place is also a heaven sent as I&#39;m currently participating in a weight loss challenge at my gym.  I will continue to stop in at this place.  All of their nutrition information is posted online... all healthy stuff!!!!

This place caters, they deliver, they have take out and have meal plans...how cool is that?!?!  They need to open more of these, because every suburb should have one!"

You see, I&#39;ve always carried around a bit of extra weight since late childhood, but I have taken steps to combat that, to get rid of bad eating habits, and to stay physically active. And so Muscle Maker Grill helps make Review 200, and it helps me in my quest for 200, because they offer well-portioned and well-PROportioned meals. You want high protein/low-carb? Balanced lean protein, veggie, and starch? Veggie options? It&#39;s all there. You can tell certain food items come pre-cooked, or pre-prepared in some fashion. But the price is right, and at the end of the day, someone else is doing all the food prep for you! Most meals can be split into two sensibly sized portions. Eat half now, save the rest for later.

If you&#39;re reeeeeeally not into the whole cooking/meal prep thing, they also offer meal plans that run about $7 per meal, with no weekly commitment whatsoever. I also get a 10% discount thanks to my association with the Cardinal Fitness in Glen Ellyn. With mostly healthy, and mostly guilt-free options, there&#39;s a little room to feel like you&#39;re cheating, but also plenty to make sure you stay true to your nutritional goals. The quest for 200 (and beyond) continues!"

They have a nice selection that is healthier than 95% of the other offerings around town.  I had a chicken breast that was served over steamed broccoli, what a treat instead of fries.  Lots of different choices, good food, hot, cooked fresh. 
On the flip side, I have had the chicken breast sandwich and it was pretty small, about the same size bun as a Mcdonalds regular burger, and the smallest chicken breast I have seen. I think it was $9, and that came with a side. Was a little underwhelmed.
I had the godfather last time, which the menu lists as Griled chicken and Portabella mushrooms. Since I love the earthy taste of portabellas, I tried it.  Well, the vast majority of mushrooms on my dish were regular button mushrooms.  The person at the counter said they mix up both kinds.  So why doesn&#39;t it say Portabella and Button mushrooms?  If I saw an offering that said &#34;Kobe beef burger&#34;, I would expect 100% Kobe beef, not a mixture of 90% ground chuck, and 10% Kobe, right? I felt like I was a little mislead, and that makes me wonder what else is &#34;mixed&#34; on the menu."

There food is simple, portioned and good. I am excited to try the other four meals I have in the fridge. You don&#39;t have to do the meal plans but it does save you time and money.

We&#39;ve been talking about going for months and we finally found ourselves nearby so we decided to go for a late lunch. Upon entering, there was a weird, bad grill smell- strike 1. The place was completely empty- strike 2. We ordered the Texas Chicken Nuggets, Rocky Balboa Wrap, and Arizona. Our food came out 2 minutes after we ordered it- strike 3!!!! I thought it was going to be great that it was empty, they&#39;d have plenty of time to cook our food, but no....they clearly took pre-cooked food and microwaved it. Every part of me did NOT want to eat this chicken and turkey bacon... And alas, I had an excuse not to- there was a hair or fuzz in it.

My friends and I really, really liked this place.  The food tasted great, which I wasn&#39;t expecting because I thought it was going to be bland health food. I was totally wrong!  This place is great!  

What I learned is that most of their food is made fresh, not frozen.  That&#39;s one of the things that makes it such a healthy option.  

First thing I noticed is our food arrived to our table steaming hot!  Sweet!  I ordered the El Mexicana from their entree menu.  It had seasoned chicken, black beans, rice, bell peppers, cheese, and salsa.  Mmmm!  It was more than I could eat.  I took some home.  They have these really cute take-home containers that are microwavable, dishwasher safe, and reusable!  I&#39;m totally saving this for future uses.  

One of my friends ordered the Rocky Balboa wrap.  The Rocky Balboa had a blend of chicken and meatballs with mozzarella cheese and a tasty sauce.  I was lucky to get a taste before my friend ate it all.  After one taste, I knew why he ate it so fast.  It was SO good!!  I think I&#39;ll order that next time.  The wrap came with a side dish.  My friend chose the spicy chunks of potato and loved them too!  

My other friend ordered the grass-fed beef burger and had a side of the greenest, brightest, most flavorful broccoli she had ever seen or tasted.  I don&#39;t know what their secret is, but this was beautiful broccoli!  The burger was incredible, so tender and juicy!

We will DEFINITELY be back!  Looking at their menu, Muscle Maker Grill delivers and also offers meal plans. That&#39;s cool.   There are lots of options to explore at this place.  They will certainly see us again."

A friend had a chicken and broccoli dish, the broccoli was very green and fresh and had a wonderful balsamic vinegar sauce. 
The steak wrap had a great deal of steak and the side of spicy potatoes hit the spot for another friend.

We loved everything about this place and the food was delicious. My boyfriend had the Godfather &#34;guiltless entrée&#34; it came with TWO chicken breast on a bed of broccoli and some portobello mushrooms and peppers. I tried some.. And wanted more. I had the TeX Mex fajita wrap and a cucumber salad both were the bomb. Considering going there again this week the place was so good.

That being said, they still don&#39;t have the well rounded selection they once had. But they have bottles craft beer nonetheless. 

My recommendation to management of this store is to get the whole menu reprinting thing done before you dispose of the existing menus. And, educate your servers through the transition from old menus to new menus.

My sister &amp; I decided to go for an early dinner on Sunday March 20th to enjoy our girl time, we chose on hooters because it&#39;s something we both thoroughly enjoy &amp; have done it every couple months, religiously might I add. This was literally the worst service I have received at this location.

They messed up our food order. Which took 40mins to come out. Mind you, it was not busy. They brought two cheeses when I asked for ranches &amp; never brought our fries.. which whatever, it was fine. Mix ups happen. I understand because I used to work in a restaurant. I was also given a dirty look when I asked for extra lemons for my water, for the second time in 20mins. So I corrected our served almost immediately about the mix up. &amp; yet, she still tried to charge me for the fries we didn&#39;t receive &amp; the cheese we very obviously didn&#39;t use or touch. When I corrected her a second time, she had the audacity to go back to the cook to check if I had fries on my plate.

I was given no utensils. Crab legs came with orange slices (????) Wing badder doesn&#39;t taste like traditional Hooters wings. So many young girls employed with no customer service skills. Took forever to get the check. Don&#39;t waste your calories or money here.

These were a tad on the dry side however, definitely could have used more sauce.  We asked for extra sauce and I was disappointed to learn I was charged for that when the bill came around.  You didn&#39;t put enough on so now I have to pay extra for something you failed to do?  As well as the ranch dressing and celery.  I mean, c&#39;mon.  These are the things that typically are included with wings.  I&#39;m surprised I wasn&#39;t charged for my ice water.  Seriously though.  What makes ranch dressing so special?  There&#39;s ketchup on the table.  I don&#39;t see a charge for that.  

I&#39;ve also noticed the prices have increased as well.  Now paying nearly $1 per wing.  At least they&#39;re decently sized, but it&#39;s getting to the point where our hooters visits will be seldom if any.  $50 for two people for wings and beer is ridiculous."

I am a frequent customer here and today I went there and had the worst service I have ever had in my life. We waited over ten minutes to be greeted at our table while our waitress talked with other employees and ignored us.The waitress was ditsy and I had to repeat my order to her multiple times even tho she wrote it down. She could tell we were frustrated with her and went on to talk about us to other employees right I front of our faces.  We then had employees staring at us while we are our food.  My girlfriends food was over cooked and she didn&#39;t even eat it.  No service was provided after we got our food.  The waitress name was lexxy.  If u ever get her I suggest getting another waitress.  Avoid this restaurant as much as you can.  If you have a taste for hooters spend the extra gas and drive to another one.

Carryout has seriously disappointed me on two separate occasions.  The first disappointment I ordered wings for the first NFL game of the season.  I timed it so I could be back home with the wings for kickoff.  Unfortunate for me, Hooters jacked up the entire order.  Instead of having my order ready when I got there, Hooters had to start a new one while I stood there and waited.  By the time I got home with my wings, the game was in the second quarter. 

The second carryout disappointment came this past Friday, December 12th.  When I arrived to pick up my order, they couldn&#39;t find it. Why?  Because they put it under the wrong name, (&#34;Pink&#34; instead of &#34;Kate&#34;) which took the manager forever to find.  I ordered fries and ten wings.  The fries were hard and cold; the wings were dried out and overcooked.  I live only 10 minutes from Hooters.  Food does NOT get that cold that quickly. Nothing was edible. I totally wasted my money and was so irritated!!  Hooters left a bad taste in my mouth, pun intended."

The second time we finally got what was owed, actually part of it. We were supposed to get a half off for the order and 2 pitchers, we got the discount, but still had to pay for the one pitcher we got. The GM said my name and what we were supposed to get was to be in their book or in the office and the manager at the time after searching several times said no. He reluctantly called the GM at home and she said the half off. Apparently she even forgot about the pitchers. We thought after that visit, the service and speed would pick up. Boy we were wrong, I don&#39;t know why everyone in our group wants to go back. Our waitress this time, Alexis was good at taking our orders, but when it came to taking care of extra needs like silverware, hand wipes, and extra sauce it was horrible. Never saw silverware and had to ask for the hand wipes. Refills were far and few, one person in our group had iced tea and when he asked for a refill, they didn&#39;t have any more and had to get a diet Pepsi instead. Wouldn&#39;t you think if the place is still open that they would still have tea available. Usually around 11:20 or so, you can see the girls cleaning up and straightening up tables for the next day. I get it was busy earlier with the Blackhawks game on and some other sporting events, but come on you are open til midnight. Our waitress, was not very attentive and when one at our table asked for blue cheese dressing, it took a good 10 minutes. The refills took about as long. I don&#39;t get how two buffalo chicken sandwiches, a philly cheese steak sandwich and an order of wings all with tots or onion rings can take 30-40 minutes. Flagging down a manager to ask him won&#39;t do any good, since you can&#39;t rush frying chicken. 
I ordered no cheese on my sandwich and it had cheese, I didn&#39;t want to risk the food going back only not to receive a sandwich back. The onion rings that came with the food were nothing more than frozen onion rings you can get at a grocery store and I got maybe 8 rings. When you order tots or fries, the plate is loaded with them. 
It would take a lot to get my business back and I will encourage everyone in my group to go to TGI Fridays nearby. We are loyal customers who are tired of getting the raw end of crap service."

I am not a big Hooters fan but I tried to be fair here; the biggest issue I had in this Hooters was the parking, it is just off the mall loop drive but it is really confusing trying to find the parking lot

I was promptly greeted at the door and I took a seat at the bar (good so far). I ordered a long island and Chicken quesadilla. The waitress didn&#39;t know how to make the Long Island (really) and the manager was no help, the staff seemed happier running around being rambunctious than being productive. That being said the long Island was below par the quesadilla was pretty good.

Perhaps once a year I get a craving for regular wings and curly fries from here.  This is the closest location to me, which is in a far outlot of Louis Joliet Mall, and can be a bit tricky to get to via the mall parking lot.
     We came in for a late lunch on a Wednesday afternoon, and were one of the six or so occupied tables.  Although music was playing, the atmosphere was quite subdued for a bar/grill type of place.  Our server was prompt and well-endowed (Duh!) but very listless.  Not that I expected rah-rah fanfare, but at least crack a smile now and then.  I then noticed that the entire staff had that same robotic, nearly catatonic sort of vibe going on.  Maybe everyone was just winding down and chilling after dealing with the lunch rush.  Who knows.  
     I had my normal order of regular wings and curly fries.  The fries were great (even better when dipped in ranch!) but the wings left something to be desired.  I know they are tossed in a butter sauce, but these things weren&#39;t merely tossed; they were bathed in the stuff.  So much that I had to wipe down each wing before eating.
     I don&#39;t know, but it kind of killed as opposed to satiated my craving for Hooters."

I sat down and waited, after two more customers orders were ready, the customers came in, paid for and left with their orders.

The waitstaff are all really nice and don&#39;t bat an eye at a table of girls out for an evening instead of a bunch of guys watching the game and oogle-ing (is that a word?) at all the waitresses.  Sitting directly at the bar gives you a whole different experience; you can watch the poor guys in the kitchen run around like crazy folks getting those orders together.  It&#39;s amazing to watch them co-ordinate the tickets to get the food out at once.  

Only 4 stars because having to walk through groups of smokers all standing right outside the door (even though there&#39;s laws against that) is horrible.  COUGH COUGH!!  Gross.  Hold your breath, run in, and grab a pitcher of sangria."

The mediums wings had no sauce or flavor on them and the hot wasn&#39;t hot at all. And then there was a piece of shrimp tail fried up in chicken. The cold mexicurly fries were made worse by the fact that they are made with cheese that tastes like bland melted velveeta. The food was terrible in general. Literally, my stomach hurts. Then after our food was given to us, the waitress did not check on us once. Didn&#39;t ask the food was, nothing. We watched her run around servicing other tables, but not ours. We had to flag her down just to get the check. We usually tip very well. I mean VERY well, but not this time. Disappointed in the service I left a two dollar tip.

Not a good first impression here, sorry. The chips were thick, heavy and a little greasy. The guacamole was good, but was such a vivid green that it looked fake. 

My dinner was some steak special - Also disappointing. It was thick, dry and chewy. Tough to cut it because of the light weight fork that kept bending while I sawed away with my flimsy knife. 

I&#39;d like to come back here. Maybe I will, if someone can tell me that they have improved."

Order jager bombs &#34;We&#39;re out&#34;. Order one of their signature drinks &#34; those take too long to make because we are out of our premix&#34;. The place was barely 1/4 occupied.
Mentioned this to the manager, He makes excuses and accuses us of lying even after his waitress confirmed the story. Told my husband to please lower his voice. My husband says&#34;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m hard of hearing&#34; Manager/owner says &#34;Well I&#39;m not&#34;.

After my most recent visit on 8/27/2016 that opinion has changed. My wife and I usually stop in and split their quesadilla dinner. It used to be a very substantial meal, more than enough for the two of us. Not so anymore. The portion is half as big, yet somehow at the same price. When it arrived, we inquired about the change we were very casually told that the owner had made some changes. According to the waiter, this is often done rather arbitrarily. Either way, we ending up paying $30 for a meal that would barely feed a single person. This place has gone from nice to far over priced. There are other places that offer a far better value that I will be taking my business to in the future."

Our party of ten made a reservation for 7:00 on a Saturday night.  The owner said that our large group would overwhelm the kitchen at that hour if we ordered all at once.  So we changed our time to the less-busy 6:30, and we ordered a little here and a little there.  We didn&#39;t need to eat all at the same time, so that wasn&#39;t an issue. 
     
Chips and salsa took over an hour to arrive.  And the rest of the food came out at odd intervals, with no apparent rhyme or reason; dishes did not arrive in the order in which they had been ordered. 
    
We had to wait unbelievably long times for the rest of our food: two members of our party waited TWO TO THREE HOURS -- yes, you read that correctly -- for their meals (one a quesadilla, the other a flatbread of some sort).  The quesadilla was ordered at 7:15 and still hadn&#39;t come as of 10:20.  And this after repeatedly asking the server!  Unreal and totally unacceptable.
   
The rest of us waited anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes for our meals, still far too long.

If you have all night to hang out, with no place to go, then stop in here.  But if you have fewer than four or five hours to spend here, or if you are hungry, do yourself a huge favor and go elsewhere."

If you&#39;ve been there more than five times you will run out of things to try.

The venue was fairly empty. There was a family that was leaving as we arrived and a few individuals sitting at the bar. 

Needless to say, I don&#39;t think they place can be classified as an authentic Mexican restaurant. There are plenty of Puerto Rican infused items in the menu. The appetizer for example was a goat cheese and meat stuffed plantain with a savory salad and rue on top. I wish I could re-call the name. 

Date and I ordered the exact same meal, but were told there was only one. So I compromised since there was the skirt-steak chefs special on the menu. As a rule of thumb, I never order skirt steak. Is a poor cut and chewey. However, not far from edible. I can&#39;t say that I enjoyed my dish, much more of a personal preference than anything. The skirt steak wasn&#39;t worth all the chew. 

The original meal I wanted to order was absolutely delicious. It was like an oso bucco stew and you&#39;re given a heaping amount of rice. After trying my dates, I definitely lost the appetite for my main dish. 

I took off one star for them running out of a main dish on their menu. And I took off a second star (this may seem trivial, but it&#39;s all about balance) for only having super ginormous booths. I was swimming in the booth."

Tacos were also good, and the guac was perfect. You can tell it&#39;s made fresh with the chunks of avocado on there. 

My passion fruit mojito was my favorite drink that I ordered, it was delicious.

We also played the one game on one of the big TV screens called &#34;Fibbage&#34; which was a lot of fun, especially when others in the bar joined in.

I can&#39;t even explain how delicious the chicken was, let alone the rice that came with it as a side.  My husband ordered the Pollo con Mole Poblano- another chicken entree.  It was amazing; we are still trying to figure out how they got their chicken to be so tender.  The food there is quite tasty and I gladly give this restaurant 5 stars and I will become a regular patron.  Oh- one last remark...the staff is very willing to help its patrons.

I had three very small drinks.  21.00 plus $9.00 upgrade.   Wow!
The bartender should have gotten a manager when I questioned the bill, instead he just said &#34;yep that&#39;s what we charge&#34; 

Food was good.   We will never go back to this place.  Our bill was 76.00.  We had a Mexican pizza, another dish that cost 11.00. The rest were our drinks. My husband was only drinking beer.  Don&#39;t go unless you have extra money to throw away.

They have totally redecorated since the establishment was known as Cool River. Ruben has added booths, tables and a lively menu to make the Rubi Agave more of a restaurant than a bar. However the bar scene is still alive and well on weekends and late into the night. 
      The food was good but came to table lukewarm. Service below average and that is kind. It was jammed the night we were there but still a little attention to the customer is warranted. 
      Margaritas are yummy and the piña colada is to die for. But you would have to have a few cocktails to get u through the looooong wait for food. Music is nice and I hear there are live bands on weekends and other occasions. Ole!!!
    I think we would try here again but on a week day when not so busy. Need more help obviously."

The service was slow to say the least. Appetizers took forever. Drinks you might have well brought your own. In defense of the server the restaurant was way under staffed our server was actually making his own drinks. Two of the 7 meals came out 20 minutes after the others and they offered us 20% off just the 2 meals. Now to the check. Charged for 12 margaritas  when we only ordered 7. Had a coupon that the server did not want to honor. Waited 15 minutes for the owner/manager to come to our table. When he finally arrived he agreed to take the  coupon. Upon leaving I stayed behind to speak with the owner he was very rude and dismissive.  So moral of this rant is I will never go to Rubi Agave again and I recommend that you do the same!

Chef Reuben, you MUST be hemorrhaging money. Your food is good &amp; original. You need management at the front of your house.  Train your staff.  Fire your ponytailed bartender. Your own family is going to kill your business. 

Since my original review my wife &amp; I have been back at least 1/2 dozen times. This was the 2nd time we actually walked out and we won&#39;t ever come back.  The service was so bad this time it outweighed the unique cuisine. 

Rule number one in the restaurant business is don&#39;t bring out a humongous bussing cart when there&#39;s people walking through the restaurant. The busboy ran right into my wife&#39;s chair and nearly knocked her over, he looked at her, and just moved on. No excuse me, no apology.

The waitress came to our table bringing only two waters for three people. She said she would be right back with another water and we never saw the water come until 30 min later.  We immediately ordered two empanadas appetizers and two whiskey Manhattans straight up.  The waitress asks us what type of glass we wanted. I told her it normally served in a martini glass.  She returned to the table with short rocks glasses, warm, and they were half full.  I had to explain to her what a martini glass was and she said that the bartender told her this is the way HE does it.  Now I&#39;ve been drinking Manhattan&#39;s for over 20 years. I&#39;ve never had it served in a short rocks glass. It wasn&#39;t iced or shaken.  I asked the waitress to bring me a martini glass and poured my drink into it.  I showed her that it was only about one third filled and on top of that after taking a small sip, it definitely was not a Manhattan made with proper ingredients or proportions &amp; since there was no ice, I thought it strange my regular drink lacked flavor. I would hope it wasn&#39;t watered down but I&#39;m suspicious. Basically it was only 1 ounce of warm booze (I know how much a short rocks glass holds).  She apologized and said she would speak with the bartender.

She came back only after I had to take my empanadas appetizer from the table next to us (it had been carelessly dropped on the wrong table by the food runner without comment) and the people at the table were kind enough to ask if that was our order.  When she returned she told me again the bartender told her that this is the way HE makes a Manhattan.  I told her this is completely wrong and definitely the wrong proportion after I showed her how much was in the martini glass. 

At that point the hostess  saw we were getting aggravated and came over to talk to us.  I asked her to have Ruben come out and speak with us regarding the service. After a quick run to the kitchen she said he was cooking and didn&#39;t have time to come out and talk.  I told her that will be here a while and if we if he has two minutes to come out to talk please do so. He was probably the only person back there so we never did see him.

A few minutes later the bartender, a young kid with a long ponytail (I believe he&#39;s Ruben&#39;s cousin), came over to see what the problem was.  I explained to him that after working 10 years in the restaurant business including professionally bartending, I&#39;ve never seen a Manhattan made this way.  I even told him what the correct proportions were. His response was &#34;I used to bartend in New York and I know how to make a Manhattan&#34;. I explained to him you can go online and see what the proper proportions are and take a look at any picture of a Manhattan in a martini glass and it does not look one third filled!  Again his response was &#34;well that&#39;s how I make them.&#34;  I said to him that if that is the way he bartended in New York, no wonder he&#39;s not working there anymore.  I kindly asked him to take the drinks away since he decided that he knows best.

Now I have had that kid wait on us before as a server, and he was horrible and unattentive. Why they would have him behind the bar when he clearly does not know how to bartend is beyond me.

At this point for over a half hour had passed and the waitress had still not taken our food order. She apologized for the behavior of the bartender, sort of shrugged it off and took our order.  After another 10 minutes &amp; mulling over the whole situation we decided to just pay for the empanadas &amp; leave. 
I left my name and phone number for Chef Ruben to call me as I really want to see him succeed. The place is nice, well decorated, and has awesome food.  The issue is he has his family working behind the bar &amp; serving. These were certainly not professionally trained waiters waitresses &amp; bartenders. In fact, they&#39;re going to kill his business.  The food is consistently good &amp; the service is consistently the worst I&#39;ve ever experienced. 

Chef Ruben, you really need to do something about the front of the house. You lost at least a $100 tab from us. Family or not, you need to fire the staff, hire a professional bartender as well as someone who has the ability to train your servers. A manager up there is a MUST!"

The place was decorated nice and had a great Latin vibe. 
The drinks were fantastic and I really enjoyed the bartender helpful friendly.
The food was excellent we had the guacamole it&#39;s was delicious and the salsa was very good as well.
My wife have the tacos and I had the big sampler and it didn&#39;t disappoint.
They also had a nice outdoor patio area.
I would give it give stars but we were there on a night that didn&#39;t have live entertainment. I could see a bigger crowd and a live band pushing my experience to a 5 star

This could be due to the low alcohol content of the cocktails, the 45 minutes it took for them to arrive at the table or both. Add another hour to get how long we waited for our appetizers - which we ordered at the same time as our drinks - to be ready. Is the kitchen cooking with Bic lighters or something? Why should it take that long to melt cheese? The service was so lousy, it seemed intentional. A few members of our party actually got up and left rather than deal with the BS. Judging from some of the other Yelp reviews I&#39;ve read, our experience was not unique. Unless something changes, I can&#39;t see Rubi Agave remaining open much longer."

So I left a review on Facebook already but Yelp is where it counts. First, I&#39;m shocked that anyone thinks these drinks are strong ... Whatever you people are smoking please pass it here because I&#39;m not a drinker (usually buzzed off a shot) and I finished a del mar that was so watered down it seemed pointless to even order. My husband had the margarita which he ended up returning because it was watered down and just plain nasty. 

We initially when in for the Brazilian dancers which were awesome but was ruined because we were sat all the way in the back when clearly there were tables open. 

 First, we waited and waited and waited some more 20 minutes in and we still didn&#39;t have drinks - not even offered water. We even put our order in at the start and waited another 20 mins after getting drinks. The best part is that we waited another 30 mins for our check after waiting and waiting - maybe this joint should be called Waiting Rubi! Our server was sweet but does not know the menu and was not on her game. 

The food was actually pretty good but not anything to rave about- there was not a lot of choices and for what you would pay there you would pay in the city for way better concoctions. 

My husband and I decided to confront the owner, which was really weird. There wasn&#39;t a sincere apology it was more of an excuse. Excuses that went on forever. First, it was an off night, the server was new, people called off, our food is made to order, it was packed.... Here&#39;s some advice - I don&#39;t care what the excuse is - you had entertainment come in - you should be on your a game knowing more people may be there for it... Packed? Again, what are you smoking? Packed would mean there are people lined up waiting - there were tons of tables and spaces at the bar open.... New server? More like bad training ... 
Here&#39;s the icing on the cake: we were pretty much forced to having a dessert shot on the house as a sorry excuse for a comp of any sort. I asked what was in it because it was interesting ... I got two ingredients ( milk and roasted coconut) listed and then &#34;some other special things&#34;, really? You don&#39;t know what your shots are made of? Not surprised since everyone we asked questions to about drinks or food items had to take a moment ask over their head piece.... Not wise to not know what&#39;s in your food or drinks if you have someone ask because they have an allergy or restriction - lawsuit anyone? 

$65 later and 2.5 hours we finally were able to pick up and leave ... Unfortunately I was looking forward to coming here but it&#39;s nothing special ... It&#39;s a wannabe latin dance club with amped up Mexican food... Great entertainment but that will only hold you up for so long - best of luck to Rubi but I won&#39;t be back! 

If you&#39;re looking for real latin vibes head to Nacional, Carnival or Rios in the city - $65 will get you food, drunk and dancing all night :)"

Extremely disappointed in the service and quality of food. I have worked in this industry and consider myself a good judge. This place needs to reevaluate their menu as the food is bland and tapas size portions in the selections we ordered. The service is the slowest and most uneducated I have ever encountered. I would strongly encourage the manager to retrain all staff in liquor selections and customer service. If you promote yourself as a tequila and whiskey bar your staff should be able to take a simple cocktail order. You make your money on your bar service and this is the slowest service I&#39;ve ever had. And delivered incorrectly. If you hope to stay in business please spend some time retraining the right people to promote your business.

The mango one had nice hunks of mango too!

Very interesting menu, things I had never seen before. Ordered guacamole and chips, great fresh guacamole!! I had the quesadilla which was the size of a pizza! Very interesting and good!  Definitely coming back.

I arrived to a full parking lot but that&#39;s what&#39;s to be expected on a Friday themed night.  I found parking and headed in.  No one greeted me at the door.  I found my friends at the bar where upon my arrival they mentioned, good luck getting a drink - great.  Everyone on staff appeared to have at least two jobs.  The bartender was running food from the kitchen, taking orders and tending bar.  There was a guy in back who I can only assume is cooking is running dinner orders out.  The rest of the staff looked confused an disoriented and could not keep up with demand.  45 minutes after my arrival, I order my first drink.  20 minutes later while seated at the bar, it arrives.  The couple sitting next to me at the bar waited so long to pay their bill they eventually gave up and walked out without paying.  The bartender never noticed and the tab from the persons previously sitting in their seats was still sitting on the bar top.  My drink arrives, and the bar tender never asks for payment or for a card to run my tab.  Later in the night when it takes us 20 minutes to flag her down to pay she now tries to figure out who ordered what and who is paying and how.  She messes this up three times, coming back on several occasions for repeat instructions.  She approaches my friend to pay who has a tab open and my friend has to tell her she already has her card.  There was no system in place for getting seated at the tables since my friends had put our name in at 6:30 and by the time we left several hours later - were never seated or approached for a table.  I can&#39;t say enough bad things about the service and hopefully I never return.  It&#39;s a shame because it has the possibility of being a good place to go.

The drinks were very delicious and would be the only factor in my return.  Most likely I would never go back, however if I did it would be on a Wednesday night at 4 p.m."

I grew up on the south-side of chicago where there was a delicious Mexican restaurant every ten feet so I&#39;ve eaten my share. The ambience is great. I love the warm paint on the walls and the stone bar not to forget the gorgeous patio. The new owners have worked wonders in this place. We started with the chips and salsa, this is not your average Pepes salsa this salsa has levels of flavor sweet, spicy, sweet and spicy again just enough to leave your mouth wanting more. From there we went to the tamale and taco duos. The tamales were mind blowing. The masa was not dry at all and awesomely sweet  the pork was seasoned perfectly and the whole thing garnished beautifully with a drizzle of crema. The tacos were solid seasoned and cooked perfectly next time I would try the steak. Even the little side salad was delicious dressed in something delicious I couldn&#39;t define.

I really really wanted to like this place, I did. There are no other Mexican restaurants in the area besides Pepe&#39;s. 
My husband, daughter and I went, we had a taste for Mexican food so I thought go give Rubi Agave a try! The chips and salsa are VERY small in portion but NOT price. We were left chewing our finger nails because our tummies were hurting from hunger pains waiting for our food. Our dinner had finally arrived! 1 quasadilla 2 burritos and THATS it!!! No beans, no rice, no jalapeños and carrots no refill on our chips!! Nothing else but the quasadilla and 2 burritos and 12 pieces of lettuce that was referred to as the spring salad that came complimentary with the overpriced burrito that lacked not only character but taste. I&#39;m not used to this way of a traditional Mexican dinner/restaurant I mean come on who doesn&#39;t have carrots,jalapeños or fricken rice! Our bill came I almost fell over and shit out what little bit of the food that I did eat out on the booth. Bill $64!! 
$64 for what??? Oh my jeez

Just say your a Mexican restaurant. The food was nothing less than stellar. The Mexican pizza was on a deep fried tortilla that was burnt and had so much fryer oil in it that it was oozing grease. Yuk! I tried the $20 special fajita that was a normal fajita with a few strips of overlooked chicken and some beef. The only novelty of it was that it was served on a skillet box where you are supposed to cook your own meat more to your liking, but the meat was already cooked to way overdone. Talked to someone to tell them how awful. the pizza was but they seemed not to care and just dismiss it as nothing was wrong. However the server was fantastic constantly checking to see if we were ok and did bring it to someone&#39;s attention and the pizza was taken off the bill. Thank you!!"

They were friendly and polite.  The regular margaritas were ok--not great and not bad.  You have to pay for chips and salsa--not complimentary with your meal.  The Mexican pizza was very tasty and a good bargain for the price.  Someone in my party ordered a burrito but there was virtually no meat in it unfortunately.  I had a feeling that they are catering more to the nightclub crowd.  They had a party going on that side of the restuarant."

I didn&#39;t realize before coming that it&#39;s connected to an upscale grocery store. But not to worry, this is a casual and welcoming place to stop for lunch with pretty reasonable prices. 

You walk up to order at the counter and take a number to your seat. What was different at this place though was a server continues checking in after bringing your food. They were friendly and attentive. 

I can be nervous eating out since I&#39;m sensitive to several different foods,  follow the Paleo AIP diet, and am also gluten free. I didn&#39;t call ahead or ask very specific questions, they didn&#39;t bat an eye when I ordered a gluten free and dairy free salad with no pepper or seasonings. I didn&#39;t ask specifically about oils or seasonings on the meat, but felt I was pretty safe ordering the kale salad with salmon. Just asked them to leave off the nuts, cheese, and seeds. Then did oil and vinegar dressing at the table. The salmon didn&#39;t seem seasoned with pepper or any other obvious pre-marinade. 

It was also nice to stop by the grocery and pick up a few items on my way home. Good value, friendly place, nice eating area. Surprised and happy with my stop here on vacation."

With a huge menu filled with many healthy and fresh options, Standard Market Grill always sounds like an appealing choice. 

I&#39;ve had burgers, sandwiches, salads, and my easy go-to Buddha Bowl with the addition of salmon. Everything has been worthy of a repeat order. Their sweet potato fries are simply the best. While most restaurants who serve sweet potato fries seem to only serve limp ones, theirs are addiction worthy. I never order my own since willpower is not my forte. --It&#39;s best to snag a few from a friend&#39;s plate since manners will keep my sweet potato fry eating in check. 

While the environment looks a little sterile with its stark modern lines, the sunlight that pours through the massive windows softens everything it touches. The lit candles in the evening help accomplish this as well. If weather permits, grab a table outdoors. The umbrella covered tables look out over the ponds.

It&#39;s has an upscale modern grill connected to a grocery store (similar to Trader Joe&#39;s only pricier).  I leave from there disappointed today from my choice to go there for breakfast, a choice I will likely not make in the future.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy with the sunny side up eggs, my husband- the omelet with fruit (substituted for the hashbrowns).  Aside from the waiter - service was a major issue.  Starting out the cashier seemed confused and couldn&#39;t answer a single question without consulting someone else - our questions were simple no brainer&#39;s (gravy on the side, replace hashbrowns for fruit, etc.) which clearly she wasn&#39;t trained to know the answer for in advance.  There was just a handful of people, yet it took several minutes for it to arrive at the table.  When it was delivered our food was cold &amp; my sunny side eggs were broken and running all over the plate. (my husband didn&#39;t send his back) I told the runner (that delivered the food) that the food was cold &amp; requested that it be remade as I&#39;m not one to accept this.  He took the plate and returned within a few minutes with the same plate (leaving the gravy), which as still cold and appeared to be slightly microwaved. He had to take the gravy back to be microwave it at a separate trip.  When the waiter came back we told him that this isn&#39;t acceptable - at that point I was so frustrated I simply wanted to leave.  After that the manager came to the table (after telling the waiter we didn&#39;t want to talk to her) and tried to pick up our check as compensation.  I quickly told her that wasn&#39;t the point and declined the offer.  I reminded her that in Naperville&#39;s competitive restaurant market service issues of this litany has brought many restaurants before it out of business - service is paramount and expected.  She proceed to make excuses that they have no plate warmers in their kitchen, that they just started service breakfast 6 or so weeks ago.  Again, not a valid excuse when I&#39;ve been in Standard Market multiple times with every table filled and not had those issues.  I&#39;ve given it three stars because the food is high quality and for the most part good.  However, the service issues for me will be a deal-breaker with future visits.  I&#39;m disappointed, because the food is for the most part on point, but service for me will trump that every time.  My suggestion is to hire a manager with experience - it seems that the staff&#39;s training is lacking.  Service is king in Naperville - especially when you can go a different restaurant every day for an entire year &amp; never hit the same one twice!  The restaurants that make it long-term in Naperville have mastered service first and foremost - coupled with good food and portion size.  I give it three stars because it&#39;s not been this way every time."

My wife and I visited last night, and this place is a circus. Upon ordering we noticed a customer actually in the kitchen! The guy was complaining about his food, and the staff let him back there, where he had his hands and arms on the serving station. It was crazy, and the staff were completely absorbed by the event, and paying no attention to the customers. 

The food- Uggh! the worst. I ordered a chimmichuri steak with potatoes. What I got was an overcooked piece of meat (worst cut possible), and a pound of green potatoes. Flavorless and terrible. My wife had a fairly uninspiring turkey burger.

We have noticed over the past several months that service level and quality is declining steadily there. At the end of the day, this place is a grocery store, and they need a lot of improvement in basic food preparation and restaurant operations."

I generally order a Buddha bowl, and never know which mix of vegetables I will get.  Sometimes there are mushrooms, sometimes not.  Sometimes leafy greens, sometimes endemine.  For being &#34;standard&#34; the recipe seems to vary a lot.  The line when you order carry out can be frustrating too.  You watch your food sit and get cold while the slow, young staff attempts to take orders of those in front.  A carry out register would help.

The ordering process and delivery was very efficient and the physical room was much nicer than I had expected. It&#39;s a order your own food cafe attached to a grocery store but the vibe is much more elegant.

I tried the stir fry and a sandwich because I had read about them on other reviews. They were fine, pleasant and adequate.

I liked the little mini sweet when you were done, that was the best part of the meal.

The problem with The Standard Market Grill is their service. My family and I have been coming here for lunch since they opened, and each time we have come the service is always extremely slow. You wouldn&#39;t think that based on the amount of staff they have working all day, but it&#39;s true. When meals should take approximately 10 or so minutes to arrive at your table, they take closer to 20 or minutes. For a casual dining place, that is way too long. And if you&#39;re expecting refills on your drink, forget about it. You&#39;ll get your drink 10 min after you sit down and a server won&#39;t be back well after you&#39;re done eating. With how much they charge for a meal, it&#39;s unacceptable. I hope they fix that problem."

So I&#39;ve gotten food from standard market grill on three different occasions now. Food has always been great. I have ordered the kids sliders and fries because it is a big enough portion for an adult, and I love them. I order them with sweet potato fries that come with delicious honey mustard sauce. On point with those. I&#39;ve also tried their Buddha bowl with steak and it is also absolutely delicious. 

My beef here is the drinks and how much they charge for how LITTLE you get also with the service* I&#39;ve had the past two times. 

My second visit I ordered a milkshake for $5 and it came in a smaller glass, which wasn&#39;t that big of a deal because I added a bunch of stuff to it and honestly smaller portions are better for you (contradicting their meal portions). Today I ordered a LARGE size of their strawberry banana juice and I got my cup, same size as the milkshake but it was HALF full. The girl bringing me the drink asked the one who poured it if it was correct, the girl who poured it rudely said &#34;that&#39;s how much they get&#34;. I would have stayed and asked to speak with a manager but I was already running late for work.

My advice: Skip the drinks and just order water with your food. Maybe get it to go as well, I&#39;ve had rude and snooty service two out of the three times I&#39;ve been there. But alas, I will be back to try more things on the menu."

Standard Market Grill had the best ratings and all the positive reviews and pictures looked promising. Located next to the Standard Market, the grill is its restaurant offering fresh fare. I was expecting a full service restaurant and was surprised to see an ordering counter as soon as you walk in. There&#39;s a digital menu beyond the counter and to be honest, I was looking for more variety in brunch options. If I didn&#39;t want a sandwich or salad, it seemed my options were limited to one of two omelets, a breakfast burrito, or a Belgian waffle. I quickly decided on a hanger steak and mushroom omelet, which is exactly what it sounds like and is served with standard breakfast potatoes (diced potatoes mixed with onions and peppers) or fresh fruit. Choice of white bread, whole grain bread, or English muffin. Strawberry jam and butter on the side. We were given a buzzer, told to grab our waters from their water station, and find our seats. 

Now is time to note that I like the layout of the restaurant. There&#39;s an indoor dining area; a semi-outdoor dining area with views of the pond, high windows and a cozy fireplace, and an outdoor dining area with wooden chairs and large umbrellas. There&#39;s a sign in the center table directing you to place your buzzer there and we did as instructed. Shortly thereafter, a server appeared, grabbed our buzzer from us, and assured us our food would be out soon. We waited only a short time and our food arrived. 

My omelet was fluffy and well-seasoned, with bits of hanger steak and mushroom through the egg instead of inside the omelet itself. I&#39;m not a huge meat person, but I think they could have definitely been more generous with the steak, especially at $9 for the omelet. Perhaps there was even an adequate amount of meat in my omelet and I just couldn&#39;t tell because it was chopped up and mixed with the egg and mushroom. The potatoes were heavily seasoned, and the onions and peppers gave it more flavor. The English muffin was also delicious, and I appreciated the fresh butter and strawberry jam.

After delivering our food, our server did not come back to check on us and didn&#39;t seem to be anywhere near the patio area, which makes me very confused on what level of service Standard Market Grill is trying to achieve. I do not mind ordering at the counter or picking up my own drink, but then I would expect a classy place like this would offer more service than a greeting and food delivery. Overall the food is good; I&#39;m not impressed with the brunch selections but I look forward to coming back and giving lunch or dinner a shot."

This particular restuarant takes advatange of the fast casual trend and provides a great place to get a meal on the side of a Trader Joe&#39;sish type of a grocery store.  The place is beatiful and open with tons of places to sit.  The one thing I will have to comment on is that they are a little slow to clear down tables, as one was left dirty for quite sometime into the meal.  While I&#39;m on the downsides, their draft beer list is on a rotating screen and the person at the counter taking the order had no clue what beers were being offered.


Outside of that the food and beer selection was pretty fantastic. I ended up getting the BLAT.  It had tons of crisp bacon, nice toasted brioche bread and creamy avocado.  All things considered it is a nice location and one I would likely return to."

Sure, the grocery store is nice as well, but the restaurant really takes the cake. The grocery store prices have niche items, so if I needed a specific ingredient and couldn&#39;t find it at a specialty store closer to me, I could probably look here. But, kind of out of my budget right now. The restaurant fits nicely within our budget, though. They have cucumber water and watermelon water, so that&#39;s free also. 

My husband ordered a chicken sandwich with chicken, cheese, and bacon. He orders a sandwich no other way. He liked it. He also had a bowl of chicken tortilla soup. He said it was good, but it was literally just chicken and tortilla chips. Usually there is some corn, tomatoes, beans, etc. in the soup, but not in this one. It was more of a chicken chili. Also, it came with tortilla chips on top..and a dinner roll...and packaged oyster crackers..so carb heaven.

I ordered the veggie burger and I can confirm that it is not just a Morningstar or Boca burger patty. I asked and they do make them daily. Granted, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a given, but it seems like most restaurants just use frozen patties. Anyway, it was delicious and I would order it again. Maybe without the BBQ sauce (I&#39;m just not a super BBQ fan). I did like the buttermilk garlic, though. 

And the fries...oh. the fries. Delicious. Freshly made and really, really good. If you&#39;re trying to be healthy and order a salad, good for you. The fries are worth it.

Only downside is the seating. There needs to be a wall separating the ordering line from the booths. Otherwise, we had people watching us the entire time we ate. And maybe a better system for seating people. There were people walking in and saving tables so that by the time we ordered, there was only one table open. 

This is definitely a place to which we will return."

The grocery store alone is tremendous, but my lunch at the Grill took me over the top. We had the grass fed burger with white cheddar cheese, tomato bacon jam, kale slaw, and red onion on a pretzel roll. I ordered it medium and it came out light pink in the middle and juicy. The jam was quite strong, but I liked how the raw onion cut the flavor. And you can&#39;t go wrong with a pretzel roll. 

I also had the mustard honey chicken sandwich. Pretzel batard, grilled chicken, Monterey Jack cheese, roasted red pepper, bacon, avocado, Bibb lettuce, red onion, mustard-honey. Everything just came together perfectly. I&#39;d order it again for sure.

And the sides are great. The market side salad as these soft cornbread croutons. There is no crouton anywhere near as good as these. And it&#39;s true, get the sweet potato fries. Incredibly thick, nicely seasoned, and a good honey-mustard dipping sauce. I want some chicken fingers for that mustard!!!

The Arnold Pomer was a really good drink; it&#39;s basically an Arnold Palmer with pomegranate juice. Very refreshing and refills are free. And there are no salt and pepper shakers. They give you a grinder that has coarse salt on one end and peppercorns on the other. You grind either side, so both the salt and pepper are as fresh as can be. Awesome. And the service was really good, everybody was very friendly. 

For a casual place, the ingredients are top notch and the menu is unique and creative while being approachable. Definitely will return."

She went up and asked what was going on with my salad... they clearly forgot about it. They finally made it and the cashier was very apologetic and she seemed to be the only one who wanted to help me out. But no drink while I wait or cookie to leave with. Anyways I leave, start eating my salad and it&#39;s missing ingredients, this is the second time they have forgot to put avocado in my salad!

Standard Market paid for the repairs to my pants, and even showed up at the tailor personally when they wouldn&#39;t take a credit card over the phone.

The Super 7 with grilled salmon was excellent, and I was impressed with the craft beer selection on tap.  I&#39;ll definitely be back to walk through the market area, which definitely looks to give Whole Foods or Mariano&#39;s some stiff competition.

Came here for lunch. It is the type of place where you order at the register but then have a server from there on out. Brock and I split the mushroom/goat cheese pizza (AHH goat cheese!!) and the blue cheese steak sandwich. We were lucky enough to find a seat on the patio where we waited with our pager-thingy. The neat thing is that the pager has a gps of some sort so your server can tell where you sit and bring your food to you. We even moved seats once and he figured it out!
Our food was brought quickly and was delish! The pizza was larger than I expected, definitley sharing size, and the sandwich was average size. The pizza was a kind-of cross between a flatbread and a regular pizza, kind of rustic, with perfect crust. The steak sandwich was cooked well, rare, and was of average tenderness. It still got stuck in between your teeth as rare steak typically does. The star of the sandwich though was the blue cheese aioli. It was not too pungent but you certainly knew it was there. I am not a HUGE blue cheese fan but this was balanced perfectly. The sandwich was paired with fries which were average if you ask me, I don&#39;t know what other Yelpers are raving about there.
The service was excellent as was the value. Our freshly squeezed lemonade even came with refills which NEVER EVER happens. Our server was attentive but not overbearing and came with warm chocolate chip cookie chunks to accompany our check. 
The patio is small so the seating is a little tight but I love eating outdoors. I&#39;ll be returning if i&#39;m in the neighborhood."

The market has a variety of culinary pleasures including HOOK&#39;S aged cheddar.  Lots of items you wont even find at WF though I found the prices to be comparable.  

It lost one star due to how small it is, imagine how much more stuff you could fill in here if the place was bigger.  Moving along, you can find helpful staff and pre-bagged dinners, with fresh ingredients to make dinner/lunch yourself OR you can pick up pre-made.  I believe there are different meals depending on the day of the week.  The day we went they had a pre-bagged steak dinner and pre-packaged knuckle rolls (lobster salad sammies) YUM. 

As we moseyed around we saw people drinking wine next to the cheese counter area, will have to come back to check that out.

Last, the GRILL.  We opted to sit outside because the weather was perfect and started with the chicken tortilla soup which was excellent.  We shared, the Pulled Pork Pizza, the Molten Grilled Cheese, a side of hand cut fries and Kale Slaw.  All were fantastic.  

Everything from start to finish was tasty, we will definitely be back again, and again, and again.  :)"

I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich, it was really good. My fiancé ordered the Cuban chicken sandwich, which he enjoyed as well. My moscow mule was off though, very lemony. It just didn&#39;t seem right. 

Our service was a little less then average. We sat at the bar so we were up close to all of the action. It was very busy, but just sitting next to two working the bar we didn&#39;t get asked about drinks for about 10 minutes. Being at the bar, and I n front of all of the workers in the 45 minutes we were there we witnessed 3 meals being refunded.

My over all impression was that yes it was busy, however I feel like I saw lots of confusion with workers. I think if it was more like an average restaurant where you sit down and order (which I was very surprised when I realized you ordered at the counter) then the workers would be less confused and wouldn&#39;t wander around the entire place with found searching for the right table."

If you like the sweeter tasting salads that have goat cheese, avocado, fruit and nuts, this is your salad.  They mix the dressing into the salad perfectly!  I was thinking about it all day today and wondering when I will get my next Four Farmers salad. Good portion size, too!  Well worth the $12.  I felt it was more of a value than the sandwich I got there the first time.

I enjoy this restaurant.  It&#39;s clean, contemporary.  I like the bar area that overlooks the open kitchen area.

The price is right, too, since it&#39;s about $12 (with tax) for the chicken Buddha bowl, and you get a large portion that&#39;s presumably made with higher quality ingredients than most places use.

I *really* don&#39;t like that they don&#39;t provide nutritional information.

I have been there a few times know and have never had a bad experience. My favorite is the farmers pizza they also have good sushi. Another great thing about this place they have a very large selection of craft beers. If your lucky on Tuesdays they get there shipment of three floyds!! Does not last long... So get there early I have been there a few times for lunch on Tuesdays by noon not much is left.

It is fantastic. Best sweet potato fries anywhere. Generous portions. Delicous food. We also love the flavored water we can get at our leisure.

The other amazing gem here is their coffee shop. We are coffee snobs and this is the best in Naperville. Try the pumpkin latte and you will not regret it."

The food is excellent. We order or eat in at least once a week. The BBQ chicken sandwich on the pretzel roll is fantastic. Chicken tortilla soup is great and make sure you try the sweet potato fries.

I wish I was exaggerating when I say always but it truly is every time. If you order food be sure to double check. I believe it is a systems issue bc this happens to us at both the westmont and Naperville location. The sweet potato fries used to be one of our favorite staples but they must have changed how they make them bc now they are soggy and not as good quality. 

I went there Sunday bc I enjoy this chia teas. My husband brought me my drink. It tastes like dirty dish water and was disgusting. I brought it back and complained about how wrong it tasted. The girl behind the counter said she could make me a new one but it would take a few minutes to make the chia. We were in a hurry so I had to get the receipt to make the return. I&#39;m concerned that it wasn&#39;t made right in the first place bc the chia wasn&#39;t brewed and she just threw something together hoping it wouldn&#39;t be noticed. I&#39;m very disappointed."

It&#39;s has
Grocery Market
Catering
The Grill (restaurant)
Cheese &amp; Wine (with a bar)
Deli 

This is a Chef driven business so everything seems to be pretty top choice^_^ almost everything is top quality with almost no artificial preservatives/additives. Prices are similar to a Whole Foods, so it may seem a bit pricey but this day and age we end up having to pay a little more for REAL food as opposed to over processed, mass consumer items. I&#39;m the kind of person who tries to save money where I can, but when it comes to what I put into my body I will pay a little more to put good stuff into it. 
Not to mention it tastes better ;))
*gluten free options available in grocery store &amp; at restaurant
 
Ps the sweet potato fries are amazing &amp; my BF worships the bacon hahaha :)~ 

Sandwhiches we tried we delicious! We had the *24 steak &amp; BLAT (with Swiss cheese &amp; egg added). The steak was perfectly done so you didn&#39;t have to rip at it through your sandwich. The Swiss cheese on my BLAT went perfectly with the fried egg (I added both of those).

Enjoy!

Now when I walked into this fine establishment on this fine day and observed the fine menu board rich with options, I was blinded by my previous experience. I ordered the Brunch Burger, a delicacy by my standards, and my amigo ordered the Brisket Grilled Cheese. I had been resting in the booth with my good friend when after an extended period of time my friend had his meal and I was still waiting for my glorious sandwich. I had to go say something to the server and finally I had the beloved burger in front me. Considering the quality of food served here, I had high hopes that have never been disappointed before. You would think frying an egg is a simple task, but it seems the chefs that day had it out for my immune system (as in salmonella, which is rampant uncooked eggs). As for my friends brisket grilled cheese, it was less than satisfactory. He considers himself a connoisseur of brisket having eaten and enjoyed it for many years (he&#39;s pretty old but that&#39;s just between you and me). As I enjoyed my bacon and burger (minus the egg) I periodically looked over at him taking large slices of fat off of his grilled cheese. While I am no professor of brisket according to him this is one of the worst sins possible in meats. Over half of the brisket were large pieces of fat. With the combination of the poor service, and the lackluster elements of the food, Standard Market Grill was not up to standard"

I ordered the Mediterranean Salad and it was one of the top three salads I have ever had - absolutely delicious!  It comes with grilled salmon, balsamic dressing, field greens, Campari tomatoes, focaccia croutons, cucumber, feta, and Kalamata olives.  The salmon was perfectly seasoned and cooked - tender and not overdone.  The dressing was sweet and had the right amount of bite from the balsamic vinegar.  Everything tasted fresh and was cut in small pieces for dainty eating.  I could not put my fork down, lol.

I also enjoyed the flavored waters - not sure what was in mine, haha.  Maybe labels might be helpful?...  ;)

I thought the service seemed accommodating and friendly - I requested my salad without olives and my order was accurate.

The seating area is nice, though; makes you mostly forget that you&#39;re in a grocery store. And the service checks up on you, so even though you order at a counter it feels more like a restaurant in that sense as well. The menu is big, and I have eaten at the location in Westmont with varied success before, so I&#39;d be willing to give it another shot since it&#39;s convenient to me, but know that you&#39;re paying for a &#34;real&#34; meal in a place that is still after all attached to a supermarket."

It is a market with a grill/restaurant attached.   A very very high priced market, actually overpriced in many areas.  But it has some interesting options.  The &#34;dinner for two&#34; appears to be a good deal coming in at around $18.00, including a salad, entree, vegetable/starch and dessert.  everything I put my hands on was expensive to me... unnecessarily so in many instances.  I think the market caters to a different kind of ego that could care less about how much something costs.  That&#39;s okay, just turns me off. Obviously the meat counter is phenomenal, but I can do better at Caputo&#39;s. The cheese and wine selection is large and varied, top of the line.  The Grill is a nice option for lunch.  It has an attractive bar, replete with a lot of craft beers.  They make a good steak sandwich, and the fries are great.  That&#39;s all I had so far along with an excellent craft beer.  They try to take very very good care of you but customer service is sketchy, which is surprising.  It&#39;s a nice experience, and I will go back just out of curiosity, or to pick up dinner for two.  I would definitely do lunch at the Grill again.  Not much more to say, but I will probably do another review at a later date...maybe my opinion will change.  Do they have a Red Box?"

The only downside is, every time I order my food to go it is never quite as good as when I dine in. 
One major thing - please bring back the original kale topping on the burgers. It was fantastic. The most recent burger I had, had a different topping (not as great)."

He was skeptical about this place because of the fact that it&#39;s a chain restaurant. The first night we ate here, it was dead quiet and empty. We were thinking about ordering some of the small app&#39;s for $3 (I think) when a neighboring couple said they were REALLY small. So we skipped it.

I almost always order the buffalo blue chicken salad. The chicken is crispy and awesome tasting. I accidentally got the bigger portion with soup and was sad it didn&#39;t have a roll (like I got with lunch). On a second visit, I got the smaller portion and it came with bread.

The salad is huge and the ingredients are really fresh and tasting. I love the tomato soup with the two cheesy fritter things. It&#39;s just out of this world. I usually can tell you what my partner ordered and what he liked, but I was too busy enjoying my yummy salad.

The service was good, the tables clean, the food was outstanding. My only problem is that Houlihan&#39;s isn&#39;t closer to home. Should I sell my house? Probably not. But it was worth the extra drive and considering it takes 20 minutes to get here, it was strange that we would come back within a week.

So, I would definitely recommend. Skip Applebee&#39;s and the those crappy chains. Houlihan&#39;s is the only chain worth eating at in my opinion!!!!"

Her level of attentiveness and desire to make our visit a personalized experience was remarkable and worthy of commendation. As soon as we sat down, she introduced herself with a smile on her face and, without us asking, brought our two kids plates of carrots and ranch to keep them occupied till our dishes arrived. The remainder of our stay was highly enjoyable and all of the staff seemed to consistently smile and have a very positive demeanor. Even little things like stowing a small step stool under the sink in the men&#39;s bathroom so that my son can reach the sink to wash his hands just made all the difference in our experience. The first I saw the manager on duty, Jen, was when she was cleaning plates off tables to make room for her guests. Not something you normally see a manager doing, but just goes to show how humbly she handles her position of authority.

The first bad experience was in Indy a few years ago. The most recent was at #165 on 4/16/16. First, the Long Islands are aweful. Both my friend and I didn&#39;t like them having tried different flavors. She ordered pot roast, her favorite and disliked it. My srooms were good as usual, but I noticed how small they&#39;ve gotten. 
The next day, I noticed a discrepancy in my accout &amp; realized they doupled charged me. I&#39;ve spoken to Kelly, Sue and Maxine. They said it takes 10 days to repost. REALLY? It only took a few minutes to take my money but over a week to return it? I&#39;m done."

The dinning event started a little slow, waited nearly 15 minutes for wait staff to notice us, and it wasn&#39;t very busy, but once they did notice us the service and food were outstanding. 

We arrived before 7 pm on Monday and were able to take advantage of the drink and appetizer specials. $2 off select draft &amp; bottled beer $3 off Blue Taboo &amp; Raspberry Peach Sangria. 

The waiter went out of his way to make sure we got a sampling of everything we asked for, which included Left Hand Milk Stout, served at the correct temperature and a sampling of the Sriracha Thai peanut sauce from the Sriracha salad. 

Glad we went for a full order of GOAT CHEESE AND ARTICHOKE POPPERS. Amazing! We nearly licked the plate. 

We enjoyed the BUFFALO BLEU SALAD with a 20 oz glass of Allagash White on draft and the STEAK &amp; WEDGE SALAD with RASPBERRY PEACH SANGRIA. 

Don&#39;t be fooled, the Steak &amp; Wedge Salad was more like a petit cut steak dinner. The steak was cooked to order and served on the side, along with asparagus and the lettuce wedge with just enough dressing. We asked for the roasted pecans to be served on the side as well, which we were glad we did. The pecans had a chili flavor to them. 

The Raspberry Peach Sangria was a great compliment to the Steak &#34;Salad&#34;.  It was served as a fully poured wine glass with an added small decanter, enough for a second glass. 

We know we have been to Houlihan&#39;s before, but can&#39;t say why we hadn&#39;t been there in a while. However, we do know we will be visiting again really soon to enjoy a full glass of that Stout, some of poppers, and steak salad."

After about 20 minutes, I realized that I didn&#39;t have my glasses or sunglasses. I spoke with the waiter and he indicated that the table had been cleared, but we could look in lost and found.

I ordered the egg roll appetizer which was pretty good! And the manager even came outside to check on us and he was very nice! He took care of the issue with my friends drink. At the end of our visit, we asked for separate checks and she just split everything down the middle when the checks weren&#39;t even close to the same price. Then we waited for a very long time to get our checks after that. I would recommend this place for their food but that&#39;s all"

She then ended with &#34;next time I see you you&#39;ll be on the fucking ground&#34; - then the management approached me to apologize for this employee.

Last Saturday was a disaster. My friend ordered a red wine but was brought red instead. Not a big deal because mistakes happen. At ordering time, my friend ordered a salad and specifically asked for no bacon. I ordered the stuffed chicken. When the food came, my friend began eating her salad and immediately bit into bacon which she had asked to have excluded from the salad. Ok, we were at this point running late for a movie so she picked out the bacon and kept eating, but after the wine mistake we began to wonder if it was the server or the cook. Well, I was happily digging into my chicken. I got about halfway through it, and I kept waiting for the cream cheesy stuffing to flow out. When it never did, I opened up the chicken, which was basically 2 breasts cooked together, and there was no filling.....at all! What? I still don&#39;t know who was running the show and making the mistakes but since the quality of the chicken was good and we were only getting later for our movie, I didn&#39;t want to deal right then with anyone offering to bring something else or correct the error(s). Just wanted to finish and get going. Doubt I&#39;ll be back. Too bad cuz I love their stuffed mushrooms!"

I have been served by two different younger gentleman who are SO socially awkward, they try to remember orders without writing anything down but then have to come back and clarify order or even better just mess it up completely. One of the past three times, my husband and I were wanting to have a couple of drinks, but we left after just one because we were never asked by the guy if we wanted anything else.

The hostesses were lovely and polite. We were seated quickly. We sat... And sat... And sat watching server after server just walk right past or just standing around talking. Thirty minutes later one of the hostesses walked past and I stopped her and told her no one had even taken our drink order. She said she would find our server. About ten minutes later a server came over and said she didn&#39;t know we were her table. She took our order and she seemed truly apologetic. It took about 20 minutes for our food. My boyfriend&#39;s burger was overcooked and part of my flatbread was touching the server&#39;s hand and then the table. I ate my flatbread and was less than impressed.

The place was full but we had the option to be immediately seated in the bar area, which a lot of times we prefer. From our table, we could see through the glass wall that they have a nice outside eating area with a fire pit. The flame was on in the pit and the area was somewhat busy. It was about 7:30 p.m and  I thought just a little cool out. Overall we thought the place had a nice casual atmosphere.

Through the whole night our server was really busy but yet fairly prompt. We didn&#39;t order anything unique. The French Dip with fries was good and so was their Black Angus Burger with the extras.  They were nice size sandwiches and served hot. With the burger I had the House Bleu  cheese salad. I liked the way they cut/shredded the lettuce, it was a little different.

I thought it was all good at a reasonable price for the area. Would go again."

The lettuce wrap was nice as you get to make it yourself with the shell of an iceburg. The thai wings and buffalo wings were right on. Flavorful and juicy. The sliders were a bit disappointing. Pork was lacking flavor and the roast had an onion ring on top that just couldn&#39;t save the day. They both came with thick cut fries that had a dusting of seasoning. They would have been fine on their own. That just made them a bit salty. The server was attentive and friendly. She made the experience more enjoyable.

I went here with my family and it took about ten mins to get seated when the place was dead on a Saturday night. When we did get seated it was right behind the hostess booth with a bunch of high school age workers chatting and hanging out. About another 15 mins go by and the waiter finally comes with no waters, etc ( mind you there was maybe four other tables there). I swear we almost went through the whole beer list and they were out of everything, even your basic domestics.

 The waiter had to go and check after everyone we tried to order too (half the time we saw him go back and play on his phone or chat for a bit before returning). We finally decided with some wines and ordered food. Again, this place was dead and we were waiting another 30 mins for our food. We asked to talk to the manager and told her that the wait times and beer issue was ridiculous. I can see being a out of a few, but everything you try to order? They should of used a company card and hit binnys or something to cover till they restocked the next day. She apologized with the usual responses as we continued to wait. Another 10-15 mins go by and we asked for her again. 

 We told her that it was almost an hour without any food ( no appetizers served yet either) and we were leaving. Magically the food starts to come out and more apologies.  We said we didn&#39;t care even though she offered to give us food for free. and were leaving on the principle of the whole situation. She gave us some $25 vouchers which I gave to a homeless guy the next day.

 You couldn&#39;t pay me to go back here. When a place is practically empty it shouldn&#39;t take long for anything. Just the waiters attitude was aggravating too.Like it was comical that they didn&#39;t have anything and how long it was taking. After an hour of wasting our time we ended up just cooking at home, which we should of done in the first place......


Unacceptable to run a business like this. I wish I could comment on the food but I never got to taste it. The manager needs to actually manage and not be chatty Kathy with the staff. Also, when almost all your beer is out and you say a service company is coming tomorrow, go buy some and get reimbursed later or something."

The food looks good, but doesn&#39;t really taste half as good as it looks. Granted we came in late on a Saturday night, but we still expected hot, tasty food. When my friend and I checked in on Foursquare or Yelp (can&#39;t remember which) we got a free order of Frites (fries) which I figured oughtta be good. The fries came and they weren&#39;t really hot. They tasted alright. I got a salad, and my friends got meals. One got the chicken alfredo and the other got a sandwich I think. They didn&#39;t seem impressed. Not sure why the food wasn&#39;t all that, the place wasn&#39;t crowded, maybe the kitchen staff was tired because it was the end of the night.... If I decide to come back here, I
l&#39;ll come earlier, and won&#39;t order what my friends ordered."

I wouldn&#39;t go here for an actual dinner or meal in general. Where Houlihan&#39;s really wins out is with a group of friends for Happy Hour drinks. Me and my coworkers frequent this place and always have a great time. The service has always been friendly and efficient. We all order some Long Island Iced Tea pitchers (Georgia Peach is my favorite!) and a bunch of appetizers (Stuffed Mushrooms, yum!). And you really can&#39;t beat the price during happy hour... 1/2 off 1 liter pitchers anyone?! And definitely get a seat on the patio when it&#39;s nice out! 

Definitely recommend Houlihan&#39;s with a group of friends to have a good time in the early evening!"

First off its so DARK! Outside and in! Lightning needs to be changed. Second the food was bland, temperature of food was too cold for my preference. We ordered the chicken avocado egg rolls, and chicken nachos both disappointment. Chicken is dark meat which I&#39;m not a fan of. For the main entrees which came after 45 minutes! Crazy we were about to get up and leave, even crazier the place wasn&#39;t busy! Anyway I got the fish tacos after reading reviews on yelp.. They weren&#39;t as expected. So normal nothing special about them. My kids got: BBQ chicken flat bread very cold, tasteless, bread was stale. Chicken tenders, sirloin 4 oz w/ order of fries and mashed potatoes, chicken Parmesan , and husband got the salmon between sourdough bread. All disappointments, all cold, all bland . Save ur money go somewhere else! You waiting for cold bland tasteless food it&#39;s not worth it! I&#39;d give it only 1/2 a star but guess that&#39;s not an option. I have it one star just cause waiter was nice."

We have been here many times before and enjoyed the ambiance and the food. It is industrial, nice lighting, the bar with high tops and TV&#39;s for the games. This is definitely not a sports bar. The bar  is separate from the dining area. The whole area of t he restaurant is tidy and so are the restrooms. Outside seating is available during the summer months, with it being 26 degrees outdoors who wants to sit out? We have visited in the afternoon and evenings. This place is really busy during the evening hours. Now about the staff, we had Michelle as our server yesterday and what a nice person she was. Michelle made sure that she visited the table often for refills etc. She was able to accommodate a special request for my husband. The food was delish, as always, I had the filet with smashed potatoes, French Onion soup and a garden salad. The birthday boy had the Thai Chicken, pineapple rice and the Tomato Bisque. We also ordered the Buffalo wings, brought those home for later. The salad that I had was enough for a meal in itself. Dessert was the ice cream brownie sundae,  what a brownie, deep dark chocolate, this was okay except for the whipped cream. Enjoyed the meal, the service and the fact that the manager also asked how the meal was. Keep in mind that if you register for your birthday, the meal that you have is free. The bar area started to get busy as we waddled out to our car after a very nice meal. This is not a sports bar but I am sure that on Sunday&#39;s, it must be busy just for the wings and a cold beer at the bar."

1. Ordered a soup for myself and salad for my wife for starter.  Her salad was forgotten and finally given to us after 10 minutes after receiving my soup. 

2. Ordered a refill, when it came the waitress took it upon herself to grab my straw and move it to the new cup. Now I&#39;m not saying she&#39;s dirty, but I don&#39;t know anything about her. Very unsanitary thing to do. 

3. 20 minutes after waiting they came to tell me they ran out of meatloaf. It took them 20 minutes after I ordered to realize they ran out? 

4. I changed my order to a chicken sandwich after they ran out of meatloaf, and they still had the nerve to charge me for the meatloaf! It wasn&#39;t that big of a difference, but you would figure after they ran out of the food and made me change my order they would make sure to charge me correctly. Nope.

But it was just standard. And when you really impress me with the appetizer, you set a high bar for the entree - it just didn&#39;t meet it.

We go there a lot and today&#39;s visit was a pleasure just like our other ones. 

We got seated right away and had our favorite server, Travis.  He is not only a great server but over the years we have discussed history and politics with him, a bonus!

We had the lettuce wraps to start, which are my favorite lettuce wraps.  For entrees, I had the Parmesan crusted Tilapia with berries and asparagus.  It&#39;s a great combination of crunchy, fruity tastes and textures.  It feels healthy so don&#39;t tell me if it&#39;s not!  My husband had the NY Strip, a little risky in a chain in my opinion but he really liked it.  

I love desserts here because they are not the normal huge serving and stickiness, calories and heart attack a la mode of most chains.  They have small tastes and fun choices.  I had the Snicker one which went great with coffee.

A very satisfying meal with superb service and we got home before the rain turned to snow, great Midwestern Saturday afternoon.  Only thing that could improve a meal here is to come in the nice weather when their patio is divine."

Cons - The food just wasn&#39;t anything special at all!!!! Everyone at the table just felt like the food was just ok. My brother had the steak and lobster tail, two of his favorite things on earth and he just said it was fine but he&#39;s had better. I had the buffalo  bleu cheese chicken salad, which i was taken aback because the salad dressing it was tossed in wasn&#39;t bleu cheese but some sweet type of ranch dressing which i did not like, but once they gave me my bleu cheese it was ok. My bf had the chicken alfredo and he likes olive garden&#39;s much better. So none of us were impressed. The atmosphere would be nice for a date night, but i don&#39;t think we will be back."

There is literally something here for everyone. If you can&#39;t find something you like, then you don&#39;t like food. The menu is actually more on the overwhelming side, it&#39;s so hard to narrow down what I want when I go there! 

They have a good mixed drink menu, but not a good beer menu. So this is great for a girls dinner or night out with friends. 

I got a seared tuna salad there...it tasted great, but could&#39;ve used more tuna. It was just meh, after that. I wasn&#39;t really full. 

The margaritas were great, but I don&#39;t think our server understood us EVER. We went for a girlfriend&#39;s birthday, and we had to constantly ask him for more drinks. We figured out that we needed to ask him 3 times before ever getting anywhere. It became the big joke of the night, how we had to ask 3 times before getting anything.

My veggie sandwich was really good and it comes with a choice of sides including Mediterranean orzo, mashed potatoes, fries, vegetable of the day, rice.  It&#39;s kind of nice to have a choice besides french fries.  Everyone&#39;s food seemed to be pretty good - but not amazing.  They have a nice kids menu including apple sauce and ice cream.

Service was standard.  Our waiter looked like he just came from the nearby Lifetime Fitness, goes there on his breaks and before and after work too."

I have been to this Houlihan&#39;s three times and also to one near Kansas City, where the chain began a long time ago. The service is generally good, but what is nice is the contemporary ambiance, the full bar, and the attention to every table from management. The variety on the menu is really commendable, especially if you are vegetarian or in any way health conscious. I LOVE the white bean salad. The one complaint I have is that they got rid of the Skinny Cutini cocktail. That really was great. The new drink list includes something called a Skinny Raspberry Mojito, which I tried but really didn&#39;t like. It kind of tasted artificial. On this last visit, my mother had a Long Island and it was HUGE. She&#39;s a petite woman and she wasn&#39;t even buzzed, so I have to believe that they skimp on their alcohol pours. Regardless, if you&#39;re stuck in strip mall hell in Orland and need a break, Houlihan&#39;s is a very suitable oasis in sea of sameness."

Service is always friendly and fast and I constantly see a manager walking around making sure everything is running smooth and customers are happy. I highly recommend this place for a cheaper (but still nice) date night if you&#39;re on a budget.

I didnt like the chicken fettucine alfredo because the chicken kind of tasted burnt and was a bit on the salty side. Dessert was ok nothing to write home about and the service was ok but the patrons in there are kind of snotty like you didnt belong there since Orland comes off to me as one of those upper crust suburbs where if you&#39;re not rocking a Blackberry or some expensive smartphone with a Coach or Louis Vuitton handbag you dont fit in. I have had better than Houlihans after eating at this place in two different locations. Plus my friend and I waited for a table for nearly 45 minutes and spent that at the bar having a drink before dinner and I wasnt impressed by the nasty looks some of the customers were giving to me as if they never saw a black person in their entire lives.

Just a nicely done four ounce steak with a wedge of iceberg, covered with blue cheese dressing and a slice of quality blue cheese.  A few nice touches like the asparagus and light beets with the wedges of hot, fried polenta make this a meal.  

Drink specials are quite worth it, such as the Long-Island specials Mon-Thurs and 6.95 appetizers, such as the Chicken Nachos-huge.

The staff is friendly and we see plenty of regulars, at the same time, same day we visit there.  So that says something about the &#34;Cheers-everybody knows your name atmosphere.&#34;  The decor is sophisticated for Orland Park and again, the food is pretty darn great!"

I&#39;ve had both the Filet Mignon and their New York Strip . . . both are delicious. My friend always enjoy the mini Filet. The steak is always juice, seasoned and you don&#39;t need any time of steak sauce (don&#39;t insult the steak that way!). 

I&#39;ve been here on several occasions now. I thought it was time to give what have become my regular spot a review. While I do enjoy their food and those wonderful Key Lime Pie Martini&#39;s (DELICIOUS), their service is sometimes lacking. Friendly but it seems like their wait staff are constantly making mistakes. 

For one instance a waitress brought my salad after I already had my entree and didn&#39;t remember I ordered rolls until I told her to cancel that order (what type of mess is that?). She constantly made mistake through out the night. Another waiter refuses to write down your order as if to give off he&#39;s a pro at this. Yea, it impressed me the first time I had him until he started forgetting food and getting the wrong order. Bruh, just write it down!

They actually make the servers carry around a shaker and promote them, which I thought was kind of silly, but hey, that&#39;s chain restaurants.  Also, when the margaritas came, they did some half-ass salted rim on the martini glass.  Come on now, you had one job bartender.  The server was very friendly and nice.

I greatly appreciated the staff from going above &amp; beyond to make my experience a good one. I celebrated a birthday while in town for business, and I joked with both bartenders about being here while on the road.

We got a gift card for Christmas and decided to come last night. When we got here it wasn&#39;t crowded at all. We were seated right away. However, it took us a good 10 minutes to get drinks. The table next to us was getting ready to leave. By the way their table looked, you would think they just got their food. The server closed them out, sat at the bar to count her tips, got her coat and left. We finally got our drinks. 

The food was normal chain food. The onion rings were too crispy and hard to bite into. Nothing spectacular. The table next to us was still dirty and now we are losing room on our table as well with extra cups and dirty plates. 

The manager appeared to like walking around. He was the one to serve our food and kind of dropped our plates down on the table. My husband and I ordered the same thing, but mine didn&#39;t come out with everyone else&#39;s. He walked away and a couple minutes later came back with my food. He looked at the table next to us, grabbed the booster seats, looked like he was going to clean it, and walked away. 

The dinner rush is starting to come in now and everyone that walked by the dirty table looks at it and leaves. We closed out our bill and getting ready to leave. No one still touched the dirty table. 

I shouldn&#39;t let it bother me, but if they&#39;re too lazy and unorganized to clean a table, why should I come back? Most likely won&#39;t be returning."

We started off with the beer pub pretzel which are seriously amazing! And 15 hot wings. Everything was great except for  having to ask for a cup of ranch twice...

Then we ordered the triple bacon burger, I&#39;m not sure why they chose that name because it was literally just a patty with two pieces of bacon. We asked for little pink in our burgers and they came back over cooked and dry.  
Not happy at all.

What really bothered me, was when I had piled all of our dirty plates on top of one another and pushed them to the end of our table for our waitress to pick up, they were just left there. Some guy dropped of our dinner, saw the plates and did nothing. Our waitress came by to check on us and did nothing about the dirty plates and who i believe was a manager came by to check on us look at the pile of dirty plates and walked away. Come on!! 
I was a waitress and that&#39;s one of the most important things to do! Learn to pre buss your tables people!! I don&#39;t want to eat my dinner looking at dirty plates...

Who serves tacos without sauce?  

My friend ordered a beer and they brought the wrong one twice. 

Please note:  if you order the 6 taco plate, there&#39;s a charge of $5.00 for sharing your dish. So If you&#39;re full and want to give some to your friends or family, they will charge you $5.00.

So it&#39;s Mother&#39;s Day and we had reservations for when they opened. It was our first time here and there was only five or six other tables sat. Drinks took a long time to get, ordering food took a long time, and getting extra anything (napkins, condiments, tortillas, etc) took a long time. Nobody made us aware of the day&#39;s specials either. I found out they existed after we ate. The food came quickly and tasted awesome! I would say today&#39;s crew was made up of inefficient servers/bar staff and/or they were short staffed
Again, the food was fantastic. 
So it came time to pay. I was short changed on purpose. My &#34;change&#34; was rounded down. Well my receipt said I was still owed a measly 46 cents. It&#39;s about the principal. The server acknowledged doing it and said she didn&#39;t have 46 cents. so it was rounded down. (So are they just taking everyone&#39;s change each shift? That&#39;s called stealing.) Two additional staff members scoffed at me and fetched 45 cents from the bar resister and made a snide remark while giving me the change. I tipped well at the table before speaking with them at the front desk on the way out and now I wish I hadn&#39;t after this treatment over the stupid 46 cents that was suppose to be mine after paying in the first place. Geez...
I&#39;ve been a bus boy, a host/cashier, a server, and a bartender and never did this to anyone. I was so taken aback that I created a Yelp account to add my 2 cents... the food was really great though."

Given this, I feel Aguamiel has an advantage.  The ambiance is very nice and location is right by the train.  Kenny is the best part about this place.  He is very friendly and gives good recommendations.  The food is average, although I wish I could report better.  The margaritas were actually solid and not watered down.  They also have a decent wine list.  

The salsa they bring is okay.  The green was bland to me but the red was good.  The habenero that is available upon request is the standout.  I&#39;ve gotten the sampler, which allows you to try a bunch of different things.  The sopas were my least favorite, despite the fact that I usually love them.  These were just very bland.  The taquitos, which I usually find boring, were actually better than average.  Flautas were okay and the empanades were actually solid.  We also tried the tacos, which were again good but nothing special.  I will say I really enjoyed their tamales.  That was probably the best thing I&#39;ve had.  The seafood enchilades were good but again, not a standout.  For me, I really need a very good salsa for a Mexican restaurant so I hope that this can be improved upon and I can upgrade!  Overall, good food, good setting and I&#39;ll continue to go back and hope some of the dishes can bring up the flavor a bit."

We were a bit disappointed. We arrived on a Thursday night to find the place mostly empty. We sat outside. We ordered some drinks, they were ok not anything special. The chips and salsa were decent. We had queso fundido for an appetizer. It was pretty good, but the cheese was thicker than I&#39;m used to. We split the taco platter - six different types of tacos. A few of the tacos were covered in onions, more onions than meat. The fish taco was probably the best one. 

The outside area is nice but it&#39;s missing something. Some music would give a more festive feel. Clarendon Hills &#34;downtown&#34; doesn&#39;t really have much life to it. 

Next time we&#39;re looking for fancy Mexican we&#39;ll go back to Cine in Hinsdale."

Like a restaurant at an upscale resort in Mexico. Enjoy margaritas on their nice patio (or bar side when it&#39;s cold out). We love to order the simple stuff most of the time but every now and then splurge on the entrees. Make a good mole, or chiles relleno. I believe they usually have an empanadas special with different fillings each night. And sometimes, you&#39;ll catch live mariachi! Much better than the Mexican spots in Downtown La Grange."

BUT only for the food. The service is pretty atrocious. Even after reading all the Yelp reviews about the horrible service, I really wanted to have an amazing experience with the staff and yet, it fell short - hence the 3 star review. We were 1 of only 3 parties of people in the entire place on a Thursday night and yet they screwed up our drink order, screwed up our food order, couldn&#39;t recommend a tequila (it&#39;s a Mexican restaurant, train your servers!!) and never once filled up our water glasses. 

As for the food it was beyond delicious. The homemade guacamole and salsas were to die for and we could have made a meal out of just those two things alone. My pork shoulder was seasoned so well it didn&#39;t even need the delicious sauce that came with it and while I&#39;m not a fan of beans, I couldn&#39;t stop eating the ones that accompanied my dish.

Our tequila cocktails were unique and tasty and the service was solid, especially being NYE when you may run into some angry servers. A few negative aspects included: Some high prices on menu items, not all, but the guacamole and carne asada entree seemed very overpriced, the desserts were just ok, and the service wasn&#39;t as good as it could have been. Overall, I strongly feel that many of the negative reviews stemmed from diners looking for a TexMex flavor and running into truly authentic favors and being disappointed.

We were taken aback by that because we looked around the restaurant and there were a ton of empty tables.  We told her we did not, and then she walked away to talk to what I think was the manager.  She came back a few seconds later and we were seated.

The food and drink menu were both a good size with a lot of different selections.  Free chips and salsa were placed at our table, and I was extremely disappointed with the salsa.  No one in my group ended up touching it.  I don&#39;t know how to describe the taste except it was just, off.  However, the fresh guacamole was delicious!  We wanted to order another one!  For my meal I ended up with the steak tacos and Mexican rice.  They were fine, nothing that special.  For my drink I had the white sangria and it went down super quick so I of course had to order another one.

Our waitress was pretty slow and we had to ask her a couple times for refills and more chips.  When our food came, 3 out of the 5 of us didn&#39;t have the correct order and she seemed kind of annoyed when we told her this, but did accommodate us, just not with a great attitude.

This is the first time I&#39;ve been in &#34;downtown&#34; Clarendon Hills and the area was pretty cute and the restaurant did have a nice decor (super cute glasses).  I probably wouldn&#39;t come back just because I believe I can find a better Mexican restaurant in the area."

It was busy  and you could barley hear the music.  Started with the chips and guacamole which was good.  We then shared the chicken enchiladas and the garlic shrimp.  Both were ok.

The drink special was not special accept for the 11.50 price. If you have taste buds you wont end up here again.

The restaurant was decently busy but the place was not packed. The service was so slow. Our sodas took way too long to arrive. We asked for a refill of water and the waiter never brought it. It took almost an hour for our food to arrive and by that point, all of the tables around us had left. 

I had the tacos, which everyone else seems to like so much. The meat was fatty and they were very bland. 

The owner or manager asked us about our visit and when we commented that it was fine just really slow, he got really defensive. Maybe it was a rough night because I heard him apologizing to other tables about various things. Whether or not that is the case, I don&#39;t see myself wanting to go back."

Downtown Clarendon Hills sure is catching on! Aguamiel is a super cute place and I&#39;ve had a great experience both times I&#39;ve dined here. 
Pros- 
The 1800 Margarita pitcher is delicious and huge! Definitely enough for four to share! 
The hostesses are very friendly and helpful
Chips are fresh and salsa is interesting and delicious, just wish they gave you more!
The plantains they serve with some of the dishes are fantastic

Cons-
Our waiter seemed to be rushing us along during our last meal here. Never a good feeling. 
Don&#39;t order the specialty coffee, disappointing. Basically just coffee with a clove in it.
The Mole Chicken Enchiladas were a bit dry
No free dessert for a birthday, even though the waiter pushed a dessert choice on us"

Our server was fantastic and offered some great suggestions. All the food, from the chips/salsa to our entrees, were delicious and authentically flavorful.  Their enticing menu made it pretty difficult to narrow down our choices, but we&#39;ll definitely be back to try some more. 

All in all, great food, perfect portion sizes and acceptable (maybe a teensy bit high if I had to find one criticism) prices. I can&#39;t comment on the bar or drink choices, but the bar area did look inviting."

One time when we were there the waiter cleared a pitcher of margaritas that was 1/3 full. On another occasion I called for a reservation and was told over the phone I was all set for the evening. Well, we got there and the reservation was lost. No apology from anyone. They said at least an hour to an hour and a half. We drove to Frontera and had amazing food and service. We have never been back to this restaurant and it is a shame because we enjoyed the food. An apology or at least acting like you give a care about customers goes a long way."

We were a party of 4.  We ordered a bottle of $35 wine.  The server came back and said that they were out of our chosen bottle, recommended another wine and said he would &#39;make a deal&#39; with us.  When the check came, the $35 wine turned into a $75 wine.  We politely protested and he brought out the owner, which is where the problem escalated.

The owner was condescending and rude. She agreed to reduce the cost from $75 to $52, stating that $52 was her cost. (I do not know of a restaurant that only marks wine up by 50%...)  When we explained that $52 was still unreasonable, and that we expected to be charged $35 for whatever the server recommended, she threw the server under the bus and tried to guilt us into paying more by saying &#34;do you think it&#39;s fair for the server to have to pay the difference&#34;.  We suggested that that was between her and her server and had nothing to do with the fact that we were dissatisfied.

This episode occurred in the middle of the restaurant at about 8pm on a Friday night. It was very uncomfortable.  We have never been in a situation where a restaurant owner did not make things right.  Our total check was about $140, so there was ample room for the owner to make an adjustment.

In the end, we had no choice but to pay the additional $17.  Unfortunately, the server ended up on the short end of the stick because his tip was reduced to account for the overcharged wine.  I routinely treat servers well (having one in the family) and tip a minimum of 20%.

The owner was very short sighted.  She just lost 4 first time customers for life.  This is unfortunate because we were very happy with the restaurant until this incident occurred."

Apps:
jalapeno rellenos - spicy, tangy and delicious
Tamales - decent but forgettable.
Guacamole - standard

Entree:
Taco, pick 3 - I chose baja fish taco (which was excellent), carne asada (which on the menu was listed as just having grilled onion but ended up with some sort of sweet sauce - meh) and braised pork belly (which tasted nothing like pork belly)

Margarita - the Cadillac is much more on par with a standard margarita. The House margarita tastes like fruit punch that should be served at a 12 year old&#39;s first pool party.

Bottom line, there is some room for improvement BUT I still give it 4 stars because it is a solid option when out in the western suburbs."

To begin with, the warm, flaky, thin tortilla chips and dual salsas they bring are delicious. For starters, I&#39;ve had the taquitos, the guacamole, and the tortilla soup which is wonderful. 

The tacos are phenomenal. You can get three of each kind or do a &#34;you pick 3&#34; with any of them. I&#39;ve had the steak, carnitas (pork), chicken, and battered shrimp, all of which are delicious. The steak and pork both have a lot of onions on them though, so if you are not a fan of onions make sure you ask for them without. 

I always leave Aguamiel feeling overly stuffed but happy because I loved everything i ate. I highly recommend this restaurant."

The first time I was here with a friend, I thought the food was fantastic, but that the service could be better. A lot better. I thought that since they had just opened, I would wait a while and see if there was improvement.

The second time I visited, I was meeting a friend at the bar. The bar crowd was much older and I suppose I forgot the unspoken rule of &#34;if you&#39;re female and order yourself a drink at the bar you are allowing men to hit on you even if they&#39;re older than your father&#34;. So, that was a life lesson, I guess.

I only ordered a margarita, and it was great. However, after I ordered that first drink, I was largely ignored. Even when I flagged down the bartender for another drink and then a glass of water, I got neither. 

When my friend arrived, we finally were able to order a couple more, but were largely ignored and couldn&#39;t receive service for all of our trying.

The last time I came here was with my dad and everything was again, delicious. However it was, again, difficult to receive service.

I think the food here is too good to have a place with such poor service. I would say go for the food and give it three stars, but honestly, good luck convincing anyone in there to actually serve you any."

High expectations were exceeded by the top notch restaurant Aguamiel, named after the honeywater of the agave plant (that becomes tequila and mezcal) which can be fermented into pulque.  The place is situated in the center of town among gift shops and an ice cream parlor and abundant parking.  Inside the restaurant was toasty in winter and cozy with a fireplace, hand blown glasses on the tables matched by hanging lampshades at the bar, and intriguing art including humanscale sculpture, paintings and the restaurant&#39;s insignia in metal above the fireplace.  Chef Kike&#39;s signature sauces shine at Aguamiel.  From the table salsas served with tortilla chips to the spicy brightly acidic tomato guajillo sauce cutting the rich slow cooked shortribs, the flavors were big and bold.  

The best may have been the smoky serrano chile sauce accompanying the grilled shrimp entree- deeply flavorful, complex, a hot herbacious campfire.  Ceviche was a mouthwateringly acidic starter with albacore tuna cooked in the acid of lime, the heat of chiles accented by the salt of diced olives.  Sopes featured rich shredded beef in buttery corn masa complimented by roasted tomatoes and onions.  The food was so delicious.  To drink we split a half pitcher of 1800 margarita- blanco tequila, fresh squeezed lime, limey and bright with a touch of sweetness from agave nectar, and a half pitcher of the cadillac margarita- smoother and rounder from tequila aged in oak, orange liquor lingering on the palette.  Both were excellent, as was the prompt service.  Chef Kike who worked for so many years at Frontera Grill has a place whose standards of Mexican cuisine and service deserve to be around for many years to come.  Well done and thank you, Chef."

This being said, Aguamiel has become a regular stop, not only for us but several of our friends as well. The food is always fantastic, service is always good so I would still give it a 4-5 stars BUT, my issue is with the bar, particularly the margaritas. Come on guys, give the customer what they order and what they pay for. Substitute the crappy bar mix instead of the &#34;fresh lemon and lime mix&#34;?  Completely fill the glass or worse yet, the pitcher with ice and skimp on the drink itself?  Now, I may not be a professional bartender but for sure, I can hold my own when it comes to margaritas and the one key ingredient in a margarita is tequila. What happened to the tequila? Especially the premium ones you are supposed to get when you order them.  On a recent visit, we had a group of 6 and ordered 3 pitchers of cadillac margaritas (yea, I know) and not one person had even the slightest buzz by the end of the night. (we could sink the Titanic with all the ice though)!  $100 in drinks?   C&#39;mon Aguamiel, you have too good a thing going to skimp on the drinks like this.  
I will return for the food and order a couple of margaritas in the near future, and will gladly revise my review if corrected."

I would say this is a neighborhood place and not a destination restaurant.  With that in mind, the food is decent.   I believe their tortillas are freshly made, a highlight of the meal.

The two salsas (served with tortilla chips) were a little less spicy than I usually like, but the flavors were interesting enough to make them delicious.  The guacamole of the day had habanero in it, and at first I thought there was a mistake as it was undetectable.  As we ate, I began to notice a subtle burn, and by the end of the little bowl, my lips were lightly burning and tingling from the heat, so I think it was perfectly seasoned for a serving for two people.

I had the vegetarian chile, and the flavor was superb.  Nicely spicy and smoky, with plenty of good vegetables and cheese in the ample-sized &#34;open face&#34; chile.  My husband loved his quesadilla special that included shrimp. 

The drink specials looked good as well; we settled on the gold margaritas that were amply-sized.

We will definitely be back!"

Our first few visits were outstanding! As for the last 10 or so it&#39;s been on the steep incline. 

My past visits we always enjoyed the margaritas, now I am pregnant and can only drink iced tea or some sort of boring beverage. I am very thirsty being pregnant so I had 4 of them, mind you they fill the small glasses ALL the way to the top with ice so it&#39;s literally like 5 sips, I was charged $3.00 EACH! I was baffeled, how can you charge for iced tea? it&#39;s water and tea bags?  $12! UGH! Seriously Aguamiel? I would have much rather had a margarita at that price (if I could), Also the waiter brought me a lemonade instead of a iced tea and still had the nerve to charge me for it. 

The waiter was also annoyed that I had him ask if their cheese was pasteurized. He was annoyed by this, this isn&#39;t the first time I had this waiter and he is very rude and was caring more about the large party that was also his table so we had to wait, I literally had to wait to get another iced tea for 20 minutes, then another 15 minutes for the sour cream I asked for 3 times.

Also I asked to wrap my leftovers and give me more flour tortillas as he gave my husband corn on accident, then on the bill we were also charged for those tortillas we didn&#39;t even want, not to mention sour cream 

It&#39;s not like you give us credit for the items we don&#39;t want on our bill so don&#39;t nickel and dime us for everything dinner shouldn&#39;t cost $85 without alcohol for 2 people. 

Disappointed, I don&#39;t know if we will be back. The customer service needs to be stepped up if you want repeating customers, you&#39;d actually have more customers if you properly take care of them.

Also take it easy on the mole sauce there&#39;s no reason to smother the food with it."

The menu is very original....but the food was just good....not great.

After we had been out on the patio for about 20 minutes by ourselves, other parties were seated out with us as well, but the service did not improve.

The staff was very attentive, but not in-your-face. 
The chips and salsa are always my favorite part of eating at a Mexican restaurany- but the salsa here was AMAZING!  I was enjoying the red salsa so much, but when I tried the green salsa I fell in love.
The sangrias were pretty darn good, too.  That was the ONLY thing I was looking for that night, and Aguamiel delivered.
Hubby ordered the pork belly with a mole sauce and mashed sweet potatoes.  on the waiter&#39;s recommendation.  He&#39;d never had pork belly before, but is adventurous so he gave it a try...and liked them alot.
I had the wood- grilled salmon in a peanut mole sauce with garlic spinach and mashed potatoes.
The potatoes didn&#39;t have a ton of taste, but the salmon was very good and the sauce was unique.  They blend alot of different  flavors to create unique dishes...which I find so fun!

This place is LOUD!!  Between the poor acoustics, and the numerous people who had one too many, you had to yell for the person next to you to hear, it was also difficult for the waiter to hear our order.

The food is much more authentic than most of the other Mexican restaurants around here, with unique items.  They have a number of different moles that are very good.

The staff could use some work, the front of the house was weak, and the waiter didn&#39;t get our order exactly right, perhaps he didn&#39;t hear us right with all the noise.  Also they were not quick to correct the wrong order, by the time they did we were already on our way out.

Service was minimal, waiter didn&#39;t come around much.

He suggested the rib special which my husband had and loved! Just the right amount of kick without lighting your mouth on fire! 
I loved the carne asada. It had a few spots that were a bit fattier than I like but most steaks do.  The highlight of my dish was the plantains! They were sauteed in maybe honey? Brown sugar? They had a perfect crisp glaze and then a drizzle of their fresh crema and a sprinkling of queso fresco? Goat cheese? Whatever it was, they were divine!
The music is a bit too loud, and I am not THAT old... the ladies bathroom music was actually loud enough you could not have dished with your friend about her date!
We will be back! And bringing out friends!"

Very fresh and flavorful. Certainly a welcome addition to the area. The prices are really good considering the neighborhood. Then there are the margaritas! By far one of the best I&#39;ve had outside of Mexico. Splurge and get the Cadillac, you won&#39;t be disappointed, great fresh flavor and no sickeningly sweet triple sec. Also take the server recommendations, they were spot on. The fish tacos are amazing for so few ingredients and the carnitas are melt in your mouth. My friend had the stuffed peppers and loved the combination of fillings. The tortillas are handmade, soft and delicious. 

The service is working out the kinks of being new, but no issues that can&#39;t be overcome with time. The servers I have had have all been very informative on the menu. My biggest pet peeve in restaurants is patrons asking the busboy for things out of his scope of work. FYI a busboy can&#39;t order food for you or get you another drink, other than water. There are certainly places that have ultra experienced busboys that will go tell the server what is needed but this guy can just do the basics which is fine, he is still doing his job and doing it well. I had people next to us complaining that he was &#34;incompetent and didn&#39;t even speak English.&#34; Get a clue folks and stop being so ignorant. 

They are very kid friendly which I would normally not be thrilled about, but since having a two year old nephew that has been dining out since 3 months, I appreciate a place we can all go. Btw, he loved the guacamole. I guess he&#39;s not really your typical 2 year old. The management knows how to seat a dining room because everyone cringes when they see the kid in the high chair. They put us up front by the windows and sat other patrons in another section. Granted this was very early on a Sunday night so they had the luxury of an empty restaurant to begin with. They also have plastic cups with straws for water that are given to all kids. 

Try Aguamiel, I&#39;ll be shocked if you are disappointed."
aguamiel-clarendon-hills,Kate W.,gqimocAPnvr9V-YjYhfElg,"Philadelphia, PA",0,1,1,211,12,8bXsziMpXP4WZeNwXgkrYA,4.0,2013-04-07,"Truly about 3.5 stars, but I&#39;m giving rounding up for the star rating since halves are overly fussy.  Food was delicious, service could use a little improvement. 

We arrived at 8pm on a Friday and were told it would be a 30 minute wait for 3, but we waited only half of that before being seated.  The bar was packed so we had to awkwardly plaster ourselves against the half-wall that separates the bar from the busy pathway to the kitchen.  Be smarter than we were and make a reservation!

I liked the look of the dining area, but it&#39;s so LOUD.  Not a good place for a first date or catching up with an old friend. 

The service - our waiter was perfectly nice and got our orders right, so yay for that.  However, food runners tried to deliver other tables&#39; food and drinks to us three times throughout the night, and our own waiter couldn&#39;t remember who ordered what when our entrees came.  Little details, but that&#39;s the stuff that would set this place apart from the competition, if they could get the details right.

I had a regular margarita - fine, not awesome, I&#39;m sure if I had upgraded my tequila it would have been better.  

The food is where this place shines.  I started with the ensalada fresca - jicama, cucumbers, and pineapple, with a little kick of chile powder.  Not only does it look amazing (and had diners at other tables asking me what I ordered) but it tastes fantastic - refreshing and fun.  My mom started with a special appetizer - tamales - which were very good (though were a little heavy on the masa/light on the meat for us), and my dad had the sopa classica, which was outstanding. 

For entrees, I had the camarones ala diabla (shrimp in some spicy sauce, with rice and zucchini).  They weren&#39;t kidding around with the spice here - very good, but not for the faint of heart - or rather, stomach.  If you typically order things medium or mild, this would probably not be a good choice for you, but if you&#39;re like me and love some heat, have at it.

My mom had the quesadilla with chicken and said it was wonderful (and she knows her quesadillas - that&#39;s her standard order when we go Mexican), and my dad went with a taco trio - al pastor (too sweet for him, I tried it &amp; thought it was good), carne asada (great), and pollo (his favorite).

I&#39;m surprised at how affordable everything was - parents&#39; entrees were under $10, mine was almost $20 (darn shrimp), apps were all under $10.  Here&#39;s to hoping they keep their prices reasonable, get their waitstaff and food runners a little more focused, and continue to create excellent meals."

They had pineapple and pork empanadas as appetizers. They were wonderful. My wife loves enchiladas. Hers were great. I always order Carne Asada. It was the best I ever had.

A very tiny downside is the noise level, it&#39;s a little louder than ideal. Overall Aguamiel is amazing. We will definitely be back."

I ordered the chicken enchiladas and the chicken was over cooked and the beans and rice were the worst just terrible. The enchilada itself had a sauce that was very different and did not suit my taste. They brought out the chips and salsa and the red salsa was empty when he brought it to the table and lead me to think of different scenarios as to where it came from. I told the waiter and he did not understand my comment as to why the container was mostly empty when he put it on the table.

We tried making a reservation for 7pm but we&#39;re told they only had an 8. Ok fine. 8 it is. We arrived early to get a drink and wait until we were seated yet when we arrived the place was half empty and we were seated immediately. Ok weird. Our server was good. Very polite and attentive without being obnoxious. I ordered 3 tacos and ended up not caring for one of them. Everyone else at the table seemed to really enjoy their food and the guac/salsa we had as well. Overall I thought this place was pretty good and would give it 3.5 stars.

Fortunately, we made a reservation. Since we just ate at CiNe, we were looking forward to dining at the neighborhood&#39;s other new Mexican restaurant. Like CiNe, this is is not the normal suburban burrito and fajita experience. The menu looked appetizing as there were numerous selections that looked muy bueno. Most dishes were less than $15. Started off with chips and salsas, green and red.  Chips were overly salty and they masked the taste of the salsas. The red salsa could have been a bit spicier. For dinner, I had the chicken enchiladas with a dark mole sauce.  They were good, but were not hot enough. And the rice and refried sides were luke warm as well. My wife ordered the chicken tostada which she also enjoyed.  Children&#39;s menu available for $6. Service could have been better.  Maybe they just need more help. Besides one dish not being prepared as we requested, a second basket of chips never arrived and the waiter never asked whether we wanted dessert, just dropped off the check.  Plus, one dish was also never cleared from the table. Management was very friendly and checked on us a few times.  Beware, the dining room is inordinately loud. Or maybe I just need a hearing aid, which my wife would agree with!

Compared to CiNe, the portions at Aguamiel are more authentic, larger and at a lower cost.  Quality is similar.  The atmosphere at CiNe is more to my liking and is not as loud. Plus, CiNe&#39;s chips and salsa were superior--I love my chips!

My disclaimer:  I&#39;m a California native so I take my Mexican seriously. We are deprived here in the Western burbs so I have high hopes for Aquamiel. Will be back in a few months to see if the kinks have been worked out."

Very inventive food, there is nothing ordinary going on here. 
This place brings me back to the days when I found Fronterra Grill on Clark Street. 
Regional Mexican cuisine is embraced here just as regional Italian cuisine is in a good Italian restaurant.

My dad had a really great margarita that was like a combination of a pina colada and a marg. If i didn&#39;t consume a 47 ounce margarita somewhere else the night before, I would have drank 5 of these :) One of the most delicious flavored margaritas I&#39;ve ever had!

We started with guacamole which was outstanding. Good texture, nice flavor without being too spicy. You can tell it was super fresh. I loved how the chips were thick enough to hold up the guacamole! My dad ordered the tortilla soup and really enjoyed it.

We each had the 3 taco platter. I chose 1 al pastor, and 2 carne asada. The Al Pastor sounded really interesting, with adobo flavoring and topped with bacon and pineapple. The smokiness of the adobo was almost a little too much for me, but the bright pineapple flavor cut through and the bacon was a nice addition. I was super excited for my steak tacos, which were supposed to be marinated skirt steak with grilled onions. Imagine my disappointment when they arrived with chopped, raw onion, and loaded with some cilantro type of sauce. They were good, but I really don&#39;t like raw onions and a lot of cilantro, so they weren&#39;t as enjoyable as I was expecting. My sister had the same as me and was disappointed by the same aspects. I only ate one taco and two bites of another.

My dad decided to get dessert - a mexican bread pudding and some mexican coffee. You&#39;d think the coffee would come pretty quickly, yes? No. almost 10 minutes pass, and someone drops off our check - without the coffee or dessert on there. Why? I don&#39;t know. It took a few minutes to flag someone down to tell them what was going on, then he took the check away and said he&#39;d be back - we weren&#39;t really quite sure if we were still going to get the items my dad had ordered or not, but then the coffee arrived. I tried a sip and it was outstanding! So many bold, delicious flavors, I would honestly come back here just to have a cup of coffee. About 10 minutes later, the bread pudding shows up. Our server explains that he dropped the first one and the chef had to make another, which is why it took so long. Well, the bread pudding was delicious too, and was served with what I think might have been pistachio ice cream. Creamy, crispy, and warm, this was a lovely dessert.

It took a while to get an updated check, then to have someone come get the credit card, then to have them come back with it. I don&#39;t think that guacamole, tacos, and bread pudding warranted an hour and 45 minute long dining experience, but maybe I&#39;m just antsy. 

I would probably try this place out again, but make sure that my tacos come with what they&#39;re supposed to. And hopefully there is a better waitstaff around too, the  service was pretty spotty."

The staff is very poorly motivated to help and the food was extremely just okay. To the people who don&#39;t know what real fine Mexican cuisine should taste like it may be pleasing but really the only thing worth remembering was the decor and the chips and salsa.

Loved the place.  Delicious echoes of Frontera Grill from the Rick Bayless acolyte, Chef Kike.  Terrific salsas, moles, guacamole, tacos, margaritas, and several terrific platos fuertes (entrees).  Loved, loved, loved the place.  We made sure we were there at least a couple times a month.

Unfortunately, our last couple of visits have been somewhat disappointing.  Portions have shrunk considerably, and several of the dishes seem to have lost their kick.  Has Chef Kike turned the kitchen over to a much less capable sous chef?  I&#39;m not sure what, exactly, is going on, but if this trend continues, I&#39;m afraid we will be writing this place off -- which would be really sad given how much I loved this place."

The tacos are so good that I haven&#39;t ventured too much farther on the menu during my four visits.  The bar has an excellent selection of tequila and an adequate selection of most other beverages.  The gold margarita is excellent.  I have been waiting to write this review until after trying Cine.  Last night was my first experience there, and now I must wonder what kind of herbs those who prefer Cine to this place are smoking.  Cine is more trendy and highly designed inside, but both spaces are attractive.  Cine has a slightly better bar selection.  Service seems about equal at both places, though both are relatively new and I&#39;ve seen staff missteps at both places.  At the end of everything, the determining factor for a restaurant must be the food, and in my opinion Aguamiel has *much* better food at a slightly cheaper price compared to Cine.  Aquamiel boasts a wide selection of amazing tacos, all of which can be mixed and matched.  The carnitas and pork belly are to die for, and the fried fish taco is the best of that genre I have ever tried.  I will be back.  Drive on in to downtown Clarendon Hills for the tacos here.  You will not be disappointed."

The menu looked interesting and a step beyond the normal suburban Mexican restaurant.  Six of us arrived early but were seated within five minutes of our reservation time.  The interior is trendy -  I thought I could be in a  small restaurant in River North. The place was packed. 

To start off, the obligatory chips seemed to be the same ones we get at Costco. First batch was served cold, the second batch was warm. The two salsas were good.  

I ordered the Al Pastor Tacos. I really enjoyed them. The taste of pineapple contrasted well with the meat, but the tacos were supposed to have &#34;crisp bacon&#34; but I could not taste nor see any bacon. This was one of the reasons I ordered these tacos.  The beans and rice were barely lukewarm. My wife had a mix of tacos. Two were good, the fish taco was rather poor - think &#34;fish sticks&#34;. Other meals were actually pretty good.

The service was inexcusable. We go out for fine dining at least once a month and this the worse service we have had in many years. The waiter was was pleasant enough and seemed knowledgeable about the menu , but was very absent minded and non-attentive. We ordered guacamole. It never came. I ordered  a drink, that did not come until I was well in to my meal, and the was after prompting the waiter. Many of the drinks were filled to the rim - which on one hand is nice. But my wife&#39;s drink spilled some and she cleaned up with the napkin - the waiter did not offer any assistance. We asked for a napkin. It never came - we grabbed one from another table. We went through the water and asked for another carafe. It never arrived.  Also, at a place like this I do not expect the meals to be auctioned when they are brought to the tables. So the last one is a bit petty but this there seemed to be  a trend.

Prices were very reasonable. The main dishes ran from $12 to upper 20&#39;s as I recall.
.
This place is also really loud - think Pappadeux and multiple times 2.  How about some fabrics to deafen the sound? 

I really wanted to like this restaurant. I suspect if I came back and had an experienced server this would be a 4-5 star review. Please train your staff or replace them and work out the kinks to insure the menu items arrive as advertized."

We had 5:30 reservations, and were seated right away which was good, but things went downhill from there. 

Service was terrible. My friend had to ask for a straw 4 times and even then she didn&#39;t get it. It took forever for our order to get to us, we watched many other tables who came in after us finish their meals before we got ours.Our server never came back to check on us after our food was delivered. 

The food was ok. We all agreed we&#39;ve had much better. I split the taco platter of six tacos with my husband, and our friends got three tacos and the enchiladas Mexicanos. The pork tacos were the best, everything else was pretty bland. The rice and beans had no flavor. It wasn&#39;t bad, it was just bland and nothing special. The pitcher of margaritas was very good. The guacamole was again bland.

It was good, but no more than that.  Wife liked the chicken in mole sauce a lot; I had the chiles rellenos, and they were were all right. The queso molida app was likewise, as far as I was concerned, just all right, too.  Didn&#39;t have dessert.  The margaritas were kind of watery, but then I&#34;m a straight-up vodka martini guy. The prices seem quite reasonable for the serving size and ambience.

My go-to Mexican in the CH area is still Taco Grill on Ogden a couple blocks west of Cass. Just a small lunch joint (though open for early dinner, too.)  A lot less fancy than Aguamiel, which is a very attractive  dining room with a very well-stocked and ornate bar, but I think TG food is much more flavorful. They have a good selection of routine Mex food, and the Tacos are especially good. Prices are a bit less than  Aguamiel.

I like TG&#39;s self-serve salsa bar, a selection of sixteen or so different, always-fresh salsas plus chiles, lime slices, and the like. They offer a pretty good bottled-beer selection along with soft drinks."

By the way I had to ask for more of the green sauce for the nachos because both my wife and I could not stop eating them. I plan to go back and take friends with me. The prices were reasonable and the service was great.

But they were a bit inconsistent.  But I&#39;m going back.

Have a ceviche starter - definite low point of meal.  But good ambiance, guacamole was solid and three out of the four meals very well liked,  Taco plate is great though mix of 6 tacos is ALOT of food.  Pork loin dish I had had a great sauce though wish it was a fattier cut of meat.  Skirt steak was enjoyed and fourth had a seafood dish.  Desserts pretty blah - bread pudding almost always a win for me - blah.

Good prices, family friendly and not snotty atmosphere and enough outstanding dishes to make me think it might get to 4 ... but right now too much variance."

After moving from chicago to downers grove, I was still searching for a really good, authentic mexican restaurant.  I found it in Aguamiel.  
The fresh ingredients to the fun cocktails all make for a delicious meal.  I keep going back for the tacos but need to branch out and try some other dishes - everything sounds so good.  
The restaurant can get crowded and now that word is out I feel reservations are a must.  But it&#39;s got a good atmosphere and love that it&#39;s not a cookie cutter chain restaurant.  Prices seem like a great value especially considering the nicer neighborhood.  I hope this place is here to stay as it&#39;s my new favorite!"

Opening weekend was crazy so I will reserve judgment on service as the first two times we went it was a little spotty.   The Baja and Carnitas tacos were amazing. The guacamole was top-notch.  I didn&#39;t notice it, but a friend said they were charged for a second basket of chips.  On the whole it&#39;s a pretty promising place but we&#39;ll have to see how it plays out.

Three of us plus a toddler dined (early) and enjoyed all of our food choices. The guacamole was fresh and delicious and I enjoy the green salsa though just not a fan of chipotle salsas myself. We shared a 1/2 pitcher of house margarita which was fantastic. I didn&#39;t think it was too sweet or sour. We also had one of the top shelf margaritas last time which was the best, but knocked us on our a$$! :) 

I had the chicken mole based on the reviews-  it was delicious. It wasn&#39;t what I was expecting at all, but so good I nearly licked the plate clean. The other two in the party shared the 6 taco platter. This was a good deal b/c it came with rice and a side of guac, which I think the plate of 3 does not. Much more authentic food than many other places around, but refreshing if your husband wants to drag you to the Taco Grill and Salsa Bar again.

We had great service, very attentive and nice. So why not 5 stars? I love my chips and salsa and while good, it is not great.  I like a place that I can hang at the bar  for a margarita and abundant salsa. I can barely fit my chip in the little bowl. I will be back to try some of the other items and other margaritas. Looks like they have a good space for larger groups too."

The first visit was just after they opened so service was spotty and the place was packed.  We&#39;ve been back 2-3 times since and have tried many items from the menu.
Guacamole is very fresh tasting and good.   Portion is on the small side. They bring chips and two very small dishes of salsa, one red, one green.  Chips are good if on the salty side.
My favorite dishes would be the chicken tinga and the chicken enchiladas in a mole sauce.
My husband had the carne asada, and it was very good as well.
The margaritas were a little too sweet for my taste, I like them more tart.  Sangria is pretty good.  Service has been much improved on subsequent visits."

The service was good and the food arrived in a timely manner. I&#39;m a vegetarian so I was pleased to have a lot of options. They were accommodating with my restrictions. I order the tacos with mushrooms, onions, cheese, and peppers. Tasty but not greasy.

My husband, on the other hand, will eat anything. I think he got a pork or chicken mole which he liked.

My only negatives were:

The guacamole was bland. It needed more kick but that&#39;s a personal preference which is a simple fix.

Also, we weren&#39;t happy with our desserts. We ordered the churros which were served in a cold chocolate sauce and a bread pudding that was served cold.

I also agree with other posts about the chips and salsa. That was an unexpected surprise.

All in all we were happy with the experience!"

It was very crowded and the layout of the bar made it difficult to find a place to wait where we weren&#39;t in the way of the waitstaff in the back or standing in the open doorway.  The bar staff (of 1) seemed completely overwhelmed.  Luckily another set of hands hopped in to help out, but while that helped the speed of service, we didn&#39;t get the margarit&#39;s we actually ordered, but instead got the standard house version. They were ok, but we are not fans of the sour-mix margarita, so we did not get off to a good start.

We did get seated in the time estimated, which was a pleasant surprise. And the chips and salsa arrived promptly.  The chips were clearly homemade and very fresh and the salsa was good as well.

They clearly were open a little too soon, as the menus were paper copies and we informed that the bar could not actually make our 1st 2 drink choices.  We then went back to ordering a fairly standard margarita, though with premium tequila and lime juice v sourmix and these were very good.

The highlight of the night was however, the food.  We were excited that the exec chef had experience at Frontera/Topolobampo and that was evident from the food.  I had the pork tenderloin which was tender and flavorful.  My husband went with the chicken mole and was more than pleased.  It was nice to be in a Mexican restaurant that didn&#39;t have a standard Pepe&#39;s/Uncle Julio&#39;s-style menu.

We did order another round of margaritas, which never arrived (luckily we didn&#39;t get charged for them either, though we did see the drinks they couldn&#39;t make appear on the bill).  We noticed and experienced a rather long wait time to take our order, come back to ask about dessert, deliver our bill, and refill our water glasses (which never happened).

So, there are obviously some servie issues which need to be worked out, but the quality of the food and reasonableness of the prices should definitely make you want to give it a try.  We will be returning in a few weeks to see if they&#39;ve gotten the kinks worked out.  The food is well worth it.  This is a great addition to the dining choices in the Western Suburbs."

We were looking for somewhere different to stop and have a margarita. We decide to drive to Clarendon Hills. We new we went to a place there before, but couldn&#39;t remember the name. We saw Aguamiel and stopped in for some beverages. We always sit at the bar when we go out on saturdays for a little social time. The two bartenders were good and made us some good ole drinks.

The bartender was friendly and took our drink order.  After that he ignored us and finally someone else came through for us to ask if we could have a menu.  Finally we ordered.  Then had to flag someone down for another glass of wine.  A very nice waitress came behind the bar to help this bartender who seems to be too busy to watch anyone at the bar.  I ordered the steak tacos, and they were pretty good, although the meat didn&#39;t taste fresh, the sauce the steak marinated in was good.  It took 2 separate people to finally get our bill, and we were charged for something that wasn&#39;t even ours.  The food is decent, but the service is horrible. I felt like we weren&#39;t welcome and it was just a big cluster**** going on with the service.  They were all friendly, but they need to be more organized. I will not go back there."

On our first visit my only negative comment was that they lacked a desert heavy in chocolate as I&#39;m a chocolate nut.

Chips and salsa arrived quickly (salsa portions are tiny), and we split the half order of margaritas which was fine for 3 adults as we each had a glass, and I had a second.  My wife ordered guacamole and chips which is NOT worth the price, as the portion size is small even by kids standards.  Apparently a LOT of people have complained about this to the manager, but nothing has changed.  They should listen to their customers or we can easily find other options, especially in this area.  I ordered 3 tacos, all different and all very good, though the shrimp was a bit spicy.  My wife did the same.  Kids ordered the tortilla classica soup and loved it, then had tacos and chicken strips as entrees.  Chicken strips are not what you think, but actually much better than the breaded chicken pieces you normally see on a kids menu....this is a pounded thin chicken breast that is very lightly breaded and cooked.  My son ate all of it.  We did not get dessert, and bill was very reasonable.  The place was very crowded but Tara at the hostess station was very friendly and sat us right away.  They handled the crowd well and the noise level was fine, even though it was full.  Nothing to complain about at all...in fact, we will be there again tonight."

I had the chicken waffles.  Really well made.  The other dishes looked terrific.

Chicken &#39;n Biscuits Breakfast... Yea, what it sounds like! All that with eggs and hashbrowns smothered in sausage gravy! I judge a breakfast place on their gravy and this gravy was pretty good! Throw in some fried chicken and fresh made biscuits and we have a winner! I had leftovers for the next day and I was very happy about that!

The boy ordered the Meat Eaters Omelet and Toast with Homemade Strawberry Jam. I&#39;ve never seen him order an omelet! He really liked it and the jam was great! He also had leftovers and was happy he did since he had to work on Sunday!

It looks impossibly small and completely unassuming from the outside, but inside its kinda spacious and delightful. We came here last weekend at about 11AM and had a choice of tables - sooo much better than the inevitable wait at most breakfast joints around here! Our server was kind and helpful, explaining the specials and highlighting favorite items. I tried a cup of the cream of chicken &amp; rice soup and it was very tasty. For my meal, I had the biscuits and gravy with fried chicken and it was awesome. Fluffy homemade biscuits, rich sausage gravy and a perfectly cooked, crispy fried boneless chicken breast with two eggs over easy. Decadent, huge portion, not too salty/greasy, just perfect. My mom got an omelette with a morning glory square on the side which was an interesting menu item, kind of carrot-cake-y but with a banana bread texture. Really good! My husband got the chicken and waffles which was actually amazing, the malted waffle batter might have been my favorite thing at the whole table and I got swatted away more than once sneaking extra bites of that awesome waffle. Our server was kind, prompt, knowledgeable of the menu and seemed to really take pride in the items on the menu, pointing out to us that the coffee cakes are baked in house and even gesturing over to the cook who makes them. I thought this was a nice touch. 

Overall, an excellent breakfast spot. I&#39;m bummed I waited so long to try it, but now that I know about it, I can&#39;t wait till our next visit."

Today I ventured in around lunch time so opted for a burger. Went with the California Burger complete with avocado, mixed greens and provolone cheese, to which I added garlic aioli and crispy bacon. The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare and came with some house made fries that were crunchy and tasty. Throw in an iced tea and that&#39;s a pretty damn good lunch.

But the best part was Penny and her hospitality. She knew my name and came and sat down again to visit. And then she let me taste test a new item she&#39;s working on that includes waffles, house made chorizo, an egg and chipotle creme and salsa verde. It was pretty tasty and definitely unique. Can&#39;t wait to see it on the menu. 

Also nice to see a little crowd on hand at lunch time. Penny visited with each customer and the other folks who taste tested also gave it thumbs up.

We enjoyed the establishment before this one and its recent change of owners so decided to come back and give this new restaurant a shot. 

Upon walking in, we immediately notice this restaurant is busy. There were only a handful of open tables, but we were quickly greeted and seated. The restaurant is very clean and the staff is extremely friendly. The specials are listed on a large board at the back of the restaurant and I quickly noticed many of their dishes have a Southwestern flair, containing ingredients such as chorizo or accompanied by salsa. They have traditional American breakfast dishes as well, but I chose to go outside of the box and order the Carintas Waffles:Topped with slow cooked, perfectly seasoned pulled pork, chipotle crema, salsa verde, cojita cheese, and fresh cilantro. There is no need for syrup. At first glance, this sounds pretty weird, but I really, really enjoyed this dish! It comes with a heaping ton of carnitas and the chipotle crema and salsa verde is the perfect accompaniment to the fresh, warm waffle. I would recommend trying this creative dish if you&#39;re looking for something different!

I&#39;d also like to add kudos to this place for trying oh-so-hard for business: we noticed the staff was highly attentive, including whom I assume to be the owner, refilling coffee and working tables. They&#39;ve also done a great job with their website for being a smaller restaurant, with appetizing pictures of their menu selections and detailed descriptions so my boyfriend and I knew exactly what we had to look forward to before even arriving!

During the busy workweek, I don&#39;t always have the option (read never have the option) to sit down and enjoy breakfast.  On the weekends, I strive to have one sit-down breakfast on the weekend.

This is the place Naperville has been missing.  It&#39;s a small hidden treasure of food nirvana.  Everything else in the area feels the same, but this is a locally owned and operated breakfast destination.  

I&#39;ve been here a handful of times.  The first few were scouting expeditions, prior to introducing my wife to the goodness that awaits behind the hidden, yet blatantly obvious entrance.  Once you walk in the door, you&#39;re greeted by a member of the friendly staff.  It might be the host.  If the host is busy seating someone else, it might be a server.  Seemingly there&#39;s no &#34;this is your job, this is my job&#34;.  No waiting for &#34;your server&#34; to refill your coffee.  Every person I&#39;ve dealt with has been very friendly and helpful.  

Let&#39;s talk food...

It&#39;s all good.  I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve eaten everything - I&#39;ve only been there 5-6 times.  Most everything is homemade (it might all be homemade).  The corned beef hash...if you remotely like corned beef hash - get it.  Biscuits 

The portions are decently sized.  Not crazy-assed Texas sized portions that seem to be the trend.  The eggs are actually cooked to your preference.  I&#39;ve been a few places where &#34;over-medium&#34; = &#34;way less than over-easy&#34;.  

Can we talk homemade jams?  Or is it jelly?  What&#39;s the difference again?  What ever the smashed-fruit goodness that you put on toast for breakfast dessert is called...that in itself if almost worth the trip.  

At the end of your meal and the check comes. If you want to bring it to the cashier - go for it.  If you want the server to do it - also an option.  Love. It."

It&#39;s a cute place directly in the corner of the strip mall. You might not notice it driving by and that would be a shame. 

The walls have art by local artists and more than a few caught our eye. Our server was named Anjie and she was very nice and attentive. 

We both got a make-your-own-skillet and were very impressed. The ingredients were all very fresh and both of our scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly. We both opted to pay the extra dollar for coffee cakes instead of the toast and they blew us away! Do NOT miss out on the coffee cake, it&#39;s homemade. I got the Bavarian cream and he got the blueberry, both were phenomenal. My mom makes good coffee cake and this beat it hands down. I also got a mimosa which was very good. You gotta love a nice mimosa on your day off!

We had Tracey as our waitress and she was very sweet and attentive. I ordered the biscuit and gravy breakfast that included hash browns and got cheese/onion added + a side of egg whites. The hash browns were perfectly cooked just the way I liked them (without me even asking), the eggs whites were beautifully scrambled with a light butter taste and were sooo fluffy, and the biscuits and gravy were out of this world. I could eat this breakfast 3 more times this week! The portions are perfect and the price is spot on. 

This place offers a vast array of different items on their menu. For those pumpkin lovers, they have everything pumpkin for you. Their flavors seem to change daily (or maybe weekly, not sure) for things like coffee cake, which is great. My friend had coffee cake and it looks great and was a HUGE piece! I was amazed at the items on the menu in such a small place such as wilted spinach with all kinds of fancy toppings. Seriously, this place is such a treasure in Naperville. I will be back again and again!!"

It is a small but comfortable restaurant.  The food here is your typical breakfast fare.  I was expecting something a bit more unique for some reason. I ordered their pancakes which I normally do at a new breakfast restaurant. Also a 1/2 order of biscuits and gravy just to do a little taste test and a side of sausage patties.

When it came time to serve our meal the staff seemed a bit unorganized as they handed out my order to three different people and forgot parts of others.  As I gathered my meal with a chuckle I tended to my pancakes which were large and fluffy looking but unfortunately they were rather dry and crumbly once I dug into them.  The breakfast sausage patties were thin and unremarkable. The biscuits and gravy was fairly weak on flavor and thin on sausage. 

My wife&#39;s waffle came with a huge glob of butter in the middle. Most restaurants usually only serve their waffles with powdered sugar.  My wife hates the taste of butter so this put a damper on her meal immediately.

Other guest in our party were also &#34;meh&#34; about the restaurant so I guess it is unlikely that we will be coming back in the near future.  Too bad because it seems like a nice cozy local place."

We had the Bavarian creme coffee cake to start, and it was fantastic. We went savory other than that -- I tried the popeye breakfast sandwich, and boy, it&#39;s unique and tasty. Sourdough with ham, blueberry jam (what?!), and a fried egg. Very unique, very flavorful. My husband had a scramble and I had a bite -- onions were actually completely cooked and nicely diced (it&#39;s a pet peeve of mine in diners when they onions are still hard and unevenly chopped). Portions were just right, and we left feeling happy. We were there on a quiet weekday morning, and the service was great -- not a typical breakfast rush experience, but we&#39;d definitely go back."

I miss Ken and Wilma. They ran a great business, where they served a good plate of food at a frugal price, and always served it with a smile.

That said, the food was still good, and the prices were not outrageous, but they weren&#39;t a super bargain anymore. They expanded the menu to allow for more unique meals, but they hipstered-up the prices for a plate of eggs to match the new menu.

Overall, everyone felt that the portion sizes were large and satisfying.

The pros are the friendly service, large selection on the menu, Taste of the food, and cleanliness.

The only con I see is that the coffee is watered down and the taste is decent but not great."

I ate a skillet hash browns with veggies. I loved that the potatoes were not greasy. The homemade peach-mango jam on sourdough was scrumptious, as was the homemade salsa verde.

We were not pleased with our meal and won&#39;t be back.  We went about 9:30ish in the morning, it was not busy, a few open tables and more open booths.

There seemed to be confusion when we walked in the door, another couple was behind us and they were trying seat us together. We got seated with just our party and a waitress asked about drinks.  We only had one coffee cup on the table so my husband got his cup of coffee right away, I asked for decaf and a milk for my LO. Another waitress came up and again asked us what we wanted to drink, had to ask for drinks again.  I was looking at the menu to see if there was a kids menu, the guy who seated us didn&#39;t give us one, one of the waitresses brought us the kids menu with crayons.  

Food - considering the place was not super busy, it took longer than expected to get our food.  I had ordered the two eggs (scrambled) with meat (bacon).  My meal was supposed to come with either hash browns or fruit, the waitress didn&#39;t ask which one I wanted when I ordered, the default is usually hash browns, but neither were on my plate when it was served, we had to ask for it, I got a nice side of fresh fruit.  I asked for pancakes, instead of toast.  I thought it was weird there was a $1 up charge for basic pancakes.  We go out to breakfast and have tried multiple breakfast joints in Naperville and never seen an up charge for basic pancakes.  Overall, my meal was just ok.  My scrambled eggs were a little over done and the bacon was just ok.

I ordered the one egg kids meal for my LO, it came with an egg, meat and starch (toast or pancake).  The meal was sufficient for my LO but when we got the bill, it showed an up charge of $2 for bacon.  The bill was corrected but I am glad I checked everything.

Hubby ordered a make your own skillet and upgraded his toast with the blueberry coffee cake.  He liked the coffee cake but didn&#39;t care for the skillet, and it wasn&#39;t the ingredients he added.

Overall, food was just mediocre.  Before I was done with my food, I stated I didn&#39;t want to come back and my husband said he had already decided we wouldn&#39;t be back and he is the man who eats anything and almost never complains."

I&#39;ve lived near this location for years and have seen a few restaurants come and go. If my first experience is any indication, I think Lucky Penny is going to be my favorite cafe that&#39;s been in this spot.

The owner, Penny, served my breakfast, kept my coffee fresh, and chatted with me. Her passion for her work was apparent from the start; I felt very welcome, and I could tell she was excited and proud of her food. It&#39;s always so cool to see someone passionate about what they do. I still miss my dearly departed Wicked Good Café, and this was the first time since then that I&#39;ve found a place that&#39;s as warm and friendly as they were.

I had eggs benedict, hash browns, and coffee. The serving size is generous - I need to keep that in mind and order light when I go in so early in the morning. When I get restaurant hash browns, I honestly don&#39;t expect much, but these were carefully seasoned; the salt-and-pepper blend made them special. The eggs benedict had strips of ham instead those fried discs that many restaurants use, so they were cooked evenly and were tastier. I think there was some paprika in the sauce; it was yummy.

The coffee was a standout. I take two creams and half a sugar in my coffee, so when Penny refilled it partway through my first cup, I thought I would need to add more of both. Instead, it was so smooth and mild that I put away 2 or 2 1/2 cups without having to add any more flavoring. Very impressed with the coffee.

It always feels so satisfying to support a local business, and I&#39;m so pleased to have a high-quality one right near my house. Highly recommended."
